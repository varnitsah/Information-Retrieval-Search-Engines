here have a strange story of a white girl who in dingaans day was supposed to hold the spirit of some legendary goddess of theirs who is also white this girl they say was very beautiful and brave and had great power in the land before the battle of the blood river which they fought with the emigrant boers her title was lady of the zulus or more shortly zoola which means heaven  she seems to have been the daughter of a wandering pioneer missionary but the king i mean dingaan murdered her parents of whom he was jealous after which she went mad and cursed the nation and it is to this curse that they still attribute the death of dingaan and their defeats and other misfortunes of that time  ultimately it appears in order to be rid of this girl and her evil eye they sold her to the doctors of a dwarf people who lived far away in a forest and worshipped trees since when nothing more has been heard of her but according to them the curse stopped behind  if i can find out anything more of this curious story i will let you know but i doubt if i shall be able to do so although fifteen years or so have passed since dingaans death in 1840 the kaffirs are very shy of talking about this poor lady and i think only did so to me because i am neither an official nor a missionary but one whom they look upon as a friend because i have doctored so many of them when i asked the indunas about her at first they pretended total ignorance but on my pressing the question one of them said that all that tale was unlucky and went beyond with mopo now mopo as i think i wrote to you was the man who stabbed king chaka dingaans brother he is supposed to have been mixed up in the death of dingaan also and to be dead himself at any rate he vanished away after panda came to the throne    chapter i  the girl   the afternoon was intensely terribly hot looked at from the high ground where they were encamped above the river the sea a mile or two to her rightfor this was the coast of pondolandto little rachel dove staring at it with sad eyes seemed an illimitable sheet of stagnant oil yet there was no sun for a grey haze hung like a veil beneath the arch of the sky so dense and thick that its rays were cut off from the earth which lay below silent and stifled tom the kaffir driver had told her that a storm was coming a father of storms which would end the great drought therefore he had gone to a kloof in the mountains where the oxen were in charge of the other two native boyssince on this upland there was no pasturage to drive them back to the waggon for as he explained to her in such tempests cattle are apt to take fright and rush away for miles and without cattle their plight would be even worse than it was at present  at least this was what tom said but rachel who had been brought up among natives and understood their mind knew that his real reason was that he wished to be out of the way when the baby was buried kaffirs do not like death unless it comes by the assegai in war and tom a good creature had been fond of that baby during its short little life well it was buried now he had finished digging its restingplace in the hard soil before he went rachel poor child for she was but fifteen had borne it to its last bed and her father had unpacked his surplice from a box put it on and read the burial service over the grave afterwards together they had filled in that dry red earth and rolled stones on to it and as there were few flowers at this season of the year placed a shrivelled branch or two of mimosa upon the stonesthe best offering they had to make  rachel and her father were the sole mourners at this funeral if we may omit two rock rabbits that sat upon a shelf of stone in a neighbouring cliff and an old baboon which peered at these strange proceedings from its crest and finally pushed down a boulder before it departed barking indignantly her mother could not come because she was ill with grief and fever in a little tent by the waggon when it was all over they returned to her and there had been a painful scene  mrs dove was lying on a bed made of the cartel or frame strung with strips of green hide which had been removed from the waggon a pretty palefaced woman with a profusion of fair hair rachel always remembered that scene the hot tent with its flaps turned up to let in whatever air there might be her mother in a blue dressinggown dingy with wear and travel from which one of the ribbon bows hung by a thread her face turned to the canvas and weeping silently the gaunt form of her father with his fanatical saintlike face pale beneath its tan his high forehead over which fell one grizzled lock his thin set lips and faraway grey eyes taking off his surplice and folding it up with quick movements of his nervous hands and herself a scared wondering child watching them both and longing to slip away to indulge her grief in solitude it seemed an age before that surplice was folded pushed into a linen bag which in their old home used to hold dirty clothes and finally stowed away in a deal box with a broken hinge at length it was done and her father straightened himself with a sigh and said in a voice that tried to be cheerful  do not weep janey remember this is all for the best the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord  her mother sat up looking at him reproachfully with her blue eyes and answered in her soft scotch accent  you said that to me before john when the other one went down at grahamstown and i am tired of hearing it dont ask me to bless the lord when he takes my babes no nor any mother he who could spare them if he chose why should the lord give me fever so that i could not nurse it and make a snake bite the cow so that it died if the lords ways are such then those of the savages are more merciful  janey janey do not blaspheme her father had exclaimed you should rejoice that the child is in heaven  then do you rejoice and leave me to grieve from today i only make one prayer that i may never have another john she added with a sudden outburst it is your fault you know well i told you how it would be i told you that if you would come this mad journey the babe would die aye and i tell youhere her voice sank to a kind of wailing whisperbefore the tale is ended others will die too all of us except rachel there who was born to live her life well for my part the sooner the better for i wish to go to sleep with my children  this is evil broke in her husband evil and rebellious  then evil and rebellious let it be john but why am i evil if i have the second sight like my mother before me oh she warned me what must come if i married you and i would not listen now i warn you and you will not listen well so be it we must dree our own weird everyone of us a short one all save rachel who was born to live her life man i tell you that the spirit drives you on to convert the heathen just for one thing that the heathen may make a martyr of you  so let them her father answered proudly i seek no better end  aye she moaned sinking back upon the cartel so let them but my babe my poor babe why should my babe die because too much religion has made you mad to win a martyrs crown martyrs should not marry and have children john  then unable to bear any more of it rachel had fled from the tent and sat herself down at a distance to watch the oily sea  it has been said that rachel was only fifteen but in southern africa girls grow quickly to womanhood also her experiences had been of a nature to ripen her intelligence thus she was quite able to form a judgment of her parents their virtues and their weaknesses rachel was english born but had no recollection of england since she came to south africa when she was four years old it was shortly after her birth that this missionaryfury seized upon her father as a result of some meetings which he had attended in london he was then a clergyman with a good living in a quiet hertfordshire parish and possessed of some private means but nothing would suit him short of abandoning all his prospects and sailing for south africa in obedience to his call rachel knew all this because her mother had often told her adding that she and her people who were of a good scotch family had struggled against this south african scheme even to the verge of open quarrel  at length indeed it came to a choice between submission and separation mr dove had declared that not even for her sake would he be guilty of sin against the spirit which had chosen him to bring light to those who sat in darknessthat is the kaffirs and especially to that section of them who were in bondage to the boers for at this time an agitation was in progress in england which led ultimately to the freeing of the slaves of the cape dutch and afterwards to the exodus of the latter into the wilderness and most of those wars with which our generation is familiar so as she was devoted to her husband who apart from his religious enthusiasm or rather possession was in truth a very lovable man she gave way and came before they sailed however the general gloom was darkened by mrs dove announcing that something in her heart told her that neither of them would ever see home again as they were doomed to die at the hands of savages  now whatever the reason or explanation scientifically impossible as the fact might be it remained a fact that janey dove like her mother and several of her scottish ancestors was foresighted or at least so her kith and kin believed therefore when she communicated to them her conviction as though it were a piece of everyday intelligence they never doubted its accuracy for a minute but only redoubled their efforts to prevent her from going to africa even her husband did not doubt it but remarked irritably that it seemed a pity she could not sometimes be foresighted as to agreeable future events since for his part he was quite willing to wait for disagreeable ones until they happened not that he quailed personally from the prospect of martyrdom this he could contemplate with complacency and even enthusiasm but zealot though he was he did shrink from the thought that his beautiful and delicate wife might be called upon to share the glory of that crown indeed as his own purpose was unalterable he now himself suggested that he should go forth to seek it alone  then it was that his wife showed an unsuspected strength of character she said that she had married him for better or for worse against the wishes of her family that she loved and respected him and that she would rather be murdered by kaffirs in due season than endure a separation which might be lifelong so in the end the pair of them with their little daughter rachel departed in a sailing ship and their friends and relations knew them no more  their subsequent history up to the date of the opening of this story may be told in very few words as a missionary the reverend john dove was not a success the boers in the eastern part of the cape colony where he laboured did not appreciate his efforts to christianise their slaves the slaves did not appreciate them either inasmuch as saint though he might be he quite lacked the sympathetic insight which would enable him to understand that a native with thousands of generations of savagery behind him is a different being from a highly educated christian and one who should be judged by another law their sins amongst which he included all their most cherished inherited customs appalled him as he continually proclaimed from the housetops moreover when occasionally he did snatch a brand from the burning and the said brand subsequently proved that it was still alight or worse still replaced its original failings by those of the white man such as drink theft and lying whereof before it had been innocent he would openly condemn it to eternal punishment further he was too insubordinate or as he called it too honest to submit to the authority of his local superiors in the church and therefore would only work for his own hand finally he caused his cup to overflow as he described it or in plain english made the country too hot to hold him by becoming involved in a bitter quarrel with the boers of these on the whole worthy folk he formed the worst and in the main a very unjust opinion which he sent to england to be reprinted in church papers or to the home government to be published in bluebooks in due course these documents reached south africa again where they were translated into dutch and became incidentally one of the causes of the great trek  the boers were furious and threatened to shoot him as a slanderer the english authorities were also furious and requested him to cease from controversy or to leave the country at last stubborn as he might be circumstances proved too much for him and as his conscience would not allow him to be silent mr dove chose the latter alternative the only question was whither he should go as he was well off having inherited a moderate fortune in addition to what he had before he left england his poor wife pleaded with him to return home pointing out that there he would be able to lay his case before the british public this course had attractions for him but after a nights reflection and prayer he rejected it as a specious temptation sent by satan  what he argued should he return to live in luxury in england not only unmartyred but a palpable failure his mission quite unfulfilled his wife might go if she liked and take their surviving children rachel and the newborn baby boy with her they had buried two other little girls but he would stick to his post and his duty he had seen some englishmen who had visited the country called natal where white people were beginning to settle in that land it seemed there were no slavedriving boers and the natives according to all accounts much needed the guidance of the gospel especially a certain king of the people called zulus who was named chaka or dingaan he was not sure which this ferocious person he particularly desired to encounter having little doubt that in the absence of the contaminating boer he would be able to induce him to see the error of his ways and change the national customs especially those of fighting and worse still of polygamy  his unhappy wife listened and wept for now the martyrs crown which she had always foreseen seemed uncomfortably near indeed as it were it glowed blood red within reach of her hand moreover in her heart she did not believe that kaffirs could be converted at any rate at present they were fighting men as her highland forefathers had been and her scottish blood could understand the weakness while as for this polygamy she had long ago secretly concluded that the practice was one which suited them very well as it had suited david and solomon and even abraham but for all this although she was sure in her uncanny fashion that her babys death would come of her staying she refused to leave her husband as she had refused eleven years before  doubtless affection was at the bottom of it for janey dove was a very faithful woman also there were other thingsher fatalism and stronger still her weariness she believed that they were doomed well let the doom fall she had no fear of the beyond at the best it might be happy and at the worst deep everlasting rest and peace and she felt as though she needed thousands of years of rest and peace moreover she was sure no harm would come to rachel the very apple of her eye that she was marked to live and to find happiness even in this wild land so it came about that she refused her husbands offer to allow her to return home where she had no longer any ties and for perhaps the twentieth time prepared herself to journey she knew not whither  rachel seated there in the sunless sweltering heat reflected on these things of course she did not know all the story but most of it had come under her observation in one way or other and being shrewd by nature she could guess the rest for she who was companionless had much time for reflection and for guessing she sympathised with her father in his ideas understanding vaguely that there was something large and noble about them but in the main body and mind she was her mothers child already she showed her mothers dreamy beauty to which were added her fathers straight features and clear grey eyes together with a promise of his height but of his character she had little that is outside of a courage and fixity of purpose which marked them both   for the rest she was far or foreseeing like her mother apprehending the end of things by some strange instinct also very faithful in character  rachel was unhappy she did not mind the hardship and the heat for she was accustomed to both and her health was so perfect that it would have needed much worse things to affect her but she loved the baby that was gone and wondered whether she would ever see it again on the whole she thought so for here that intuition of hers came in but at the best she was sure that there would be long to wait she loved her mother also and grieved more for her than for herself especially now when she was so ill moreover she knew and shared her mind this journey she felt was foolishness her father was a man led by a star as the natives say and would follow it over the edge of the world and be no nearer he was not fit to have charge of her mother  of herself she did not think so much still at grahamstown for a year or so there had been other children for companions dutch most of them it is true and all rough in mind and manner yet they were white and human while she played with them she could forget she knew so much more than they did that for instance she could read the gospels in greekwhich her father had taught her ever since she was a little childwhile they could scarcely spell them out in the taal or boer dialect and that they had never heard even of william the conqueror she did not care particularly about greek and william the conqueror but she did care for friends and now they were all gone from her gone like the baby as far off as william the conqueror and she she was alone in the wilderness with a father who talked and thought of heaven all day long and a mother who lived in memories and walked in the shadow of doom and oh she was unhappy  her grey eyes filled with tears so that she could no longer see that everlasting ocean which she did not regret as it wearied her she wiped them with the back of her hand that was burnt quite brown by the sun and turning impatiently fell to watching two of those strange insects known as the praying mantis or often in south africa as hottentot gods which after a series of genuflections were now fighting desperately among the dead stalks of grass at her feet men could not be more savage she reflected for really their ferocity was hideous then a great tear fell upon the head of one of them and astonished by this phenomenon or thinking perhaps that it had begun to rain it ran away and hid itself while its adversary sat up and looked about it triumphantly taking to itself all the credit of conquest   she heard a step behind her and having again furtively wiped her eyes with her hand the only handkerchief available looked round to see her father stalking towards her  why are you crying rachel he asked in an irritable voice it is wrong to cry because your little brother has been taken to glory  jesus cried over lazarus and he wasnt even his brother she answered in a reflective voice then by way of defending herself added inconsequently i was watching two hottentot gods fight  as mr dove could think of no reply to her very final scriptural example he attacked her on the latter point  a cruel amusement he said especially as i have heard that boys yes and men too pit these poor insects against each other and make bets upon them  nature is cruel not i father nature is always cruel and she glanced towards the little grave under the rock then while for the second time her father hesitated not knowing what to answer she added quickly is mother better now  no he said worse i think very hysterical and quite unable to see things in the true light  she rose and faced him for she was a courageous child then asked  father why dont you take her back she isnt fit to go on it is wrong to drag her into this wilderness  at this question he grew very angry and began to scold and to talk of the wickedness of abandoning his call  but mother has not got a call she broke in  then as for the third time he could find no answer he declared vehemently that they were both in league against him instruments used by the evil one to tempt him from his duty by working on his natural fears and affections and so forth  the child watched him with her clear grey eyes saying nothing further till at last he grew calm and paused  we are all much upset he went on rubbing his high forehead with his thin hand i suppose it is the heat and thisthistrial of our faith what did i come to speak to you about oh i remember your mother will eat nothing and keeps asking for fruit do you know where there is any fruit  it doesnt grow here father then her face brightened and she added yes it does though the day that we outspanned in this camp mother and i went down to the river and walked to that kind of island beyond the dry donga to get some flowers that grow on the wet ground i saw lots of cape gooseberries there all quite ripe  then go and get some dear you will have plenty of time before dark  she started up as though to obey then checked herself and said  mother told me that i was not to go to the river alone because we saw the spoor of lions and crocodiles in the mud  god will guard you from the lions and the crocodiles if there are any he answered doggedly for was not this an opportunity to show his faith you are not afraid are you  no father i am afraid of nothing perhaps because i dont care what happens i will get the basket and go at once  in another minute she was walking quickly towards the river a lonely little figure in that great place mr dove watched her uneasily till she was hidden in the haze for his reason told him that this was a foolish journey  the lord will send his angels to protect her he muttered to himself oh if only i could have more faith all these troubles come upon me from a lack of faith and through that i am continually tempted i think i will run after her and go too no there is janey calling me i cannot leave her alone the lord will protect her but i need not mention to janey that she has gone unless she asks me outright she will be quite safe the storm will not break tonight    chapter ii  the boy   the river towards which rachel headed one of the mouths of the umtavuna was much further off than it looked it was indeed not less than a mile and a half away she had said that she feared nothing and it was true for extraordinary courage was one of this childs characteristics she could scarcely ever remember having felt afraidfor herself except sometimes of her father when he grew angryor was it mad that he grewand raged at her threatening her with punishment in another world in reward for her childish sins even then the sensation did not last long because she could not believe in that punishment which he so vividly imagined so it came about that now she had no fear when there was so much cause  for this place was lonely not a living creature could be seen moreover a dreadful hush brooded on the face of earth and in the sky above only far away over the mountains the lightning flickered incessantly as though a monster in the skies were licking their precipices and pinnacles with a thousand tongues of fire nothing stirred not even an insect every creature that drew breath had hidden itself away until the coming terror was overpast  the atmosphere was full of electricity struggling to be free although she knew not what it was rachel felt it in her blood and brain in some strange way it affected her mind opening windows there through which the eyes of her soul looked out she became aware of some new influence drawing near to her life of a sudden her budding womanhood burst into flower in her breast shone on by an unseen sun she was no more a child her being quickened and acknowledged the kinship of all things that are that brooding flamethreaded skyshe was a part of it the earth she trod it was a part of her the mind that caused the stars to roll and her to live dwelt in her bosom and like a babe she nestled within the arm of its almighty will  now as in a dream rachel descended the steep rockstrewn banks of the dry branch of the riverbed wending her way between the boulders and noting that rotten weeds and peeled brushwood rested against the stems of the mimosa thorns which grewthere tokens which told her that here in times of flood the water flowed well there was little enough of it now only a pool or two to form a mirror for the lightning in front of her lay the island where grew the cape gooseberries or winter cherries as they are sometimes called which she came to seek it was a low piece of ground a quarter of a mile long perhaps but in the centre of it were some great rocks and growing among the rocks trees one of them higher than the rest beyond it ran the true river even now at the end of the dry season three or four hundred yards in breadth though so shallow that it could be forded by an oxdrawn waggon  it was raining on the mountains yonder raining in torrents poured from those inky clouds as it had done off and on for the past twentyfour hours and above their firelaced bosom floated gloriouscoloured masses of misty vapour enflamed in a thousand hues by the arrows of the sinking sun above her however there was no sun nothing but the curtain of cloud which grew gradually from grey to black and minute by minute sank nearer to the earth  walking through the dry riverbed rachel reached the island which was the last and highest of a line of similar islands that separated from each other by narrow breadths of water lay like a chain between the dry donga and the river here she began to gather her gooseberries picking the silvery octagonal pods from the green stems on which they grew at first she opened these pods removing from each the yellow subacid berry thinking that thus her basket would hold more but presently abandoned that plan as it took too much time also although the plants were plentiful enough in that low and curious light it was not easy to see them among the dense growth of reedy vegetation  while she was thus engaged she became aware of a low moaning noise and a stirring of the air about her which caused the leaves and grasses to quiver without bending then followed an icecold wind that grew in strength until it blew keen and hard ruffling the surface of the marshy pools still rachel went on with her task for her basket was not more than half full till presently the heavens above her began to mutter and to groan and drops of rain as large as shillings fell upon her back and hands now she understood that it was time for her to be going and started to walk across the islandfor at the moment she was near its farther sideto reach the deep rocky riverbed or donga  before ever she came there with awful suddenness and inconceivable fury the tempest burst a hurricane of wind tore down the valley to the sea and for a few minutes the darkness became so dense that she could scarcely stumble forward then there was light a dreadful light all the heavens seemed to take fire yes and the earth too it was as though its last dread catastrophe had fallen on the world  buffeted breathless rachel at length reached the edge of the deep riverbed that may have been fifty yards in width and was about to step into it when she became aware of two things the first was a seething roaring noise so loud that it seemed to still even the bellowing of the thunder and the next now seen now lost as the lightning pulsed and darkened the figure of a youth a white youth who had dismounted from a horse that remained near to but above him and stood a gun in his hand upon a rock at the farther side of the donga  he had seen her also and was shouting to her of this she was sure for although the sound of his voice was lost in the tumult she could perceive his gesticulations when the lightning flared and even the movement of his lips   wondering vaguely what a white boy could be doing in such a place and very glad at the prospect of his company rachel began to advance towards him in short rushes whenever the lightning showed her where to set her feet she had made two of these rushes when from the violence and character of his movements at length she understood that he was trying to prevent her from coming further and paused confused  another instant and she knew why some hundreds of yards above her the river bed took a turn and suddenly round this turn crested with foam appeared a wall of water in which trees and the carcases of animals were whirled along like straws the flood had come down from the mountains and was advancing on her more swiftly than a horse could gallop rachel ran forward a little way then understanding that she had no time to cross stood bewildered for the fearful tumult of the elements and the dreadful roaring of that advancing wall of foam overwhelmed her senses the lightnings went out for a moment then began to play again with tenfold frequency and force they struck upon the nearing torrent they struck in the dry bed before it and leapt upwards from the earth as though titans and gods were hurling spears at one another  in the lurid sheen of them she saw the lad leap from his rock and rush towards her a flash fell and split a boulder not thirty paces from him causing him to stagger but he recovered himself and ran on now he was quite close but the water was closer still it was coming in tiers or ledges a thin sheet of foam in front then other layers laid upon it each of them a few yards behind its fellow on the top ledge in its very crest was a bull buffalo dead but held head on and down as though it were charging and rachel thought vaguely that from the direction in which it came in a few moments its horns would strike her another second and an arm was about her waistshe noted how white it was where the sleeve was rolled up dead white in the lightningand she was being dragged towards the shore that she had left the first film of water struck her and nearly washed her from her feet but she was strong and active and the touch of that arm seemed to have given her back her wit so she regained them and splashed forward now the next tier took them both above the knees but for a moment shallowed so that they did not fall the high bank was scarce five yards away and the wall of waters perhaps a score  together for life or death said an english voice in her ear and the shout of it only reached her in a whisper   the boy and the girl leapt forward like bucks they reached the bank and struggled up it the hungry waters sprang at them like a living thing grasping their feet and legs as though with hands a stick as it whirled by them struck the lad upon the shoulder and where it struck the clothes were rent away and red blood appeared almost he fell but this time it was rachel who supported him then one more struggle and they rolled exhausted on the ground just clear of the lip of the racing flood  thus through tempest threatened by the waters of death from which he snatched her and companioned by heavens lightnings did richard darrien come into the life of rachel dove  presently having recovered their breath they sat up and looked at each other by lightning light which was all there was he was a handsome lad of about seventeen though short for his years sturdy in build very fairskinned and curiously enough with a singular resemblance to rachel except that his hair was a few shades darker than hers they had the same clear grey eyes and the same wellcut features indeed seen together most people would have thought them brother and sister and remarked upon their family likeness rachel spoke the first  who are you she shouted into his ear in one of the intervals of darkness and why did you come here  my name is richard darrien he answered at the top of his voice and i dont know why i came i suppose something sent me to save you  yes she replied with conviction something sent you if you had not come i should be dead shouldnt i in glory as my father says  i dont know about glory or what it is he remarked after thinking this saying over but you would have been rolling out to sea in the flood water like that buffalo with not a whole bone in you which isnt my idea of glory  thats because your father isnt a missionary said rachel  no he is an officer naval officer or at least he was now he trades and hunts we are coming down from natal but whats your name  rachel dove  well rachel dovethats very pretty rachel dove as you would be if you were cleanerit is going to rain presently is there any place where we can shelter here  i am as clean as you are she answered indignantly the river muddied me thats all you can go and shelter i will stop and let the rain wash me   and die of the cold or be struck by lightning of course i knew you werent dirty really is there any place  she nodded mollified  i think i know one come and she stretched out her hand  he took it and thus hand in hand they made their way to the highest point of the island where the trees grew for here the rocks piled up together made a kind of cave in which rachel and her mother had sat for a little while when they visited the place as they groped their way towards it the lightning blazed out and they saw a great jagged flash strike the tallest tree and shatter it causing some wild beast that had sheltered there to rush past them snorting  that doesnt look very safe said richard halting but come on it isnt likely to hit the same spot twice  hadnt you better leave your gun she suggested for all this while that weapon had been slung to his back and she knew that lightning has an affinity for iron  certainly not he answered it is a new one which my father gave me and i wont be parted from it  then they went on and reached the little cave just as the rain broke over them in earnest as it chanced the place was dry being so situated that all water ran away from it they crouched in it shivering trying to cover themselves with dead sticks and brushwood that had lodged here in the wet season when the whole island was under water  it would be nice enough if only we had a fire said rachel her teeth chattering as she spoke  the lad richard thought a while then he opened a leather case that hung on his rifle sling and took from it a powder flask and flint and steel and some tinder pouring a little powder on the damp tinder he struck the flint until at length a spark caught and fired the powder the tinder caught also though reluctantly and while rachel blew on it he felt round for dead leaves and little sticks some of which were coaxed into flame  after this things were easy since fuel lay about in abundance so that soon they had a splendid fire burning in the mouth of the cave whence the smoke escaped now they were able to warm and dry themselves and as the heat entered into their chilled bodies their spirits rose indeed the contrast between this snug hiding place and blazing fire of drift wood and the roaring tempest without conduced to cheerfulness in young people who had just narrowly escaped from drowning  i am so hungry said rachel presently  again richard began to search and this time produced from the pocket of his coat a long and thick strip of sundried meat  can you eat biltong he asked  of course she answered eagerly  then you must cut it up he said giving her the meat and his knife my arm hurts me i cant  oh she exclaimed how selfish i am i forgot about that stick striking you let me see the place  he took off his coat and knelt down while she stood over him and examined his wound by the light of the fire to find that the left upper arm was bruised torn and bleeding as it will be remembered that rachel had no handkerchief she asked richard for his which she soaked in a pool of rain water just outside the cave then having washed the hurt thoroughly she bandaged his arm with the handkerchief and bade him put on his coat again saying confidently that he would be well in a few days  you are clever he remarked with admiration who taught you to bandage wounds  my father always doctors the kaffirs and i help him rachel answered as having stretched out her hands for the pouring rain to wash them she took the biltong and began to cut it in thin slices  these she made him eat before she touched any herself for she saw that the loss of blood had weakened him indeed her own meal was a light one since half the strip of meat must she declared be put aside in case they should not be able to get off the island then he saw why she had made him eat first and was very angry with himself and her but she only laughed at him and answered that she had learned from the kaffirs that men must be fed before women as they were more important in the world  you mean more selfish he answered contemplating this wise little maid and her tiny portion of biltong which she swallowed very slowly perhaps to pretend that her appetite was already satisfied with its superabundance then he fell to imploring her to take the rest saying that he would be able to shoot some game in the morning but she only shook her little head and set her lips obstinately  are you a hunter she asked to change the subject  yes he answered with pride that is almost at any rate i have shot eland and an elephant but no lions yet i was following the spoor of a lion just now but it got up between the rocks and bolted away before i could shoot i think that it must have been after you  perhaps said rachel there are some about here i have heard them roaring at night  then he went on while i was staring at you running across this island i heard the sound of the water and saw it rushing down the donga and saw too that you must be drowned andyou know the rest  yes i know the rest she said looking at him with shining eyes you risked your life to save mine and therefore she added with quiet conviction it belongs to you  he stared at her and remarked simply  i wish it did this morning i wished to kill a lion with my new roer and he pointed to the heavy gun at his side above everything else but tonight i wish that your life belonged to meabove anything else  their eyes met and child though she was rachel saw something in those of richard that caused her to turn her head  where are you going she asked quickly  back to my fathers farm in graafreinet to sell the ivory there are three others besides my father two boers and one englishman  and i am going to natal where you come from she answered so i suppose that after tonight we shall never see each other again although my life does belong to youthat is if we escape  just then the tempest which had lulled a little came on again in fury accompanied by a hurricane of wind and deluge of rain through which the lightning blazed incessantly the thunderclaps too were so loud and constant that the sound of them which shook the earth made it impossible for richard and rachel to hear each other speak so they were silent perforce only richard rose and looked out of the cave then turned and beckoned to his companion she came to him and watched till suddenly a blinding sheet of flame lit up the whole landscape then she saw what he was looking at for now nearly all the island except that high part of it on which they stood was under water hidden by a brown seething torrent that tore past them to the sea  if it rises much more we shall be drowned he shouted in her ear  she nodded then cried back  let us say our prayers and get ready for it seemed to rachel that the glory of which her father spoke so often was nearer to them than ever  then she drew him back into the cave and motioned to him to kneel beside her which he did bashfully enough and for a while the two children for they were little more remained thus with clasped hands and moving lips presently the thunder lessened a little so that once more they could hear each other speak   what did you pray about he asked when they had risen from their knees  i prayed that you might escape and that my mother might not grieve for me too much she answered simply and you  i oh the samethat you might escape i did not pray for my mother as she is dead and i forgot about father  look look exclaimed rachel pointing to the mouth of the cave  he stared out at the darkness and there through the thin flames of the fire saw two great yellow shapes which appeared to be walking up and down and glaring into the cave  lions he gasped snatching at his gun  dont shoot she cried you might make them angry perhaps they only want to take refuge like ourselves the fire will keep them away  he nodded then remembering that the charge and priming of his flintlock roer must be damp hurriedly set to work by the help of rachel to draw it with the screw on the end of his ramrod and this done to reload with some powder that he had already placed to dry on a flat stone near the fire this operation took five minutes or more when at length it was finished and the lock reprimed with the dry powder the two of them richard holding the roer crept to the mouth of the cave and looked out again  the great storm was passing now and the rain grew thinner but from time to time the lightning no longer forked or chainshaped flared in wide sheets by its ghastly illumination they saw a strange sight there on the island top the two lions marched backwards and forwards as though they were in a cage making a kind of whimpering noise as they went and staring round them uneasily moreover these were not alone for gathered there were various other animals driven down by the flood from the islands above them reed and water bucks and a great eland among these the lions walked without making the slightest effort to attack them nor did the antelopes which stood sniffing and staring at the torrent take any notice of the lions or attempt to escape  you are right said richard they are all frightened and will not harm us unless the water rises more and they rush into the cave come make up the fire  they did so and sat down on its further side watching till as nothing happened their dread of the lions passed away and they began to talk again telling to each other the stories of their lives   richard darrien it seemed had been in africa about five years his father having emigrated there on the death of his mother as he had nothing but the halfpay of a retired naval captain and he hoped to better his fortunes in a new land he had been granted a farm in the graafreinet district but like many other of the early settlers met with misfortunes now to make money he had taken to elephanthunting and with his partners was just returning from a very successful expedition in the coast lands of natal at that time an almost unexplored territory his father had allowed richard to accompany the party but when they got back added the boy with sorrow he was to be sent for two or three years to the college at capetown since until then his father had not been able to afford him the luxury of an education afterwards he wished him to adopt a profession but on this point herichardhad made up his mind although at present he said little about that he would be a hunter and nothing else until he grew too old to hunt when he intended to take to farming  his story done rachel told him hers to which he listened eagerly  is your father mad he asked when she had finished  no she answered how dare you suggest it he is only very good much better than anybody else  well it seems to come to much the same thing doesnt it said richard for otherwise he would not have sent you to gather gooseberries here with such a storm coming on  then why did your father send you to hunt lions with such a storm coming on she asked  he didnt send me i came of myself i said that i wanted to shoot a buck and finding the spoor of a lion i followed it the waggons must be a long way ahead now for when i left them i returned to that kloof where i had seen the buck i dont know how i shall overtake them again and certainly nobody will ever think of looking for me here as after this rain they cant spoor the horse  supposing you dont find iti mean your horsetomorrow what shall you do asked rachel we havent got any to lend you  walk and try to catch them up he replied  and if you cant catch them up  come back to you as the wild kaffirs ahead would kill me if i went on alone  oh but what would your father think  he would think there was one boy the less thats all and be sorry for a while people often vanish in africa where there are so many lions and savages  rachel reflected a while then finding the subject difficult suggested that he should find out what their own particular lions were doing so richard went to look and reported that the storm had ceased and that by the moonlight he could see no lions or any other animals so he thought that they must have gone away somewhere the flood waters also appeared to be running down comforted by this intelligence rachel piled on the fire nearly all the wood that remained to them then they sat down again side by side and tried to continue their conversation by degrees it drooped however and the end of it was that presently this pair were fast asleep in each others arms    chapter iii  goodbye   rachel was the first to wake which she did feeling cold for the fire had burnt almost out she rose and walked from the cave the dawn was breaking quietly for now no wind stirred and no rain fell so dense was the mist which rose from the river and sodden land however that she could not see two yards in front of her and fearing lest she should stumble on the lions or some other animals she did not dare to wander far from the mouth of the cave near to it was a large hollowsurfaced rock filled now with water like a bath from this she drank then washed and tidied herself as well as she could without the aid of soap comb or towels which done she returned to the cave  as richard was still sleeping very quietly she laid a little more wood on the embers to keep him warm then sat down by his side and watched him for now the grey light of the dawning crept into their place of refuge to her this slumbering lad looked beautiful and as she studied him her childish heart was filled with a strange new tenderness such as she had never felt before somehow he had grown dear to her and rachel knew that she would never forget him while she lived then following this wave of affection came a sharp and sudden pain for she remembered that presently they must part and never see each other any more at least this seemed certain for how could they when he was travelling to the cape and she to natal  and yet and yet a strange conviction told her otherwise the power of prescience which came to her from her mother and her highland forefathers awoke in her breast and she knew that her life and this lads life were interwoven perhaps she dozed off again sitting there by the fire at any rate it appeared to her that she dreamed and saw things in her dream wild tumultuous scenes opened themselves before her in a vision scenes of blood and terror sounds too of voices crying war it appeared to her as if she were mad and yet ruled a queen death came near to her a score of times but always fled away at her command now richard darrien was with her and how she had lost him and soughtah how she sought through dark places of doom and unnatural night it was as though he were dead and she yet living searched for him among the habitations of the dead she found him also and drew him towards her how she did not know  then there was a scene a last scene which remained fixed in her mind after everything else had faded away she saw the huge trunks of forest trees enormous towering trees gloomy trees beneath which the darkness could be felt down their avenues shot the level arrows of the dawn they fell on her rachel dressed in robes of white skin turning her long outspread hair to gold they fell upon little people with faces of a dusky pallor one of them crouched against the bole of a tree a wizened monkey of a man who in all that vastness looked small they fell upon another man whiteskinned halfnaked with a yellow beard who was lashed by hide ropes to a second tree it was richard darrien grown older and at his feet lay a broadbladed spear  the vision left her or she was awakened from her sleep whichever it might be by the pleasant voice of this same richard who stood yawning before her and said  it is time to get up i say why do you look so queer are you ill  i have been up long ago she answered struggling to her feet what do you mean  nothing except that you seemed a ghost a minute ago now you are a girl again it must have been the light  did i well i dreamed of ghosts or something of the sort and she told him of the vision of the trees though of the rest she could remember little  thats a queer story he said when she had finished i wish you had got to the end of it i should like to know what happened  we shall find out one day she answered solemnly  do you mean to say that you believe it is true rachel  yes richard one day i shall see you tied to that tree  then i hope you will cut me loose that is all what a funny girl you are he added doubtfully i know what it is you want something to eat have the rest of that biltong  no she answered i could not touch it there is a pool of water out there go and bathe your arm and i will bind it up again  he went still wondering and a few minutes later returned his face and head dripping and whispered  give me the gun there is a reed buck standing close by i saw it through the mist well have a jolly breakfast off him  she handed him the roer and crept after him out of the cave about thirty yards away to the right looming very large through the dense fog stood the fat reed buck richard wriggled towards it for he wanted to make sure of his shot while rachel crouched behind a stone the buck becoming alarmed turned its head and began to sniff at the air whereon he lifted the gun and just as it was about to spring away aimed and fired down it went dead whereon rejoicing in his triumph like any other young hunter who thinks not of the wonderful and happy life that he has destroyed richard sprang upon it exultantly drawing his knife as he came while rachel who always shrank from such sights retreated to the cave half an hour later however being healthy and hungry she had no objection to eating venison toasted upon sticks in the red embers of their fire  their meal finished at length they reloaded the gun and although the mist was still very dense set out upon a journey of exploration as by now the sun was shining brightly above the curtain of lowlying vapour stumbling on through the rocks they discovered that the water had fallen almost as quickly as it rose on the previous night the island was strewn however with the trunks of trees and other debris that it had brought down amongst which lay the carcases of bucks and smaller creatures and with them a number of drowned snakes the two lions however appeared to have escaped by swimming at least they saw nothing of them walking cautiously they came to the edge of the donga and sat down upon a stone since as yet they could not see how wide and deep the water ran  whilst they remained thus suddenly through the mist they heard a voice shouting from the other side of the donga  missie cried the voice in dutch are you there missie   that is tom our driver she said come to look for me answer for me richard  so the lad who had very good lungs roared in reply  yes im here safe waiting for the mist to lift and the water to run down  god be thanked yelled the distant tom we thought that you were surely drowned but then why is your voice changed  because an english heer is with me cried rachel go and look for his horse and bring a rope then wait till the mist rises also send to tell the pastor and my mother that i am safe  i am here rachel shouted another voice her fathers i have been looking for you all night and we have got the englishmans horse dont come into the water yet wait till we can see  thats good news any way said richard though i shall have to ride hard to catch up the waggons  rachels face fell  yes she said very good news  are you glad that i am going then he asked in an offended tone  it was you who said the news was good she replied gently  i meant i was glad that they had caught my horse not that i had to ride away on it are you sorry then and he glanced at her anxiously  yes i am sorry for we have made friends havent we it wont matter to you who will find plenty of people down there at the cape but you see when you are gone i shall have no friend left in this wilderness shall i  again richard looked at her and saw that her sweet grey eyes were full of tears then there rose within the breast of this lad who be it remembered was verging upon manhood a sensation strangely similar had he but known it to that which had been experienced an hour or two before by the child at his side when she watched him sleeping in the cave he felt as though these tearladen grey eyes were drawing his heart as a magnet draws iron of love he knew nothing it was but a name to him but this feeling was certainly very new and queer  what have you done to me he asked brusquely i dont want to go away from you at all which is odd as i never liked girls much i tell you he went on with gathering vehemence that if it wasnt that it would be mean to play such a trick upon my father i wouldnt go id come with you or follow afterall my life answer mewhat have you done  nothing nothing at all said rachel with a little sob except tie up your arm  that cant be it he replied anyone could tie up my arm oh i know it is wrong but i hope i shant be able to overtake the waggons for if i cant i will come back  you mustnt come back you must go away quite away as soon as you can yes as soon as you can your father will be very anxious and she began to cry outright  stop it said richard do you hear me stop it i am not going to be made to snivel too just because i shant see a little girl any more whom i never mettill yesterday  these last words came out with a gulp and what is more two tears came with them and trickled down his nose  for a moment they sat thus looking at each other pitifully andthe truth must be toldweeping both of them then something got the better of richard let us call it primeval instinct so that he put his arms about rachel and kissed her after which they continued to weep their heads resting upon each others shoulders at length he let her go and stood up saying argumentatively  you see now we are really friends  yes she answered again rubbing her eyes with the back of her hand for lack of a pocket handkerchief in the fashion that on the previous day had so irritated her father but i dont know why you should kiss me like that just because you are my friend or she added with an outburst of truthfulness why i should kiss you  richard stood over her frowning and reflecting then he gave up the problem as beyond his powers of interpretation and said  you remember that rubbish you dreamt just now about my being tied to a tree and the rest of it well it wasnt nice and it gives me the creeps to think of it like the lions outside the cave but i want to tell you that i hope it is true for then we shall meet again if it is only to say goodnight  yes richard she answered placing her slim fingers into his big brown hand we shall meet again i am surei am quite sure and i think that it will be to say not goodnight and she looked up at him and smiled but goodmorning  as rachel spoke a puff of wind blew down the donga rolling up the mist before it and of a sudden shining above them they saw the glorious sun as though by magic butterflies appeared basking upon the rainshattered lily blooms bright birds flitted from tree to tree ringdoves began to coo the terror of the tempest and the darkness of night were overpast the world awoke again to life and love and joy instantly this change reflected itself in their young hearts they whose natures had as it were ripened prematurely in the stress of danger and the shadow of death became children once again the very real emotions that they had experienced were forgotten or at any rate sank into abeyance now they thought not of separation or of the dim mysterious future that stretched before them but only of how they should ford the stream and gain its further side where rachel saw her father tom the driver and the other kaffirs and richard saw his horse which he had feared was lost  they ran down to the brink of the water and examined it but here it was still too deep for them to attempt its crossing then directed by the shouts and motions of the kaffir tom and mr dove they proceeded up stream for several hundred yards till they came to a rapid where the lessening flood ran thinly over a ridge of rock and after investigation proceeded to try its passage hand in hand it proved difficult but not dangerous for when they came near to the further side where the current was swift and the water rather deep tom threw them a waggon rope clinging on to which they were draggedwet but laughingin safety to the further bank  ow exclaimed the kaffirs clapping their hands she is alive the lightnings have turned away from her she rules the waters and the lightnings and then and there after the native fashion they gave rachel a name which was destined to play a great part in her future that name was lady of the lightnings or to translate it more accurately of the heavens  i never thought to see you again said her father looking at rachel with a face that was still white and scared it was very wrong of me to send you so far with that storm coming on and i have had a terrible nightyes a terrible night and so has your poor mother however she knows that you are safe by now thank god thank god and he took her in his arms and kissed her  well father you said that he would look after me didnt you and so he did for he sent richard here if it hadnt been for richard i should have been drowned she added inconsequently  yes yes said mr dove providence manifests itself in many ways but who is your young friend whom you call richard i suppose he has some other name  of course answered that youth himself everybody has except kaffirs mine is darrien  darrien said mr dove i had a friend called darrien at school i never saw him after i left but i believe that he went into the navy  then he must be my father sir for i have heard him say that there had been no other darrien in the service for a hundred years  i think so answered mr dove for now that i look at you i can see a likeness we slept side by side in the same dormitory once fiveandthirty years ago so i remember and now you have saved my daughter it is very strange but tell me the story  so between them they told it although to one scene of itthe lastneither of them thought it necessary to allude or perhaps it was forgotten  truly the almighty has had you both in his keeping exclaimed mr dove when their tale was done and now richard my boy what are you going to do you see we caught your horseit was grazing about a mile away with the saddle twisted under its stomachand wondered what white man could possibly have been riding it in this desolate place afterwards however one of my voorloopers reported that he had seen two waggons yesterday afternoon trekking through the poort about five miles to the north there the white men with them said that they were travelling towards the cape and pushing on to get out of the hills before the storm broke they bade him if he met you to bid you follow after them as quickly as you could and to say that they would wait for you if you did not arrive before at the three sluit outspan on this side of the pondo country at which you stopped some months ago  yes answered richard i remember but that outspan is thirty miles away so i must be getting on or they will come back to hunt for me  first you will stop and eat with us will you not said mr dove  no no i have eaten also i have saved some meat in my pouch i must go i must indeed for otherwise my father will be angry with me you see he added i went out shooting without his leave  ah my boy remarked mr dove who seldom neglected an opportunity for a word in season now you know what comes of disobedience  yes i know sir he answered looking at rachel i was just in time to save your daughters life here as you said just now providence sent me well goodbye and dont think me wicked if i am very glad that i was disobedient as i believe you are too  yes i am good comes out of evil sometimes though that is no reason why we should do evil the missionary added not knowing what else to say richard did not attempt to argue the point for at the moment he was engaged in bidding farewell to rachel it was a very silent farewell neither of them spoke a word they only shook each others hand and looked into each others eyes then muttering something which it was as well that mr dove did not hear richard swung himself into the saddle for his horse stood at hand and without even looking back cantered away towards the mountains  oh exclaimed rachel presently call him father  what for asked mr dove  i want to give him our address and to get his  we have no address rachel also he is too far off and why should you want the address of a chance acquaintance  because he saved my life and i do replied the child setting her face then without another word she turned and began to walk towards their campa very heavy journey it was to rachel  when rachel reached the waggon she found that her mother was more or less recovered at any rate the attack of fever had left her so that she felt able to rise from her bed now although still weak she was engaged in packing away the garments of her dead baby in a travelling chest weeping in a silent piteous manner as she worked it was a very sad sight when she saw rachel she opened her arms without a word and embraced her  you were not frightened about me mother asked the child  no my love she answered because i knew that no harm would come to you i have always known that it was a mad thing of your father to send you to such a place at such a time but no folly of his or of anyone else can hurt you who are destined to live never be afraid of anything rachel for remember always you will only die in old age  i am not sure that i am glad of that answered the girl as she pulled off her wet clothes life isnt a very happy thing is it mother at least for those who live as we do  there is good and bad in it dear we cant have one without the othermost of us at any rate we must take it as it comes who have to walk a path that we did not make and stop walking when our path comes to an end not a step before or after but rachel you are changed since yesterday i see it in your face what has happened to you  lots of things mother i will tell you the story all of it every word would you like to hear it  her mother nodded and the babyclothes being at last packed away shut the lid ofthe box with a sigh sat down upon it and listened  rachel told her of her meeting with richard darrien and of how he saved her from the flood she told of the strange night that they had spent together in the little cave while the lions marched up and down without she told of her vigil over the sleeping richard at the daybreak and of the dream that she had dreamed when she seemed to see him grown to manhood and herself grown to womanhood and clad in white skins watching him lashed to the trunk of a gigantic tree as the first arrows of sunrise struck down the lanes of some mysterious forest she told of how her heart had been stirred and of how afterwards in the mist by the waters brink his heart had been stirred also and of how they had kissed each other and wept because they must part  then she stopped expecting that her mother would be angry with her and scold her for her thoughts and conduct as she knew well her father would have done but she was not angry and she did not scold she only stretched out her thin hands and stroked the childs fair hair saying  dont be frightened rachel and dont be sad you think that you have lost him but soon or late he will come back to you perhaps as you dreamedperhaps otherwise  if i were sure of that mother i would not mind anything said the girl though really i dont know why i should care she added defiantly  no you dont know now but you will one day and when you do remember that however long it seems to wait you may be quite sure because i who have the gift of knowing told you so now tell me again what richard darrien was like while you remember for perhaps i may never live to see his face and i wish to get it into my mind  so rachel told her and when she had described every detail asked suddenly  must we really go on mother into this awful wilderness would not father turn back if you asked him  perhaps she answered but i shall not ask he would never forgive me for preventing him from doing what he thinks his duty it is a madness when we might be happy in the cape or in england but that cannot be helped for it is also his destiny and ours dont judge hardly of your father rachel because he is a saint and this world is a bad place for saints and their families especially their families you think that he does not feel that he is heartless about me and the poor babe and sacrifices us all but i tell you he feels more than either you or i can do at night when i pretend to go to sleep i watch him groaning over his loss and for me and praying for strength to bear it and for help to enable him to do his duty last night he was nearly crazed about you and in all that awful storm when the kaffirs would not stir from the waggon went alone down to the river guided by the lightnings but of course returned half dead having found nothing by dawn he was back there again for love and fear would not let him rest a minute yet he will never tell you anything of that lest you should think that his faith in providence was shaken i know that he is strangeit is no use hiding it but if i were to thwart him he would go quite mad and then i should never forgive myself who took him for better and for worse just as he is and not as i should like him to be so rachel be as happy as you can and make the best of things as i try to do for your life is all before you whereas mine lies behind me and yonder and she pointed towards the place where the infant was buried hush here he comes now help me with the packing for we are to trek to the ford this afternoon    chapter iv  ishmael   it may he doubted whether any wellborn young english lady ever had a stranger bringingup than that which fell to the lot of rachel dove to begin with she had absolutely no associates male or female of her own age and station for at that period in its history such people did not exist in the country where she dwelt practically her only companions were her father a religious enthusiast and her mother a half brokenhearted woman who never for a single hour could forget the children she had lost and whose constitutional mysticism increased upon her continually until at times it seemed as though she had added some new quality to her normal human nature  then there were the natives amongst whom from the beginning rachel was a sort of queen in those first days of settlement they had never seen anybody in the least like her no one so beautifulfor she grew up beautifulso fearless or so kind the tale of that adventure of hers as a child upon the island in the midst of the flooded torrent spread all through the country with many fabulous additions thus the kaffirs said that she was a heavenherd that is a magical person who can ward off or direct the lightnings which she was supposed to have done upon this night also that she could walk upon the waters for otherwise how did she escape the flood and lastly that the wild beasts were her servants for had not the driver tom and the natives seen the spoor of great lions right at the mouth of the cave where she and her companion sheltered and had they not heard that she called these lions into the cave to protect her and him from the other creatures therefore as has been said they gave her a name a very long name that meant chieftainess or lady of heaven inkosazanayzoola for zulu or zoola which we know as the title of that people means heaven and udadeysilwana or sister of wild beasts as these appellations proved too lengthy for general use even among the bantu races who have plenty of time for talking ultimately it was shortened to zoola alone so that throughout that part of southeastern africa rachel came to enjoy the lofty title of heaven the first girl probably who was ever so called  with all natives from her childhood up rachel was on the best of terms she was never familiar with them indeed for that is not the way for a white person to win the affection or even the respect of a kaffir but she was intimate in the sense that she could enter into their thoughts and nature a very rare gift we whites are apt to consider ourselves the superior of such folk whereas we are only different in fact taken altogether it is quite a question whether the higher sections of the bantu peoples are not our equals of course we have learned more things and our best men are their betters but on the other hand among them there is nothing so low as the inhabitants of our slums nor have they any vices which can surpass our vices is an assegai so much more savage than a shell is there any great gulf fixed between a chaka and a napoleon at least they are not hypocrites and they are not vulgar that is the privilege of civilised nations  well with these folk rachel was intimate she could talk to the warrior of his wars to the woman of her garden and her children to the children of that wonder world which surrounds childhood throughout the universe and yet there was never a one of these but lifted the hand to her in salute when her shadow fell upon them to them all she was the inkosazana the great lady they would laugh at her father and mimic him behind his back but rachel they never laughed at or mimicked of her mother also although she kept herself apart from them much the same may be said for her they had a curious name which they would not or were unable to explain they called her flowerthatgrowsonagrave for mr dove their appellation was less poetical it was shouteraboutthingshedoesnotunderstand or more briefly the shouter a name that he had acquired from his habit of raising his voice when he grew moved in speaking to them the things that he did not understand it may be explained were not to their minds his religious views which although they considered them remarkable were evidently his own affair but their private customs especially their family customs that he was never weary of denouncing to the bewilderment of these poor heathens who for their part were not greatly impressed by those of the few white people with whom they came in contact therefore with native politeness they concluded that he spoke thus rudely because he did not understand hence his name  but rachel had other friends in truth she was natures child if in a better and a purer sense than byron uses that description the sea the veld the sky the forest and the river these were her companions for among them she dwelt solitary their denizens too knew her well for unless she were driven to it never would she lift her hand against anything that drew the breath of life the buck would let her pass quite close to them nor at her coming did the birds stir from off their trees often she stood and watched the great elephants feeding or at rest and even dared to wander among the herds of savage buffalo of only two living things was she afraidthe snake and the crocodile that are cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field because being cursed they have no sympathy or gentleness she feared nothing else she who was always fearless nor brute or bird did they fear her  after rachels adventure in the flooded river she and her parents pursued their journey by slow and tedious marches and at length though in those days this was strange enough reached natal unharmed at first they went to live where the city of durban now stands which at that time had but just received its name it was inhabited by a few rough men who made a living by trading and hunting and surrounded themselves with natives refugees for the most part from the zulu country amongst these people and their servants mr dove commenced his labours but ere long a bitter quarrel grew up between him and them  these dwellers in the midst of barbarism led strange lives and mr dove who rightly held it to be his duty to denounce wrongdoing of every sort attacked them and their vices in no measured terms and upon all occasions for long years he kept up the fight until at length he found himself ostracised if they could avoid it no white men would speak to him nor would they allow him to instruct their kaffirs thus his work came to an end in durban as it had done in other places now again his wife and daughter hoped that he would leave south africa for good and return home but it was not to be for once more he announced that it was laid upon him to follow the example of his divine master and that the spirit drove him into the wilderness so with a few attendants they trekked away from durban  on this occasion it was his wild design to settle in zululandwhere chaka the great king being dead dingaan his brother and murderer ruled in his placeand there devote himself to the conversion of the zulus indeed it is probable that he would have carried out this plan had he not been prevented by an accident one night when they were about forty miles from durban they camped on a stream a tributary of the tugela river which ran close by and formed the boundary of the zulu country it was a singularly beautiful spot for to the east of them about a mile away stretched the placid indian ocean while to the west overshadowing them almost rose a towering cliff over which the stream poured itself looking like a line of smoke against its rocky face they had outspanned upon a rising hillock at the foot of which this little river wound away like a silver snake till it joined the great tugela in its general aspect the country was like an english park dotted here and there with timber around which grazed or rested great elands and other buck and amongst them a huge rhinoceros  when the waggon had creaked to the top of the rise for of course there was no road and the kaffirs were beginning to unyoke the hungry oxen rachel who was riding with her father sprang from her horse and ran to it to help her mother to descend she was now a tall young woman full of health and vigour strong and straightly shaped mrs dove frail delicate greyhaired placed her foot upon the disselboom and hesitated for to her the ground seemed far off and the heels of the cattle very near  jump said rachel in her clear laughing voice as she smacked the near afterox to make it turn round which it did obediently for all the team knew her ill catch you  but her mother still hesitated so thrusting her way between the ox and the front wheel rachel stretched out her arms and lifted her bodily to the ground  how strong you are my love said her mother with a sort of wondering admiration and a sad little smile it seems strange to think that i ever carried you  one had need to be in this country dear replied rachel cheerfully come and walk a little way you must be stiff with sitting in that horrid waggon and she led her quite to the top of the knoll there she added isnt the view lovely i never saw such a pretty place in all africa and oh look at those buck and yesthat is a rhinoceros i hope it wont charge us  mrs dove obeyed gazing first at the glorious sea then at the plain and the trees and lastly behind her at the towering cliff steeped in shadowfor the sun was westeringdown the face of which the waterfall seemed to hang like a silver rope  as her eyes fell upon this cliff mrs doves face changed  i know this spot she said in a hurried voice i have seen it before  nonsense mother answered rachel we have never trekked here so how could you  i cant say love but i have i remember that cliff and the waterfall yes and those three trees and the buck standing under them  one often feels like that about having seen places i mean mother but of course it is all nonsense because it is impossible unless one dreams of them first  yes love unless one dreams well i think that i must have dreamt what was the dream now rachel weepingrachel weepingmy love i think that we are going to live here and i thinki think  all right broke in her daughter quickly with a shade of anxiety in her voice as though she did not wish to learn what her mother thought i dont mind i am sure i dont want to go to zululand and see this horrid dingaan who is always killing people and i am quite sure that father would never convert him the wicked monster it is like the garden of eden isnt it with the sea thrown in there are all the animals and that green tree with the fruit on it might be the tree of life andoh my goodness there is adam  mrs dove followed the line of her daughters outstretched hand and perceived three or four hundred yards away as in that sparkling atmosphere it was easy to do a white man apparently clad in skins he was engaged in crawling up a little rise of ground with the obvious intention of shooting at some blesbuck which stood in a hollow beyond with quaggas and other animals while behind him was a mounted kaffir who held his masters horse  i see said mrs dove mildly interested but he looks more like robinson crusoe without his umbrella adam did not kill the animals in the garden my dear  he must have lived on something besides forbidden apples remarked rachel unless perhaps he was a vegetarian as father wants to be therehe has fired  as she spoke a cloud of smoke arose above the man and presently the loud report of a roer reached their ears one of the buck rolled over and lay struggling on the ground while the rest together with many others at a distance turned and galloped off this way and that frightened by this new and terrible noise the old rhinoceros under the tree rose snorting sniffed the air then thundered away up wind towards the man its piglike tail held straight above its back  adam has spoilt our eden i hope the rhinoceros will catch him said rachel viciously look he has seen it and is running to his horse  rachel was right adamor whatever his name might bewas running with remarkable swiftness reaching the horse just as the rhinoceros appeared within forty yards of him he bounded to the saddle and with his servant galloped off to the right the rhinoceros came to a standstill for a few moments as though it were wondering whether it dared attack these strange creatures then making up its mind in the negative rushed on and vanished when it was gone the white man and the kaffir who had pulled up their horses at a distance returned to the fallen buck cut its throat and lifted it on to the kaffirs horse then rode slowly towards the waggon  they are coming to call said rachel how should one receive a gentleman in skins  apparently some misgivings as to the effect that might be produced by his appearance occurred to the hunter at any rate he looked first at the two white women standing on the brow and next at his own peculiar attire which appeared to consist chiefly of the pelt of a lion plus a very striking pair of trousers manufactured from the hide of a zebra and halted about sixty yards away staring at them rachel whose sight was exceedingly keen could see his face well for the light of the setting sun fell on it and he wore no head covering it was a dark handsome face of a man about thirtyfive years of age with stronglymarked features black eyes and beard and long black hair that fell down on to his shoulders they gazed at each other for a while then the man turned to his afterrider gave him an order in a clear strong voice and rode away inland the afterrider on the contrary directed his horse up the rise until he was within a few yards of them then sprang to the ground and saluted   what is it asked rachel in zulu a language which she now spoke perfectly  inkosikaas that islady answered the man my master thinks that you may be hungry and sends you a present of this buck and as he spoke he loosed the riem or hide rope by which it was fastened behind his saddle and let the animal fall to the ground  rachel turned her eyes from it for it was covered with blood and unpleasant to look at then replied  my father and my mother thank your master how is he named and where does he dwell  lady among us black people he is named ibubesi lion but his white name is hishmel  hishmel hishmel said rachel oh i know he means ishmael there mother i told you he was something biblical and of course ishmael dwelt in the wilderness didnt he after his father had behaved so badly to poor hagar and was a wild man whose hand was against every mans  rachel rachel said her mother suppressing a little smile your father would be very angry if he heard you you should not speak lightly of holy persons  well mother abraham may have been a holy person but we should think him a mean old thing nowadays almost as mean as sarah you know they were most of them mean so what is the use of pretending they were not  then without waiting for an answer she asked the kaffir again where does the inkoos ishmael dwell  in the wilderness answered the man appropriately now his kraal is yonder two hours ride away it is called mafooti and he pointed over the top of the precipice adding he is a hunter and trades with the zulus  is he dutch asked rachel whose curiosity was excited  the kaffir shook his head no he hates the dutch he is of the people of george  the people of george why he must mean a subject of king georgean englishman  yes yes lady an englishman like you and he grinned at her have you any message for the inkoos hishmel  yes say to the inkoos ishmael or lionwhodwellsinthewilderness hates the dutch and wears zebraskin trousers that my father and my mother thank him very much for his present and hope that his health is good go that is all  the man grinned again suspecting a joke for the zulus have a sense of humour then repeated the message word for word trying to pronounce ishmael as rachel did saluted mounted his horse and galloped off after his master  perhaps you should have kept that kaffir until your father came suggested mrs dove doubtfully  what was the good said rachel he would only have asked mr ishmael to call in order that he might find out his religious opinions and i dont want to see any more of the man  why not rachel  because i dont like him mother i think he is worse than any of the rest down there too bad to stop among them probably and she added with conviction i think we shall have more of his company than we want before all is done oh it is no good to say that i am prejudicedi do and what is more he came into our garden of eden and shot the buck i hope he will meet that rhinoceros on the way home there  although she disapproved or tried to think that she did of such strong opinions so strongly expressed mrs dove offered no further opposition to them the fact was that her daughters bodily and mental vigour overshadowed her as they did her husband also indeed it seemed curious that this girl so powerful in body and in mind should have sprung from such a pair a wrongheaded narrowviewed saint whose right place in the world would have been in a cell in the monastery or one of the stricter orders and a gentle uncomplaining highbred woman with a mind distinguished by its affectionate and mystical nature a mind so unusual and refined that it seemed to be and in truth was open to influences whereof mercifully enough the majority of us never feel the subtle secret power  of her father there was absolutely no trace in rachel except a certain physical resemblanceso far as he was concerned she must have thrown back to some earlier progenitor even their intellects and moral outlook were quite different she had it is true something of his scholarly power thus notwithstanding her wild upbringing as has been said she could read the greek testament almost as well as he could or even homer which she liked because the old bloodthirsty heroes reminded her of the zulus he had taught her this and other knowledge and she was an apt pupil but there the resemblance stopped whereas his intelligence was narrow and enslaved by the priestly tradition hers was wide and human she searched and she criticised she believed in god as he did but she saw his purpose working in the evil as in the good in her own thought she often compared these forces to the day and night and believed both of them to be necessary to the human world for her savagery had virtues as well as civilisation although it is true of the latter she knew but little  from her mother rachel had inherited more for instance her grace of speech and bearing and her intuition or foresight only in her case this curious gift did not dominate her her other forces held it in check she felt and she knew but feeling and knowledge did not frighten or make her weak any more than the strength of her frame or of her spirit made her unwomanly she accepted these things as part of her mental equipment that was all being aware that to her a door was opened which is shut firmly enough in the faces of most folk but not on that account in the least afraid of looking through it as her mother was  thus when she saw the man called ishmael she knew well enough that he was destined to bring great evil upon her and hers as when as a child she met the boy richard darrien she had known other things but she did not therefore fear the man and his attendant evil she only shrank from the first and looked through the second onward and outward to the ultimate good which she was convinced lay at the end of everything and meanwhile being young and merry she found his zebraskin trousers very ridiculous  just as rachel and her mother finished their conversation about mr ishmael mr dove arrived from a little kloof where he had been engaged with the kaffirs in cutting bushes to make a thorn fence round their camp as a protection against lions and hyenas he looked older than when we last met him and save for a fringe of white hair which increased his monkish appearance was quite bald his face too was even thinner and more eager and his grey eyes were more faraway than formerly also he had grown a long white beard  where did that buck come from he asked looking at the dead creature  rachel told him the story with the result that as her mother had expected he was very indignant with her it was most unkind and indeed unchristian he said not to have asked this very courteous gentleman into the camp as he would much have liked to converse with him he had often reproved her habit of judging by external and in the veld lion and zebra skins furnish a very suitable covering she should remember that such were given to our first parents  oh i know father broke in rachel when the climate grew too cold for leaf petticoats and the rest now dont begin to scold me because i must go to cook the dinner i didnt like the look of the man besides he rode off then it wasnt my business to ask him here but mothers who stood staring at him and never said a single word if you want to see him so much you can go to call upon him tomorrow only dont take me please and now will you send tom to skin the buck  mr dove answered that tom was busy with the fence and ceasing from argument which he felt to be useless with rachel suggested doubtfully that he had better be his own butcher  no no she replied you know you hate that sort of thing as i do let it be till the kaffirs have time we have the cold meat left for supper and i will boil some mealies go and help with the fence father while i light the fire  usually rachel was the best of sleepers so soon as she laid her head upon whatever happened to serve her for a pillow generally a saddle her eyes shut to open no more till daylight came on this night however it was not so she had her bed in a little flap tent which hooked on to the side of the waggon that was occupied by her parents here she lay wide awake for a long while listening to the kaffirs who having partaken heartily of the buck were now making themselves drunk by smoking dakka or indian hemp a habit of which mr dove had tried in vain to break them at length the fire around which they sat near the thorn fence on the further side of the waggon grew low and their incoherent talk ended in silence punctuated by snores rachel began to dose but was awakened by the laughing cries of the hyenas quite close to her the brutes had scented the dead buck and were wandering round the fence in hope of a midnight meal rachel rose and taking the gun that lay at her side threw a cloak over her shoulders and left the tent  the moon was shining brightly and by its light she saw the hyenas two of them wolves as they are called in south africa long grey creatures that prowled round the thorn fence hungrily causing the oxen that were tied to the trek tow and the horses picketed on the other side of the waggon to low and whinny in an uneasy fashion the hyenas saw her also for her head rose above the rough fence and being cowardly beasts slunk away she could have shot them had she chose but did not first because she hated killing anything unnecessarily even a wolf and secondly because it would have aroused the camp so she contented herself by throwing more dry wood on to the fire stepping over the kaffirs who slept like logs in order to do so then resting upon her gun like some amazon on guard she gazed a while at the lovely moonlit sea and the long line of game trekking silently to their drinking place until seeing no more of the wolves or other dangerous beasts she turned and sought her bed again  she was thinking of mr ishmael and his zebraskin trousers wondering why the man should have filled her with such an unreasoning dislike if she had disliked him at a distance of fifty paces how she would hate him when he was near and yet he was probably only one of those broken soldiers of fortune of whom she had met several who took to the wilderness as a last resource and by degrees sank to the level of the savages among whom they lived a person who was not worth a second thought so she tried to put him from her mind and by way of an antidote since still she could not sleep filled it with her recollections of richard darrien some years had gone by since they had met and from that time to this she had never heard a word of him in which she could put the slightest faith she did not even know whether he were alive or dead only she believed that if he were dead she would be aware of it no she had never heard of him and it seemed probable that she never would hear of him again yet she did not believe that either had she done so her happinessfor on the whole rachel was a happy girlwould have departed from her since this once seen lad never left her heart nor had she forgotten their farewell kiss  reflecting thus at length rachel fell off to sleep and began to dream still of richard darrien it was a long dream whereof afterwards she could remember but little but in it there were shoutings and black faces and the flashing of spears also the white man ishmael was present there one part however she did remember richard darrien grown taller changed and yet the same leaning over her warning her of danger to come warning her against this man ishmael  she awoke suddenly to see that the light of dawn was creeping into her tent that low soft light which is so beautiful in southern africa rachel was disturbed she felt the need of action of anything that would change the current of her thoughts no one was about yet what should she do she knew the sea was not more than a mile away she would go down to it and bathe and be back before the rest of them were awake    chapter v  noie   that a girl should set out alone to bathe through a country inhabited chiefly by wild beasts and a few wandering savages sounds a somewhat dangerous form of amusement so it was indeed but rachel cared nothing for such dangers in fact she never even thought of them long ago she had discovered that the animals would not harm her if she did not harm them except perhaps the rhinoceros which is given to charging on sight and that was large and could generally be discovered at a distance as for elephants and lions or even buffalo her experience was that they ran away except on rare occasions when they stood still and stared at her nor was she afraid of the savages who always treated her with the utmost respect even if they had never seen her before still in case of accidents she took her doublebarrelled gun loaded in one barrel with ball and in the other with loopers or slugs and awakened tom the driver to tell him where she was going the man stared at her sleepily and murmured a remonstrance but taking no heed of him she pulled out some thorns from the fence to make a passage and in another minute was lost to sight in the morning mist  following a game path through the dewdrenched grass which grew upon the swells and valleys of the veld and passing many small buck upon her way in about twenty minutes just as the light was really beginning to grow rachel reached the sea it was dead calm and the tide chancing to be out soon she found the very place she soughta large rockbound pool where there would be no fear of sharks that never stay in such a spot fearing lest they should be stranded slipping off her clothes she plunged into the cool and crystal water and began to swim round and across the pool for at this art she was expert diving and playing like a seanymph her bath done she dried herself with a towel she had brought all except her long fair hair which she let loose for the wind to blow on and having dressed stood a while waiting to see the glory of the sun rising from the ocean  whilst she remained thus suddenly she heard the sound of horses galloping towards her two of them she could tell that from the hoof beats although the lowlying mist made them invisible a few more seconds and they emerged out of the fog the first thing that she saw were stripes which caused her to laugh thinking that she had mistaken zebras for horses then the laugh died on her lips as she recognised that the stripes were those of mr ishmaels trousers yes there was no doubt about it mr ishmael wearing a rough coat instead of his lionskin but with the rest of his attire unchanged was galloping down upon her furiously leading a riderless horse remembering her wet and dishevelled hair rachel threw the towel over it whence it hung like an old egyptian headdress setting her beautiful face in a most becoming frame next she picked up the doublebarrelled gun and cocked it for she misdoubted her of this mans intentions not many modern books came her way but she had read stories of young women who were carried off by force  for an instance she was frightened but as she lifted the hammer of the second barrel her constitutional courage returned  let him try it she thought to herself if he had come ten minutes ago it would have been awful but now i dont care  by this time mr ishmael had arrived and was dragging his horse to its haunches also she saw that evidently he was much more frightened than she had been the mans handsome face was quite white and his lips were trembling perhaps that rhinoceros is after him again thought rachel then added aloud quietly  what is the matter  forgive me he answered in a rich and to rachels astonishment perfectly educated voice forgive me for disturbing you i am ashamed but it is necessary the zulus and he paused  well sir asked rachel what about the zulus  a regiment of them are coming down here on the warpath they are hunting fugitives the fugitives about fifty of them passed my camp over an hour ago and i saw the impi following them i rode to warn you all they told me you were down by the sea i came to bring you back to your waggon lest you should be cut off  thank you very much said rachel but i am not afraid of the zulus i do not think that they will hurt me  not hurt you not hurt you white and beautiful as you are why not  oh i dont know she replied with a laugh but you see i am called inkosazanayzoola they wont touch one with that name  inkosazanayzoola he repeated astonished why she is their spirit yes and i rememberwhite like you so they say how did you get that name but mount mount they will kill you first and ask how you were called afterwards your father is much afraid  my mother would not be afraid she knows muttered rachel to herself as she sprang to the saddle of the ledhorse  then without more words they began to gallop back towards the camp before they reached the crest of the second rise the sun shone out in earnest thinning the seaward mist although between them and the camp it still hung thick then suddenly in the fogedge rachel saw this sight towards them ran a delicately shaped and beautiful native girl naked except for her moocha and of a very light coppercolour whilst after her brandishing an assegai came a zulu warrior evidently the girl was in the last stage of exhaustion indeed she reeled over the ground her tongue protruded from her lips and her eyes seemed to be starting from her head  come on shouted the man called ishmael it is only one of the fugitives whom they are killing  but rachel did nothing of the sort she pulled up her horse and waited the girl caught sight of her and with a wild hoarse scream redoubled her efforts so that her pursuer who had been quite close was left behind she reached rachel and flung her arms about her legs gasping  save me white lady save me  shoot her if she wont leave go shouted ishmael and come on  but rachel only sprang from the horse and stood face to face with the advancing zulu  stand she said and the man stopped  now she asked what do you want with this woman  to take her or to kill her gasped the soldier  by whose order  by order of dingaan the king  for what crime  witchcraft but who are you who question me white woman  one whom you must obey answered rachel proudly go back and leave the girl she is mine  the man stared at her then laughed aloud and began to advance again  go back repeated rachel  he took no heed but still came on  go back or die she said for the third time  i shall certainly die if i go back to dingaan without the girl replied the soldier who was a boldlooking savage now you noie will you return with me or shall i kill you say witch and he lifted his assegai  the girl sank in a heap upon the veld kill she murmured faintly i will not go back i did not bewitch him to make him dream of me and i will be deaths wife not his a ghost in his kraal not a woman  good said the man i will carry your word to the king farewell noie and he raised the assegai still higher adding stand aside white woman for i have no order to kill you also  by way of answer rachel put the gun to her shoulder and pointed it at him  are you mad shouted ishmael if you touch him they will murder every one of us are you mad  are you a coward she asked quietly without taking her eyes off the soldier then she said in zulu listen the land on this side of the tugela has been given by dingaan to the english here he has no right to kill this girl is mine not his come one step nearer and you die  we shall soon see who will die answered the warrior with a laugh and he sprang forward  they were his last words rachel aimed and pressed the trigger the gun exploded heavily in the mist the zulu leapt into the air and fell upon his back dead the white man ishmael rode to them pulled up his horse and sat still staring it was a strange picture in that lonely silent spot the soldier so very still and dead his face hidden by the shield that had fallen across it the tall white girl rigid as a statue in whose hand the gun still smoked the delicate fragile kaffir maiden kneeling on the veld and looking at her wildly as though she were a spirit and the two horses one with its ears pricked in curiosity and the other already cropping grass  my god what have you done exclaimed ishmael  justice answered rachel  then your blood be on your own head i am not going to stop here to have my throat cut  dont answered rachel i have a better guardian than you and will look after my own blood  to this speech the white man seemed to be able to find no answer turning his horse he galloped off swearing but not towards the camp whereon the other horse galloped after him and presently they all vanished in the mist leaving the two women alone  at this moment from the direction of the waggon they heard the sound of shouting and of screams which appeared to come from the valley between them and it  the kings men are killing my people muttered the girl noie go or they will kill you too  rachel thought a moment evidently it was impossible to get through to the camp indeed even had they tried to do so on the horses they would have been cut off an idea came to her they stood upon the edge of a steep bushclothed kloof where in the wet season a stream ran down to the sea this stream was now represented by a chain of deep and muddy pools one of which pools lay directly underneath them  help me to throw him into the water said rachel  the girl understood and with desperate energy they seized the dead soldier dragged him to the edge of the little cliff and thrust him over he fell with a heavy splash into the pool and vanished  crocodiles live there said rachel i saw one as i passed now take the shield and spear and follow me  she obeyed for with hope her strength seemed to have returned to her and the two of them scrambled down the cliffs into the kloof as they reached the edge of the pool they saw great snouts and a disturbance in the water rachel was right crocodiles lived there  now she said throw your moocha on that rock they will find it and think  noie nodded and did so rending its fastening and wetting it in the water then quite naked she took rachels hand and swiftly swiftly the two of them leapt from stone to stone so as to leave no footprints heading for the sea only the fugitive stopped once to drink of the fresh water for she was perishing with thirst now when rachel was bathing she had observed upon the farther side of her pool and opening out of it as it were a little pocket in the rock where the water was not more than three feet deep and covered by a dense growth of beautiful seaweed some black and some ribbonlike and yellow the pool was long perhaps two hundred paces in all and to go round it they would be obliged to expose themselves upon the sand and thus become visible from a long way off  can you swim said rachel to noie  again she nodded and the two of them slipped into the water and swam across the pool till they reached the pocketlike place on the edge of which they sat down covering themselves with the seaweed  they had not been there five minutes when they heard the sound of voices drawing near down the kloof and at once slid into the water covering themselves in it in such fashion that only their heads remained above the surface mixed with the black and yellow seaweed so that without close search none could have said which was hair and which was weed  the zulus said noie shivering so that the water shook about her they seek me  lie still then answered rachel i cant shoot now the gun is wet  the voices died away and the two girls thought that the speakers had gone but rendered cautious still remained hidden in the water it was well for them that they did so for presently they heard the voices again and much nearer the zulus were walking round the pool two of them came quite close to their little hidingplace and sat down on some rocks to rest and talk peeping through her covering of seaweed rachel could see them great men who held red spears in their hands  you are a fool said one of them to the other and have given us this walk for nothing as though our feet were not sore enough already the crocodiles have that noie her witchcraft could not save her from them it was a baboons spoor you saw in the mud not a womans  it would seem so brother answered the other as we found the moocha still if so where is bomba who was running her down and what made that bloodmark on the grass  doubtless replied the first man bomba came up with her there and wounded her whereon being a woman and a coward she ran from him and jumped into the pool in which the crocodiles finished her as for bomba i expect that he has gone back to zululand or is asleep somewhere resting the other spoor we saw was that of a white woman who puts skins upon her feet there is a camp of them up yonder but you remember our orders were not to touch any of the people of george so we need not trouble about them  well brother if you are sure we had better be starting back lest there should be trouble with the white people dingaan will be satisfied when we show him the moocha and sleep in peace henceforth she must really have been tagati uncanny that little noie for otherwise although it is true she was pretty why should dingaan who has all zululand to choose from have fallen in love with her and why should she have refused to enter his house and persuaded all her kraal to run away for my part i dont believe that she is dead now notwithstanding the moocha i think that she is a witch and has changed into something elsea bird or a snake perhaps well the rest of them will never change into anything except black mould let us see we have killed every one all the common people the mother of noie the dwarfwizard seyapi her father and her other mothers four of them and her brothers and sisters twelve in all  at these words noie again trembled beneath her seaweed so that the water shook all about her  there is a fish there said the first kaffir i saw it rise it is a small pool shall we try to catch it  no brother answered the other only coast people eat fish i am hungry but i will wait for mans food take that fish and he threw a stone into the pool which struck rachel on the side and caused her fair hair to float about among the yellow seaweed  then the two of them got up and went away walking arminarm like friends and amiable men as they were in their own fashion  for a long time the girls remained beneath their seaweed fearing lest the men or others should return until at length they could bear the cold of the water no longer and crept out of it to the brink of the little pool where still wreathed in seaweed they sat and warmed themselves in the hot sunlight now noie seemed to be half dead indeed rachel thought that she would die  awake she said life is still before you  would that it were behind me lady moaned the poor girl you understand our tonguedid you not hear my father my own mother my other mothers my brothers and sisters all killed all killed for my sake and i left living oh you meant kindly but why did you not let bomba pass his spear through me it would have been quickly over and now i should sleep with the rest  rachel made no answer for she saw that talking was useless in such a case only she took noies hand and pressed it in silent sympathy until at length the poor girl utterly outworn with agony and the fatigue of her long flight fell asleep there in the sunshine rachel let her sleep knowing that she would take no harm in that warmth quietly she sat at her side for hour after hour while the fierce sun from which she protected her head with seaweed dried her garments at length the shadows told her that midday was past and the sea water which began to trickle over the surrounding rocks that the tide was approaching its full they could stop there no longer unless they wished to be drowned  come she said to noie the zulus have gone and the sea is here we must swim to the shore and go back to my fathers camp  what place have i in your kraal lady asked the girl when her senses had returned to her  i will find you a place rachel answered you are mine now  yes lady that is true said noie heavily i am yours and no one elses and taking rachels hand she pressed it to her forehead  then together once more they swam the pool and not too soon for the tide was pouring into it reaching the shore in safety no easy task for rachel who must hold the heavy gun above her head noie tied rachels towel about her middle to take the place of her moocha and very cautiously they crept up the kloof fearing lest some of the zulus might still be lurking in the neighbourhood  at length they came to the pool into which they had thrown the soldier bomba and saw two crocodiles doubtless those that had eaten him lying asleep in the sun upon flat rocks at its edge here they were obliged to leave the kloof both because they feared to pass the crocodiles and for the reason that their road to the camp ran another way so they climbed up the cliff and looked about but could see only a pair of oribe bucks one lying down under a tree and one eating grass quite close to its mate  the zulus have gone or there would be no buck here said rachel come now hold the shield before you and the spear in your hand to hide that you are a woman and let us go on boldly  so they went till they reached the crest of the next rise and then sprang back behind it for lying here and there they saw people who seemed to be asleep  the zulus resting exclaimed rachel  nay answered the girl with a sigh my people dead see the vultures gathered round them  rachel looked again and saw that it was so without a word they walked forward and as they passed each body noie gave it its name here lay a brother there a sister yonder four folk of her fathers kraal they came to a tall and handsome woman of middle age and she shivered as she had done in the pool and said in an icy voice  the mother who bore me  a few more steps and in a patch of high grass that grew round an antheap they found two zulu soldiers each pierced through with a spear seated against the antheap also as though he were but resting was a lightcoloured man a dwarf in stature spare of frame and with sharp features his dress if he wore any seemed to have been removed from him for he was almost naked and rachel noticed that no wound could be seen on him  behold my father said noie in the same icy voice  but whispered rachel he only sleeps no spear has touched him  not so he is dead dead by the white death after the fashion of his people  now rachel wondered what this white death might be and of which people the man was one that he was not a zulu who had been stunted in his growth she could see for herself nor had she ever met a native who at all resembled him still she could ask no questions at that time the thing was too awful moreover noie had knelt down before the body and with her arms thrown around its neck was whispering into its ear for a full minute she whispered thus then set her own ear to the cold stirless lips and for another minute or more seemed to listen intently nodding her head from time to time never before had rachel witnessed anything so uncanny and oddly enough the fact that this scene was enacted in the bright sunlight added to its terrors she stood paralysed forgetting the zulus forgetting everything except that to all appearance the living was holding converse with the dead  at length noie rose and turning to her companion said  my spirit has been good to me i thank my spirit which brought me here before it was too late for us to talk together now i have the message  the message oh what message gasped rachel  an inscrutable look gathered on the face of the beautiful native girl  it is to me alone she answered but this i may say much of it was of you inkosazanayzoola  who told you that was my native name asked rachel springing back  it was in the message o thou before whom kings shall bow  nonsense exclaimed rachel you have heard it from our people  so be it lady i have heard it from your people whom i have never seen now let us go your father is troubled for you  again rachel looked at her sideways and noie went on  lady from henceforth i am your servant am i not and that service will not be light  she thinks i shall make her dig thought rachel to herself as the girl continued in her low soft voice  now i ask you one thingwhen i tell you my story let it be for your breast alone say only that i am a common girl whom you saved from the soldier  why not answered rachel that is all i have to tell  then once more they went on rachel wondering if she dreamed the girl noie walking at her side stern and coldfaced as a statue    chapter vi  the casting of the lots   they reached the crest of the last rise and there facing them on the slope of the opposite wave of land stood the waggon surrounded by the thorn fence within which the cattle and horses were still enclosed doubtless for fear of the zulus nothing could be more peaceful than the aspect of that camp to look at it no one would have believed that within a few hundred yards a hideous massacre had just taken place presently however voices began to shout and heads to bob up over the fence then it occurred to rachel that they must think she was a prisoner in the charge of a zulu and she told noie to lower the shield which she still held in front of her the next instant some thorns were torn out and her father a gun in his hand appeared striding towards them  thank god that you are safe he said as they met i have suffered great anxiety although i hoped that the white man israelno ishmaelhad rescued you he came here to warn us he added in explanation very early this morning then galloped off to find you indeed his afterrider whose horse he took is still here where on earth have you been rachel andsuddenly becoming aware of noie who arrayed only in a towel a shield and a stabbing spear presented a curious if an impressive spectaclewho is this young person  she is a native girl i saved from the massacre replied rachel answering the last question first it is a long story but i shot the man who was going to kill her and we hid in a pool are you all safe and where is mother  shot the man shed human blood hid in a pool ejaculated mr dove overcome really rachel you are a most trying daughter why should you go out before daybreak and do such things  i dont know i am sure father predestination i supposeto save her life you know  again he contemplated the beautiful noie then murmuring something about a blanket ran back to the camp by this time mrs dove had climbed out of the waggon and arrived with the kaffirs  i knew you would be safe rachel she said in her gentle voice because nothing can hurt you still you do upset your poor father dreadfully andwhat are you going to do with that naked young woman  give her something to eat dear answered rachel dont ask me any more questions now we have been sitting up to our necks in water for hours and are starved and frozen to say nothing of worse things  at this moment mr dove arrived with a blanket which he offered to noie who took it from him and threw it round her body then they went into the camp where rachel changed her damp clothes whilst noie sat by her in a corner of the tent presently too food was brought and rachel ate hungrily forcing noie to do the same then she went out leaving the girl to rest in the tent and with certain omissions such as the conduct of noie when she found her dead father told all the story which wild as were the times and strange as were the things that happened in them they found wonderful enough  when she had done mr dove knelt down and offered up thanks for his daughters preservation through great danger and with them prayers that she might be forgiven for having shot the zulu a deed that except for the physical horror of it did not weigh upon rachels mind  you know father you would have done the same yourself she explained and so would mother there if she could hold a gun so what is the good of pretending that it is a sin also no one saw it except that white man and the crocodiles which buried the body so the less we say about the matter the better it will be for all of us  i admit answered mr dove that the circumstances justified the deed though i fear that the truth will out since blood calls for blood but what are we to do with the girl they will come to seek her and kill us all  they will not seek father because they think that she is dead and will never know otherwise unless that white man tells them which he will scarcely do as the zulus would think that he shot the soldier not i she has been sent to us and it is our duty to keep her  i suppose so said her father doubtfully poor thing truly she has cause for gratitude to providence all her relations killed by those bloodthirsty savages and she saved  if all of you were killed and i were saved i do not know that i should feel particularly grateful answered rachel but it is no use arguing about such things so let us be thankful that we are not killed too now i am tired out and going to lie down for of course we cant leave this place at present unless we trek back to durban  such was the finding of noie                                       when rachel awoke from the sleep into which she had fallen sunset was near at hand she left the tent where noie still lay slumbering or lost in stupor to find that only her mother and ishmaels afterrider remained in the camp her father having gone out with the kaffirs in order to bury as many of the dead as possible before night came and with it the jackals and hyenas rachel made up the fire and set to work with her mothers help to cook their evening meal whilst they were thus engaged her quick ears caught the sound of horses hoofs and she looked up to perceive the white man ishmael still leading the spare horse on which she had ridden that morning he had halted on the crest of ground where she had first seen him upon the previous day and was peering at the camp with the object apparently of ascertaining whether its occupants were still alive  i will go and ask him in said rachel who for reasons of her own wished to have a word or two with the man  presently she came up to him and saw at once that he seemed to be very much ashamed of himself  well she said cheerfully you see here i am safe enough and i am glad that you are the same  you are a wonderful woman he replied letting his eyes sink before her clear gaze as wonderful as you are beautiful  no compliments please said rachel they are out of place in this savage land  i beg your pardon i could not help speaking the truth did they kill the girl and let you go  no i managed to hide up with her she is here now  that is very dangerous miss dove i know all about it it is she whom dingaan was after when he hears that you have sheltered her he will send and kill you all take my advice and turn her out at once i say it is most dangerous  perhaps answered rachel calmly but all the same i shall do nothing of the sort unless she wishes to go nor do i think that my father will either now please listen a minute if this story comes to the ears of the zulusand i do not see why it should as the crocodiles have eaten that soldierwho will they think shot him i or the white man who was with me do you understand  i understand and shall hold my tongue for your sake  no for your own well by way of making the bargain fair for my part i shall say as little as possible of how we separated this morning not that i blame you for riding off and leaving an obstinate young woman whom you did not know to take her chance still other people might think differently   yes he answered they might and i admit that i am ashamed of myself but you dont know the zulus as i do and i thought that they would be all on us in a moment also i was mad with you and lost my nerve really i am very sorry  please dont apologise it was quite natural and what is more all for the best if we had gone on we should have ridden right into them and perhaps never ridden out again now here comes my father we have agreed that you will not say too much about this girl have we not  he nodded and advanced with her leading the horses for he had dismounted to meet mr dove at the opening in the fence  good evening said the clergyman who seemed depressed after his sad task as he motioned to one of the kaffirs to put down his mattock and take the horses i dont quite know what happened this morning but i have to thank you for trying to save my daughter from those cruel men i have been burying their victims in a little cleft that we found or rather some of them the vultures you know and he paused  i didnt save her sir answered the stranger humbly it seemed hopeless as she would not leave the kaffir girl  mr dove looked at him searchingly and there was a suspicion of contempt in his voice as he replied  you would not have had her abandon the poor thing would you for the rest god saved them both so it does not much matter exactly how as everything has turned out for the best wont you come in and have some supper mrishmaeli am afraid i do not know the rest of your name  there is no more to know mr dove he replied doggedly then added look here sir as i daresay you have found out this is a rough country and people come to it some of them whose luck has been rough elsewhere now perhaps i am as well born as you are and perhaps my luck was rough in other lands so that i chose to come and live in a place where there are no laws or civilisation perhaps too i took the name of another man who was driven into the wildernessyou will remember all about himalso that it does not seem to have been his fault any way if we should be thrown up together ill ask you to take me as i am that is a hunter and a trader in the zulu and not to bother about what i have been whatever i was christened my name is ishmael now or among the kaffirs ibubesi and if you want another let us call it smith  quite so mr ishmael it is no affair of mine replied mr dove with a smile for he had met people of this sort before in africa  but within himself already he determined that this white and perchance fallen wanderer was one whom perhaps it would be his duty to lead back into the paths of christian propriety and peace  these matters settled they went into the little camp and a sentry having been set for now the night was falling fast ishmael was introduced to mrs dove who looked him up and down and said little after which they began their supper when their simple meal was finished ishmael lit his pipe and sat himself upon the disselboom of the waggon looking extremely handsome and picturesque in the flare of the firelight which fell upon his dark face long black hair and curious garments for although he had replaced his lionskin by an old coat his zebrahide trousers and waistcoat made of an otters pelt still remained contemplating him rachel felt sure that whatever his present and past might be he had spoken the truth when he hinted that he was wellborn indeed this might be gathered from his voice and method of expressing himself when he grew more at ease although it was true that sometimes he substituted a zulu for an english word and employed its idioms in his sentences doubtless because for years he had been accustomed to speak and even to think in that language  now he was explaining to mr dove the political and social position among that people whose cruel laws and customs led to constant fights on the part of tribes or families who knew that they were doomed and their consequent massacre if caught as had happened that day of course the clergyman who had lived for some years at durban knew that this was true although never having actually witnessed one of these dreadful events till now he did not realise all their horror  i fear that my task will be even harder than i thought he said with a sigh  what task asked ishmael  that of converting the zulus i am trekking to the kings kraal now and propose to settle there  ishmael knocked out his pipe and filled it again before he answered apparently he could find no words in which to express his thoughts but when at length these came they were vigorous enough  why not trek to hell and settle there at once he asked i beg pardon i meant heaven for you and your likes man he went on excitedly have you any heart do you care about your wife and daughter  i have always imagined that i did mr ishmael replied the missionary in a cold voice   then do you wish to see their throats cut before your eyes or and he looked at rachel worse  how can you ask such questions said mr dove indignantly of course i know that there are risks among all wild peoples but i trust to providence to protect us  mr ishmael puffed at his pipe and swore to himself in zulu  yes he said when he had recovered a little so i suppose did seyapi and his people but you have been burying them this afternoonhavent youall except the girl noie whom you have sheltered for which deed dingaan will bury you all if you go into zululand or rather throw you to the vultures dont think that your being an umfundusi i mean a teacher will save you the almighty himself cant save you there you will be dead and forgotten in a month whats more you will have to drive your own waggon in for your kaffirs wont they know better a bible wont turn the blade of an assegai  please mr ishmael please do not speak soso irreligiously said mr dove in an irritated but nervous voice you do not seem to understand that i have a mission to perform and if that should involve martyrdom  oh bother martyrdom which is what you are after no doubt casting down your golden crown upon a crystal sea and the rest of iti remember the stuff the question is do you wish to murder your wife and daughter for thats the plain english of it  of course not how can you suggest such a thing  then you had better not cross the tugela go back to durban or stop where you are at least for unless he finds out anything dingaan is not likely to interfere with a white man on this side of the river  that would involve abandoning my most cherished ambition and impulses thatbut i will not speak to you of things which perhaps you might not understand  i dare say i shouldnt but i do understand what it feels like to have your neck twisted out of joint look here sir if you want to go into zululand you should go alone it is no place for white ladies  that is for them to judge sir answered mr dove i believe that their faith will be equal to this trial and he looked at his wife almost imploringly  for once however she failed him  my dear john she said if you want my opinion i think that this gentleman is quite right for myself i dont care much but it can never have been intended that we should absolutely throw away our lives i have always given way to you and followed you to many strange places without grumbling although as you know we might be quite comfortable at home or at any rate in some civilised town now i say that i think you ought not to go to zululand especially as there is rachel to think of  oh dont trouble about me interrupted that young lady with a shrug of her shoulders i can take my chance as i have often done beforetoday for instance  but i do trouble about you my dear although it is true i dont believe that you will be killed you know i have always said so still i do trouble and johnjohn she added in a kind of pitiful cry cant you see that you have worn me out cant you understand that i am getting old and weak is there nobody to whom you have a duty as well as to the heathen are there not enough heathen here she went on with gathering passion if you must mix with them do what this gentleman says and stop here that is if you wont go back build a house and let us have a little peace before we die for death will come soon enough and terribly enough i am sure and she burst into a fit of weeping  my dear said mr dove you are upset the unhappy occurrences of today whichdid we but know itare doubtless all for the best and your anxiety for rachel have been too much for you i think that you had better go to bed and you too rachel i will talk the matter over further with mr ishmael who perhaps has been sent to guide me i am not unreasonable as you think and if he can convince me that there is any risk to your livesfor my own i care nothingi will consider the suggestion of building a missionstation outside zululand at any rate for a few years it may be that it is not intended that we should enter that country at present  so mrs dove and her daughter went but for two hours or more rachel heard her father and the hunter talking earnestly and wondered in a sleepy fashion to what conclusion he had come personally she did not mind much on which side of the tugela they were to live if they must bide at all in the region of that river still for her mothers sake she determined that if she could bring it about they should stay where they were indeed there was no choice between this and returning to england as her father had quarrelled too bitterly with the white men at durban to allow of his taking up his residence among them again  when rachel woke on the following morning the first thing she saw in the growing light was the orphaned native noie seated on the further side of the little tent her head resting upon her hand and gazing at her vacantly rachel watched her a while pretending to be still asleep and for the first time understood how beautiful this girl was in her own fashion although small that is in comparison with most kaffir women she was perfectly shaped and developed her soft skin in that light looked almost white although it had about it nothing of the muddy colour of the halfbreed her hair was long black and curly and worn naturally not forced into artificial shapes as is common among the kaffirs her features were finely cut and intellectual and her eyes shaded by long lashes somewhat oblong in shape of a brown colour and soft as those of a buck certainly for a native she was lovely and what is more quite unlike any bantu that rachel had ever seen except indeed that dead man whom she said was her father and who although he was so small had managed to kill two great zulu warriors before mysteriously enough he died himself  noie said rachel when she had completed her observations whereon with a quick and agile movement the girl rose sank again on her knees beside her took the hand that hung from the bed between her own and pressed it to her lips saying in the soft zulu tongue  inkosazana i am here  is that white man still asleep noie  nay he has gone he and his servant rode away before the light fearing lest there might still be zulus between him and his kraal  do you know anything about him noie  yes lady i have seen him in zululand he is a bad man they call him there lion not because he is brave but because he hunts and springs by night  just what i should have thought of him answered rachel and we know that he is not brave she added with a smile but never mind this jackal in a lions hide tell me your story noie if you will only speak low for this tent is thin  lady said the girl you who were born white in body and in spirit hear me i am but half a zulu my father who died yesterday in the flesh departing back to the world of ghosts was of another people who live far to the north a small people but a strong they live among the trees they worship trees they die when their tree dies they are dealers in dreams they are the companions of ghosts little men before whom the tribes tremble who hate the sun and dwell in the deep of the forest myself i do not know them i have never seen them but my father told me these things and others that i may not repeat when he was a young man my father fled from his people   why asked rachel for the girl paused  lady i do not know i think it was because he would have been their priest or one of their priests and he feared i think that he had seen a woman a slave to them whom therefore he might not marry i think that woman was my mother so he fled from themwith her and came to live among the zulus he was a great doctor there in chakas time not one of the abangomas not one of the smellersoutofwitches not a bringerdowntodeath for like all his race he hated bloodshed no none of these things but a doctor of medicines a master of magic an interpreter of dreams a lord of wisdom yes it was his wisdom that made chaka great and when he withdrew it from him because of his cruelties then chaka died  lady dingaan rules in chakas place dingaan who slew him but although he had been chakas doctor my father was spared because they feared him i was the only child of my mother but he took other wives after the zulu fashion not because he loved them i think but that he might not seem different to other men so he grew great and rich and lived in peace because they feared him lady my father loved me and to me alone he taught his language and his wisdom i helped him with his medicines i interpreted the dreams which he could not interpret his blanket fell upon me often i was sought in marriage but i did not wish to marry wisdom is my husband  there came an evil day we knew that it must come my father and i and i wished to fly the land but he could not do so because of his other wives and children the maidens of my district were marshalled for the king to see his eye fell upon me and he thought me fair because i am different from zulu women andyou can guess yet i was saved for the other doctors and the head wives of the king said that it was not wise that i should be taken into his house i who knew too many secrets and could bewitch him if i willed or prison him with drugs that leave no trace so i escaped a while and was thankful now it came about that because he might not take me dingaan began to think much of me and to dream of me at nights at last he asked me of my father as a gift not as a right for so he thought that no ill would come with me but i prayed my father to keep me from dingaan for i hated dingaan and told him that if i were sent to the king i would poison him my father listened to me because he loved me and could not bear to part with me and said dingaan nay now dingaan grew very angry and asked counsel of his other doctors but they would give him none because they feared my father then he asked counsel of that white man hishmel who is called the lion and who is much at the kraal of umgungundhlovu  ah said rachel now i understand why he wished you to be killed  the white man hishmel the jackal in a lions skin as you named him laughed at dingaans fears he said to him it is of the father seyapi you should be afraid he has the magic not the girl kill the father and his house and take the daughter whom your heart desires and be happy  so spoke hishmel and dingaan thought his counsel good and paid him for it with the teeth of elephants and certain women for whom he asked now my father foreboded ill and i also for both of us had dreamed a dream still we did not fly until the slayers were almost at the gates because of his other wives and his children nor save for them would he have fled then or i either but would have died after the fashion of his people as he did at last  the white death queried rachel  yes lady the white death still in the end we fled thinking to gain the protection of the white men down yonder i went first to escape the kings men who had orders to take me alive and bring me to him that is why we were not together at the end lady you know the rest hishmel doubtless had seen you and thinking that the impi would kill you came to warn you then we met just as i was about to die though perhaps not by that soldiers spear as you thought i have spoken  what message came to you when you knelt down before your dead father asked rachel for the second time since on this point she was intensely curious  again that inscrutable look gathered on the girls face and she answered  did i not tell you it was for my ear alone o inkosazanayzoola i dare not say it be satisfied but this i may say your fate and mine are intertwined yours and mine and anothers for our spirits are sisters which have dwelt together in past days  indeed said rachel smiling for she who had mixed with them from her childhood knew something of the mysticism of the natives also that it was often nonsense well noie i love you i know not why perhaps for all you have suffered yet i say to you that if you wish to remain my sister in the spirit you had better separate from me in the flesh that jackal man knows your secret girl and soon or late will loose the assegai on you  doubtless she answered doubtless many things will come about but they are doomed to come about whether i go or whether i stay they will happen say you therefore lady and i will obey shall i go or shall i stay or shall i die before your eyes  it is on your own head answered rachel shrugging her shoulders  nay nay lady you forget it is on yours also seeing that if i stay i may bring peril on you and your house have you then no order for me  noie i have answeredone judge you  i will not judge let heavenabove judge lady give me a hair from your head  rachel plucked out the hair and handed it a shining thread of gold to noie who drew one from her own dark tresses and laid them side by side  see she said they are of the same length now without the wind blows gently come then to the door of the tent and i will throw these two hairs into the wind if that which is black floats first to the ground then i stay if that which is golden then i go to seek my hair is it agreed  it is agreed  so the two girls went to the entrance of the tent and noie with a swift motion tossed up the hairs as it happened one of those little eddies of wind which are common in south africa caught them causing them to rise almost perpendicularly into the air at a certain height about forty feet the supporting wind seemed to fail that is so far as the hair from noies head was concerned for there it floated high above them like a black thread in the sunlight and gently by slow degrees came to the earth just at their feet but the hair from rachels head being caught by the fringe of the whirlwind was borne upwards and onwards very swiftly until at length it vanished from their sight  it seems that i stay said noie  yes answered rachel i am very glad also if any evil comes of it we are not to blame the wind is to blame  yes lady but what makes the wind to blow  again rachel shrugged her shoulders and asked a question in her turn  whither has that hair of mine been borne noie  i do not know lady perhaps my fathers spirit took it for his own ends i think so i think it went northwards at any rate when mine fell it was snatched away was it not and yet they both floated up together i think that one day you will follow that hair of yours lady follow it to the land where great trees whisper secrets to the night    chapter vii  the message of the king   so it chanced that noie became a member of the dove household for obvious reasons she changed her name and thenceforward was called nonha also it happened that mr dove abandoned his idea of settling as a missionary in zululand and instead took up his residence at this beautiful spot he called it ramah because it was a place of weeping for here all the family and dependents of seyapi had been destroyed by the spear mrs dove thought it an illomened name enough but after her manner gave way to her husband in the matter  i think there will be more weeping here before everything is done she said  rachel answered however that it was as good as any other since names could alter nothing here then at ramah mr dove built him a house on that knoll where first he had pitched his camp it was a very good house after its fashion for as has been said he did not lack for means and was moreover clever in such matters he hired a mason who had drifted to natal to cut stone of which a plenty lay at hand and two halfbreed carpenters to execute the woodwork whilst the kaffirs thatched the whole as only they can do then he set to work upon a church which was placed on the crest of the opposite knoll where the white man ishmael had appeared on the evening of their arrival like the house it was excellent of its sort and when at length it was finished after more than a year of labour mr dove felt a proud man  indeed at ramah he was happier than he had ever been since he landed upon the shores of africa for now at length his dream seemed to be in the way of realisation very soon a considerable native village sprang up around him peopled almost entirely by remnants of the natal tribes whom chaka had destroyed and who were but too glad to settle under the aegis of the white man especially when they discovered how good he was of the doctrines which he preached to them day and night most of them it is true did not understand much still they accepted them as the price of being allowed to live in his shadow but in the vast majority of cases they sturdily refused to put away all wives but one as he earnestly exhorted them to do  at first he wished to eject them from the settlement in punishment of this sin but when it came to the point they absolutely refused to go demonstrating to him that they had as much right to live there as he had an argument that he was unable to controvert so he was obliged to submit to the presence of this abomination which he did in the hope that in time their hard hearts would be softened  continue to preach to us o shouter they said and we will listen mayhap in years to come we shall learn to think as you do meanwhile give us space to consider the point  so he continued to preach and contented himself with baptising the children and very old people who took no more wives except on this one point however they got on excellently together indeed never since chaka broke upon them like a destroying demon had these poor folk been so happy the missionary imported ploughs and taught them to improve their agriculture so that ere long this rich virgin soil brought forth abundantly their few cattle multiplied also in an amazing fashion as did their families and soon they were as prosperous as they had been in the good old days before they knew the zulu assegai especially as to their amazement the shouter never took from them even a calf or a bundle of corn by way of tax only the shadow of that zulu assegai still lay upon them for if chaka was dead dingaan ruled a few miles away across the tugela moreover hearing of the rise of this new town and of certain strange matters connected with it he sent spies to inspect and enquire the spies returned and reported that there dwelt in it only a white medicineman with his wife and a number of natal kaffirs also they reported in great detail many wonderful stories concerning the beautiful maiden with a high name who passed as the white teachers daughter and who had already become the subject of so much native talk and rumour on learning all these things dingaan despatched an embassy who delivered this message  i dingaan king of the zulus have heard that you o white shouter have built a town upon my borders and peopled it with the puppies of the jackals whom chaka hunted i send to you now to say that you and your jackals shall have peace from me so long as you harbour none of my runaways but if i find but one of them there then an impi shall wipe you out i hear also that there dwells with you a beautiful white maiden said to be your daughter who is known throughout the land as inkosazanayzoola now that is the name of our spirit who the doctors say is also white and it is strange to us that this maiden should bear that great name some of the isanusis the prophetesses declare that she is our spirit in the flesh but that meat sticks in my throat i cannot swallow it still i invite this maiden to visit me that i may see her and judge of her and i swear to you and to her by the ghosts of my ancestors that no harm shall come to her then or at any time he who so much as lays a finger upon her shall die he and all his house because of her name which i am told she has borne from a child all the territories of the zulus are her kraal and all the thousands of the zulus are her servants yea because of her high name i give to her power of life and death wherever men obey my word and for an offering i send to her twelve of my royal white cattle and a bull also an ox trained to riding when she visits me let her ride upon the white ox that she may be known but let no man come with her for among the people of the zulus she must be attended by zulus only i have spoken i pray that she who is named princess of the zulus will appear before my messengers and acknowledge the gift of the king of the zulus that they may see her in the flesh and make report of her to me  now when mr dove had received this message one evening at sundown he went into the house and repeated it to rachel for it puzzled him much and he knew not what to answer  rachel in her turn took counsel with noie who was hidden away lest some of the embassy should see and recognise her  speak with the messengers said noie it is well to have power among the zulus i who have some knowledge of this business say speak with them alone and speak softly saying that one day you will come  so having explained the matter to her father and obtained his consent rachel who desired to impress these savages threw a white shawl about her as noie instructed her to do then letting her long golden hair hang down she went out alone carrying a light assegai in her hand to the place where the messengers six of them and those who had driven the cattle from zululand were encamped in the guest kraal at the gate of which as it chanced lay a great boulder of rock on this boulder she took her stand unobserved waiting there till the full moon shone out from behind a dark cloud turning her white robe to silver now of a sudden the messengers who were seated together talking and taking snuff looked up and saw her  inkosazanayzoola exclaimed one of them rising whereon they all sprang to their feet and perceiving this beautiful and mysterious figure by a common impulse lifted their right arms and gave to her what no woman had ever received beforethe royal salute  bayète they cried bayète then stood silent  i hear you said rachel who spoke their tongue as well as she did her own it has been reported to me that you wished to see me o mouths of the king behold i am pleased to appear before you what would you of inkosazanayzoola o mouths of the king  then their spokesman an old man of high rank with a withered hand stepped forward from the line of his companions stared at her for a while and saluted again  lady he said humbly lady or spirit we would know how thou earnest by that great name of thine  it was given me as a child far away from here she answered because in a mighty tempest the lightnings turned aside and smote me not because the waters raged yet drowned me not because the lions slept with me yet harmed me not it came to me from the high heaven that was my friend i do not know how it came  we have heard the story answered the old man which indeed they had with many additions and we believe we believe that the heavens above gave thee their own name which is the name of the spirit of our people that spirit i have seen in a dream and she was like to thee o inkosazanayzoola  it may be so mouth of the king still i am woman not spirit  yet in every woman there dwells a spirit or so we believe and in thee a great one or so we have heard and believe o lady of the heavens to thee then again we repeat the words of dingaan and of his council which today we have said in the ears of him who thinks himself thy father to thee the roads are open thine are the cattle and the kraals here is an earnest of them thine are the lives of men command now if thou wilt that one of us be slain before thee and whilst thou watchest he shall look his last upon the moon  i hear you said rachel quietly but i seek the life of none who are good i thank the king for his gift i wish the king well i remember that life and death lie in my hands say these words to the king  we will say them but wilt thou not come o lady as the king desires a regiment shall meet thee on the river bank and lead thee to his house unharmed shalt thou come unharmed shalt thou return and what thou askest that shall be given thee  one day perchance i will come but not now go in peace o mouths of the king  as she spoke another dark cloud floated across the moon and when it had passed away she stood no more upon the rock then seeing that she was gone those messengers gathered up their spears and mats and returned swiftly to zululand  when she readied the house again rachel told her father and mother all that had passed laughing as she spoke   it seems scarcely right my dear said mr dove when she had done those benighted heathens will really believe that you are something unearthly  then let them she answered it can do no one any harm and the power of life and death with the rest of it unless it was all talk as i suspect might be very useful one day who knows and now the princess of the heavens will go and set the supper as noiei beg pardon nonhais off duty for the present  afterwards she asked noie who was the old man with a withered hand who had spoken as the kings mouth  mopo is his name mopo or umbopo none other o zoola she answered it was he who stabbed tchaka the black one it is said also that alone among men living he has seen the white spirit the inkosazana thrice he has seen her or so goes the tale that my father who knew everything told to me that is why dingaan sent him here to make report of you and she told her all the wonderful story of mopo and of the death of tchaka which rachel treasured in her mind footnote for the history of mopo see nada the lilyauthor  such was rachels first introduction to the zulus an occasion on which her undoubted histrionic abilities stood her in good stead  this matter of the embassy happened and in due course was almost forgotten that is until a certain event occurred which brought it into mind for some time however rachel thought of it a good deal wondering how it came about that her native name and the strange significance which they appeared to give to it had taken such a hold of the imagination of the zulus ultimately she discovered that the white man ishmael was the chief cause of these things he had lived so long among savages that he had caught something of their mind and dark superstitions to him as to them it seemed a marvellous thing that she should have acquired the title of the legendary spirit of the zulu people the calm courage too so unusual in a woman which she showed when she shot the warrior and at the risk of her own life saved that of the girl noie impressed him as something almost ultrahuman especially when he remembered his own conduct on that occasion all of this story of course he did not tell to the zulus for he feared lest they should take vengeance for his share in it but of rachel he discoursed to the king and his indunas or great men as a white witchdoctoress of supernatural power whose name showed that she was mixed up with the fortunes of the race therefore in the end dingaan sent mopo he who knew the spirit to make report of her  when he was not absent upon his hunting or trading expeditions ishmael visited ramah a great deal and as rachel soon discovered not without an object indeed almost from the first her feminine instincts led her to suspect that this man who notwithstanding his good looks repelled her so intensely was falling in love with her which in truth he had done once and for all at their first meeting in the beginning he did not it is true say much that could be so interpreted but his whole attitude towards her suggested it as did other things for instance when he came to visit the doves he discarded his garments of hide including the picturesque zebraskin trousers and appeared dressed in smart european clothes which he had contrived to obtain from durban and a large hat with a white ostrich feather that struck rachel as even more ludicrous than the famous trousers also he was continuously sending presents of game and of skins or of rare karosses that is fur rugs which he ordered to be delivered to her personallytokens all of them that she could not misunderstand her father however misunderstood them persistently although her mother saw something of the truth and did her best to shield her from attentions which she knew to be unwelcome mr dove believed that it was his company which ishmael sought indeed in this matter the man was very clever contriving to give the clergyman the impression that he required spiritual instruction and comfort which of course he found forthcoming in an abundant supply when mrs dove remonstrated saying that she misdoubted her of him and his character her husband answered obstinately that it was his duty to turn a sinner from his way and declined to pursue the conversation so ishmael continued to come  for her part rachel did her best to avoid him instructing noie to keep a constant lookout both with her eyes and through the kaffirs and to warn her of his advent then she would slip away into the bush or down to the seashore and remain there till he was gone or if he came when she could not do so in the evening for instance would keep noie at her side and on the first opportunity retire to her own room  now the result of this method of selfprotection was to cause ishmael to hate noie as bitterly as she hated him he guessed that the girl knew the dreadful truth about him that it was he and no other who had counselled dingaan to kill her father and all his family and take her by force into his house and although she said nothing of it he suspected that she had told everything to rachel moreover it was she who always thwarted him who prevented him time upon time from having a single word alone with her mistress therefore he determined to be revenged upon noie whenever an opportunity occurred   but as yet he could find none since if he were to tell the zulus that she still lived and cause her to be killed or taken away he was sure that it would mean a final breach with the dove family all of whom had learned to love this beautiful orphan maid so he nursed his rage in secret  meanwhile his passion increased daily burning ever more fiercely for its continued repression until at length the chance for which he had waited so long came to him  having become aware of rachels habit of slipping away whenever he appeared he showed himself on horseback at a little distance then waited a while and instead of going up to the mission station rode round it and hid in some bush whence he could command a view of the surrounding country presently he saw rachel who was alone for she had not waited to call noie hurrying towards the seashore along the edge of that kloof down which ran the stream where the crocodiles lived presently when she had gone too far to return to the house if she caught sight of him he followed after her and leaving his horse at last came up with her seated on a rock by the pool in which she had bathed on the morning of the massacre  walking softly in his veldschoens or shoes made of raw hide on the sand rachel knew nothing of his coming until his shadow fell upon her then she sprang up and saw him smiling and bowing the ostrichplume hat in his hand her first impulse was to run away but recovering herself she nodded in a friendly fashion and bade him good day adding  what are you doing here mr ishmael hunting  yes he answered thats it hunting you it has been a long chase but i have caught you at last  really i am not a wild creature mr ishmael she said indignantly  no he answered you are more beautiful and more dangerous than any wild creature  rachel looked at him then she made as though she would pass him saying that she was going home now ishmael stood between two rocks filling the only egress from this place  he stretched out his arms so that his fingers touched the rocks on either side and said  you cant you must listen to me first i came here to say what i have wanted to tell you for a long time i love you and i ask you to marry me  indeed she replied setting her face how can that be i understood that you were already marriedseveral times over  who told you that he asked angrily i knowthat accursed little witch noie   dont speak any ill of noie please she is my friend  then you have a liar for your friend those women are only my servants  it doesnt matter to me what they are mr ishmael i have no wish to know your private affairs shall we stop this talk which is not pleasant  no he answered i tell you that i love you and i mean to marry you with your will or without it let it be with your will rachel he added pleadingly for i will make you a good husband also i am wellborn much better than you think and i am rich rich enough to take you out of this country if you like i have thousands of cattle and a great deal of money put by good english gold that i have got from the sale of ivory you shall come with me from among all these savage people back to england and live as you like  thank you but i prefer the savages as you seem to have done until now no do not try to touch me you know that i can defend myself if i choose and she glanced at the pistol which she always carried in that wild land i am not afraid of you mr ishmael it is you who are afraid of me  perhaps i am he exclaimed because those zulus are right you are tagati an enchantress not like other women white or black if it were not so would you have driven me mad as you have done i tell you i cant sleep for thinking of you oh rachel rachel dont be angry with me have pity on me give me some hope i know that my life has been rough in the past but i will become good again for your sake and live like a christian but if you refuse me if you send me back to hellthen you shall learn what i can be  i know what you are mr ishmael and that is quite enough i do not wish to be unkind or to say anything that will pain you but please go away and never try to speak to me again like this as it is quite useless you must understand that i will never marry you never  are you in love with somebody else he asked hoarsely and at the question do what she would to prevent it rachel coloured a little  how can i be in love here unless it were with a dream  a dream a dream of a man you mean well dont let him cross my path or it will soon be the dream of a ghost i tell you id kill him if i cant have you no one else shall do you understand  i understand that i am tired of this let me go home please  home soon you will have no home to go to except minethat is if you dont change your mind about me i have power heredont you understand i have power  as he spoke these words the man looked so evil that rachel shivered a little but she answered boldly enough  i understand that you have no power at all against me no one has it is i who have the power  yes because as i said you are tagati but there are others  as these words passed his lips someone slipped by him starting back he saw that it was noie draped in her usual white robe for nothing would induce her to wear european clothes passing him as though she saw him not she went to rachel and said  inkosazana i was at my work in the house yonder and i thought that i heard you calling me down here by the seashore so i came is it your pleasure that i should accompany you home  for instance he went on furiously there is that black slut whom you are fond of well if i cant hurt you i can hurt her daughter of seyapi you know how runaways die in zululand or if you dont you shall soon learn i will pay you back for all your tricks and he stopped choking with rage  noie looked him up and down with her soft dreamy brown eyes  do you think so nightprowler she asked do you think that what you did to the father and his house you will do to the daughter also well it is strange but last night just before the cock crew i sat by seyapis grave and he spoke to me of you white man listen now and i will tell you what he said and stepping forward she whispered in his ear  rachel watching saw the mans swarthy face turn pale as he hearkened then he lifted his hand as though to strike her let it fall again and muttering curses in english and in zulu turned and walked or rather staggered away  what did you tell him noie asked rachel  never mind zoola she answered perhaps the truth perhaps what came into my mind at any rate i frightened him away he was making love to you was he not the low silwana wild beast ah i thought so for that he has wished to do for long and he threatened did he not well you are right he cannot hurt you at all and me only a little i think but he is very dangerous and very strong and can hurt others if your father is wise he will leave this place zoola  i think so too answered rachel let us go home and tell him so    chapter viii  mr dove visits ishmael   when rachel and noie reached the house which they did not do for some time as they waited to make sure that ishmael had really gone it was to see the man himself riding away from its gate  be prepared said noie i think that he has been here before us to pour poison into your fathers ears  so it proved to be indeed for on the stoep or verandah they found mr dove walking up and down evidently much disturbed in mind  what is all this trouble rachel he asked what have you done to mr smithfor mr dove in pursuance of the suggestion made by the man had adopted that name for him which he considered less peculiar than ishmael he has been here much upset declaring that you have used him cruelly and that nonha threatened him with terrible things in the future of which of course she can know nothing  well father if you wish to hear answered rachel mr ishmael or mr smith as you call him has been asking me to marry him and when i refused as of course i did behaved very unpleasantly  indeed rachel i gathered from him that something of the sort had happened only his story is that it was you who behaved unpleasantly speaking to him as though he were dirt now rachel of course i do not want you to marry this person in fact i should dislike it although i have seen a great change for the better in him latelyi mean spiritually of courseand an earnest repentance for the errors of his past life all i mean is that the proffered affection of an honest man should not be met with scorn and sharp words  up to this point rachel endured the lecture in silence but now she could bear no more  honest man she exclaimed father are you deaf and blind or only so good yourself that you cannot see evil in others do you know that it was this honest man who brought about the murder of all noies people in order that he might curry favour with the zulus  mr dove started and turning asked  is that so nonha  it is so teacher answered noie although i have never spoken of it to you afterwards i will tell you the story if you wish  and do you know went on rachel why he will never let you visit his kraal among the hills yonder well i will tell you it is because this honest man who wishes me to marry him keeps his kaffir wives and children there  rachel replied her father in much distress i will never believe it you are only repeating native scandal why he has often spoken to me with horror of such things  i daresay he has father well now i ask you to judge for yourself take a guide and start two hours before daybreak tomorrow morning to visit that kraal and see if what i say is not true  i will indeed exclaimed mr dove who was now thoroughly aroused for it was conduct of this sort that had caused his bitter quarrel with the first settlers in natal i cannot believe the story rachel i really cannot but i promise you that if i should find cause to do so the man shall never put foot in my house again  then i think that i am rid of him said rachel with a sigh of relief only be careful dear that he does not do you a mischief for such men do not like to be found out then she left the stoep and went to tell her mother all that had happened  when she had heard the story mrs dove who detested ishmael as much as her daughter did tried to persuade her husband not to visit his kraal saying that it would only breed a feud and that under the circumstances it would be easy to forbid him the house upon other grounds but mr dove obstinate as usual refused to listen to her saying that he would not judge the man without evidence and that of the natives could not be relied on also if the tale were true it was his duty as his spiritual adviser to remonstrate with him  so his poor wife gave up arguing as she always did and long before dawn on the following morning mr dove accompanied by two guides departed upon his errand  after he had ridden some twelve miles across the plain which lay behind ramah just at daybreak he reached a pass or nek between two swelling hills beyond which the guides said lay the kraal that was called mafooti presently he saw it a place situated in a cuplike valley chosen evidently because the approaches to it were easy to defend on a knoll in the centre of this rich valley stood the kraal a small native town surrounded by walls and stone enclosures full of cattle as they approached the kraal from its main entrance issued four or five goodlooking native women one of them accompanied by a boy and all carrying hoes in their hands for they were going out at sunrise to work in the mealie fields when they saw mr dove they stood still staring at him till he called to them not to be afraid and riding up asked them who they were  we are of the number of the wives of ibubesi the lion answered their spokeswoman who held the little boy by the hand  do you mean the umlungu that is the white man ishmael he asked again  whom else should we mean she answered i am his head wife now that he has put away old mami and this is his son if the light were stronger you would see that he is almost white she added with pride  mr dove knew not what to answer this intelligence overwhelmed him and he sat silent on his horse the wives of ishmael prepared to pass on to the mealie fields then stopped and began to whisper together at length the mother of the boy turned and addressed him while the others crowded behind her to listen  we desire to ask you a question teacher she said somewhat shyly for evidently they knew well enough who he was is it true that we are to have a new sister  a new sister what do you mean asked mr dove  we mean teacher she replied smiling that we have heard that ibubesi is courting the beautiful zoola the daughter of your head wife and we thought that perhaps you had come to arrange about the cattle that he must pay for her doubtless if she is so fair it will be a whole herd  this was too much even for mr dove  how dare you talk so you heathen hussies he gasped where is the white man  teacher she replied with indignation and drawing herself up why do you call us bad names we are respectable women the wives of one husband as respectable as your own although not so numerous or so we hear from ibubesi if you desire to see him he is in the big hut yonder with our youngest sister she whom he married last month we wish you good day as we go to hoe our lords fields and we hope that when she comes the inkosazana your daughter will not be as rude as you are for if so how shall we love her as we wish to do then wrapping her blanket round her with a dignified air the offended lady stalked off followed by her various sisters  as for mr dove who for once in his life was in a towering rage he cut his horse viciously with the sjambok or hippopotamushide whip which he carried and followed by his guides galloped forward to a big hut in the centre of the kraal  apparently ishmael heard the sound of his horses hoofs for as the missionary was dismounting he crawled out of the beehole of the hut upon his hands and knees as a kaffir does followed by a young woman in the lightest of attire who was yawning as though she had just been aroused from sleep what is more except for the colour of his skin he was a kaffir and nothing else for his costume consisted of a skin moocha such as the natives wear and a fur kaross thrown over his shoulders straightening himself ishmael saw for the first time who was his visitor his jaw dropped and he uttered an ejaculation that need not be recorded then stood silent mr dove was silent also for his wrath would not allow him to speak  how do you do sir ishmael jerked out at last you are an early visitor and find me somewhat unprepared if i had known that you were coming i wouldthen suddenly he remembered his attire or the lack of it also his companion who was leaning on his shoulder and peeping at the white man over it drawing the kaross tightly about him he gave the poor girl a backward kick and with a kaffir oath bade her begone then went on hurriedly i am afraid my dress is not quite what you are accustomed to but among these poor heathens i find it necessary to conform more or less to their ways in order to gain their confidence andumaffection will you come into the hut my servant there will get you some tywala kaffir beeri mean some amasi curdled milk at once and i will have a calf killed for breakfast  mr dove could bear it no longer  ishmael or smith or ibubesiwhichever name you may prefer he broke out do not lie to me about your servant for now i know all the truth which i refused to believe when my daughter and nonha told it me you are a blackhearted villain but yesterday you dared to come and ask rachel to marry you and now i find that you are livingoh i cannot say it it makes me ashamed of my race listen to me sir if ever you dare to set foot in ramah again or to speak to my wife and daughter the kaffirs shall whip you off the place indeed he added shaking his sjambok in ishmaels face although i am an older man than you are were it not for my office i would give you the thrashing you deserve  at first ishmael had shrunk beneath this torrent of invective but the threat of violence roused his fierce nature his face grew evil and his long black hair and beard bristled with wrath  you had best get out of this you prayersnuffling old humbug he said savagely for if you stop much longer i will make you sing another tune we have seacow whips here too and you shall learn what a hiding means such a hiding that your own family wont know you if you live to get back to them look here i offered to marry your daughter on the square and i meant what i said id have got rid of all this black baggage and she should have been the only one well ill marry her yet only now shell just take her place with the others we are all one flesh and blood black and white aint we i have often heard you preach it so what will she have to complain of he sneered she can go and hoe mealies like the rest  as this brutal talk fell upon his ears mr doves reason departed from him entirely after all he was an english gentleman first and a clergyman afterwards also he loved his daughter and to hear her spoken of like this was intolerable to him as it would have been to any father lifting the sjambok he cut ishmael across the mouth so sharply that the blood came from his lips then suddenly remembering that this deed would probably mean his death stood still awaiting the issue as it chanced it did not for the man like most brutes and bullies was a coward as rachel had already found out obeying his first impulse he sprang at the clergyman with an oath then seeing that his two guides who carried assegais had ranged themselves beside him checked himself for he feared lest those spears should pierce his heart  you are in my house he said wiping the blood from his beard and an old man so i cant kill you as i would anyone else but you have made me your enemy now you fool and others can i have protected you so far for your daughters sake but i wont do it any longer you think of that when your time comes  my time like yours will come when god wills answered mr dove unflinchingly not when you or anyone else wills i do not fear you in the least still i am sorry that i struck you it was a sin of which i repent as i pray that you may repent  then he mounted his horse and rode away from the kraal mafooti                                       when mr dove reached ramah he only said to rachel that what she had heard was quite true and that he had forbidden ishmael the house of course however noie soon learnt the whole story from the kaffir guides and repeated it to her mistress to his wife on the other hand he told everything with the result that she was very much disturbed she pointed out to him that this white outcast was a most dangerous man who would certainly be revenged upon them in one way or another again she implored him as she had often done before to leave these savage countries wherein he had laboured for all the best years of his life saying that it was not right that he should expose their daughter to the risks of them  but answered her husband you have often told me that you were sure no harm would come to rachel and i think that too  yes dear i am sure still for many reasons it does not seem right to keep her here she did not add poor unselfish woman that there was another who should be considered as well as rachel  how can i go away he went on excitedly just when all the seed that i have sown is ripening to harvest if i did so my work would be utterly lost and my people relapse into barbarism again i am not afraid of this man or of anything that he can do to my body but if i ran away from him it would be injuring my soul and what account should i give of my cowardice when my time comes do you go my love and take rachel with you if you wish leaving me to finish my work alone  but now as before mrs dove would not go and rachel when she was asked shrugged her shoulders and answered laughing that she was not afraid of anybody or anything and except for her mothers sake did not care whether she went or stayed certainly she would not leave her nor she added did she wish to say goodbye to africa  when she was asked why she replied vaguely that she had grown up there and it was her home but her mother watching her knew well enough that she had another reason although no word of it every passed her lips in africa she had met richard darrien as a child and in africa and nowhere else she believed she would meet him again as a woman  the weeks and months went by bringing to the ramah household no sight or tidings of the white man ishmael they heard through the kaffirs indeed that although he still kept his kraal at mafooti he himself had gone away on some trading journey far to the north and did not expect to return for a year news at which everyone rejoiced except noie who shook her wise little head and said nothing  so all fear of the man gradually died away and things were very peaceful and prosperous at ramah  in fact this quiet proved to be but the lull before the storm  one day about eight months after mr dove had visited the kraal mafooti another embassy came to rachel from the zulu king dingaan bringing with it a present of more white cattle she received them as she had done before at night and alone for they refused to speak to her in the presence of other people  in substance their petition was the same that it had been before namely that she would visit zululand as the king and his indunas desired her counsel upon an important matter when asked what this matter was they either were or pretended to be ignorant saying that it had not been confided to them thereon she said that if dingaan chose to submit the question to her by messenger she would give him her opinion on it but that she could not come to his kraal they asked why seeing that the whole nation would guard her and no hair of her head be harmed  because i am a child in the house of my people and they will not allow me to leave even for a day she answered thinking that this reply would appeal to a race who believe absolutely in obedience to parents and every established authority  is it so remarked the old induna who spoke as dingaans mouthnot mopo but another now how can the inkosazanayzoola before whom a whole nation will bow be in bonds to a white umfundusi a mere skydoctor shall the wide heavens obey a cloud  if they are bred of that cloud retorted rachel  the heavens breed the cloud not the cloud the heavens answered the induna aptly  now it occurred to rachel that this thing was going further than it should to be set up as a kind of guardian spirit to the zulus had seemed a very good joke and naturally appealed to the love of power which is common to women but when it involved at any rate in the eyes of that people dominion over her own parents the joke was she felt becoming serious so she determined suddenly to bring it to an end  what mean you messenger of the king she asked i am but the child of my parents and the parents are greater than the child and must be obeyed of her  inkosazana answered the old man with a deprecatory smile if it pleases you to tell us such tales our ears must listen as if it pleased you to order us to be killed we must be killed but learn that we know the truth we know how as a child you came down from above in the lightning and how these white people with whom you dwell found you lying in the mist on the mountain top and took you to their home in place of a babe whom they had buried   who told you that story asked rachel amazed  it was revealed to the council of the doctors lady  then that was revealed which is not true i was born as other women are and my name of lady of the heavens came to me by chance as by chance i resemble the spirit of your people  we hear you answered the mouth politely you were born as other women are by chance you had your high name by chance you are tall and fair and goldenhaired like the spirit of our people we hear you  then rachel gave it up  bear my words to the king she said and they rose saluted her with a bayète that royal salute which never before had been given to woman and departed  when they had gone rachel went into supper and told her parents all the story mr dove now that she seemed to take a serious view of the matter affected to treat it as absurd although when she had laughed his attitude it may be remembered was different he talked of the silly zulu superstitions showed how they had twisted up the story of the death of her baby brother and her escape from the flood in the umtavuna river into that which they had narrated to her he even suggested that the whole thing was nonsense part of some political move to enable the king or a party in the state to declare that they had with them the word of their traditional spirit and oracle  mrs dove however who that night was strangely depressed and uneasy thought far otherwise she pointed out that they were playing with vast and cruel forces and that whatever these people exactly believed about rachel it was a dreadful thing for a girl to be put in a position in which the lives of hundreds might hang upon her nod  yes and she added hysterically perhaps our own lives alsoperhaps our own lives also  to change the conversation which was growing painful rachel asked if anyone had seen noie her father answered that two hours ago just before the embassy arrived he had met her going down to the banks of the stream as he supposed to gather flowers for the table then he began to talk about the girl saying what a sweet creature she was and how strange it seemed to him that although she appeared to accept all the doctrines of the christian faith as yet she had never consented to be baptised  it was while he was speaking thus that rachel suddenly observed her mother fall forward so that her body rested on the table as though a kind of fit had seized her rachel sprang towards her but before she reached her she appeared to have quite recovered only her face looked very white   what on earth is the matter mother  oh dont ask me she answered a terrible thing a sort of fancy that came to me from talking about those zulus i thought i saw this place all red with blood and tongues of fire licking it up it went as quickly as it came and of course i know that it is nonsense    chapter ix  the taking of noie   presently mrs dove who seemed to have quite recovered from her curious seizure went to bed  i dont like it father said rachel when the door had closed behind her of course it is contrary to experience and all that but i believe that mother is foresighted  nonsense dear nonsense said her father it is her scotch superstition that is all we have been married for fiveandtwenty years now and i have heard this sort of thing again and again but although we have lived in wild places where anything might happen to us nothing out of the way ever has happened in fact we have always been most mercifully preserved  thats true father still i am not sure perhaps because i am rather that way myself sometimes thus i know that she is right about me no harm will happen to me at least no permanent harm i feel that i shall live out my life as i feel something else  what else rachel  do you remember the lad richard darrien she asked colouring a little  what the boy who was with you that night on the island yes i remember him although i have not thought of him for years  well i feel that i shall see him again  mr dove laughed is that all he said if he is still alive and in africa it wouldnt be very wonderful if you did would it and at any rate of course you will one day when we all cease to be alive really he added with irritation there are enough bothers in life without rubbish of this kind which comes from living among savages and absorbing their ideas i am beginning to think that i shall have to give way and leave africa though it will break my heart just when after all the striving my efforts are being crowned with success   i have always told you father that i dont want to leave africa still there is mother to be considered her health is not what it was  well he said impatiently i will talk to her and weigh the thing perhaps i shall receive guidance though for my part i cannot see what it matters weve got to die some time and if necessary i prefer that it should be while doing my duty take no thought for the morrow sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof has always been my motto who am content with what it pleases providence to send me  then rachel seeing no use in continuing the conversation bade him goodnight and went to look for noie only to discover that she was not in the house this disturbed her very much although it occurred to her that she might possibly be with friends in the village hiding till she was sure the zulu embassy had gone so she went to bed without troubling her father  at daybreak next morning she rose not having slept very well and went out to look for the girl without success for no one had heard or seen anything of her as she was returning to the house however she met a solitary zulu a dignified middleaged man whom she thought she recognised as one of the embassy although of this she could not be sure as she had only seen these people in the moonlight the man who was quite unarmed except for a kerry which he carried crouched down on catching sight of heir in token of respect as she approached he rose and gave her the royal salute then she was sure  speak she said  inkosazana he answered humbly be not angry with me i am tamboosa one of the kings indunas you saw me with the others last night  i saw you  inkosazana there has been dwelling with you one noie the daughter of seyapi the wizard who with all his house was slain at this place by order of the king she also should have been slain but we have learned that you called down lightning from heaven and that with it you slew the soldier who had run her down slew him and burned him up as you had the right to do and took the girl to be your slave as you had the right to do  speak on said rachel showing none of the surprise which she felt  inkosazana we know that you have come to love this girl therefore yesterday before we spoke with you we seized her as we were commanded and hid her away awaiting your answer to our message had you consented to visit the king at his great place we would have let her go but as you did not consent my companions have taken her to the king  an ill deed what more tamboosa  this the king says by my mouthlet the inkosazana come and command and her servant noie shall go free and unharmed for is she not a dog in her hut but if she comes not and at once then the girl dies  how know i that this tale is true tamboosa asked rachel controlling herself with an effort for she loved noie dearly  the man turned towards some bushes that grew at a distance of about twenty paces and cried come hither  thereon from among the bushes where she lay hidden rose a little maid of about fourteen whom rachel knew well as a girl that noie often took with her to carry baskets and other things  tell now the tale of the taking of noie and deliver the message that she gave to you commanded tamboosa  thereon the trembling child began and after the native fashion suppressing no detail or circumstance however small narrated how the zulus had surprised her and noie while they were gathering flowers and having bound their arms had caused them to be hurried away unseen to some dense bush about four miles off here they had been kept hidden till in the night the embassy returned then they had spoken with noie who in the end called her and gave her a message this was the message say to the inkosazana that the zulus have caught me and are taking me to dingaan the king say that they declare that if she is pleased to come and speak the word i shall be set free unharmed that is if she comes at once but if she does not come then i shall be killed say to her that i do not ask that she should come who am ready to die and that though i believe that no harm will happen to her in zululand i think that she had better not come say that living or dead i love her  then the maid described how the embassy went on with noie leaving her in the charge of the man tamboosa who at the first break of dawn brought her back to ramah and made her hide in the bush  now rachel had no more doubts clearly the tale was true and the question waswhat must be done she thought a while then bade tamboosa and the child to follow her to the missionhouse on the stoep she found her father and mother sitting in the sun and drinking coffee after the south african fashion  what is it asked mr dove looking at the man anxiously  rachel ordered him to repeat his story and this he did addressing rachel alone for of her father and mother he would take no notice when he had done the child told her tale also  go now and wait without said rachel when it was finished  inkosazana i go answered the man but if it pleases you to save your servant know that you must come swiftly if you are not across the tugela by sunset this night word will be passed to the king and she dies at once know also that you must come alone with me for if any white or black accompany you they will be killed  now said rachel when the three of them were left alone now what is to be done  mrs dove shook her head helplessly and looked at her husband who broke into a tirade against the zulus their superstitions cruelties customs and everything that was theirs and ended by declaring that it was of course utterly impossible that rachel should go upon such a mad errand and thus place herself in the power of savages  but father she said when he had done do you understand that you are pronouncing noies death sentence if you were in my place would you not go  of course i would in fact i propose to do so as it is no doubt dingaan will listen to me  you mean that dingaan will kill you did you not hear what that man tamboosa said father you must not go  no john broke in mrs dove rachel is right you must not go for you would never come back again also how can you be so cruel as to think of leaving me here alone  then i suppose that we must abandon that poor girl to her fate exclaimed mr dove  how can you suppose anything so merciless father when it is in my power to save her asked rachel if i let those horrible zulus kill her i shall never be happy again all my life  and what if the horrible zulus kill you  they will not kill me father mother knows they will not and so do i but as they have got this madness into their heads i am sure that if i do not go they will send an impi here to kill everybody else and take me prisoner the kidnapping of noie is only a first move it is one of two things either i must visit zululand save noie and play my part there as best i can or we must desert noie and all leave this place at once tomorrow if possible but then as i told you i shall never forgive myself especially as i am not in the least afraid of the zulus   it is true that god can protect you as much in zululand as he can here replied mr dove beginning to weaken in face of this desperate alternative  of course father but if i go to zululand i want you and mother to trek to durban and remain there till i return  why rachel it is absurd  because i do not think that you are safe here and it is not at all absurd she answered stubbornly these people choose to believe that i am in some way in bondage to you you remember all their talk about the heavens and the cloud of course it may mean nothing but you will be much better in durban for a while where you can take to the water if necessary  now mr doves obstinacy asserted itself he refused to entertain any such idea giving reason after reason why he should not do so thus for another half hour the argument raged till at length a compromise was arrived at as usual in such cases not of too satisfactory an order rachel was to be allowed to undertake her mission on behalf of noie and her parents were to remain at ramah on her return which they hoped would be within a week or eight days the question of the abandonment of the mission was to be settled by the help of the experience she had gained to this arrangement then they agreed reluctantly enough all of them in order to save noies life and for no other reason  the momentous decision once taken in half an hour rachel was ready for her journey which she determined she would make upon her own horse a grey mare that she had ridden for a long while and could rely on in every way the white ridingox that dingaan had sent as a present was also to accompany her to carry her spare garments and other articles packed in skin bags such as coffee sugar and a few medicines and to serve as a remount in case anything should happen to the horse when it was laden rachel sent for the zulu tamboosa and pointing to the ox said  i come to visit dingaan the king and to claim my servant lead the beast on i will overtake you presently  the man saluted and began to bonga that is to give her titles of praise but she cut him short with a wave of her hand and he departed leading the ox  now while mr dove saw to the saddling of the horses for he was to ride with her as far as the tugela rachel went to bid farewell to her mother she found her by herself in the sittingroom seated at an open window and looking out sadly towards the sea   i am quite ready dear she said in a cheerful voice dont look so sad i shall be back again in a week with noie  yes answered mrs dove i think that you and noie will come back safely but and she paused  but what mother  oh i dont know i am very much oppressed my heart is heavy in me i hate parting with you rachel remember we have never been separated since you were born  her daughter looked at her and was filled with grief and compunction  mother she said if you feel like thatwell i love noie but after all you are more to me than noie and if you wish i will give up this business and stop with you it is very terrible but it cant be helped noie will understand poor thing and her eyes filled with tears at the thought of the girls dreadful fate  no rachel somehow i think it best that you should go not only for noies sake but for your own if your father would leave here today or tomorrow as you suggested it might be otherwise but he wont do that so it is no use talking of it let us hope for the best  as you wish mother  now dear kiss me and go i hear your father calling you and rachel if we should not meet again in this world i know you wont forget me or that there is another where we shall i did not want to frighten you with my fancies which come from my not being well goodbye my love goodbye god be with you and make you happy alwaysalways  then rachel kissed her in silence for she could not trust herself to speak and turning left the room whence her mother watched her go also in silence in another minute she was mounted and accompanied by her father riding on the road along which tamboosa had led the white ox  presently they overtook him whereon he stopped and looking at mr dove said  inkosazana the kings orders are that none should accompany you into zululand  be silent answered rachel proudly he rides with me as far as the river bank  then they went on and rachel was relieved to find that whatever might have been her mothers mood that of her father was fairly cheerful indeed his mind was so occupied with the details and object of her journey that he quite forgot its dangers  two hours steady riding brought them to the ford of the tugela river across which lay zululand on the hills beyond it they could see a number of kaffirs watching who on catching sight of rachel ran down to the river and entered it shouting and beating the water with their sticks as she guessed to scare away any crocodiles that might be lurking there  now that the moment of separation had come mr dove grew loth to part with his daughter and again suggested to tamboosa that he should accompany her to dingaans great place  if you set a foot across that river praying man answered the induna grimly you shall die look there are the spears that will kill you  as he spoke he pointed to the crest of the opposing hill over which running swiftly in ordered companies now appeared a zulu regiment who carried large white shields and wore white plumes rising from their head rings  it is the escort of the inkosazana he added do you think that she can take hurt among so many and do you think if you dare to disobey the words of dingaan that you can escape so many go back new lest they should come over and kill you where you are  then seeing that both argument and resistance were useless and that tamboosa would brook no delay mr dove hurriedly embraced his daughter in farewell indeed rachel was glad that there was no time for words for this parting was more terrible to her than she cared to own and she feared lest she should break down before the zulu who was watching her and thereby be lowered in his eyes and in those of his people  it was over and done she had entered the water riding her grey mare while tamboosa led the white ox at her side presently she looked back and saw her father kneeling in prayer upon the bank  what does the man asked tamboosa uneasily is he bewitching us  nay she answered he prays to the heavens for us  on they went between the two lines of natives who ceased their beating of the water and were silent as she passed the river was shallow and they crossed it with ease by now the regiment was gathered on its further bank two thousand men or more brought hither to do honour to this white girl in whom they chose to consider that the guardian spirit of their people was incarnate contemplating them rachel wondered how it came about that they should be thus prepared for her advent the answer rose in her mind if she had refused to visit zululand it was their mission to fetch her it was wise therefore that she had come of her own will  forward she rode a striking figure in her long white cloak down which her bright hair hung sitting very proud and upright on her horse without a sign of doubt or fear as she approached the captains of the regiment ran forward to meet her with lifted shield and crouching bodies  hail cried their leader in the name of the great elephant of dingaan the king hail to thee princess of the heavens holder of the spirit of nomkubulwana  rachel rode on taking no notice marvelling who nomkubulwana whose spirit she was supposed to enshrine might be afterwards she discovered that it was only another name for the inkosazanayzoola that mysterious white ghost believed by this people to control their destinies with whom it had pleased them to identify her as her horse left the wide river and set foot upon dry land every man of the two thousand soldiers who were watching as it seemed to her with wonder and awe began to beat his oxhide shield with the handle of his spear they beat very softly at first producing a sound like the distant murmur of the sea then harder and harder till its volume grew to a mighty roar impossible to describe a sound like the sound of thunder that echoed along the water and from hill to hill the mighty noise sank and died away as it had begun and for a moment there was silence then at some signal every spear flashed aloft in the sunlight and from every throat came the royal salutebayète it was a tremendous and most imposing welcome so tremendous that rachel could no longer doubt that this people regarded her as a being apart and above the other white folk whom they knew  at the time however she had little space for such thoughts since the mare she rode terrified by the tumult bucked and shied so violently that she could scarcely keep her seat she was a good rider which was fortunate for her since had she been ignominiously thrown upon such an occasion her prestige must have suffered if indeed it were not destroyed as it proved it was greatly enhanced by this accident many of the zulus of that day had never even seen a horse which was considered by all of them to be a dangerous if not a magical beast that a woman could remain seated on such a wild animal when it sprang into the air and swerved from side to side struck them therefore as something marvellous and out of experience a proof indeed that she was not as others are  she quieted the mare and rode on between the whiteshielded ranks who their greeting finished remained absolutely still like bronze statues watching her with wondering eyes when at length they were passed the captains and a guard of about fifty men ran ahead of her   then she came and after her tamboosa leading the white ox followed by another guard which in turn was followed by the entire regiment thus royally escorted asking no questions and speaking no word did rachel make her entry into zululand only in her heart she wondered whither she was going and how that strange journey would end wondered too how it would fare with her father and her mother till she returned to them  well might she wonder  when she had ridden thus for about two hours an incident occurred which showed her how great and indeed how dreadful was the eminence on which she had been set among these people suddenly some cattle frightened by the approach of the impi rushed through it towards their kraal and a bull that was with them seeing this unaccustomed apparition of a white woman mounted on a strange animal put down its head and charged her furiously she saw it coming and by pulling the mare on to its haunches avoided its rush now at the time she was riding on a path which ran along the edge of a little rockstrewn donga not more than eight or ten feet deep but steepsided into this donga the bull which had shut its eyes to charge after the fashion of its kind plunged headlong and as it chanced struck its horns against a stone twisting and dislocating the neck so that it lay there still and dead  when the zulus saw what had happened they uttered a longdrawn oww of amazement for had not the beast dared to attack the white spirit and had not the spirit rewarded it with instant death then a captain made a motion with his hand and instantly men sprang upon the remaining cattle four or five of them that were following the bull and despatched them with assegais before rachel could interfere they were pierced with a hundred wounds now there was a little pause while the carcases of the beasts were dragged out of her path and the bloodstains covered from her eyes with fresh earth just as this task was finished there appeared scrambling up the denga and followed by some men a fat and hideouslooking woman with fish bladders in her hair and snakeskins tied about her who from her costume rachel knew at once must be an isanuzi or witchdoctoress evidently she was in a fury as might be seen by the workings of her face and the extraordinary swiftness with which she moved notwithstanding her years and bulk  who has dared to kill my cattle she screamed is it thou whom men name nomkubulwana  woman answered rachel quietly the heavens killed the bull which would have hurt me for the rest ask of the captains of the king   the witchdoctoress glanced at the dead bull which lay in the donga its head twisted up in an unnatural fashion at right angles to the body and for a moment seemed afraid then her rage at the loss of her herd broke out afresh for she was a person in authority one accustomed to be feared because of her black arts and her office  when the inkosazana is seen in zululand she gasped death walks with her there is the token of it and she pointed to the dead cattle so it has ever been and so shall it ever be red is thy road through life white one go back go back now to thine own kraal and see whether or no my words are true and springing at the horse she seized it by the bridle as though she would drag it round  now in her hand rachel held a little rod of white rhinoceros horn which she used as a riding whip and with this rod she pointed at the woman meaning that some of those with her should cause her to loose the bridle too late she remembered that in this savage land such a motion when made by the king or one in supreme command had another dreadful interpretationdeath without pity or reprieve  in an instant before she could interfere before she could speak the witchdoctoress lay dead upon the carcase of the dead bull  what of the others queen what of the others asked the chief of the slayers bending low before her and pointing with his spear to the attendants of the witchdoctoress who fled aghast do they join this evildoer who dared to lift her hand against thee  nay she answered in a low voice for horror had made her almost dumb i give them life forward  she gives them life shouted the praisers about her the bearer of life and death gives life to the children of the evildoer and as the great cavalcade marched forward company after company took up these words and sang them as a song    chapter x  the omen of the star   as it chanced and can easily be understood rachel could not have made a more effective entry into zululand or one more calculated to confirm her supernatural reputation when the wild beast she rode plunged about she had remained seated on it as though she grew there whereas every warrior knew that he would have fallen off when the bull charged her that bull had died slain by the heavens when the isanuzi a witch of repute had lifted voice and hand against her she had commanded her death showing that she feared no rival magic true the woman would have been killed in any case for such was the order of the king as to all who should dare to affront the inkosazana yet the captains had waited to see what rachel would do that they might judge her accordingly if she had shown fear if she had even neglected to avenge they might have marvelled whether after all she were more than a beautiful white maiden filled with the wisdom of the whites  now they knew better she was a spirit having the power of a spirit over beast and man who smote as a spirit should the fame of it went throughout the land and little chance thence forward had rachel of escaping from the shadow of her own fearful renown  towards sundown they came to a kraal set upon a hill and it was asked of her if she were pleased to spend the night there she bowed her head in assent and they entered the kraal it was quite empty save for certain maidens dressed in bead petticoats who waited there to serve her all the other inhabitants had gone they took her to a large and beautifully clean hut kneeling on their knees the maidens presented her with foodmeat and curdled milk and roasted cobs of corn she ate of the corn and the milk but the meat she sent away as a gift to the captains then alone in that kraal in which after they had served her even the girls seemed to fear to stay rachel slept as best she might in such solitude while without the fence two thousand armed savages watched over her safety  it was a troubled sleep for she dreamed always of that dreadfullooking isanuzi with the fishbladders in her hair yelling to her that her path through life was watered with blood and bidding her go back to her own kraal and see whether the words were true an ominous saying of which she could not read the riddle she dreamed also of the womans coarse furious face turned suddenly to one of abject terror and then of the dreadful end the red death without mercy and without appeal which she had let loose by a motion of her hand another dream she had was of her father and her mother who seemed to be lying side by side staring towards her with wideopen eyes and that when she spoke to them they would not answer  so the long night wore away till at length rachel woke with a start thinking that a hand had been laid upon her face to see by the faint light of dawn which struggled into the hut through the cracks of the doorboards that the hand was only a great rat that had crawled over her and now nibbled at her hair she sat up frightening it and its companions away then rose and washed herself with water that stood by in great gourds while without she heard the women singing some kind of song or hymn of which she could not catch the words  scarcely was she ready than they entered the hut saluting her and bringing more food rachel ate then bade one of them say to the captain of the impi that she was ready to start presently the girl returned with the message that all was prepared she walked from the kraal to find her mare which had been well fed and groomed by tamboosa who had seen horses in natal and knew how they should be treated saddled and waiting whilst before and behind it arranged as on the previous day stood the warriors who received her in dead respectful silence  she mounted and the procession went forward with a two hours halt at midday they marched on over hill and dale passing many villages of beehiveshaped huts as they came the inhabitants of these places deserted them and fled crying nomkubulwana nomkubulwana it was evident to rachel that the tale of the death of the isanuzi had preceded her and they feared lest should they cross her path her fate would be their fate indeed one of the strangest circumstances of this strange adventure was the complete loneliness in which she lived except those who were actually ordered to wait upon her none dared come near to rachel she was holy a spirit to approach whom unbidden might mean death  at nightfall they reached another empty kraal where again she slept alone when they left it in the morning she called tamboosa to her and asked him at what hour they would come to dingaans great town umgugundhlovo which means the place of the trumpeting of the elephant he answered at sunset  so she rode on all that day also till as the sun began to sink from a hill whereon grew large euphorbia trees on a plain backed by mountains she saw the town surrounded by a fence inside of which were thousands of huts that in their turn surrounded a great open space now they pushed forward quickly and as darkness fell approached the main gate of the place where as usual there was no one to be seen but here they did not enter marching on till they came to another gate that of the intunkulu the kings house where their escort done the regiment turned and went away leaving rachel alone with the envoy tamboosa who still led the white ox they entered this gate and presently came to a second it was that of the emposeni the dwelling of the kings wives out of which appeared women crawling on the ground before rachel and holding in their left hands torches of grass these undid the baggage from the ox and at their signals for they did not seem to dare to speak to her rachel dismounted thereon tamboosa saluted her and taking the horse by the bridle led it away with the ox  then rachel felt that she was indeed alone for tamboosa at any rate had seen her home which now was so far away still proudly enough she followed the women who bent double as before led her to a great hut lit by a rude lamp filled with melted hippopotamus fat where they set down her bags and departed to return presently with food and water  having washed off the dust of her long journey and combed out her hair rachel ate all she could for she was hungry and guessed that she might need her strength that night then she lay down upon a pile of beautiful karosses that had been placed ready for her and rested an hour or more went by and just as she was beginning to fall asleep the doorboard of the hut was thrust aside and a tall woman entered who knelt to her and said  hail inkosazana the king asks whether it be thy pleasure to appear before him this night  it is my pleasure answered rachel for that purpose have i travelled here lead me to the king  so the woman went out of the hut rachel following her to find that the moon shone brightly in a clear sky the woman conducted her through tortuous reed fences until presently they came to an open court where in the shadow of a hut sat a number of men wrapped about with fur karosses guessing that she was in the presence of dingaan rachel drew her white cloak round her tall form and walked forward slowly till she reached the centre of the space where she stopped and stood quite still looking like a ghost in the moonlight then all the men to right and left rose and saluted her silently by the uplifting of one arm only he who was in the midst of them remained seated and did not salute still she stayed motionless uttering no word for a long while six or seven minutes perhaps her silence fought against theirs and she knew that the one who spoke first would own to inferiority  at length in answering salutation she lifted the little wand of white horn that she carried and turned slowly as though to leave the place so that now the moonlight glistened on her lovely hair then fearing perhaps lest she should depart or vanish away the man seated in the centre said in a low halfawed voice  i am dingaan king of the amazulu say white one who art thou  by what name am i known here o dingaan the king she replied answering the question with a question  by a high name white one a name that is seldom spoken the name of inkosazanayzoola the title of nomkubulwana the spirit of our people how camest thou by that name  my name is my name she said  we know white one the wind has borne all that story through the land it whispers it from the leaves of the forest and the reeds of the water and the grass of the plains we know that the heavens gave thee their own name o child of heaven o holder of the spirit of nomkubulwana  thou sayest it king i do not say it thou sayest it  i say it and having seen thee i know that it is true for thy beauty white one is not the beauty of woman alone although still thou beest woman now i confirm to thee the words my messengers bore thee in past days here with me thou rulest the land is thine my impis wait thy word death and life are in thy hands command and they go forth to slay command and they return again only thou rulest alone with me and the black folk not the white shall be thy servants  i hear thee king now as a first fruit give to me noie daughter of seyapi my slave whom the soldiers stole away from ramah beyond the river where i dwell  she is dead white one she is dead for her crimes answered dingaan looking at her  now rachels heart sank in her for it might well be that a trick had been played on her and that this was true or perhaps this tale of noies death was but a trap to test her powers moreover it was not likely that the king who had promised that she should live would dare to break his word to one whom he believed or halfbelieved to be a spirit  for a moment she thought then after her nature determined to be bold and hazard all upon a throw therefore she did not argue or reproach but said  she is not dead i have questioned every spear in zululand and none of them is red with her blood  thou art right he answered the spears are clean she died in the river  now rachel was sure and answered in her clear voice  i have questioned the waters and i have questioned the crocodiles and they answer that noie has passed them safely  thou art right white one she died by a rope in yonder huts  now rachel looked at the huts and cried  noie i hear thee i see thee i smell thee out come forth noie  the king and his councillors stared at her whispering to one another and before ever they had done their whisperings out from among the gloom of the huts crept noie  to rachel she crept taking no heed even of the king and crouching down in the faint shadow of her that the moonlight threw she flung her arms about her knees and pressed her forehead on her feet now rachels heart bounded with joy at the sight of her and she longed to bend down and kiss her but did not lest her great dignity should be lessened in the eyes of the king only she said  i greet you noie be seated in my shadow where you are safe and tell me have these men dealt well by you  not so ill inkosazana that is since i reached the great kraal but one of them he who sits yonder and she pointed to a certain induna struck me on the journey and took away my food  now rachel looked at the man angrily playing with the little wand in her hand whereon this induna shivered with terror fearing lest she should point it at him rising he came to rachel and flung himself down before her  what have you to say asked rachel you who have dared to strike my servant  inkosazana he mumbled the maid was obstinate and tried to run away and our orders were to bring her to the king spare my life i pray thee  king said rachel i have power over this man have i not  it is so answered dingaan kill him if thou wilt  rachel seemed to consider while the poor wretch with chattering teeth implored her to forgive then she turned to noie saying  he struck you not me i give him to you to do by as you will shall he sleep tonight with the living or the dead  noie looked at him and next at a mark on her arm and the induna ceasing from his prayers to rachel clutched noie by the ankle and begged her mercy  your life has been given to you he said give mine to me lest illfortune follow you   do you remember asked noie contemptuously how when you had beaten me yonder by the tugela you said you hoped that it would be your luck to put a spear through this heart of mine and do you remember that i answered you that the spear would be over your own heart first and that thereon you called me daughter of wizards and struck me againme the child of seyapi upon whom the mantle of the inkosazana lies me who have drunk of her wisdom and of hisyou struck me you dog and lifting her foot she spurned him in the face  now the king and his company concluding that the thing was finished glanced at rachel to see her point with the rod and thus give the man to death but rachel waited sure that noie had not done moreover whatever noie might say she had determined to save him  meanwhile the girl after a pause said  were you a man you would be too proud to ask your life of me but you are a dog and dog i remember that you have children among them a daughter of my own age whom i saw come out to greet you for her sake then take your life and with it this new name that i give yousoldierwhostrikesgirls  so the man rose and weak with shame and the agony of suspense crept swiftly from the place fearing lest the inkosazana or her servant might change her mind and kill him after all but noies name clung to him so closely that at length unable to bear the ridicule of it he and his family fled from zululand  so this matter ended  now the king spoke saying  white one thy magic is great and thine eyes could pierce the darkness and see thy servant hidden and call her forth to thee yet know she is mine not thine for when she fled i had already chosen her to be my wife and afterwards i sent and killed the wizard seyapi and all his house  but this girl thou didst not kill o king for i saved her  it is so white one i have heard lately how thou didst call down the lightning and burn up my soldier who followed after her so that nothing of him remained  yes said rachel quietly as were it to please me i could burn thee up also o king a saying at which dingaan looked afraid  yet he went on waving his hand as though to put aside this unpleasant suggestion the maid is mine not thine and therefore i took her  how didst thou learn that she dwelt at my kraal asked rachel   the king hesitated  the white man ishmael he whom thou callest ibubesi told thee did he not  dingaan bowed his head  and he told thee that thou couldst make what promises thou wouldst to me as to the girls life but that afterwards when thou hadst called me here to claim it thou mightest kill her or keep her as a wife as it pleased thee  i can hide nought from thee it is so said dingaan  is that still in thy mind o king asked rachel again beginning to play with the little wand  not so not so he answered hurriedly hadst thou not come the girl would have died as she deserved to do according to our law but thou hast come and claimed her o holder of the spirit of nomkubulwana and she sits in thy shadow and is clothed with thy garment take her then for henceforth she is holy as thou art holy  rachel heard and without any change of countenance waved her hand to show that this question was finished then she asked suddenly  what is this great matter whereof thou wouldst speak with me o king  surely thy wisdom has told thee white one he answered uneasily  perchance yet i would have it from thy lips and now  now dingaan consulted a little with his council  white one he said presently the thing is grave and we need guidance therefore as the circle of the witchdoctors have declared must be done we ask it of thee who art named with the name of the spirit of our people and hast of her wisdom thou knowest white one of the fights in past years between the white people of natal and the zulus in which many were slain on either side but now when we are at peace with the english we hear of another white people the amaboona ie the dutch boers who are marching towards us from the cape and have already fought with moselikatzethe traitor who was once my captainand killed thousands of his men these amaboona threaten us also and say aloud that they will eat us up for they are brave and armed with the white mans weapons that spit out lightning now white one what shall we do shall i send out my impis and fall on them while they are unprepared and make an end of them as seems wisest and is the wish of my indunas or shall i sit at home and watch trying to be at peace with them and only strike back if they strike at me answer not lightly o zoola for much may hang upon thy words remember also that he whose name may not be spoken the lion who ruled before me and is gone with his last breath uttered a certain prophecy concerning the white people and this land  let me hear that prophecy o king  come forth said dingaan pointing to a councillor who sat in the circle come forth thou who knowest and tell the tale in the ears of this white one  a figure rose a draped figure whose face was hidden in a hood of blanket it came forward and as it came it drew the blanket tighter about it rachel watching all things saw or thought she saw that one of its hands was white as though it had been burned with fire surely she had seen such a hand before  speak she said  name me by my name and tell me who i am and i will obey thee answered the man  then she was sure for she remembered the voice she looked at him indifferently and asked  by what name shall i name you o slayer of a king will you be called mopo or umbopa who have borne them both  now dingaan stared and the shrouded form before her started as though in surprise  why do you seek to mock me she went on can a blanket of bark hide that face of yours from these eyes of mine which saw it a while ago at ramah when you came thither to judge of me o mouth of the king  now the man let the blanket slip from his head and looked at her  it seems that it cannot he answered then i told thee that i had dreamed of the spirit of our people and that thou white one wast like to her of whom i had dreamed canst thou tell me what was the fashion of that dream of mine  now rachel understood that notwithstanding his words at ramah this man still doubted her and was set up to prove her and all that noie had told her about him and the secret history of the zulus came back into her mind  surely mopo or umbopa she replied you dreamed three dreams not one is it of the last you speakthat dream at the kraal duguza when the inkosazana rode past you on a storm clothed in lightning and shaking in her hand a spear of fire  yes i speak of it he replied in an awed voice but if thou art but a woman as thou hast said how knowest thou these things  perchance i am both woman and spirit and perchance the past tells them to me rachel answered but the past has many voices and now that i dwell in the flesh i cannot hear them all let me search you out let me read your heart and she bent forward and fixed her eyes upon him holding him with her eyes  ah now i see and i hear she said presently had you not a sister mopo a certain baleka who afterwards entered the house of the black one and bore a son and died in the tatiyana cleft shall i tell you how she died  tell it not tell it not exclaimed the old man quaveringly  so be it there is no need yet ere she died you made a promise to this baleka and that promise you kept at the kraal duguza you and the prince umhlangana and another prince whose name i forget and she looked at dingaan who put his hand before his face you kept that promise with an assegailet me look let me look into your heartyes with a little assegai handled with the royal red wood an assegai that had drunk much blood  now a low moan broke from the lips of dingaan and those who sat with them while umbopa shivered as though with cold  have mercy i pray thee he gasped forgive me if at times since we met at ramah i thought thee but a white maiden beautiful and bold as thou didst declare thyself to be now i see thou hast the spirit or else how didst thou know these things  noie heard and smiled in the shadow but rachel stood silent  i was bidden to tell thee of the last words of the black one went on umbopa hurriedly but what need is there to tell thee anything who knowest all they were that he heard the sound of the running of the feet of a great white people which shall stamp out the children of the zulus  nay answered rachel i think they were wherefore wouldst thou kill me mopo  again dingaan moaned for he had heard these very words spoken umbopa turned and stared at him and he stared at umbopa  come hither said rachel beckoning to the old man  he obeyed and she threw the corner of her cloak over his head and whispered into his ear he listened to her whisperings then with a cry broke from her and fled away out of the council of the king  when he had gone there was silence though dingaan looked a question with his eyes  ask it not she said ask it not of me or of him i think this mopo here had his secrets in the past i think that once he sat in a hut at night and bargained with certain great ones a prince who lives and a prince who died come hither come hither thou son of senzangacona come from the fields of death and tell me what was that bargain which thou madest with mopo thou and another and once again rachel beckoned this time upwards in the air  now the face of dingaan went grey even in the moonlight it went grey beneath the blackness of his skin for there rose before his mind a vision of a hut and of mopo and of umhlangana the prince his brother whom he had slain and of himself seated in the darkness their heads together beneath a blanket whispering of the murder of a king  thou knowest all he gasped thou art nomkubulwana and no other spare us spirit who canst summon our dead sins from the grave of time and make them walk alive before us  nay nay she answered mockingly surely i am but a woman daughter of a teacher who lives yonder over the tugela a white maiden who eats and sleeps and drinks as other maidens do take notice king and you his captains that i am no spirit nothing but a woman who chances to bear a high name and to have some wisdom only she added with meaning if any harm should come to me if i should die then i think that i should become a spirit a terrible spirit and that ill would it go with that people against whom my blood was laid  oh said the king who still shook with fear we know we know mock us not i pray thou art the spirit who hast chosen to wear the robe of woman as flame hides itself in flint and woe be to the hand that strikes the fire from this stone white one give us now that wisdom whereof thou speakest shall i fall upon the boers or shall i let them be  rachel looked upwards studying the stars  she takes counsel with the heavens she who is their daughter muttered one of the indunas in a low voice  as he spoke it chanced that a bright meteor travelling from the southwest swept across the sky to burst and vanish over the kraal of umgugundhlovo  it is a messenger to her said one i saw the fire shine upon her hair and vanish in her breast  nay answered another it is the ehlose the guardian ghost of the amazulu that appears and dies  not so broke in a third that light shows the amaboona travelling from the southwest to be eaten up in the blackness of our impis  such a star runs ever before the death of king it fell the night ere the black one died murmured a fourth as though he spoke to himself   only dingaan taking no heed of them said addressing rachel  read thou the omen  nay she replied upon the swift impulse of the moment i read it not interpret it as ye will here is my answer to thy question king those who lift the spear shall perish by the spear  at this saying the captains murmured a little for they who desired war understood that she counselled peace between them and the boers though others thought that she meant that the boers would perish dingaan also looked downcast watching their faces rachel was sure that not even her hand could hold them back from their desire that war must come again she spoke  the star travels whither it is thrown by the hand of the umkulunkulu the master of men the spear finds the heart to which it is appointed read you the omen as you will i have spoken but ye will not understand that which shall be shall be  she bent her head and turned her ear towards the ground as though to hearken  what was that tale of the last words of the great lion who is gone she went on ask it of mopo ask it of dingaan the king it seems to me that i also hear the feet of a people travelling over plain and mountain and the rivers behind them run red with blood are they black feet or white feet read ye the omen as ye will i have spoken for the first time and the last trouble me no more with this matter of the white men and your war and turning rachel glided from the court followed by noie with bowed head    chapter xi  ishmael visits the inkosazana   when at last they were in the hut and the doorboard had been safely closed rachel took noie in her arms and kissed her but noie did not kiss her back she only pressed her hand against her forehead  why do you not kiss me noie asked rachel  how can i kiss you inkosazana replied the girl humbly i who am but the dog at your feet the dog whom twice it has pleased you to save from death  inkosazana exclaimed rachel i weary of that name i am but a woman like yourself and i hate this part which i must play   yet it is a high part and you play it very well while i listened to you tonight zoola twice and thrice i wondered if you are not something more than you deem yourself to be that beautiful body of yours is but a cup like those of other women but say who fills the cup with the wine of wisdom why do kings and councillors fear you and why do you fear nothing why did dead seyapi talk to me of you in dreams what strange chance gave you that name of yours and made you holy in these mens eyes what power teaches you the truth and gives you wit and strength to speak it why are you different from the rest of maidens white or black  i do not know noie something tells me what to do and say also i understand these zulus and you have taught me much you told me all the hidden tale of yonder mopo a year gone by or more as you have told me many of the darkest secrets of this people that you had from your father who knew them all at the pinch i remembered it no more and played upon them by my knowledge  what was it you said to mopo under your cloak lady  rachel smiled as she answered  i only asked him if it were not in his mind having killed one king to kill another also and that spear went home  ah exclaimed noie in admiration at least i never told you that  no i read it in his eyes for a moment all his heart was open to meyes and the heart of dingaan also he fears mopo and mopo hates him and one day hate and fear will come together  ah said noie again you know much  yes answered rachel with sudden passion more than i wish to know noie you are right i am not altogether as others are there is a power in my blood i see and hear what should not be seen and heard at times fears fill me or joys lift me up and i think that i draw hear to another world than ours no it is folly i am overwrought who would not be that must endure so much and be set upon this throne a goddess among barbarians with life and death upon my lips oh when the king asked me his riddle i knew not what to answer who feared lest ten thousand lives might pay the price of a girls incautious words then that meteor broke there have been several this night but none noted them till i looked upwards and you know the rest let them guess its meaning which they cannot for it has none  why did you not speak more plainly zoola  oh because i dared not who am i to meddle with such matters who came here but to save you i warned them not to make war upon the boers what more could i do moreover it is useless for fight they must and will and pay the price of that i am sure i feel it here and she pressed her hand upon her heart yes and other nearer things oh noie i would that i were back at home say can we start tomorrow at the dawn  noie shook her head  i do not think that they will let you go they will keep you to be their great doctoress you should not have come i sent you wordwhat did my life matter  keep me answered rachel stamping her foot they dare not here at least i am the inkosazana and i will be obeyed  noie made no answer only she said  ishmael is here i have seen him he wished to have me killed at once because he is afraid of me but when he was sure that you were coming dingaan would not break his word which he had sent to you  rachels face fell  ishmael she exclaimed in dismay then recovered herself and added well i am not afraid of ishmael for here his life is in my hand oh i am worn out i cannot talk of the man tonight i must sleep noie i must sleep come lie at my side and let us sleep  nay answered the girl my place is at the door but drink this milk and lay you down without fear for i will watch  rachel obeyed and noie sat by her holding her hand till presently her eyes shut and she slept but noie did not sleep all that night she sat there watching and listening till at length the dawn came and she lay down also by the door and rested  the sun was high in the heavens when rachel woke  good morrow to you zoola said the sweet voice of noie you have slept well now you must rise bathe yourself and eat for already messengers from the king have been to the outer gate saying that they wait to escort you to a better house that has been made ready for you  i hoped that they waited to escort me out of zululand answered rachel  i asked them of that zoola but they declared it must not be as the council of the doctors had been summoned to consider your sayings and two days will pass before it can meet also they declare that your horse is sick and not fit to travel meaning that they will not let you go   but i have the right to go noie  the bird has the right to fly but what if it is in a cage zoola  i am queen here noie the bars will burst at my word  it may be so zoola but what if the bird should find that it has no nest to fly to  what do you mean asked rachel paling  only that it seems best that you should not anger these zulus lady lest it should come into their minds to destroy your nest thinking that so you might come to love this cage no no i have heard nothing but i guess their thoughts you need rest bide here where you are safe a day or two and let us see what happens  speak plainly noie i do not understand your parable of birds and cages  zoola i obey i think that if you say you will go none not the king himself would dare to stay you though you would have to go on foot for then that horse would die but an impi would go with you or before you and woe betide those who held you from returning to zululand do you understand me now  yes answered rachel you meanoh i cannot speak it i will remain here a few days  so she rose and bathed herself and was dressed by noie and ate of the food that had been brought to the door of the hut then she went out and in the little courtyard found a litter waiting that was hung round with grass mats  the kings word is that you should enter the litter said noie  she did so whereon noie clapped her hands and girls in bead dresses ran in and having prostrated themselves before the litter lifted it up and carried it away noie walking at its side  rachel peeping between the mats saw that she was borne out of the town surrounded but at a distance by a guard of hundreds of armed men presently they began to ascend a hill whereon grew many trees and after climbing it for a while reached a large kraal with huts between the outer and inner fence and in its centre a great space of parklike land through which ran a stream  here by the banks of the stream stood a large new hut and behind at a little distance two or three other huts in front of this great hut the litter was set down by the bearers who at once went away then at noies bidding rachel came out of it and looked at the place which had been given her in which to dwell  it was a beautiful spot away from the dust and the noises of the great kraal and so placed upon a shoulder of the hillside that the soldiers who guarded this house of the inkosazana as it was called could not be seen or heard yet rachel looked at it with distaste feeling that it was that cage of which noie had spoken  a cage it proved indeed a solitary cage for here rachel abode in regal seclusion and in state that could only be called awful no man might approach her house unbidden and the maidens who waited upon her did so with downcast eyes never speaking and falling on to their knees if addressed on the first day of her imprisonment for it was nothing less an unhappy zulu through ignorance or folly slipped through the outer guard and came near to the inner fence rachel who was seated above heard some shouts of rage and horror and saw soldiers running towards him and in another minute a body being carried away upon a shield he had died for his sacrilege  once a day ambassadors came to her from the king to ask of her health and if she had orders to give but now even these men were not allowed to look upon her they were led in by the women each of them with a piece of bark cloth over his head and from beneath this cloth they addressed her as though she were in truth divine on the first day she bade them tell the king that her mission being ended it was her desire to depart to her own home beyond the river they heard her words in silence then asked if she had anything to add she repliedyes it was her will that they should cease to wear veils in her presence also that no more men should be killed upon her account as had happened that morning they said that they would convey the order at once as several were under sentence of death who had argued as to whether she were really the inkosazana so she sent them away instantly fearing lest they should be too late and they were led off backwards bowing and giving the royal salute afterwards she rejoiced to hear that her commands had arrived just in time and that the blood of these poor people was not upon her head  next day the messengers returned at the same hour unveiled as she desired bearing the answer of the king and his council it was to the effect that the inkosazana had no need to ask permission to come or to go her spirit they knew was mighty and could wander where it willed all the impis of the zulus could not hold her sprint butand here came the sting of this clever answerit was necessary until her sayings had been considered that the body in which that spirit abode should remain with them a while therefore the king and his counsellors and the whole nation of the zulus prayed her to be satisfied with the sending of her spirit across the tugela leaving her body to dwell a space in the house of the inkosazana  rachel looked at them in despair for what was she to reply to such reasoning as this before she could make up her mind their spokesman said that a white man ibubesi who said that he had often spoken with her asked leave to visit her in her house  now rachel thought a while ishmael was the last person in the whole world whom she wished to see after the interview when they parted and all that had happened since it could not be otherwise she remembered the threats he had uttered then and to her father afterwards the brutal and revolting threats some of these had been directed against noie and subsequently noie was kidnapped by the zulus that those directed at herself had not been fulfilled was she felt sure due to a lack of opportunity alone  little wonder then that she feared and hated the man still he was of white blood and perhaps for this reason had authority among the zulus who as she knew often consulted him moreover notwithstanding his vapourings like the zulus whose superstitions he had contracted he looked upon herself with something akin to fear if she saw him she had no cause to dread anything that he could do to her at any rate in this country where she was supreme whereas on the other hand she might obtain information from him which would be very useful or make use of him to enable her to escape from zululand on the whole then it seemed wisest to grant him an interview especially as she gathered from the fact that the question was raised by dingaans indunas that for some reason of his own the king hoped that she would do so  still she hesitated loathing and despising him as she did  you have heard she said in english to noie who stood behind her now what shall i say  saycome answered noie in the same tongue  read his black heart and find out truth he no can keep it from you saycome with soldiers if he behave bad tell them kill him they obey you no mind me i not afraid of that wild beast now  then rachel said to the indunas  i hear the kings word and understand that he wishes me to receive this ibubesi yet i know that man as i know all men white and black he is an evil man and it is not my pleasure to speak with him alone let him come with a guard of six captains and let the captains be armed with spears so that if i give the word there may be an end of this ibubesi  then the messengers saluted and departed as before   on the morrow at about the same hour a praiser or herald arrived outside the inner fence of the kraal and after he had shouted out rachels titles attributes beauties and supernatural powers for at least ten minutes never repeating himself announced that the indunas of the king were without accompanied by the white man ibubesi awaiting her permission to enter she gave it through noie and the horn wand in her hand seated herself upon a carved stool in front of the great hut presently an altercation arose upon the further side of the reed fence in which she recognised ishmaels strident voice mingled with the deeper tones of the zulus who seemed to be insisting upon something  they command him to take off his headdress said noie and threaten to beat him if he will not  go tell them to admit him as he is that i may see his face and learn if he be the white man whom i knew or another answered rachel and she went  then the gate was opened and the messengers were led in by women after these came six captains carrying broad spears as she had commanded and last of all ishmael himself rachels whole nature shrank at the sight of his dark handsome features she loathed the man now as always her instinct warned her of danger at his hands also she remembered his threats when last they met and she rejected him and what had passed between him and her father on the following day but of all this she showed nothing remaining seated in silence with calm set face  ishmael was advancing with a somewhat defiant air except for a kaross upon his shoulders he wore european dress and the ridiculous hat with the white ostrich feather in it both of them now much the worse for wear which she remembered so well also he had a lighted pipe in his mouth presently one of the captains appeared to become suddenly aware of this pipe for stretching out his hand he snatched it away and the hat with it throwing them upon the ground ishmael whose teeth and lips were hurt turned on the man with an oath and struck him whereon instantly he was seized and would perhaps have been killed before rachel could interfere had it not been unlawful to shed blood in her presence as it was with a motion of her wand she signified that he was to be loosed a command that noie interpreted to them at any rate they let him go though a captain placed his feet on the hat and pipe then ishmael came forward and said awkwardly  how do you do i did not expect to see you here and he devoured her beauty with his bold greedy eyes though not without doubt and dread or so thought rachel   taking no notice of his greeting she said in a cold voice  i have sent for you here to ask if you have any reason as to why i should not order you to be killed for your crime against my servant noie and therefore against me  now ishmael paled for he had not expected such a welcome and began to deny the thing  spare your falsehoods went on rachel i have it from the kings lips and from my own knowledge remember only that here i am the inkosazana with power of life and death if i speak the word or point at you with this wand in a minute you will have gone to your account  inkosazana or not he answered in a cowed voice you know too much well then she was taken that you might follow her to zululand to ask her life and you see that the plan was good for you came and he added recovering some of his insolence and familiarity we are here together two white people among all these silly niggers  rachel looked him up and down then she looked at the indunas seated in silence before her at the great limbed captains with their broad spears beyond reminding her in their plumes and attitudes of some picture that she had seen of roman gladiators about to die lastly she looked at the delicately shaped noie by her side with her sweet inscrutable face the woman whose parents and kin this outcast had brought to a bloody death the woman whom to forward his base ends he had vilely striven to murder slowly she looked at them all and at him and said  shall i explain to these nobles and captains what you call them and what you are called among your own people shall i tell them something of your story mr ishmael  you can do what you like he answered sullenly you know why i got you herebecause i love you i told you that many months ago while you were down at ramah i had no chance with you because of that old hypocrite of a father of yours and this black girl and he looked at noie viciously here i thought that it would be differentthat you would be glad of my company but you have turned yourself into a kind of goddess and hold me off and he paused  go on said rachel  all right i will you may think yourself a goddess as i do myself sometimes but i know that you are a woman too and that soon you will get tired of this business you want to go home to your father and mother dont you well you cant you are a prisoner here for these fools have got it into their heads that you are their spirit and that it would be unlucky to let you out of the country so here you must stop for years perhaps or till they are sick of you and kill you just understand rachel that nobody can help you to escape except me and that i shant do so for nothing  rachel straightened herself upon her seat gripping the edge of it with her hands for her temper was rising while noie bent forward and said something in her ear  what is that black devil whispering to you he asked telling you to have me killed i expect well you darent for what would your holy parents say it would be murder wouldnt it and you would go to hell where i daresay you come from for otherwise how could you be such a witch look here he went on changing his tone dont lets squabble make it up with me ill get you clear of this and marry you afterwards on the square if you wont it will be the worse for youand everybody else yes everybody else  mr ishmael answered rachel calmly you are making a very great mistake about my scruples as to taking life i mean amongst other things once when it was necessary you saw me kill a man well if i am forced to it what i did then i will do again only not with my own hand mr ishmael you said just now that you could get me out of zululand i take you at your word not for my own sake for i am comfortable enough here but for that of my father and mother who will be anxious and her voice weakened a little as she spoke of them  do you well i wont i am comfortable here also and shall be more so as the husband of the inkosazana this is a very pretty kraal and it is quite big enough for two he added with an amorous sneer  now for a minute at least rachel sat still and rigid when she spoke again it was in a kind of gasp  never she said have you gone nearer to your death you wanderer without name or shame listen now i give you one week to arrange my escape home if it is not done within that time i will pay you back for those words be silent i will hear no more  then she called out  rise men and bear the message of the inkosazana to dingaan king of the zulus say to dingaan that this wandering white dog whom he has sent into my house has done me insult say that he has asked me the inkosazanayzoola to be one of his wives  at these words the counsellors and captains uttered a shout of rage and two of the latter seized ishmael by the arm lifting their spears to plunge them into him rachel waved her wand and they let them fall again  not yet she said take him to the king and if my word comes to the king then he dies and not till then i would not have his vile blood on my hands unless i speak i queen of the heavens leave him to the vengeance of the heavens my mantle is over him lead him back to the king and let me see his face no more  we hear and it shall be so they answered with one voice then forgetting their ceremony hustled ishmael from the kraal  have i done well asked rachel of noie when they were alone  no zoola she answered you should have killed the snake while you were hot against him since when your blood grows cold you can never do it and he will live to bite you  i have no right to kill a man noie just because he makes love to me and i hate him also if i did so he could not help me to escape from zululand which he will do now because he is afraid of me  will he be afraid of you when you are both across the tugela asked noie inkosazana give me power and ask no questions ibubesi killed my father and mother and brethren and has tried to kill me therefore my heart would not be sore if after the fashion of this land i paid him spears for battleaxes for he deserves to die  perhaps noie but not by my word  perhaps by your hand then said noie looking at her curiously well soon or late he will die a red deaththe reddest of deaths i learned that from the spirit of my father  the spirit of your father said rachel looking at her  certainly it speaks to me often and tells me many things though i may not repeat them to you till they are accomplished thus i was not afraid in the hands of dingaan for it told me that you would save me  i wish it would speak to me and tell me when i can go home said rachel with a sigh  it would if it could zoola but it cannot because the curtain is too thick had all you loved been slain before your eyes then the veil would be worn thin as mine is and through it you who are akin to them would hear the talk of the ghosts and dimly see them wandering beneath their trees  beneath their trees  yes the trees of their life of which all the boughs are deeds and all the leaves are words under the shadow of which they must abide for ever my people could tell you of those trees and perhaps they will one day when we visit them together nay pay no heed i was wandering in my talk it is the sight of that wild beast ibubesi you will not let me kill him well doubtless it is fated so i think one day you will be sorrybut too late    chapter xii  rachel sees a vision   that evening ishmael was brought before the king he was in evil case for the captains some of whom had grudges against him when he tried to break away from them outside the gate had beaten him with their spear shafts nearly all the way from the kraal to the great place remarking that he fought and remonstrated that the inkosazana had forbidden them to kill him but had said nothing as to giving him the flogging which he deserved his clothes were torn his hat and pipe were lostindeed hours before noie had thrown both of them into the firehis eyes were black from the blow of a heavy stick and he was bruised all over  such was his appearance when he was thrust before dingaan seething with rage which he could scarcely suppress even in that presence  did you visit the inkosazana today white man asked the king blandly while the indunas stared at him with grim amusement  then ishmael broke out into a recital of his wrongs demanding that the captains who had beaten him a white man and a great person should be killed  silence said dingaan at length the question nightprowler is whether you should not be killed you dog who dared to insult the inkosazana by offering yourself to her as a husband had she commanded you to be speared she would have done well and if you trouble me with your shoutings i will send you to sleep with the jackals tonight without waiting for her word  now seeing his danger ishmael was silent and the king went on  did you discover as i bade you why it is that the inkosazana desires to leave us  yes king it is because she would return to her own people the old prayerdoctor and his wife  they are not her people exclaimed dingaan we know that she came to them out of the storm and that they are but the fosterparents chosen for her by the heavens you were the first to tell us that story and how she caused the lightning to burn up my soldier yonder at ramah we are her people and no others can the inkosazana have a father and a mother  i dont know answered ishmael but she is a woman and i never knew a woman who was without them at least i am sure that she looks upon them as her father and mother obeying them in all things and that she will never leave them while they live unless they command her to do so  dingaan stared at him with his piglike eyes repeating after himwhile they live unless they command her to do so then he asked  if the inkosazana desires to go who is there that dares to stay her and if she puts out her magic who is there that has the power if a hand is lifted against her will she not lay a curse on us and bring destruction upon us  i dont know answered ishmael again but if she goes back among the white folk and is angry i think that she will bring the boers upon you  now dingaans face grew very troubled and bidding ishmael stand back awhile he consulted with his council then he said  listen to me white man it would be a very evil thing if the inkosazana were to leave us for with her would go the spirit of our people and their good luck so say the witchdoctors with one voice and i believe them further it is our desire that she should remain with us a while this day the council of the diviners has spoken saying that the words of the inkosazana which she uttered here are too hard for them and that other doctors of a people who live far away must be sent for and brought face to face with her therefore here at umgugundhlovo she should abide until they come  indeed answered ishmael indifferently  in the doctors who dwell far away and the council of the diviners he had no belief but understanding the natives as he did he guessed correctly enough that the latter found themselves in a cleft stick worked on by their superstitions which he had first awakened for his own ends they had accepted rachel as something more than human as the incarnation of the spirit of their people this mopo who was said to have killed chaka by command of that spirit had acknowledged her to be and therefore they did not dare to declare that her words spoken as an oracle were empty words but neither did they dare to interpret the saying that she meant that no attack must be made upon the boers and should be obeyed   to do this would be to fly in the face of the martial aspirations of the nation and the secret wishes of the king and perhaps if war ultimately broke out would cost them their lives so it came about that they announced that they could not understand her sayings and had decided to thrust off the responsibility on to the shoulders of some other diviners though who these men might be ishmael neither knew nor took the trouble to ask  but went on the king who can force the dove to build in a tree that does not please it seeing that it has wings and can fly away yet if its own tree that in which it was reared from the nest could be brought to it it might be pleased to abide there do you understand white man  no answered ishmael though in fact he understood well enough that the king was playing upon rachels english name of dove and that he meant that her home might be moved into zululand no the inkosazana is not a bird and who can carry trees about  have the spearshafts knocked the wit out of you ibubesi asked dingaan impatiently or are you drunk with beer learn then my meaning the inkosazana will not stay because her home is yonder therefore it must be brought here and she will stay at first i gave orders that if this old white teacher and his wife tried to accompany her they should be killed now i eat up those words they must come to zululand  how will you persuade them to be such fools asked ishmael  how did i persuade the inkosazana herself to come was it not to seek one whom she loved  they will think that you have killed her and wish to kill them also  no because you will go in command of an impi and show them otherwise  i cannot go your brutes of captains have hurt my head and lamed me i cannot walk or ride  then you can be carried in a litter or he added threateningly you can abide here with the vultures the inkosazana is merciful but why should i not avenge her wrongs upon you white dog who have dared to scratch at the kraal gate of the inkosazanayzoola  now ishmael saw that he had no choice also a dark thought rose dimly in his mind he desired to win rachel above everything on earth he was mad with loveor what he understood as loveof her and this business might be worked to his advantage moreover to stay was death so he fell to bargaining for a reward for his services a large reward in cattle and ivory half of it to be paid down at once and it was promised to him then he took his instructions these were that he was to travel to the mission station of ramah in command of a small impi of three hundred men whose only orders would be that they were to obey him in all things that he was to tell the umfundusi who was called shouter that if they wished to see her any more he and his wife must come to dwell with the inkosazana in zululand that if they refused he was to bring them by force if perchance the inkosazana choosing to exercise her authority crossed the tugela and reached ramah before he could do this he was still to bring them for then she would follow in the same way if the shouter and his wife met her on the road they were to travel on for then she would turn and accompany them he was to go at once and execute these orders  i hear said ishmael and will start as soon as the cattle have been delivered and sent on with the ivory to my kraal mafooti  there was something in the mans voice or in the look of low cunning which spread itself over his face that attracted dingaans attention  the cattle and the ivory shall be sent he said sternly but ill shall it be for you ibubesi if you seek to trick me in this matter you have grown rich on my bounty and yonder at your place mafooti you have many cows many wives many childrenmy spies have given me count of all of them now if you play me false or if you dare to lift a finger against the white one know that i will burn that kraal and slay the inhabitants with the spear and take the cattle and when i catch you ibubesi i will kill you slowly slowly i have spoken go  i go great elephant calf of the black cow and i will obey in all things answered ishmael in a humble voice for he was frightened the white people shall be brought only i trust to you to protect me from the anger of the inkosazana for all that i may do  you must make your own peace with the inkosazana answered dingaan and turning he crept into his hut  an hour later the great induna tamboosa appeared at rachels kraal and craved leave to speak with her  what is it asked rachel when he had been admitted have you come to lead me out of zululand tamboosa  nay white one he answered the land needs you yet awhile i have come to tell you that dingaan would speak with your servant noie if it be your good pleasure to let her visit him fear not no harm shall come to her if it does you may order me to be put to death you yourself could not be safer than she shall be  are you afraid to go asked rachel of noie   not i answered the girl with a laugh i trust to the kings word and to your might  depart then said rachel and come back as swiftly as you may tamboosa shall lead you  so noie went  two hours after sundown while rachel was eating her evening meal in her great hut attended by the maidens the doorboard was drawn aside and noie entered saluted and sat down rachel signed to the women to clear away the food and depart when they had gone she asked what the kings business was eagerly enough for she hoped that it had to do with her leaving zululand  it is a long story zoola answered noie but here is the heart of it i told you when first we met that i am not of this people although my mother was a zulu i told you that i am of the dreampeople the ghostpeople the little greypeople who live away to the north beneath their trees and worship their trees  yes answered rachel and that is why you care nothing for men as other women do but dream dreams and talk with spirits but what of it  that is why i dream dreams and talk with spirits as one day i hope that i shall teach you to do you whose soul is sister to my soul replied noie her large eyes shining strangely in her delicate face and this of itthe ghostpeople are diviners they can read the future and see the hearts of men there are no diviners like them therefore chiefs and peoples who dwell far away send to them with great gifts and pray them come read their fate but they will seldom listen or obey now dingaan and his councillors are troubled about this matter of the boers and the meaning of the words you spoke as to their waging war on them and of the omen of the falling star the council of the doctors can interpret none of these things nor dare they ask you to do so since you bade them speak no more to you of that matter and they know that if they did either you would not answer or worse still say words that would displease them  they are right there said rachel to have to play the dark oracle once is enough for me if i speak again it shall be plainly  therefore they have bethought them of the dealers in dreams and desire to bring you face to face with their prophets the ghostkings that these may see your greatness and tell them the meaning of your words and of the omen that you caused to travel through the skies  do you mean that they wish me to visit these ghostkings noie  not so zoola for then they must part with your presence they wish that the priests of the ghostkings should visit you bearing with them the word of the mother of the trees  visit me how can they who will bring them here  they wish that i should bring them for as they know i am of their blood and i alone can talk their language which my father taught me from a child  but noie that would moan that we must be separated said rachel in alarm  yes it would mean that still i think it best that you should humour them and let me go for otherwise i do not know how you will ever escape from zululand now i told the king that i thought you would permit it on one condition onlythat after you had been brought face to face with the priests of the ghostkings and they had interpreted your riddle you should be escorted whence you came and he answered that it should be so and that meanwhile you could abide here in honour peace and safety moreover he promised that a messenger should be sent to ramah to explain the reason of your delay  but how long will you be on the journey noie and what if these prophets of yours refuse to visit dingaan  i cannot tell you who have never travelled that road but i will march fast and if i tire swift runners shall bear me in a litter to those who have the secret of its gate that country is not so very far away also the old mother of the trees is my fathers aunt and i think that the prophets will come at my prayer or at the least send the answer to the question indeed i am sure of itask me not why  still for a long while rachel reasoned against this separation which she dreaded while noie reasoned for it she pointed out that here at least none could harm her as they had seen in the treatment meted out to ishmael a white man whom the zulus looked upon as their friend also she said with conviction that these mysterious ghostkings were very powerful and could free her from the clutches of the zulus and protect her from them afterwards as they would do when they came to know her case  the end of it was that rachel gave way not because noies arguments convinced her but because she was sure that she had other reasons she did not choose to advance  from that day when each of them tossed up a hair from her head at ramah notwithstanding the difference of their race and circumstances these two had been as sisters rachel believed in noie more perhaps than in any other living being and thus also did noie believe in rachel they knew that their destinies were intertwined and were sure that not rivers or mountains or the will and violence of men could keep them separate   i see said rachel at length that you believe that my fate hangs upon this embassy of yours  i do believe it answered noie confidently  then go but come back as swiftly as you may for my sister i know not how without you i shall live on in this lonely greatness and she took her in her arms and kissed her lips  afterwards as they were laying themselves down to sleep rachel asked her if she had heard anything about ishmael she answered that she learned at the great kraal that he had been brought before the king that afternoon and then taken back to his hut where he was under guard one of her escort told her too that since he saw the king ibubesi had fallen very sick it was thought from a blow that he had received at the house of inkosazana and that now he was out of his mind and being attended by the doctors i wish added noie viciously that he were out of his body also for then much sorrow would be spared but that cannot be before the time  on the next day before noon noie departed upon her journey rachel sent for the captains of her escort and the isanusis or doctors who were to accompany her and in a few stern words gave her into their charge saying that they should answer for her safety with their lives to which they replied that they knew it and would do so if any harm came to the daughter of seyapi through their fault they were prepared to die then she talked for a long while with noie telling her all she knew of the boers and the purpose of their wanderings that she might be able to repeat it to her people and show them how dreadful would be a war between this white folk and the zulus  noie answered that she would give her message but that it was needless since the ghostkings could see all that passed in the bowls of water beneath their trees and doubtless knew already of her coming and of the cause of it a reply of which rachel had not time to inquire the meaning after this they embraced and parted not without some tears  when the gate shut behind noie rachel walked to the high ground at the back of her hut whence she could see over the fence of the kraal and watched her departure she had an escort of a hundred picked soldiers with whom went fifty or sixty strong bearers who carried food karosses and a litter also there were three doctors of magic and medicine and two women widows of high rank who were to attend upon her at the head of this procession save for two guides walked noie herself with sandals on her feet a white robe about her shoulders and in her hand a little bough on which grew shining leaves whereof rachel did not know the meaning she watched them until they passed over the brow of the hill on the crest of which noie turned and waved the bough towards her then rachel went back to her hut and sat there alone and wept  this was the beginning of many dreadful days most of which she passed wandering about within the circuit of the kraal fence a space of some three or four acres or seated under the shadow of certain beautiful trees which overhung a deep clear pool of the stream that ran through the kraal a reedfringed pool whereon floated blooming lilies that quiet water the happy birds that nested in the trees and the flowering lilies seemed to be her only friends of the last indeed she would count the buds watching them open in the morning and close again for their sleep at night until a day came when their loveliness turned to decay and others appeared in their place  on the morrow of noies departure tamboosa and other indunas visited her and asked her if she would not descend to the kraal of the king and help him and his council to try cases since while she was in the land she was its first judge she answered no that place smelt too much of blood if they had cases for her to try let them be brought before her in her own house this she said idly thinking no more of it but next day was astonished to learn that the plaintiff and defendant in a great suit with their respective advocates and from thirty to forty witnesses were waiting without to know when it was her pleasure to attend to their business  with characteristic courage rachel answered now her knowledge of law was it is true limited to what for lack of anything more exciting she had read in some handbooks belonging to her father who had been a justice of the peace in the cape colony and to a few cases which she had seen tried in a roughandready fashion at durban to which must be added an intimate acquaintance with kaffir customs still being possessed with a sincere desire to discover the truth and execute justice she did very well the matter in dispute was a large one that of the ownership of a great herd of cattle which was claimed as an inheritance by each of the parties rachel soon discovered that both these men were very powerful chiefs and that the reason of their cause being remitted to her was that the king knew that if he decided in favour of either of them he would mortally offend the other  for a long while rachel seated on her stool listened silently to the impassioned pleadings of the plaintiffs lawyers presently this plaintiff was called as a witness and in the course of his evidence said something which convinced her that he was lying then breaking her silence for the first time she asked him how he dared to give false witness before the inkosazanayzoola to whom the truth was always open and who was acquainted with every circumstance connected with the cattle in dispute the man seeing her eyes fixed upon him and being convinced of her supernatural powers grew afraid broke down and publicly confessed his attempted fraud into which he said he had been led by envy of his cousin the defendants riches  rachel gave judgment accordingly commanding that he should pay the costs in cattle and a fine to the king and warned him to be more upright in future the result was that her fame as a judge spread throughout the land and every day her gates were beset with suitors whose causes she dealt with to the best of her ability and to their entire satisfaction criminal prosecutions that involved the deathsentence or matters connected with witchcraft however she steadily refused to try saying that the inkosazana should not cause blood to flow these things she left to the king and his council confining herself to such actions as in england would come before the court of chancery thus to her reputation as a spiritual queen rachel added that of an upright judge who could not be influenced by fear or bribes the first perhaps that had ever been known in zululand  but she could not try such cases all day the strain was too great although in the end most of them partook of the nature of arbitrations since the parties involved having come to the conclusion that it was not possible to deceive one so wise grew truthful and submitted their differences to the decision of her wisdom  after they were dismissed which was always at noon for she opened her court at seven and would not sit more than five hours rachel was left in her solitary state until the next morning and oh the hours hung heavily upon her hands a messenger was despatched to ramah but after ten days he returned saying that the tugela was in flood and he could not cross it she sent him out again and a week later was told that he had been killed by a lion on his journey then another messenger was chosen but what became of him she never knew  it was about this time that rachel learned that ishmael having recovered from his sickness had escaped from umgugundhlovo by night whither none seemed to know from that moment fears gathered thick upon the poor girl she dreaded ishmael and guessed that his departure without communicating with her boded her no good indeed once or twice she almost wished that she had taken noies counsel and given him over to the justice of the king meanwhile of noie herself nothing had been heard she had vanished into the wilderness  living this strange and most unnatural life rachels nerves began to give way while she tried her cases she seemed stern and calm but when the crowd of humble suitors had dispersed from the outer court in which she sat as a judge and the shouts of the praisers rushing up and down beyond the fence and roaring out her titles had died away and having dismissed the obsequious maidens who waited upon her she retired to the solitude of her hut to restah then it was different then she lay down upon her bed of rich furs and at times burst into tears because she who seemed to be a supernatural queen was really but a white girl deserted by god and man  now it was the season of thunderstorms and almost every afternoon these dreadful tempests broke over her kraal which shook in the roll and crash of the meeting clouds while beyond the fence the jagged lightning struck and struck again upon the ironstone of the hillside  she had never feared such storms before but now they terrified her she dreaded their advent and the worst of it was that she must not show her dread she who was supposed to rule and direct the lightning indeed the bounteous rains which fell ensuring a full harvest after several years of drought were universally attributed to the good influence of her presence in the land in the same way when a thunderbolt struck the hut of a doctor who but a day or two before had openly declared his disbelief in her powers killing him and his principal wife and destroying his kraal by fire the accident was attributed to her vengeance or to that of the heavens who were angry at this lack of faith after this remarkable exhibition of supernatural strength needless to say the voice of adverse criticism was stayed rachel became supreme  but the storms passed and when they had rolled away at length doing her no hurt and the sun shone out again she would go and sit beneath the trees at the edge of the beautiful pool until the closing lilies and the chill of the air told her that night drew on  oh those long nightshow endless they seemed to rachel in her loneliness now she who used to sleep so well could not sleep or when she slept she dreamed she dreamed of her mother always of her mother that she was ill and calling her until she came to believe that in truth this was so so much did this conviction work upon her mind that she determined not to wait for the return of noie but at all costs to try to leave zululand and through tamboosa declared her will to the king   next morning the answer cams back that of course none could control her movements but if she would go she must fly as all the rivers were in flood as she might see if she would walk to the top of the mountain behind her kraal tamboosa added that a company of men who had been sent to recapture ishmael were kept for a week upon the banks of the first of them and at length being unable to cross had returned as her messenger had done knowing from other sources that this was true rachel made no answer what she did not know however was that ishmael had crossed the smaller rivers before the flood came down and gone on to meet the soldiers who were ordered to await him on the banks of the tugela  escape was evidently impossible at present and if it had been otherwise clearly the zulus did not mean to let her go she must abide here in the company of her terrors and her dreams  at length happily for her these distressing dreams of rachels began to be varied by others of a pleasanter complexion of which although they were vivid enough she could only remember upon waking that they had to do with richard darrien the companion of her adventure in the river of whom she had heard nothing for so many years for aught she knew he might have died long ago and yet she did not think that he was dead well if he lived he might have forgotten her and yet she did not believe that he had forgotten her he who as a boy had wished to follow her all his life and whom she had thought of day by day from that hour to this yes she had thought of him but not thus why at such a time did he arise in strength before her seeming to occupy all her soul why was her mind never free of him could it be that they were about to meet again she shivered as the hope took hold of her shivered with joy and remembered that her mother had always said that they would meet could it be that he of all men on the earth for if he lived he was a man now was coming to rescue her oh then she would fear nothing then in every peril she would feel safe as a child in its mothers arms no the thing was too happy to come about her imagination played tricks with her no more and yet and yet why did he haunt her sleep  the dreary days went on a month had passed since noie vanished over yonder ridge and worst of all for three nights the dreams of richard had departed while those of her mother remained  rachel was worn out she was in despair all that morning she had spent in trying a long and heavy case which occupied but wearied her mind one of those eternal cases about the inheritance of cattle which were claimed by three brothers descendants of different wives of a grandfather who had owned the herd finally she had effected a compromise between the parties and amidst their salutes and acclamations retired to her hut but she could not eat the sameness of the food disgusted her neither could she rest for the daily tempest was coming up and the heavy atmosphere or the electricity with which it was charged and the overpowering heat exasperated her nervous system and made sleep impossible at length came the usual rush of icy wind and the bursting of the great storm the thunder crashed and bellowed the lightning flickered and flared the rain fell in a torrent it passed as it always did and the sun shone out again gasping with relief rachel went out of the ovenlike hut into the cool sweet air and sat down upon a tanned bulls hide which she had ordered her servants to spread for her by the pool of water upon the bank beneath the trees it was very pleasant here and the raindrops shaken from the wet leaves fell upon her fevered face and hands and refreshed her  she tried to forget her troubles for a little while and began to think of richard darrien her boylover of a longpast hour wondering what he looked like now that he was grown to be a man  if only you would come to help me oh richard if only you would come to help me the poor wornout girl murmured to herself and so murmuring fell asleep  suddenly it seemed to her that she was wide awake and staring into a part of the pool beneath her where the bottom was of granite and the water clear in this water she saw a picture she saw a great laager of waggons and outside of one of them a group of bearded joviallooking men smoking and talking presently another man of sturdy build and resolute carriage who was followed by a weary kaffir walked up to them his back was towards her so that she could not see his face but now she was able to hear all that was said although the voices seemed thin and far away  what is it nephew asked the oldest of the bearded men speaking in dutch why are you in such a hurry  this uncle he answered in the same language and in a pleasant voice that sounded familiar to rachels ears that spy quabi whom we sent out a long time ago and who was reported dead reached dingaans kraal and has come back with a strange story  almighty grunted the old man all these spies have strange stories but let him tell it speak on swartzel footnote blackfellow   then the tired spy began to talk telling a long tale he described how he had got into zululand and reached umgugundhlovo and lodged there with a relative of his and done his best to collect information as to the attitude of the king and indunas towards the boers while he was there the news came that the white spirit who was called inkosazanayzoola was approaching the kraal from natal where she dwelt with her parents who were teachers  almighty interrupted the old man again what rubbish is this how can a spirit white or black have parents who are teachers  the wearylooking spy answered that he did not know it was not for him to answer riddles all he knew was that there was great excitement about the coming of this queen of the heavens and he being desirous of obtaining firsthand information slipped out of the town with his relative and walked more than a days journey on the path that ran to the tugela till they came to a place where they hid themselves to see her pass this place he described with minuteness so minutely indeed that in her dream rachel recognised it well it was the spot where the witchdoctoress had died he went on with his story he told of her appearance riding on the white horse and surrounded by an impi he described her beauty her white cloak her hair hanging down her back the rod of horn she carried in her hand the colour of her eyes the shape of her features everything about her as only a native can then he told of the incident of the cattle rushing across her path of the death of the bull that charged her of the appearance of the furious witchdoctoress who seized the rein of the horse of the pointing of the wand and the instant execution of the woman  he told of how he had followed the impi to the great place of the story of noie as he had heard it and the reports that had reached him concerning the interview between the king and this white inkosazana who it was said advised him not to fight the boers  and where is she now asked the old dutchman  there at umgugundhlovo he answered ruling the land as its head isanuzi though it is said that she desires to escape only the zulus will not let her go  i think that we should find out more about this woman especially as she seems to be a friend to our people said the old boer now who dares to go and learn the truth  i will go said the young man who had brought in the spy and as he spoke he turned and lo his face was the face of richard darrien bearded and grown to manhood but without doubt richard darrien and none other   why do you offer to undertake so dangerous a mission asked the boer looking at the young man kindly is it because you wish to see this beautiful white witch of whom yonder quabi tells us such lies nephew  the shadow of richard nodded and his face reddened for the boers around him were laughing at him  that is right uncle he answered boldly you think me a fool but i am not many years ago i knew a little maid who was the daughter of a teacher and who if she lives must have grown into such a woman as quabi describes well i joined you boers last year in order to look for that maid and i am going to begin to look for her across the river yonder  as the words reached whatever sense of rachels it was that heard them of a sudden in an instant laager boers and richard vanished in her sleep she tried to recreate them at first without avail then the curtain of darkness appeared to lift and in the still water of the pool she saw another picture that of richard darrien mounted on a black horse with one white foot riding along a native path through a bushclad country while by his side trotted the spy whose name was quabi  they were talking together and she heard or at any rate knew their words  how far is it now to umgugundhlovo asked richard  three days journey inkosi if we are not stopped by flooded rivers answered quabi  for one second only rachel saw and heard these things then they too passed away and she awoke to see in front of her the pool empty save for its lilies and above to hear the whispering of the evening wind among the trees    chapter xiii  richard comes   as the sun set rachel rose and walked to her hut she was utterly dazed she could not understand was this but a fiction of an overwrought and disordered mind or had she seen a vision of things passing or that had passed far away if it were a dream then this was but another drop in her cup of bitterness if a true visionoh then what did it mean to her it meant that richard darrien lived richard of whom her heart had been full for years it meant that his heart was full of her also for had she not seemed to hear him say that he had travelled from the cape with the boers to look for her and was he not journeying alone through a hostile land to pursue his search who would do such a thing for the sake of a girl unlessunless it meant that he would protect her would rescue her from her terrible plight would take her from among these savages to her home againoh and perhaps much more that she did not dare to picture to herself  yet how could such things be they were contrary to experience at any rate to the experience of white folk though natives would believe in them easily enough yet in nature things might be possible which were generally held to be impossible her mother had certain giftshad she perhaps inherited them had her helplessness appealed to the pity of some higher power had her ceaseless prayers been heard yet why should the universal laws be stretched for her why should she be allowed to lift a corner of the black veil of ignorance that hems us in and see a glimpse of what lies beyond if richard were really coming in a day or two she would have learned of his arrival naturally there was no need that these mysterious influences should be set to work to inform her of his approach  how selfish she was the warning might concern him not her it was probable enough that the zulus would kill a solitary white man especially if they discovered that he proposed to visit their inkosazana well she had the power to protect him if she threw her mantle over him no man in all the land would dare to do him violence surely it was for this reason that she had been allowed to learn these things if she had learned them not for her own sake but his if she had learned them well she would take the risk would run the chance of failure and of mockery yes and of the loss of her power among these people it should be done at once  rachel clapped her hands and a maiden appeared whom she bade summon the captain of the guard without the gate presently he came surrounded by a band of her women since no man might visit the inkosazana alone bidding him to cease from his salutations she commanded him to go swiftly to the great place and pray of dingaan that he would send her an escort and a litter as she must see him that night on a matter which would not brook delay  in an hour just after she had finished her food which she ate with more appetite than she had known for days it was reported that they were there throwing on her white cloak and taking her horn wand she entered the litter and guarded by a hundred men was borne swiftly to the house of dingaan at its gate she descended and once more entered that court by the moonlight  as before there sat the king and his indunas without the great hut and while she walked towards them every man rose crying hail inkosazana yes even dingaan mountain of flesh though he was struggled from his stool and saluted her rachel acknowledged the salutation by raising her wand motioned to them to be seated and waited  art thou come white one asked dingaan to make clear those dark words thou spokest to us a moon ago  nay king she answered what i said then i said once and for all read thou the saying as thou wilt or let the ghostpeople interpret it to thee hear me king and councillors ye have kept me here when i would be gone my business being ended that i might be a judge among this people ye have told me that the rivers were in flood that the beast i rode was sick that evil would befall the land if i deserted you now i know and ye know that if it pleased me i could have departed when and whither i would but it was not fitting that the inkosazana should creep out of zululand like a thief in the night so i abode on in my house yonder yet my heart grew wrath with you and i to whom the white people listen also was half minded to bring hither the thousands of the amaboona who are encamped beyond the buffalo river that they might escort me to my home  now at these bold words the king looked uneasy and one of the councillors whispered to another  how knows she that the white men are camped beyond the buffalo  yet went on rachel i did not do so for then there must have been much fighting and bloodshed and blood i hate but i have done this with these amaboona travels an english chief a young man one darrien whom i knew from long years ago and who does me reverence him then i have commanded to journey hither and to lead me to my own place across the tugela tonight i am told he sleeps a short three days journey from this town and i am come here to bid you send out swift messengers to guide him hither  she ceased and they stared at her awhile then the king asked  what messenger is it inkosazana that thou hast sent to this white chief dario we have seen none pass from thy house  dost thou think then king that thou canst see my messengers my thoughts flew from me to him and called in his ear in the night and i saw his coming in the still pool that lies near my huts  ow exclaimed one of the council she sent her thoughts to him like birds and she saw his coming in the water of the pool great is the magic of the inkosazana  the chief darrien went on rachel without heeding the interruption although she noted that it was mopo of the withered hand who had spoken from beneath the blanket wrapped about his head may be known thus he is fair of face with eyes like my eyes and beard and hair of the colour of gold if i saw right he rides upon a black horse with one white foot and his only companion is a kaffir named quabi who i think and she passed her hand across her forehead yes who was surely visiting a relation of his at this the great place when i crossed the tugela  now the king asked if any knew of this quabi and an induna answered in an awed voice that it was true that a man so called had been in the town at the time given by the inkosazana staying with a soldier whose name he mentioned but who was now away on service he had however departed before the inkosazana arrived or so he believed whither he knew not  i thought it was so went on rachel as i saw him in the pool he is a thin man whose shoulders stoop and whose beard is white although his hair is black he wears no ring upon his head  that is the man said the induna being a stranger i noted him well as it was my business to do  summon the messengers swiftly king went on rachel and let them depart at once for know that this white chief and his servant are under the protection of the heavens and if harm comes to them then i lay my curse upon the land and it shall break up in blood and ruin bid them say to darrien that the inkosazanayzoola she who stood with him once on the rock in the river while the lightnings fell and the lions roared about them sends him greetings and awaits him  now dingaan turned to an induna and said  go do the bidding of the inkosazana bid swift runners search out this white chief and lead him to her house and remember that if aught of ill befalls him those men die and thou diest also  the induna leapt up and departed and rachel also made ready to go a moment later the captain of the gate entered fell upon his knees before dingaan and said  o king tidings  what are they man he asked  king the watchmen report that it has been called from hilltop to hilltop that a white man who rides a black horse has crossed the buffalo and travels towards the great place what is thy pleasure shall he be killed or driven back  when did that news come asked the king in the silence which followed this announcement  not a minute gone he answered the inner watchman ran with it and is without the gates there has been no other tidings from the west for days  thy watchmen call but slowly king the water in the pool speaks swifter said rachel then still in the midst of a heavy silence for this thing was fearful to them she turned and departed  so it is true so it is true rachel kept repeating to herself the words suiting themselves to the time of the footfall of her bearers she was spent with all the labour and emotions of that long day culminating in the last scene when she must play her dangerous superhuman part before these keenwitted savages she could think no more scarcely could she undress and throw herself upon her bed in the hut yet that night she slept soundly better than she had done since noie went away no dreams came to trouble her and in the morning she woke refreshed  but now doubts did come might she not be mistaken after all she knew the marvellous powers of the natives in the matter of the transmission of news powers so strange that many even among white people attributed them to witchcraft she had no doubt therefore as to the fact of some englishman or boer having entered zululand doubtless the news of his arrival had been conveyed over scores of miles of country by the calling of it as the captain said from hill to hill or in some other fashion but might not this arrival and the circumstance of her dream or vision be a mere coincidence what was there to show that the stranger who was riding a black horse was really richard darrien perhaps it was all a mistake and he was only one of those white wanderers of the stamp of the outcast ishmael who even at that date made their way into savage countries for the purposes of gain or to enjoy a life of licence and yet and yet quabi of whom she also dreamed had visited the great placeas she dreamed  the next two days were terrible to rachel she endured them as she had endured all those that went before trying the cases that were brought to her keeping up her appearance of distant dignity and utter indifference she asked no questions since to do so would be to show doubt and weakness although she was aware that the tale of her vision had spread through the land and that the issue of the matter was of intense interest to thousands from some talk which she overheard while she pretended to be listening to evidence she learned even that two men going to execution had discussed it saying that they regretted they would not live to know the truth on the second day she did hear one piece of news for although she sat by her pool and again tried to sleep by its waters these remained blind and dumb  the induna tamboosa on one of his ceremonial visits after speaking of the health of her mare which it seemed was improving mentioned incidentally that the messengers running night and day had met the white man and called back that he was safe and well he added that had it not been for her vision this said white man would certainly have been killed as a spy  yes i knew that answered rachel indifferently although her heart thumped within her bosom i forget if i said that the inkosi was to be brought straight here when he arrives if not let it be known that such is my command the king can receive him afterwards if it pleases him to do so as probably we shall not depart until the next day  then she yawned and as though by an afterthought asked if any news had been called back from noie  tamboosa answered no no system of intelligence had been organised in the direction in which she had gone for that country was empty of enemies and indeed of population however this would not distress the inkosazana who had only to consult her spirit to see all that happened to her servant  rachel replied that of course this was so but as a matter of fact she had not troubled about the matter then waved her hand to show that the interview was at an end  it was the morning of the third day and while rachel was delivering judgment in a case a messenger entered and whispered something to the induna on duty who rose and saluted her  what is it she asked  only this inkosazana the white inkoos from the buffalo river has arrived and is without  good said rachel let him wait there then she went on with her judgment yes she went on although her eyes were blind and the blood beating in her ears sounded like the roll of drums she finished it and after a decent interval bowed her head in acknowledgement of the customary salutes and made the sign which intimated that the court was to be cleared  slowly slowly all the crowd melted away leaving her alone with her women  go she said to one of them and bid the captain admit this white chief say that he is to come unarmed and alone then depart all of you if i should need you i will call  the girl went on her errand while her companions filed away through the back gate of the inner fence rachel glanced round to make sure of her solitude it was complete no one was left there she sat in state upon her carved stool her wand in her hand her white cloak upon her shoulders and the sunlight that passed over the round of the hut behind her glinting on her hair till it shone like a crown of gold but leaving her face in shadow sat quite still like some lovely tinted statue  the gate of the inner fence opened and closed again after a man who entered he walked forward a few paces then stood still for the flood of light that revealed him so clearly at first prevented him from seeing her seated in the shadow oh there could be no further doubtbefore her was richard darrien the lad grown to manhood from whom she had parted so many years ago now as then he was not tall though very strongly built and for the rest save for his short beard the change in him seemed little the same clear thoughtful grey eyes the same pleasant open face the same determined mouth she was not disappointed in him she knew this at once she liked him as well as she had done at the first  now he caught sight of her and stayed there staring she tried to speak to welcome him but could not no words would come he also seemed to be smitten with dumbness and thus the two of them remained a while at last he took off his hat almost mechanically as though from instinct and said vaguely  you are the inkosazanayzoola are you not  i am so called she answered softly and with effort  the moment that he heard her voice with a movement so swift that it was almost a spring he advanced to her saying  now i am sure you are rachel dove the little girl whooh rachel how lovely you have grown  i am glad you think so richard she answered again in the same low deep voice a voice laden with the love within her and reddening to her eyes then she let fall her wand and rising stretched out both her hands to him  they were face to face now but he did not take those hands he passed his arms about her drew her to him unresisting and kissed her on the lips she slipped from his embrace down on to her stool white now as she had been red then while he stood over her trembling and confused rachel looked up her beautiful eyes filled with tears and whispered  why should i be ashamed it is fate  yes he answered fate   for so both of them knew it to be though they had seen each other but once before their love was so great the bond between their natures so perfect and complete that this outward expression of it would not be denied here was a mighty truth which burst through all wrappings of convention and proclaimed itself in its pure strength and beauty that kiss of theirs was the declaration of an existent unity which circumstances did not create nor their will control and thus they confessed it to each other  how long she asked looking up at him  eight years today he answered since i rode away after those waggons  eight years she repeated and no word from you all that time you have behaved badly to me richard  no no i could not find out i wrote three times but always the letters were returned except one that went to the wrong people who were angry about it then two years ago i heard that your father and mother had been in natal but had gone to england and that you were dead yes a man told me that you were dead he added with a gulp i suppose he was speaking of somebody else as he could not remember whether the name was dove or cove or perhaps he was just lying at any rate i did not believe him i always felt that you were alive  why did you not come to see richard  why because it was impossible for years my father was an invalid paralysed and i was his only child and could not leave him  she looked a question at him  yes he answered with a nod dead ten months ago and for a few weeks i had to remain to arrange about the property of which he left a good deal for we did well of late years just then i heard a rumour of an english missionary and his wife and daughter who were said to be living somewhere beyond the boundaries of natal in a savage place on the transvaal side of the drakensberg and as some boers i knew were trekking into that country i came with them on the chancea pretty poor one as the story was vague enough  you cameyou came to seek the girl rachel dove  of course otherwise why should i have left my farms down in the cape to risk my neck among these savages  and then went on rachel you or somebody else sent in the spy quabi who returned to the boer camp with his story about the inkosazanayzoola you remember you brought him in limping to that old fellow with a grey beard and a large pipe and the others who laughed at the tale i mean when you said that this inkosazana seemed very like an english maid the daughter of a teacher whom you were looking for and that you would go to find out the truth of the business  yes thats all right but rachel he added with a start how do you know anything about itoom piet and the rest and the words i used your spies must be very good and quick for you cant have seen quabi  my spies are good and quick did you get my message sent by the kings men it was that she who stood with you on the rock in the river greeted you and awaited you  yes i could not understand i do not understand now just before that they were going to kill me as a boer spy who told you everything  my heart she answered smiling i dreamed it all i suppose that i was allowed to save your life that i might bring you here to save me listen now richard while i tell you the strangest story that you ever heard and if you dont believe it go and ask the king and his indunas  then she told him of her vision by the pool and all that happened after it when she had finished richard could only shake his head and say  still i dont understand but no wonder these zulus have made a goddess of you well rachel what is to happen now if you are to stop here they maynt care for me as a high priest  i am not i am going home and you must take me i told them that you were coming to do so you have your horse have you not the black horse with the white forefoot well we will start at onceno you must eat first and there are things to arrange now stand at a distance from me and look as respectful as you can for i fill a strange position here  then rachel clapped her hands and the women came running in  bring food for the inkosi darrien she said and send hither the captain of the gate  presently the man arrived crouched up in token of respect and shouting her titles  go to the king said rachel and tell him the inkosazana commands that the horse on which she came be brought to her at once as she leaves zululand for a while also that an impi be assembled within an hour to escort her and this white chief her servant to the tugela say that the inkosi darrien has brought her tidings which make it needful that she should travel hence speedily if the zulus her people are to be saved from great misfortune and say too that he goes with her if the king or his indunas would see the inkosazana or the chief darrien let him or the indunas meet them on their road since they have no time to visit the great place let tamboosa be in command of the impi and say also that if it is not here at once the inkosazana will be angry and summon an impi of her own go now for the lives of many hang upon your speed yes the lives of the greatest in the land  the man saluted and shot away like an arrow  will they obey you asked richard  i think so because they are afraid of me especially since i saw you coming at any rate we must act at once it is our best chancebefore they have time to think here is some foodeat woman go tell the guard that the inkosis horse must be fed at the gate for he will need it presently and his servant also  i have no servant inkosazana broke in richard i left quabi at a kraal fifty miles away laid up with a cut foot as soon as he is better he will slip back across the buffalo river  then while richard ate which he did heartily enough for joy had made him very hungry they talked who had much to tell he asked her why she thought it necessary to leave zululand at once she answered for two reasons first because of her desperate anxiety about her father and mother as to whom her heart foreboded ill and secondly for his own sake she explained that the zulus who had set her up as an image or a token of the guiding spirit of their nation were madly jealous concerning her so jealous that if he remained here long she was by no means certain that even her power could protect him when they came to understand that he was much to her it was impossible that she could see him often and much more so that he could remain in her kraal therefore if they were detained he would be obliged to live at some distance from her where an assegai might find him at night or poison be put in his food at present they were impressed by her foreknowledge of his arrival and that was why he had been admitted to her at once but this would wear offand then who could say especially if ishmael returned  he asked who ishmael was and what he had to do with her rachel told him briefly and though she suppressed much he looked very grave at that story  while she was finishing it a woman called without for leave to enter and as before rachel bade him stand in a respectful attitude and at a distance from her richard obeyed and the woman came in to say that certain of the kings indunas craved audience with her they were admitted and saluted her in their usual humble fashion but of richard beyond eyeing him curiously and as she thought hostilely they took not the slightest heed   are all things ready for my journey as i commanded asked rachel at once  inkosazana answered their spokesman they are ready for how canst thou be disobeyed tamboosa and the impi wait without yet inkosazana the heart of the black one and the hearts of his councillors and of all the zulu people are cut in two because thou wouldst go and leave them mourning their hearts are sore also with this white man dario who has come to lead thee hence so sore that were he not thy servant the induna added grimly he at least should stay in zululand  he is my servant answered rachel haughtily whom i sent for let that suffice remember my words all of you and let them be told again in the ears of the king that if any harm comes to this white chief who is my guest and yours then there will be blood between me and the people of the zulus that shall be terribly avenged in blood  the indunas seemed to cower at this declaration but made no answer only the chief of them said  the king would know if the inkosi thy servant brings thee any tidings of the amaboona the white folk with whom he has been journeying  he brings tidings that they seek peace with the zulus to whom they will do no hurt if no hurt is done to them shall i tell them that the zulus also seek peace  the king gave us no message on that matter inkosazana replied the induna he awaits the coming of the prophets of the ghostfolk to interpret the meaning of thy words and of the omen of the falling star  so be it said rachel when my servant noie returns let her be sent on to me at once that i may hear and consider the words of her people and she began to rise from her seat to intimate that the interview was finished  inkosazana said the induna hurriedly one question from the kingwhen dost thou return to zululand  i return when it is needful fear not i think that i shall return but i say to the king and to all of you be careful when i come that there is no blood between me and you lest great evil fall upon your heads from heaven i have spoken good fortune go with you till we meet again  the indunas looked at each other then rose and departed humbly as they had entered                                       an hour later surrounded by the impi and followed by richard rachel was on the tugela road at the crest of a hill she pulled rein and looked back at the great kraal umgugundhlovu then she beckoned richard to her side and said  i think that before long i shall see that hateful place again  why he asked  because of the way in which those indunas looked at each other just now there was some evil secret in their eyes richard i am afraid    chapter xiv  what chanced at ramah   the news which reached rachel that ishmael had been ill after the rough handling of the captains in her presence was true enough for many days he was far too ill to travel and when he recovered sufficiently to start he could only journey slowly to the tugela  it will be remembered that she was told that he had escaped as indeed he seemed to do slipping off at night but this escape of his was carefully arranged beforehand nor did any attempt to recapture him upon his way when at length he came to the river he found the small impi awaiting him not knowing whither they were to go or what they were to do their only orders being that they must obey him in all things he found also that the tugela was in furious flood so that to ford it proved quite impossible here then he was obliged to remain for ten full days while the water ran down  ishmael was not idle during those ten days which be spent in recovering his health and incidentally in reflection thus he thought a great deal of his past life and did not find the record satisfactory with his exact history we need not trouble ourselves he was wellborn as he had told rachel but had been badly brought up his strong passions had led him into trouble while young and instead of trying to reform him his belongings had cast him off then he had enlisted in the army and so reached south africa there he committed a crimeas a matter of fact it was murder or something like itand fled from justice far into the wilderness where a touch of imagination prompted him to take the name of ishmael  for a while this new existence suited him well enough thus he had wives in plenty of a sort and he grew rich becoming just such a person as might be expected from his environment and unchecked natural tendencies at length it happened that he met rachel who awoke in him certain forgotten associations she was an english lady and he remembered that once he had been an english gentleman years and years ago also she was beautiful which appealed to his strong animal nature and spiritual which appealed to a materialist soaked in kaffir superstition so he fell in love with her really in love that is to say he came to desire to make her his wife more than he desired anything else on earth for her sake he grew to dislike his black consorts however handsome even the heaping up of herds of cattle after the native fashion ceased to appeal to him he wanted to live as his forbears had lived quietly respectably with a woman of his own class  so he made advances to her with the results we know for fifteen years or more he had been a savage and he could not hide his savagery from her eyes any more than he could break off the ties and entanglements that had grown up about him had she happened to care for him it is very possible however that in this he would have succeeded in time he might even have reformed himself completely and died in old age a muchrespected colonial gentleman perhaps a member of the local legislature but she did not she detested him she knew him for what he was a cowardly outcast whose good looks did not appeal to her so the spark of his new aspirations was trampled out beneath her merciless heel and there remained only the acquired savagery and superstition mixed with the inborn instincts of a blackguard  it was this superstition of his that had brought all her troubles upon rachel for however it came about he had conceived the idea that she was something more than an ordinary woman and with many tales of her mysterious origin and powers imparted it to the zulus in whose minds it was fostered by the accident of the coincidence of her native name and personal loveliness with those of the traditional white spirit of their race and by mopos identification of her with that spirit thus she became their goddess and his at any rate for a time but while they desired to worship her only and use her rumoured wisdom as an oracle he sought to make her his wife the more impossible it became the more he sought it she refused him with contumely and he laid plots to decoy her to zululand thinking that there she would be in his power in the end he succeeded basely enough only to find that he was in her power and that the contumely and more were still his share  but all this did not in the least deter him from his aim and as it chanced fortune had put other cards into his hand he knew that rachel would not stay among the zulus as they knew it therefore they had commissioned him to bring her people to her if her people were not brought he was sure that she would come to seek them and if she found no one then where could she go or at least who would be at hand to help her surely his opportunity had come at last and marriage by capture did not occur to him who had spent so many years among savages as a crime from which to shrink only he feared that the prospective captive the inkosazanayzoola was not one with whom it was safe to trifle but his love was stronger than his fear he thought that he would take the risk  such were the reflections of ishmael upon the banks of the flooded tugela and when at length the waters went down sufficiently to enable him and the soldiers under his command to cross into natal he was fully determined to put them into practice if the chance came his way how this might best be done he left to luck for if it could be avoided he did not wish to have more blood upon his hands only rachel must be rendered homeless and friendless for then who could protect her from him an answer came into his mindshe might protect herself or that power which seemed to go with her might protect her something warned him that this evil enterprise was very dangerous yet the fire that burnt within him drove him on to face the danger  ishmael was still on the zululand bank of the river when one day about noon an urgent message reached him from dingaan it said that the king was angry as a wounded buffalo to learn as he had just done that he ibubesi still lingered on his road and had not carried out his mission the inkosazana accompanied by a white man was travelling to ramah and unless he went forward at once would overtake him therefore he must march instantly and bring back the old teacher and his wife as he had been bidden should he meet the inkosazana and her companion as he returned with the white prisoners she must not be touched or insulted in any way only his ears and those of the soldiers with him were to be deaf to her orders or entreaties to release them for then she would surely turn and follow of her own accord back to the great place if the white man with her made trouble or resisted he was to be bound but on no account must his blood be made to flow for if this happened it would bring a curse upon the land and he dingaan swore by the head of the black one who was gone that is chaka that he would kill him ibubesi in payment yes he would smear him with honey and bind him over an antheap in the sun till he died if he hunted africa from end to end to catch him moreover should he fail in the business he would send a regiment and destroy his town at mafooti and put his wives and people to the spear and seize his cattle all this also he swore by the head of the black one  now when ishmael received this message he was much frightened for he knew that these were not idle threats indeed the exhausted messenger told him that never had any living man seen dingaan so mad with rage as he was when he learned that he ibubesi was still lingering on the banks of the tugela adding that he had foamed at the mouth with fury and uttered terrible threats ishmael sent him back with a humble answer pointing out that it had been impossible to cross the river which was in wrath but that now he would do all things as he was commanded and especially that not a hair of the white mans head should be harmed  then you must do them quickly said the messenger with a grim smile as he rose and prepared to go for know that the inkosazana is not more than half a days march behind you accompanied by the white inkoos dario  what is this dario like asked ishmael  oh he is young and very handsome with hair and beard of gold and eyes that are such as those of the inkosazana herself some say that he is her brother another child of the heavens and some that he is her husband who am i that i should speak of such high things but it is evident that she loves him very much for by her magic she told the king of his coming and even when he is behind her she is always trying to turn her head to look at him  oh she loves him very much does she said ishmael setting his white teeth then he turned and calling the captain of the impi gave orders that the river must be crossed at once for so the king commanded and it was better to die with honour by water than with shame by the spear  so they waded and swam the river with great difficulty but as it chanced without loss of life ishmael being borne over it upon the shoulders of the strongest men upon its further bank he summoned the captains and delivered to them the orders of the king then they set out for ramah ishmael carried in a litter made of boughs  whilst the soldiers were constructing this litter he called two men of the swampdwellers who had their homes upon the banks of the tugela and promising them a reward bade them run to his town mafooti and tell his head man there to come at once with thirty of the best soldiers and to hide them in the bush of the kloof above ramah where he would join them that night the men who knew ibubesi and what happened to those who failed upon his business went swiftly and a little while afterwards the litter being finished ishmael entered it and the impi started for ramah  before sundown they appeared upon a ridge overlooking the settlement just as the herds were driving the cattle into their kraals seeing the zulus while as yet they were some way off these herds shouted an alarm whereon the people of the place thinking that dingaan had sent a regiment to wipe them out fled to the bush the herds driving the cattle after them man woman and child deserting their pastor who knew nothing of all this being occupied with a sad business they fled incontinently so that when ishmael and the impi entered ramah no one was left in it save a few aged and sick people who could not walk  at the outskirts of the town ishmael descended from his litter and commanded the soldiers to surround it with orders that they were to hurt no one but if the white umfundusi who was called shouter or his wife attempted to escape they were to be seized and brought to him then taking with him some of the captains and a guard of ten men he advanced to the missionhouse  the door was open and followed by the zulus he entered to search the place for he feared that its inhabitants might have seen them and have gone with the others looking into the first room that they reached of which as it chanced the door was also open ishmael saw that this was not so for there upon the bed lay mrs dove apparently very ill while by the side of the bed knelt her husband praying for a few moments ishmael and the savages behind him stood still staring at the pair till suddenly mrs dove turned her head and saw them lifting herself in the bed she pointed with her finger and ishmael noticed that her lips were quite blue and that she did not seem to be able to speak then mr dove observing her outstretched hand looked round he had not seen ishmael since that day when he struck him after their stormy interview at mafooti but recognising the man at once he asked sternly  what are you doing sir with these savages in my house cannot you see that my wife is sick and must not be disturbed  i am sorry ishmael answered shamefacedly for in his heart he was afraid of mr dove but i am sent to you with a message from dingaan the king and he added as an afterthought from your daughter  from my daughter exclaimed mr dove eagerly what of her is she well we cannot get any certain news of her only rumours  i saw her but once replied ishmael and she was well enough then you know the zulus have made her their inkosazana and keep her guarded  does she live quite alone then with these savages  she did but i am sorry i must tell you that she seems to have a companion now some scoundrel of a white man with whom she has taken up he sneered  my daughter take up with a scoundrel of a white man it is false what is this mans name  i dont know but the natives call him dario and say that he is young and has fair hair and that she is in love with him thats all i can tell you about the man  mr dove shook his head but his wife sat up suddenly in bed and plucked him by the sleeve for she had been listening intently to everything that passed  dario young fair hair in love with him she repeated in a thick whisper then added john it is richard darrien grown upthe boy who saved her in the umtooma river years ago and whom she has never forgotten oh thank god thank god with him she will be safe i always knew that he would find her for they belong to each other and she sank back exhausted  thats what the zulus say that they belong to each other replied ishmael with another sneer perhaps they are married native fashion  stop insulting my daughter sir said mr dove angrily she would not take a husband as you take your wives nor if this man is richard darrien as i pray would he be a party to such a thing tell me are they coming here  not they they are far too comfortable where they are also the zulus would prevent them but dont be sad about it for i am sent to take you both to join her at the great place where you are to live  to join her it is impossible ejaculated mr dove glancing at his sick wife  impossible or not youve got to come at once both of you that is the kings order and the inkosazanas wish and what is more there is an impi outside to see that you obey now i give you five minutes to get ready and then we start  man are you mad how can my wife travel to zululand in her state she cannot walk a step  then she can be carried answered ishmael callously come dont waste time in talking those are my orders and i am not going to have my throat cut for either of you if mrs dove wont dress wrap her up in blankets  you go john you go whispered his wife or they will kill you never mind about me my time has come and i die happy for richard darrien is with rachel  the mention of richards name seemed to infuriate ishmael at any rate he said brutally  are you coming or must i use force  coming you wicked villain how can i come shouted mr dove for he was mad with grief and rage be off with your savages i will shoot the first man who lays a finger on my wife and as he spoke he snatched a doublebarrelled pistol which hung upon the wall and cocked it  ishmael turned to the zulus who stood behind him watching this scene with curiosity  seize the shouter he said and bind him lift the old woman on her mattress and carry her if she dies on the road we cannot help it  the captains hesitated not from fear but because mrs doves condition moved even their savage hearts to pity  why do you not obey roared ishmael dogs and cowards it is the kings word take her up or you shall die every man of you you know how knock down the old evildoer with your sticks if he gives trouble  now the men hesitated no longer springing forward several of them seized the mattress and began to lift it bodily mrs dove rose and tried to struggle from the bed then uttered a low moaning cry fell back and lay still  you devils you have killed her gasped mr dove as lifting the pistol he fired at the zulu nearest to him shooting him through the body so that he sank upon the floor dying then fearing lest he should shoot again the captains fell upon the poor old man striking him with kerries and the handles of their spears for they sought to disable him and make him drop the pistol  as it chanced though this was not their intention in the confusion a heavy blow from a knobstick struck him on the temple the second barrel of the pistol went off and the bullet from it but just missed ishmael who was standing to one side when the smoke cleared away it was seen that mr dove had fallen backwards on to the bed the martyrdom he always sought and expected had overtaken him he was quite dead they were both dead  the head induna in command of the impi stepped forward and looked at them then felt their hearts  wow he said these white people have gone beyond they have gone to join the spirits both of them what now ibubesi  ishmael who stood in the corner very whitefaced and staring with round eyes for the tragedy had taken a turn that he did not intend or expect shook himself and rubbed his forehead with his hand answering  carry them into the great place i suppose the king ordered that they should be brought there why did you kill that old shouter you fools he added with irritation you have brought his blood and the curse of the inkosazana on our heads  wow answered the induna again you bade us strike him with sticks and our orders were to obey you who would have guessed that the old mans skull was so thin from thinking you or i would never have felt a tap like that but they are gone beyond and we will not defile ourselves by touching them dead bones are of no use to anyone and their ghosts might haunt us come brethren let us go back to the king and make report the order was ibubesis and we are not to blame  yes they answered let us go back and make report are you coming ibubesi  not i he answered do i want to have my neck twisted because of your clumsiness go you and win your own peace if you can but if you see the inkosazana my advice is that you avoid her lest she learn the truth and bring your deaths upon you for know she travels hither and she called these folk father and mother  without doubt we will avoid her said the captain who fear her terrible curse but ibubesi it is on you that it will fall not on us who did but obey you as we were bidden yes on you she will bring down death before this moon dies make your peace with the heavens if you can ibubesi as we go to try to make ours with the king  would you bewitch me you illomened dog shouted ishmael wiping the sweat of fear off his brow may you soon be stiff  nay nay ibubesi it is you who shall be stiff the inkosazana will see to that and were i not sure of it i would make you so myself who am a noble who will not be called names by a white umfagozan a lowborn fellow who plots for blood but leaves its shedding to brave men farewell ibubesi if the jackals leave anything of you after the inkosazana has spoken we will return to bury your bones and he turned to go  stay cried the dying man on the floor would you leave me here in pain my brothers  the induna stepped to him and examined him  it is mortal he said shaking his head right through the liver why did not the white mans thunder smite ibubesi instead of you and save the inkosazana some trouble well your arms are still strong and here is a spear you know where to strike be quick with your messages yes yes i will see that they are delivered goodnight my brother do you remember how we stood side by side in that big fight twenty years ago when the pondo giant got me down and you fell on the top of me and thrust upwards and killed him it was a very good fight was it not we will talk it over again in the world of spirits goodnight my brother yes yes i will deliver the message to your little girl and tell her where the necklace is to be found and that you wish her to name her firstborn son after you goodnight use that assegai at once for your wound must be painful or perhaps as you are down upon the ground ibubesi will do it for you goodnight my brother and ibubesi goodnight to you also we cross the tugela by another drift wait you here for the inkosazana and tell her how the shouter died  then they turned and went the wounded man watched them pass the door and when the last of them had gone he used the assegai upon himself and with his failing hand flung it feebly at ishmael  the dying zulus spear struck ishmael who had turned his head away upon the cheek just pricking it and causing the blood to flow no more ishmael was still also paralysed almost or so he seemed for even the pain of the cut did not make him move he stared at the bodies of mr and mrs dove he stared at the dead zulu and in his heart a voice cried you have murdered them by now they are pleading to god for vengeance on you ishmael the outcast you will never dare to be alone again for they will haunt you  as he thought it the relaxed hand of the old clergyman who had fallen in a sitting posture on the bed slipped from his wounded head which he had clasped just before he died and for a moment seemed to point at him he shivered but still he could not stir how dreadful and solemn was that face and those eyes how they searched out the black record of his heart the quiet rays of the afternoon sun suddenly flowed in through the window place and illumined the awful accusing face till it shone like that of a saint in glory a drop of blood from the cut upon his cheek splashed on to the floor and the noise of it struck on his strained nerves loud as a pistolshot blood his own blood wherewith he must pay for that which he had shed the sight and the thought seemed to break the spell with an oath he bounded out of the room like a frightened wolf those dead staring at him as he went and rushed from the house that held them  beyond its walls ishmael paused the zulus had fled in one direction and the inhabitants of ramah in another there was no one to be seen his eye fell upon the dense mass of bush above the station and he remembered the message that he had sent to his own people to meet him there perhaps they had already arrived he would go to see he who was in such sore need of human company as he went his numbed faculties returned to him and in the open light of day some of his terror passed he began to think again what was done was done he could not bring the dead back to life he was not really to blame and after all things had worked out well for him save for this white man dario rachel was now alone in the world and dead people did not speak there was no one to tell her of his share in the tragedy why should she not turn to him who had no one else to whom she could go the white man if he were still with her could be got rid of somehow very likely he would run away and they two would be left quite alone at any rate it was for her sake that be had entered on this black road of sin and what did one step more matter the step that led him to his reward of course it might lead him somewhere else rachel was a woman to be feared and the zulus were to be feared and other things to which he could give no shape or name but that he felt pressing round him were still more to be feared perhaps he would do best to fly far into the interior or by ship to some other land where none would know him and his black story what fly companioned by those ghosts and leave rachel the woman for whom he burned with this dario whom the zulus said she loved and with whom her mother just before her end had declared that she would be safe never she was his he had bought her with blood and he would have the due the devil owed him  he was in the bush now and a voice called him that of his head man  come out you dog he said searching the dense foliage with his eyes and the man appeared saluting him humbly  we received your message and we have come inkoos we are but just arrived what has chanced here that the town is so still  the zulus have been and gone they have killed the white teacher and his wife though i thought to save themlook at my wound also the people are fled  ah replied the head man that was an ill deed for he was holy and a great prophet and doubtless his spirit is strong to revenge well for you is it master that you had no hand in the deed as at first i feared might be the case for know that last night a strange dog climbed on to your hut and howled there and would not be driven away nor could we kill it with spears so we think it was a ghost all your wives thought that evil had drawn near to you   ishmael struck him across the mouth exclaiming  be silent you accursed wizard or you shall howl louder than your ghostdog  i meant no harm answered the man humbly but with a curious gleam in his eye what are your commands chief  that we watch here i think that the daughter of the shouter she who is called inkosazanayzoola is coming and she may need help have you brought thirty men with you as i bade you through my messengers  aye ibubesi they are all hidden in the bush i go to summon them though i think that the mighty inkosazana who can command all the zulu impis and all the spirits of the dead will need little help from us    chapter xv  rachel comes home   as rachel had travelled up from the tugela to the great place so she travelled back from the great place to the tugela in state and dignity such as became a thing divine perhaps the first white woman moreover who had ever entered zululand all day she rode alone tamboosa leading the white ox before her and richard following behind while in front and to the rear marched the serried ranks of the impi her escort at night as before she slept alone in the empty kraals provided for her attended by the bestborn maidens richard being lodged in some hut without the fence  so at length about noon one day they reached the banks of the tugela not many hours after ishmael had crossed it and camped there now after she had eaten rachel sent for richard with whom she had found but few opportunities to talk during that journey he came and stood before her as all must do and she addressed him in english while the spies and captains watched him sullenly for they were angry at this use of a foreign tongue which they could not understand preserving a cold and distant air she asked him of his health and how he had fared  well enough he answered and now what are your plans the river is in flood you will find it difficult to cross still it can be done for i hear that the white man ishmael of whom you told me forded it this morning with a company of armed men   aware of the eyes that watched her with an effort rachel showed no surprise  how is that she asked i thought the man fled from zululand many days ago why then does he leave the country with soldiers  i cant tell you rachel there is something queer about the business when i inquire everyone shrugs his shoulders they say that the king knows his own business if i were you i would ask no questions for you will learn nothing and if you do not ask they will think that you know all  i understand she said but richard i must cross the river today you and i must cross it alone and reach ramah tonight richard something weighs upon my heart i am terribly afraid  how will you manage it he asked ignoring the rest  i cant tell you yet richard but keep my horse and yours saddled there where you are encamped and she nodded towards a hut about fifty yards away i think that i shall come to you presently now go  so he saluted her and went  presently rachel sent for tamboosa and the captains and asked the state of the river which was out of sight about half a mile from them they replied that it was very angry none could think of attempting its passage as much water was coming down  is it so she said indifferently well i must look and with slow steps she walked towards the hut where she knew the horses were followed by tamboosa and the captains  reaching it she saw them standing saddled on its further side and by them richard seated on the ground smoking as she came he rose and saluted her but taking no heed of him she went to her grey mare and placing her foot in the stirrup sprang to the saddle motioning to him to do likewise  whither goest thou inkosazana asked tamboosa anxiously  to throw a charm on the waters she answered so that they may run down and i can cross them to morrow come dario and come tamboosa but let the rest stay behind since common eyes must not look upon my magic and he who dares to look shall be struck with blindness  the captains hesitated and turning on them fiercely she commanded them to obey her word lest some evil should befall them  then they fell back and she rode towards the tugela followed by richard on horseback and tamboosa on foot arrived at that spot on the bank where she had received the salutation of the regiment when she entered zululand rachel saw at once that although the great river was full it could easily be forded on horseback calling richard to her she said  we must go and now while there is no one to stop us but tamboosa do not hurt him unless he tries to spear you for he has been kind to me  then she addressed tamboosa saying  i have spoken to the waters and they will not harm me the hour has come when i must leave my people for a while and go forward alone with my white servant dario these are my commands that none should dare to follow me save only yourself tamboosa who can bring on the white ox with its load so soon as the water has run down and deliver them to me at ramah do you hear me  i hear inkosazana answered the old induna and thy words split my heart  yet you will obey them tamboosa  yes i will obey them who know what would befall me otherwise and that it is the kings will that none should dare to thwart thee even if they could yet i think that very soon thou wilt return to thy children therefore why not abide with us until tomorrow when the waters will be low  tamboosa said rachel leaning forward and looking him in the eyes why did ibubesi cross this river with soldiers but a few hours agoibubesi who fled from the great place when the moon was young that now is full look there goes their spoor in the mud  i know not he answered looking down inkosazana tomorrow i will bring on the white ox to ramah and i will bring it alone  so be it tamboosa but if by chance you should not find me ask where ibubesi is and if need be seek for me with an impi tamboosafor me and for this white man dario and again she bent forward and looked at him  i know not what thou meanest inkosazana he replied but of this be sure that if i cannot find thee then i will seek for thee if need be with every spear in zululand at my back  farewell then tamboosa and to the regiment farewell also say to the captains that it is my will that they should return to the great place bearing my greetings to the king and those of the white lord dario look for me tomorrow at ramah  then followed by richard she rode her horse past him into the lip of the water as she went tamboosa drew himself up and gave her the bayète the royal salute  although it was red with earth and flecked with foam and the roar of it was loud as it sped towards the sea the river did not prove very difficult to ford but once indeed were the horses swept off their feet and forced to swim and then but for a few paces after which they regained them and plunged to the farther bank without accident  free at last rachel with our lives before us and nothing more to fear called richard in his cheery voice as he forced his horse alongside of hers then suddenly he caught sight of her face and saw that it was white and drawn as though with pain also that she leaned forward on her saddle clasping its pommel as though she were about to faint  what is it he exclaimed in alarm did the flood frighten you rachelare you ill  for a few moments she made no answer then straightened herself with a sigh and said in a low voice  richard i have been so long among those zulus playing the part of a spirit that i begin to think i am one or that their magic has got hold of me i tell you that in the roar of the water i heard voicesthe voices of my father and mother calling me and speaking of youand richard they seemed to be in great fear and pain for a minute or more i heard them then a dreadful cold wind blew on me not this wind it seemed to come from aboveand everything passed away leaving my mind numb and empty so that i do not remember how we came out of the river dont laugh at me richard it is so the kaffirs are right i have some power of the sort remember how i saw you travelling towards me in the pool  why should i laugh at you dearest he asked anxiously for something of this uncanny fear passed from her mind into his with which it was in tune indeed i dont laugh who know that you are not quite like other women but rachel the strain of those two months has worn you out and now the reaction is too much perhaps it is nothing  perhaps she answered sadly i hope so richard what is the time  about a quarter to six to judge by the sun he answered  then we shall not be able to reach ramah before dark  no rachel but there is a good moon  yes there is a good moon i wonder what it will show us and she shivered  then they pressed their horses to a canter and rode on speaking little for the fount of words seemed to be frozen in them although richard recollected with a curious sense of wonder how he had looked forward to this opportunity of long unfettered talk with rachel and how much he had to tell her over hill and valley through bush and stream they rode till at last with the short twilight they reached the plain that ran to ramah then came the dark in which they must ride slowly till presently the round edge of the moon pushed itself up above the shoulder of a hill and there was light againpure peaceful light that turned the veld to silver and shone whitely on the pale face of rachel  ramah was before them they had met no living thing save some wild game trekking to the water and heard no sound save the distant roar of some beast of prey ramah was before them the moon shone on the roofs of the missionhouse and the little church and the clusters of kaffir huts beyond but oh it was silent no cattle lowed no child cried nor did the bell of the church ring for evening prayer as at this hour it should have done also no lamp showed in the windows of the missionhouse and no smoke rose from the cooking fires of the kraals  where are all the people richard whispered rachel there is the place unharmed but where are the people  but richard could only shake his head the terror of something dreadful had got hold of him also and he knew not what to say  now they had come to the wall of the missionhouse and sprang from their horses which they left loose as they advanced side by side towards the open gate something leapt the stoep and rushed through it it was a striped hyena they could see the hair bristle on its back as it passed them with a whining growl hand in hand they ran to the house across the little garden patchrachel led by some instinct guiding her companion straight to her parents room whereof the windows that opened like doors stood wide as the gate had done  one more moment and they were there another and the moonlight showed them all  for a long whileto richard it seemed hoursrachel said nothing only stood still like the statue of a woman staring at those cold faces that looked back at her through the unearthly moonlight indeed it was richard who spoke first feeling that if he did not this dreadful silence would choke him or cause him to faint  the zulus have murdered them he said hoarsely glancing at the dead kaffir on the floor  no she answered in a cold small voice ishmael ishmael and she pointed to something that lay at his feet  richard stooped and picked it up it was a fly wisp of rhinoceros horn which the man had let fall when the zulus spear struck him  i know it she went on he always carried it he is the real murderer the zulus would not have dared and she choked and was silent  let me think said richard confusedly there is something in my mind what is it oh i know if you are right that devil has not done this for nothing he is somewhere near he wants to take you and he ground his teeth at the thought then added rachel we must get out of this and ride for durban at onceat once the white people will protect you there  who will bury my father and mother she asked in the same cold voice  i do not know it does not matter the living are more than the dead i can return and see to it afterwards  you are right she answered then she knelt down by the bed and lifting her beautiful agonised face put up some silent prayer next she rose and kissed first her father then her mother kissed their dead brows in a last farewell and turned to go as she went her eyes fell upon the assegai that lay near to the dead zulu stooping down she took it and with it in her hand passed on to the stoep here her strength seemed to fail her for she reeled against the wall then with an effort flung herself into richards arms moaning  only you left richard only you oh if you were taken from me also what would become of me  a moment later she became aware that the stoep was swarming with men who seemed to arise out of the shadows a voice said in the kaffir tongue  seize that fellow and bind him  instantly before he could do anything before he could even turn richard was torn from her struggling furiously and thrown to the ground rachel sprang to the wall and stood with her back to it raising the spear she held it flashed into her mind that these were zulus and of zulus she was not afraid  what dogs are these she cried that dare to lift a hand against the inkosazana and her servant  the black men about her swayed and murmured then made way for a man who walked up the steps of the stoep the moonlight fell upon him and she saw that it was ishmael  rachel he said taking off his hat politely these are my people we saw that white scoundrel assault you and of course seized him at once as you know a dreadful thing has happened here this afternoon the zulus killed your father and mother or rather they killed your father and your mother who was ill died with the shock because they refused to go to zululand whither dingaan had ordered that they should be taken so seeing that you were travelling here i came to rescue you lest you should fall into their hands and he added lamely you know the rest  ishmael had spoken in english but rachel answered him in zulu  i know all nightprowler she cried aloud i know that my father and mother were killed by your order and in your presence their spirits told me so but now and for that crime i sentence you to death and she pointed at him with the spear heaven above and earth beneath she went on bear witness that i sentence this man to death people of the zulus hear me in your kraals far away hear me dingaan sitting in your great place hear me every captain and induna hear the voice of your inkosazana i sentence this man to death since because of him there is blood between me and my people the blood of my father and my mother now nightprowler do your worst before you die but know this you his servants that if i am harmed or if this white man the chief dario is harmed then you shall die also every one of you what is your will nightprowler  i will tell you that at mafooti answered ishmael trying to look bold i am not afraid of you like those zulu savages and dingaan is a long way off will you come quietly i hope so for i dont want to hurt you or put you to shame but youve got to come and this dario too if you make any trouble i will have him killed at once understand rachel that if you dont come he shall be killed at once my people may be afraid of you but they wont mind cutting his throat he added significantly  never mind about me said richard in a choked voice from the ground where he was pinned down by the kaffirs do what you think best for yourself rachel  now rachel whose wits were made keen by doubt and anguish looked at the faces of the natives about her and even in that dim moonlight read them like a book as she could always do she saw that they were afraid of her and that if she commanded them they would let her go free whatever their master might say or do but she saw also that ishmael spoke truth when he declared that they had no such dread of richard and might even believe that he was doing her some violence if she escaped therefore it would be at the cost of richards life instantly in her bold fashion she made up her mind it was borne in upon her that she had declared the truth that ishmael was doomed that he had no power to work her any hurt however sore her case might seem since richards life hung on it she would go with him  servants of ibubesi she said lift the white chief dario to his feet and listen to my words  they obeyed her at once without even waiting for their master to speak only holding richard by the arms  now the most of the men went into the garden followed by ishmael and taking richard with them but a few remained to watch her from this garden presently arose a sound of great quarrelling rachel was too far off to understand what was said but from the sounds she judged that ishmael was giving orders to his people which they refused to obey for she could hear him cursing them furiously presently she heard something elsethe loud report of a gun followed by groans then a kaffir ran up to them and whispered something to those who surrounded her it was that head man whom ishmael had struck on the mouth in the bush when he told him that a dog had howled upon his hut and his face was very frightened  rachel leaned against the wall and looked at him for she could not speak she who thought that richard had been murdered  have no fear inkosazana said the man answering the question in her eyes ibubesi has killed one of us because we do not like this business and would clean it off our hands that is all the chief dario is safe and i swear to thee that no harm shall come to him from us we will care for him and protect him to the death and if we lead him away a prisoner it is because we must since otherwise ibubesi will kill us all therefore be merciful to us when the spear of thy power is lifted  before rachel could answer ishmaels voice was heard asking why they did not bring the inkosazana as the horses were ready  i pray thee come zoola said the man hurriedly or he will shoot more of us  so rachel walked down the steps of the stoep in front of them holding her head high leaving behind her the house of ramah and its dead at the gate of the garden stood the horses on one of which his own richard was already mounted his arms bound his feet made fast beneath it with a hide rope her path lay past him and as she went by he said in a voice that was choking with rage  i am helpless i cannot save you but our hour will come  yes richard she answered quietly our hour will come when his has gone and with the spear in her hand once more she pointed at ishmael who stood by watching them sullenly then she mounted her horsehow she could never rememberand they were separated  after this she seemed to hear ishmael talking to her arguing explaining but she made no answer to his words her mind was a blank and all she knew was that they were riding on for hours her tired horse stumbled up a pass and down its further side then she heard dogs bark and saw lights the horse stopped and she slid from it and as she was too exhausted to walk was supported or carried into a hut as she thought by women who seemed very much afraid of touching her after which she seemed to sink into blackness  rachel woke from her stupor to find herself lying on a bed in a great kaffir hut that was furnished like a european room for in it were chairs and a table also rough window places closed with reed mats that took the place of glass through the smokehole at the top of the hut struck a straight ray of sunlight by which she judged that it must be about midday she began to think till by degrees everything came back to her and in that hour she nearly died of horror and of grief indeed she was minded to die there at her side lay a means of deaththe assegai which she had found by the body of the zulu in ramah and none had taken from her she lifted it and felt its edge then laid it down again into the darkness of her despair some comfort seemed to creep she was sure that richard lived and if she died he would die also while he lived why should she die moreover it would be a crime which she should only dare when all hope had gone and she stood face to face with shame  thrusting aside these thoughts she rose on the table stood curdled milk and other food of which she forced herself to eat that her strength might return to her for she knew that she would need it all then she washed and dressed herself for in a corner of the hut was water in wooden bowls and even a comb and other things that apparently had been set there for her to use this done she went to the door which was made like that of a house and finding that it was not secured opened it and looked out beyond was a piece of ground floored with the soil taken from antheaps and polished black after the native fashion this space was surrounded by a high stone wall and had at the end of it another very strong door in its centre grew a large shady tree under which was placed a bench taking the assegai with her she went to the door in the high wall and found that it was barred on the further side then she returned and sat down on the bench under the tree  it seemed that she had been observed for a little while afterwards bolts were shot back the door in the wall opened and ishmael entered closing it behind him she looked at the man and at the sight of his handsome furtive face his dark guiltladen eyes her gorge rose she was alone in this secret place with the murderer of her father and her mother who sought her love yet strangely enough her heart was filled not with tears but with contempt and icy anger she did not shrink away from him as he came towards her in his gaudy clothes with an assumed air of insolent confidence but sat pale and proud as she had sat at umgugundhlovu when the zulus brought their causes before her for judgment  he advanced into the shadow of the tree took off his hat with a flourish and bowed then as she made no answer to these salutations but only searched him with her grey eyes he began to speak in jerky sentences  i hope you have slept well rachel i am glad to see you looking so fresh i was afraid that you would be overtired after your long day you rode many miles of course what you found at ramah must have been a great shock to you i want to explain to you quietly that i am not in the least to blame about that terrible business it was those accursed zulus who exceeded their orders  so he went on pausing between each remark for an answer but no answer came at length he stopped confused and rachel lifting the assegai examined its blade and asked him suddenly  whose blood is on this spear yours  a little of it perhaps he answered that fool of a kaffir flourished it about after your father shot him and cut me with it accidentally and he pointed to the wound on his face  rachel bent down and began to rub the blade against the foot of the bench as though to clean it he did not know what she meant by this act yet it frightened him  what are you doing he asked  she paused in her task and said looking up at him  i do not wish that your blood should defile mine even in death and went on with her cleansing of the spear  he watched her for a little while then broke out  curse it all i dont understand you what do you mean  ask the zulus she answered they understand me and they will tell you or if there is no time ask my father and motherafterwards  ishmael paled visibly then recovered himself with an effort and said  let us finish with all this witchdoctor nonsense and come to business i had nothing to do with the death of your parents indeed i was wounded in trying to protect them   then why do i see both of them behind you with such accusing eyes she asked quietly  he stalled turned his head and stared about him  you wont frighten me like that he went on i am not a silly kaffir so give it up look here rachel you know i have loved you for a long while and though you treat me so badly i love you more than ever now will you marry me  i told you last night that you would be dead in a few days do not waste your time in talking of marriage sit in the dust and repent your sins before you go down into the dust  all right rachel i know you are a good prophet  noie too is a good prophet she broke in reflectively you used the zulus to kill her father and mother also did you not do you remember a message that she gave you from seyapi one evening down by the sea before you kidnapped her to be a bait to trap me in zululand  remember he answered scowling am i likely to forget her devilries if you are the witch she is the familiar the black ehlosé spirit who whispers in your ears had she not gone i should never have caught you  but she will come backalthough i fear not in time to bid you farewell  you tell me that i shall soon be dead he exclaimed ignoring this talk of noie well i am not frightened i dont believe you know anything about it but if you are right the more reason i should live while i can according to you rachel we have no time to waste in a long engagement when is it to be  never she answered contemptuously in this or any other world never why you are hateful to me when i see you i shiver as though a snake crawled across my foot and when i look at your hands they are red with blood the blood of my parents and of noies parents and of many others that is my answer  he looked at her a while then said  you seem to forget that i am only asking for what i can take no one can see you or hear you here except my women you are in my power at last rachel dove  these words which ishmael intended should frighten her as they might well have done produced as it chanced a quite different effect rachel broke into a scornful laugh  look she said pointing to an eagle that circled so high in the blue heavens above them that it seemed no larger than a hawk that bird is more in your power and nearer to you than i am before you laid a finger on me i would find a dozen means of death but that i tell you again you will never live to do  for a while ishmael was silent weighing her words in his mind apparently he could find no answer to them for when he spoke again it was of another matter  you say that you hate me rachel if so it is because of that accursed fellow darrienwhom you dont hate well he at any rate is in my power now look here youve got to make your choice either you stop all this nonsense and become my wife oryour friend darrien dies do you hear me  rachel made no answer now for the first time she was really frightened and feared lest her speech should show it  you have been through a lot he went on slowly you are tired out and dont know what you say and you believe that i killed the old people which i didnt and of course that has set you against me now i dont want to be rough or to hurry you especially as i have plenty of things to see about before we are married so i give you three days if you dont change your mind at the end of them the young man dies thats all and afterwards we will see whether or no you are in my power oh you neednt stare ive gone too far to turn back and i dont mind a few extra risks meanwhile make yourself easy dear richard shall be well looked after and i wont bother you with any more lovemaking that can wait  rachel rose from her seat and pointed with the spear to the door in the wall  go she said  all right i am going rachel goodbye till this time three days i hope my women will make you as comfortable as possible in this rough place ask them for anything you want goodbye rachel and he went bolting the wall door behind him    chapter xvi  the three days   he was gone his presence had ceased to poison the air and the long strain over rachel gave a gasp of relief then she sat down upon the bench and began to think her position and that of richard was desperate it seemed scarcely possible that they could escape with their lives for if he died she would die alsoas to that she was quite determined but at least they had three days and who could say what would happen in three days for instance they might escape somehow the providence in which she believed might intervene or the zulus might come to seek her if they only knew where she was gone oh why had she not brought a guard of them with her to ramah at least they would never have insulted her and ishmaels shrift would have been short  she wondered why he had given her three days a reason suggested itself to her mind perhaps he believed what she had told himthat she was as safe from him as the eagle in the airand was sure that the only way to snare her was by using richard as a lure in other words by threatening to murder him it is true that he could have brought the matter to a head at once but then if she remained obdurate he must carry out his threat and this she believed he was afraid to do unless it was absolutely forced upon him doubtless he had reflected that in three days she might weaken and give way  whilst rachel brooded thus the door in the wall opened and through it came three women who saluted her respectfully and announced that they were sent to clean the hut and attend upon her rachel took stock of them carefully two of them were young ordinary goodlooking kaffirs but the third was between thirty and forty and no longer attractive having become old early as natives do moreover her face was sad and sympathetic rachel asked her her name she answered that it was mami and that they were all the wives of ibubesi  the women went about their duties in the hut in silence and a while afterwards announced that all was made clean and that they would return presently with food rachel answered that it was not necessary that three of them should be put to so much trouble it would be enough if mami came she desired to be waited on by mami alone her sisters need not come any more  they all three saluted again and said that she should be obeyed the two younger ones with alacrity to rachel it was evident that these women were much afraid of her her reputation had reached them and they shrank from this task of attending on the mighty inkosazana of the zulus in her cage not knowing what evil it might bring upon them  an hour later the door was unbolted and mami reappeared with the food that had been very carefully cooked rachel ate of it for she was determined to grow strong again she who might need all her strength and while she ate talked to mami who squatted on the ground before her soon she drew her story from her the woman was ishmaels first kaffir wife but he had never cared for her and against all law and custom she was discarded and made a slave even some of her cattle had been taken from her and given to other wives so her heart was bitter against ishmael and she said that although once she was proud to be the wife of a white man now she wished that she had never seen his face  here then was material ready to rachels hand but she did not press the matter too far at this time only she said that she wished mami to stay with her after the evening meal and to sleep in her hut as she was not accustomed to be alone at night mami replied that she would do so gladly if ibubesi allowed it although she was not worthy of such honour  as it happened ishmael did allow it for he thought that he could trust this old drudge and told her to act as a spy upon rachel and report to him all that she said or did very soon rachel found this out and warned her against obeying him since if she did so it would come to her knowledge and then great evil would fall on one who betrayed the words of the inkosazana  mami answered that she knew it and that rachel need not be afraid any tale would do for ishmael whom she hated then saying little herself rachel encouraged her to talk which mami did freely so she heard some news she learned for instance that the whole town of mafooti whereof ibubesi was chief which counted some sixty or seventy heads of families was much disturbed by the events of the last few days they did not like the inkosazana being brought there thinking that where she went the zulus would follow and as they were of zulu blood themselves they knew what that meant they were alarmed at the deaths of the white skydoctor who was called shouter and his wife with which ibubesi had something to do for they feared lest they should be held responsible for their blood they objected to the imprisonment of the white chief dario among them because he had hurt no one and was under the mantle of the inkosazana who was a spirit not a woman and who had warned them that if any harm came to her or to him death would be their reward they were angry also because ibubesi had killed one of them in some quarrel about the chief dario at ramah still they were so much afraid of ibubesi who was a great tyrant that they did not dare to interfere with him and his plans lest they should lose their cattle or perhaps their lives so they did not know what to do as for ibubesi himself he was actively engaged in strengthening the fortifications of the place even the old people and the children were being forced to carry stones to the walls from which it was evident that he feared some attack  when rachel had gathered this and much other information concerning ishmaels past and habits she asked mami if she could convey a message from her to richard the woman answered that she would try on the following morning so rachel told her to say that she was safe and well but that he must watch his footsteps as both of them were in great danger more she did not dare to say fearing lest mami should betray her or be beaten till she confessed everything then as there was nothing more to be done rachel lay down and slept as best she could  the next day passed in much the same fashion as the first had done for the most of it rachel sat under the tree in the walled yard companioned only by her terrible thoughts and fears nobody came near her and nothing happened in the morning mami went out and returning at the dinner hour told rachel that she had seen ishmael who had questioned her closely as to what the inkosazana had done and said to which she replied that she had only eaten and slept and invoked the spirits on her knees as for words none had passed her lips she had not been able to get near the huts where dario was in prison as ishmael was watching her for the rest the work of fortification went on without cease even ishmaels own wives being employed thereon  in the afternoon mami went out again and did not return till night when she had much to tell to begin with while the sentry was dozing being wearied with carrying stones to the wall she had managed to approach the fence of the hut where richard was confined she said that he was walking up and down inside the fence with his hands tied and she had spoken to him through a crack in the reeds and given him rachels message he listened eagerly and bade her tell the inkosazana that he thanked her for her words that he too was strong and well though much troubled in mind but the future was in the hands of the heavens and that she must keep a high heart just then the sentry woke up so mami could not wait to hear any more  that evening however a lad who had been sent out of the town to drive in some cattle had returned with the tidings which she mami heard him deliver to ibubesi with her own ears  he said that whilst he was collecting the oxen a ringed zulu came upon him who from his manner and bearing he took to be a great chief although he was alone and seemed to be tired with walking the zulu has asked him if it were true that the inkosazana and the white chief dario were in prison at mafooti and when he hesitated about replying threatened him with his assegai saying that he would cut out his heart unless he told the truth the zulu replied that he knew it as he had just come from ramah where he had seen strange things and spoken with a man of ibubesis whom he found dying in the garden of the house then he had given him this message  say to ibubesi that i know all his wickedness and that if the inkosazana is harmed or if drop of the blood of the white chief dario is shed i will destroy him and everything that lives in his town down to the rats say to him also that he cannot escape as already he is ringed in by the children of the shouter who have come back and are watching him  the lad had asked who it was that sent such a message whereon he answered i am the horn of the black bull i am the trunk of the elephant i am the mouth of dingaan  then straightway he turned and departed at a run towards zululand moreover mami described the man in the words of the lad and rachel thought that he could be none other than tamboosa whom she had commanded to follow her with the white ox mami added that when he received this message ibubesi seemed much disturbed though to his people he declared that it was all nonsense as dingaans mouth would not come alone or deliver the kings word to a boy but the people thought otherwise and murmured among themselves fearing the terrible vengeance of dingaan  on the next day mami went out again at nightfall when she returned she told rachel that she had not found it possible to approach the huts where dario was as the hole she made in the fence to speak with him had been discovered and a stricter watch was kept over him ibubesi she said was in an ill humour and working furiously to finish his fortifications as he was now sure that the town was being watched either by the kaffirs of ramah or others as for the people of mafooti they were grumbling very much both on account of the heavylabour of working at the walls and because they were in terror of being attacked and killed in payment for the evil deeds of their chief mami declared indeed that so great was their fear and discontent that she thought they would desert the town in a body were it not that they dreaded lest they should fall into the hands of the kaffirs who were watching it rachel asked her whether they would not then take her and dario and deliver them up to the zulus or to the white people on the coast mami answered she thought they would be afraid to do this as ibubesi alone had guns and would shoot plenty of them also if the zulus found them with their inkosazana they would kill them she added that she had seen ibubesi who bade her tell the inkosazana that he was coming for her answer on the morrow  rachel slept ill that night the space of her reprieve had gone by and next morning she must face the issue for herself she did not so greatly care for at the worst she had a refuge whither ishmael could not follow herthe grave after all she had endured it seemed to her that this must be a peaceful place moreover in her case what power could blame her but there was richard to be thought of if she refused ishmael he swore that he would kill richard and yet how could she pay that price even to save her lovers life perhaps he would not kill him after all perhaps he would be afraid of the vengeance of the zulus and was only trying to frighten her ah if only the zulus would comebefore it was too late it was scarcely to be hoped for tamboosa if it were he who had spoken with the lad would not have had time to return to zululand and collect an impi and when they did come the deed might be done if only these servants of ibubesi would rise against him and kill him or carry off richard and herself alas they feared the man too much and she could not get at them to persuade them there was nothing that she could do except pray richard and she must take their chance things must go as they were decreed  if she could have seen ishmael at this hour and read his thoughts that sight and knowledge might have brought some comfort to her tortured heart the man was seated in his hut alone staring at the floor and pulling his long black beard with hands rough from toiling at the walls he was drinking also stiff tots of rum and water but the fiery liquor seemed to bring him no comfort as he drank he thought he was determined to get possession of rachel that desire had become a madness with him he could never abandon it while he lived but she might not live she had sworn that she would rather die than become his wife and she was not a woman who broke her word also she hated him bitterly and with good cause there was only one way to work on herthrough her love for this man richard darrien for that she did love him he had little doubt if it were choice between yielding and the death of darrien then perhaps she might give way but there came the rub  dingaan had sworn to him that if he made darriens blood to flow then he should be killed and like rachel dingaan kept his oaths moreover that zulu who met the cattle herd had sworn it again in almost the same words therefore it would seem that if he wished to continue to breathe darriens blood must not be made to flow all the rest might be explained when the impi came as it would do sooner or later especially if he could show to them that the inkosazana was his willing wife but the murder of darrien could never be explained well the man might die or seem to die and then who could hold him responsible or if they did if any of his people remained faithful to him an attack might be beaten off brave as they were the zulus could not storm those walls on which he had spent so much labour though now he almost wished that he had left the walls alone and settled the affair of rachel and of darrien first  ishmael poured out more rum and drank it neat this time as though to nerve himself for some undertaking then he went to the door of the hut and called whereon presently a hideous old woman crept in and squatted down in the circle of light thrown by the lamp she was wrinkled and deformed and her snakeskin moocha with the inflated fishbladder in her hair showed that she was a witchdoctoress  well mother he said have you made the poison  yes ibubesi yes i have made it as i alone can do oh it is a wonderful drug worth many cows how many did you say you would give me six  no three but if it does what is wanted you shall have the other three as well tell me again how does it work  thus ibubesi whoever drinks this medicine becomes like one deadnone can tell the difference no not a doctor evenand remains so for a long whileperhaps one day perhaps two perhaps even three then life returns and by degrees strength but not memory for whole moons the memory is gone and he who has drunk remains like a child that has everything to learn  you lie mother i never heard of such a medicine  you never heard of it because none can make it save me and i had its secret from my grandmother also few can afford to pay me for it still it has been used and were i not afraid i could give you cases stay i will show you call that beast and she pointed to a dog that was asleep at the side of the hut here is milk i will show you  ishmael hesitated for he was fond of this dog then as he wished to test the stuff he called it it came and sat down beside him looking up in his face with faithful eyes then the old witch poured milk into a bowl and in the milk mixed some white powder which she took out of a folded leaf and offered it to the animal the dog sniffed the milk growled slightly and refused it  the evil beast does not like me he bit me the other day said the old doctoress do you give it to him ibubesi he will trust you   so ishmael patted the dog on the head then offered it the milk which it lapped up to the last drop  there evil beast said the woman with a chuckle you wont bite me any more youll forget all about me for a long time look at him ibubesi look at him  as she spoke the poor dogs coat began to stare then it uttered a low howl ran to ishmael tried to lick his hand and rolled over to all appearance quite dead  you have killed my dog which i love you hag he said angrily  then why did you give medicine to what you love ibubesi but have no fear the evil beast has only taken a small dose tomorrow morning it will awake but it will not know you or anyone who is the medicine for ibubesi the lady zoola if so it may not work on her for she is mighty and cannot be harmed  fool do you think that i would play tricks with the inkosazana  no you want to marry her dont you but it seems to me that she has no mind that way then it is for the man for whom she has a mind for well ibubesi you have promised the six cows and you saved me once from being killed for witchcraft so i will say something dont give it to the chief dario  why not you old fool will it kill him after all  no no it will do what i said no less and no more in this quantity and she handed him another powder wrapped in dry leaves but i have had bad dreams about you ibubesi and they were mixed up with the inkosazana and this white man dario i dreamed they brought your death upon youa dreadful death ibubesi be wise set dario free and change your mind as to marrying the inkosazana who is not for you  how can i change my mind descendant of wizards broke out ishmael can a river penned between rocks change its course can it run backwards from the sea to the hill this woman draws me as the sea draws the river because of her my blood is afire i had rather win her and die than live rich and safe without her to old age the more she hates and scorns me the more i love her  i understand said the doctoress nodding her head till the bladder in her hair bobbed about like a float at which a fish is pulling i understand i have seen people like this beforemen and women toowhen a bad spirit enters into them because of some crime they have committed the inkosazana or those who guard her have sent you this bad spirit and ibubesi you must run the road upon which it is appointed that you should travel for joy or sorrow you must run that road but when we meet in the world of ghosts which i think will be soon do not blame me do not say that i did not warn you now it is all right about those cows is it not although i dare say the zulus will milk them and not i for tonight i seem to smell zulus in the air and she lifted her broad nose and sniffed like a hound i wish you could have left the inkosazana alone and that dario too for he is a part of her in my dreams they seemed to be one but you wont you will walk your own path so good night ibubesi the dog will wake again in the morning but he will not know you good night ibubesiof course i understand that the cows will be young ones that have not had more than two calves mix the powder in milk or water or anything it is without taste or colour good night ibubesi and without waiting for an answer the old wretch crept out of the hut  when she was gone ishmael cursed her aloud then drank some more rum which he seemed to need the place was very lonely and the sight of his dog lying to all appearance dead at his side oppressed him he patted its head and it did not move he lifted its paw and it fell down flabbily the brute was as dead as anything could be it occurred to him that before night came again he might look like that dog his story might be told he might have left the earth in company of all the deeds that he had done thereon he had imagination enough to know his sins and they were an evil host to face old dove and his wife for instanceholy people who believed in god and vengeance and had never done any wrong only striven for years and years to benefit others it would not be pleasant to meet them rachel had said that she saw them standing behind him and he felt as though they were there at that moment look one of them crossed between him and the lampthere was the mark of the kerry on his headand the woman followed he could see her blue lips as she bent down to look at the dog it was unbearable he would go and talk to rachel and ask her if she had made up her mind no for if he broke in on her thus at night he was sure that she would kill either herself or him with that spear she had taken from the dead zulu reddened with his own blood he would keep faith with her and wait till the morrow he would send for one of his wives no the thought of those women made him sick he would go round the fortifications and beat any sentries whom he found asleep or receive the reports of the spies to stop in that hut in the company of a dog which seemed to be dead and of imaginations that no rum could drown was impossible                                       once more the morning came and rachel sat in the walled yard awaiting the dreadful hour of her trial for it was the day and time that ishmael had appointed for her answer until now rachel had cherished hopes that something might happen that the people of mafooti might intervene to save her and richard that the zulus might appear even that ishmael might relent and let them go but mami had been out that morning and brought back tidings which dispelled these hopes she had ventured to sound some of the leading men and said that like all the people they were very sullen and alarmed but declared as she had expected that they dare do nothing for ibubesi would kill them and if they escape him the zulus would kill them because the inkosazana was found in their possession of the zulus themselves scouts who had been out for miles reported that they had seen no sign it was clear also that ishmael was as determined as ever for he had sent her a message by mami that he would wait upon her as he had promised and bring the white man with him  then what should she say and what should she do rachel could think of no plan she could only sit still and pray while the shadow of that awful hour crept ever nearer  it had come she heard voices without the wall among them ishmaels her heart stopped then bounded like a live thing in her breast he was commanding someone to catch that dog and tie it up for it was bewitched and did not know him or anyone then the sound of a dog being dragged away whining feebly and then the door opened first ishmael came in with an affectation of swaggering boldness but looking like a man suffering from the effects of a long debauch about his eyes were great black rings and in them was a stare of sleeplessness he carried a doublebarrelled gun under his arm but the hand with which he supported it shook visibly and at every unusual sound he started after him came richard his wrists bound together behind him and on his legs hide shackles which only just allowed him to shuffle forward slowly moreover he was guarded by four men who carried spears rachel glanced quickly at his face and saw that it was pale and resolute quite untouched by fear  are you well she asked quietly taking no note of ishmael  yes he answered and you rachel  quite well bodily richard but oh my soul is sick  before he could reply ishmael turned on him savagely and bade him be silent or it would be the worse for him then he took off his hat with his shaking hand and bowed to rachel  rachel he said i have kept my promise and left you alone for three days but time is up and now this gentleman and i have come to hear your decision which is so important to both of us  what am i to decide she asked in a low voice looking straight before her  have you forgotten your memory must be very bad well it is best to have no mistake and no doubt our friend here would like to know exactly how things stand you have to decide whether you will take me as your husband today of your own free will or whether mr richard darrien shall suffer the punishment of death for having tried to kill his sentry and escape a crime of which he has been guilty and afterwards i should take you as my wife with or without your consent  when richard heard these words the veins in his forehead swelled with rage and horror till it seemed as though they would burst  you unutterable villain he gasped you cowardly hound oh if only my hands were free  well they aint mr darrien and its no use your tugging at that buffalo hide so hold your tongue and let us hear the ladys answer sneered ishmael  richard richard said rachel in a kind of wail you have heard it is a matter of your life what am i to do  do he answered in loud firm tones do how can you ask me such a question the matter is not one of my life but of yourof youroh i cannot say it let this foul beast kill me of course and then if you care enough follow the same road a few years sooner or later make little difference and so we shall soon be together again  she thought a moment then said quietly  yes i care enough and a hundred times more than that yes that is the only way out listen you ishmaelrichard darrien the man to whom i am sworn and i give you this answer murder him if you will and bring gods everlasting vengeance on your head he will not buy his life on such terms and if i consented to them i should be false to him murder him as you murdered my father and mother and when i know that he is dead i will go to join him and them  all right rachel said ishmael whose face was white with fury i think i will take you at your word and you can go to look for him down below if you like for if i am not to get you here he shant now then say your prayers mr darrien and stepping forward slowly he cocked the doublebarrelled gun  men of mafooti exclaimed rachel in zulu ibubesi is about to do murder on one who like myself is under the mantle of dingaan if his blood should flow today or tomorrow yours shall flow in payment yours and that of your wives and children for the crime of the chief is the crime of the people  at her words the four natives who had been watching this scene uneasily although they could not understand the english talk called out to ishmael in remonstrance his only answer was to lift the gun and for an instant that seemed infinite rachel waited to hear its explosion and to see the greyeyed openfaced man she loved who stood there like a rock fall a shattered corpse then one of the kaffirs bolder than the rest struck up the barrels with his arm and not too soon for whether or no he had meant to pull the trigger the rifle went off  try the other barrel said richard sarcastically as the smoke cleared away that shot was too high  perhaps ishmael might have done so for the man was beside himself but the kaffirs would have no more of it they rushed between them lifting their spears threateningly and shouting that they would not allow the blood of the white lord and the curse of the inkosazana to be brought upon their heads and those of their families rather than that they would bind him ibubesi and give him over to the zulus then whether or not he had really meant to kill richard ishmael thought it politic to give way  so be it he said to rachel i am merciful and both of you shall have another chance i am going with this fellow but the woman mami shall come to you if within three hours you send her to me with a message to say that you have changed your mind he shall be spared if not before nightfall you shall see his body and afterwards we will settle matters  rachel rachel cried richard swear that you will send no such message  now the brute ishmael rushed at him to strike him in the face but richard saw him coming and bound though he was put down his head and butted at him so fiercely that being much the stronger man he knocked him to the ground where he lay breathless  swear rachel swear he repeated or dead or living i will never forgive you  i swear she said faintly  then he shuffled towards her bending down he kissed her on the face and she kissed him back no more words passed between them this was their farewell two of the kaffirs lifted ishmael and helped him from the yard whilst the other two led away richard who made no resistance at the gate he turned and their eyes met for a moment then it closed behind him and she was left alone again    chapter xvii  rachel loses her spirit   a little while later mami entered and said that she had been sent by ibubesi to serve the inkosazana as a messenger should she need one rachel seated on the bench motioned to her to go into the hut and bide there and she obeyed  minute by minute the time ebbed away and still rachel sat motionless on the bench towards the end of the third hour someone unbolted and knocked at the door mami opened it and reported that ibubesi stood without and desired to know whether she had any word for him  none answered rachel remembering her oath and the door was barred again  after this a great silence seemed to fall upon the place the sky was grey with distant rain and the air heavy and whatever may have been the cause no sound came from man or beast without to rachels strained nerves it seemed as though the angel of death had spread his wings above the town there she sat paralysed wondering what evil thing was being worked upon her lover wondering if she had done right to give him as a sacrifice to this savage in order to save herself from dreadful wrongwondering wondering till the powers of her mind seemed to die within her leaving it grey and empty as the grey and empty sky above  night drew on and the setting sun bursting through the envelope of cloud filled earth and sky with fire and it came into rachels heart she knew not whence that fire was near that soon it would swallow up all this place  look the door was opening it swung wide and through it advanced eight kaffirs carrying something on a litter made of shields something that was covered with a blanket of bark they drew near to her with bent heads and set down their burden at her feet then one of them lifted the blanket revealing the body of richard darrien and saying in an awed voice  inkosazana ibubesi sends you this to look or to show you that he keeps his word later he will visit you himself  rachel knelt down by the litter of shields and looked at richards face the stamp of death was on it she felt his hand it was turning cold she felt his heart it did not beat  show me this dead lords wounds she said in an awful whisper that presently mine may be like to them  inkosazana said the spokesman he has no wound  how then did he die strange that he should die and i not feel his spirit pass  inkosazana he was thirsty and drank then he died  so so he was slain by poison and i have no poison mami come forth and look on the white lord whom ibubesi has murdered by poison  the woman mami who had been sleeping in the hut awoke and obeyed she saw and wailed aloud  woe to mafooti she cried like one inspired and woe woe to those that dwell therein for now vengeance red vengeance shall fall on them from heaven the blood of the innocent is upon them the curse of the inkosazana is upon them the spears of the zulus are upon them slay the silwana the wild beastibubesi and fly people of mafooti fly fly with that dead thing leave it not here to bear witness against you carry it far away and heap a mountain on it bury it in a valley that no man can find bury it in the black water lest it should arise and bear witness against you leave it not here but let the darkness cover it and fly with it into the darkness as i do and turning she sped to the door and through it  the light from the sunk sun went out smothered in the gathering thunderclouds through the gloom the terrified bearers muttered to each other  throw it down and away said one  nay answered another wisdom has come to mami her ehlosé has spoken to her take it with you lest it should remain to bear witness against us  remember what the zulu swore said a third that if harm came to this lord they would kill all down to the rats take it away so that it may not be found if you meet ibubesi spear him if not leave him the vengeance for his share  now moved as though by a common impulse the bearers cast back the blanket over the corpse and lifting the litter departed at a run the door was shut and bolted behind them and darkness fell upon the earth  for a while rachel stood still in the darkness  now i am alone she said in a quiet voice yet to her ears the words seemed to be uttered with a roar of thunder that echoed through the firmament and pierced upwards to the feet of god  then suddenly something snapped in her brain and she was changed the horror left her the terror left her she felt very well and strong so well that she laughed aloud and again that laugh filled earth and heaven oh she was hungry and food stood on a table near by she sprang to it and ate ate heartily then she drank muttering to herself richard drank before he died let me drink also and cease to be alone  her meal finished she walked up and down the place singing a song that seemed to be caught up triumphantly by a million voices the voices of all who had ever lived and died their awful music stunned her and she ceased look wild beasts wearing the face of ibubesi were licking the clouds with their tongues of fire it was curious but in that highwalled place she could not see it well now from the top of the hut the view would be better yes and ishmael was coming to visit her well they would meet for the last time on the top of the hut she was not afraid of him not at all but it would be strange to see him scrambling up the hut and they would talk there for a little while with their faces close together tillahtill what till something strange happened something unhappy for ishmael oh no no she would not kill herself she would wait to see what it was that happened to ishmael that strange thing which she knew so well and yet could not remember  how easy this hut was to climb a cat could not have run up with less trouble now she stood on the top of it her spear in one hand and holding with the other to the pole that was set there to scare away the lightning stood for a long time watching the wild beasts licking the clouds with their red tongues  the beasts grew weary of lapping up clouds their appetites were satisfied for a while at any rate she saw their tongues no more the air was very hot and heavy and the darkness very dense it seemed to press about her as though she were plunged in cream yet rachel thought that she heard sounds through it a sound of feet to the west and a sound of feet to the east  then she heard another sound that of the door in the wall opening and of a soft tentative footfall like to the footfall of a questing wolf she knew it at once for now her senses were sharper than those of any savage it was the step of ibubesi the nightprowler she felt inclined to laugh it was so funny to think of herself standing there on the top of a hut while the nightprowler slunk about below looking for her but she refrained remembering the dreadful noise when all the heavens began to laugh in answer so she was silent for the heavens do not reverberate silence although she could hear her own thoughts passing through them passing up one by one on their infinite journey  listen he was walking round and round the yard he went to the bench beneath the tree and felt along it with his fingers to see if she were there now he was entering the hut and groping at the bedstead and now he had kindled a light for the rays of it shone faintly up through the smokehole discovering nothing he came out again leaving the lamp burning within and called her softly  rachel he said rachel where are you  there was no answer and he began to talk to himself  has she got away he muttered some of them have gone i know the accursed cowardly fools no it is not possible the watch was too good unless she is really a spirit and has melted as spirits do i hope not for if so she will haunt me and i want her company in the flesh not in the spirit i ought to have it too for it has cost me pretty dear she must have bewitched me or why should i risk everything for her just one white woman who hates the sight of me the devil is at the back of it this was his road from the first  so he went on until rachel could bear it no more the thing was too absurd  yes yes she said from the top of the hut his road from the first and it ends not far away at the red gates of hell nightprowler  the man below gasped and fell against the fence  whose voice is that where are you he asked of the air  then as there was no answer he added it sounded like rachel but it spoke above me i suppose that she has killed herself i thought she might but better that she should be dead than belong to that fellow only then why does she speak  he started to feel his way towards the hut perhaps to fetch the lamp when suddenly the skies behind were illumined in a blaze of light a broad slow blaze that endured for several seconds by it the eyes of rachel made quick with madness saw many things from her perch on the top of the hut she saw the town of mafooti on the plain to the west she saw a number of black dots which she took to be people and cattle travelling away from the town in the nek to the east she saw more dots each of them crested with white and carrying something white surely it was a zulu impi marching some of these dots had come to the wall of the town yes and some of them were on the crest of it while yet others were creeping down its main street not a hundred yards away  also these caught sight of something for they paused and seemed to fall together as though in fear lastly just before the light went out she perceived ishmael in the yard below glaring up at her for he too had seen her seen her standing above him in the air the spear in her hand and in her eyes fire but of the dots to the east and of the dots to the west he had seen nothing he appeared to fall to his knees and remain there muttering then the heavens blazed again for the storm was coming up and by the flare of them he read the truth this was no ghost but the living woman  oh he said recovering himself thats where youve got to is it come down rachel and let us talk  she made no answer none at all she who was so curious to see what he would do for quite a long while he harangued her from below walking round and round the hut then at length in despair he began to climb it but in that darkness which now and again turned to dazzling light unlike rachel he found the task difficult and once missing his hold he fell to the ground heavily finding his feet he rushed at the hut with an oath and clutching the straw and the grass strings that bound it struggled almost to the top to be met by the point of rachels spear held in his face there then he hung looking like a toad on the slope of a rock unable to advance because of that spear and unwilling to go down lest his labour must be begun again  rachel he said come down rachel whatever i have done has been for your sake come down and tell me that you forgive me  she laughed out loud a wild screaming laugh for really he looked most ridiculous sprawling there on the bend of the hut and the lightning showed her all sorts of pictures in his eyes  did richard darrien forgive you she asked and what did you mix that poison with milk the milk of human kindness it was a very good poison toad so good that i think you must have drawn it from your own blood when you are dead all the bushmen should come and dip their arrows in you for then even crocodiles and the big snakes would die at a scratch  he made no answer so she went on  have your people forgiven you if so why do they flee away carrying that white thing which was a man have my father and mother forgiven you do you hear what they are saying to methat judgment is the lords have the zulus forgiven you the zulus who believe that judgment is the kingsand the inkosazanas turn now and ask them for here they are and she pointed over his head with her spear turn toad and set out your case and i will stand above and try it the case of dingaan against ibubesi and one by one i will call up all those who died through you and they shall give their evidence and i the judge will sum it up to a jury of sharp spears see here come the spears look at the wall toad look at the wall  as she raved on and pointed with her assegai the lightning blazed out and ishmael who had looked round at her bidding saw zulu warriors leaping down from the crest of the wall and zulu captains rushing in by the opened door at this terrible sight he slid to the ground purposing to reach his gun which he had left there and defend or kill himself who knows which but before ever he could lay a hand upon it those fierce men had pounced upon him like leopards on a goat now they held him fast and a voiceit was that of tamboosa called through the darkness  hail to thee inkosazana come down now and pass judgment on this wild beast who would have harmed thee  tamboosa she cried the inkosazana has fled away only the white woman in whom she dwelt remains her spirit hangs in wrath over the people of the zulus as an eagle hangs above a hare tamboosa there is blood between the inkosazana and the people of the zulus the blood of those who gave her the body that she wore who lie slain by them upon the bed at kamah tamboosa there is blood between her and ibubesi the blood of the white man who loved the body that she wore and whom she loved the white lord whom ibubesi did to death this day because she who was the inkosazana would not give herself to him tamboosa the inkosazana has suffered much from this ibubesi many an insult many a shame and when she called upon the zulus out of all their thousand thousands there was not a single spear to help her because they were too busy killing those holy ones whom she called her father and her mother and so tamboosa the spirit of the inkosazana departed like a bird from the egg leaving but this shell behind that is full or sorrows and of dreams yet tamboosa she still speaks through these lips of mine and she says that from the seed of blood that they have sown her people the zulus must harvest woe upon woe as while she dwelt among them she warned them that it would be if ill came to those she loved tamboosa this is her commandthat ye shield the breast in which she hid from the wild beast ibubesi and all evil men and that ye lead this shape to noie the daughter of seyapi whom ibubesi brought to death for with noie it would dwell  thus she wailed through the deep darkness while the soldiers who packed the space below groaned in their grief and terror because the soul of the inkosazana had been made a wanderer by their sins and the curse of the inkosazana had fallen on their land  again the lightning flared and in it they saw her standing on the crest of the hut she had let drop the spear as though she needed it no more and her arms were outstretched to the heavens and her beautiful face was upturned and her long hair floated in the wind seen thus by that quick white light which shone in the madness of her eyes she seemed no woman but what they had fabled her to be a queen of spirits and at the vision of her they groaned again while some of them fell to the earth and hid their faces with their hands  the darkness fell once more and a man went into the hut to bring out the lamp that burned there when he returned rachel stood among them they had not seen or heard her descend ishmael saw her also and feeling his doom in the fierce eyes that glowered at him stretched out his hand and caught her by the robe praying for pity  at his touch she uttered a wild scream which pierced like a knife through the hearts of all that heard it  suffer it not she cried oh my people suffer not that i be thus defiled  they rent him from her with blows and execrations looking up to their chief for his word to tear him to pieces  no said tamboosa grimly he shall to the king to tell this story ere he die  save me rachel save me he moaned you dont know what they mean i was mad with love for you do not judge me harshly and send me to be tortured  this appeal of his seemed to pierce the darkness of her brain and for a little while her face grew human  i judge not she answered in zulu pray to the great one above who judges oh man man she went on in a kind of eerie whisper what have i done to you that you should treat me thus why did you command the soldiers to kill my father and my mother why did you poison my lover why did you drive away my soul and fill me with this madness take me away from this accursed town tamboosa before heavens vengeance falls on it and let me see that face no more  then some of them made a guard about her and led her thence along the central street and through the barricaded gates that they broke down for her passage they led her to a little cave in the slope of the opposing hill for although no rain fell the gathered storm was breaking the lightning flashed thick and fast the thunder groaned and bellowed and a wild wind beat the screeching trees  here in the mouth of this cave rachel sat herself down and looked at the kraal mafooti awaiting she knew not what while the impi pillaged the town and ishmael already half dead with fear remained bound to the rooftree of the hut that had been her prison   whilst she waited thus and watched of a sudden one of the outer huts began to burn though whether the lightning or some soldier had fired it none could tell then in an instant as it seemed driven by the raging wind the flame leapt from roof to roof till mafooti was but a sheet of fire the soldiers at their work of pillage saw and rushed hither and thither confusedly for they did not know the paths and were tangled in the fences  a figure appeared running down the central street a figure of flame for his clothes burned on him and those by rachel said  see see ibubesi  he could not reach the gate for a blazing hut fell across his path turning he sped to the edge of a cliff that rose near by where because of its steepness there was no wall here for a while he ran up and down till the winddriven fire from newlit huts at its brink leapt out upon him like thin scarlet tongues he threw himself to the ground he rose again beating his head with his hand for his long hair was ablaze then in his torment and despair of a sudden he threw himself backwards into the dark gulf beneath fifty feet and more he fell to the rocks below and where he fell there he lay till he died and on the morrow the zulus found and buried him  thus did ishmael depart out of the life of rachel to the end which he had earned  nor did he go alone for of the zulus in the town many were caught by the fire and perished so many that when the regiment mustered at dawn that same regiment which had escorted the inkosazana to the banks of the tugela fifty and one men were missing whilst numbers of others appeared burned and blistered  ah said tamboosa as he surveyed the injured and counted the dead the curse is quickly at work among us and i think that this is but the beginning of evil well i expected it no less  as for the town of mafooti it was utterly destroyed to this day the place is a wilderness where the grass grows rank between the crumbling fireblackened walls for the people of ibubesi who had fled returned thither no more nor would others build where it had been since still they swear that the spot is haunted by the figure of a white man who in times of thunder rushes across it wrapped in fire and plunges blazing into the gulf upon its northern side  after the storm came the rain which poured all night long a steady sheet of water reaching from earth to heaven rachel watched it vacantly for a while then went to the head of the little cave and lay down wrapped in karosses that they had made ready for her moreover she slept as a child sleeps until the sun shone bright on the morrow then she woke and asked for food  but the impi did not sleep all night long the soldiers stood in huddled groups beneath such shelter as the trees and rocks would give to them while the water poured on them pitilessly till their teeth chattered and their limbs were frozen some died of the cold that night and afterwards many others fell sick of agues and fevers of the lungs which killed a number of them  in the morning when the storm was past and the sun shone hotly tamboosa called the council of the captains together and consulted with them as to whether they should follow after the people of mafooti who had fled and destroy them or return straight to zululand most of the captains answered that of mafooti and its people they had seen enough ibubesi was dead slain by the vengeance of heaven the inkosazana they had rescued alive though filled with madness the white lord dario had been murdered by ibubesi it was said with poison and doubtless his body was burned in the fire as for the people of mafooti themselves it would seem that most of them were innocent as they had fled the place deserting their chief to these arguments other captains answered that the people of mafooti were not innocent inasmuch as they had helped ibubesi to carry off the inkosazana and the white lord dario from ramah and consented to their imprisonment and to the death of one of them only flying when they had tidings that the impi was on the way moreover the command was that every one of these dogs should be killed whereas they had killed none of them but only taken those cattle which were left behind in their flight at length the dispute growing fierce the captains being unable to come to an agreement decided that they would lay the matter before the inkosazana and be guided by the words that fell from her if they could understand them  so tamboosa went into the cave with one other man and talked to rachel who sat staring at him with stony eyes as though she understood nothing when at length he ceased however she cried  lead me to noie at the great place lead me to noie nor would she say any more  so as the people of mafooti had fled they knew not where and they had secured some of the cattle and as many of the soldiers were sick from the cold and burns received in the fire tamboosa told the regiment that it was the will of the inkosazana that they should return to zululand  a while later they started those of them who were so badly burned that they could not travel being carried on shields but rachel would not be carried choosing to walk alone surrounded at a distance by a ring of soldiers who guarded her for hours she walked thus showing no sign of weariness but now and again bursting out into shrill laughter as though she saw things that moved her to merriment only the regiment that listened was not merry for it had heard the words that the inkosazana spoke in the town of mafooti foretelling evil to the zulus because of the blood that was between them and her they thought that she laughed over the misfortunes that were to come and over those that had already befallen them in the fire and in the rain  about midday they halted to eat and as before rachel took food in plenty for now that her mind was wandering her body seemed to call for sustenance when their meal was finished they moved down to the banks of the buffalo river which ran near by to find that it was in great flood after the heavy rain and that it was not safe to try the ford so they determined to camp there on the banks murmuring among themselves that all went ill with them upon this journey as was to be expected and that they would have done better if they had spent the time in hunting down the people of mafooti instead of sitting idle like tired storks upon the banks of a river yet bad as things might seem they were destined to be worse for while some of them were cutting boughs and grass to make a hut for the inkosazana rachel who stood watching them with empty eyes of a sudden laughed in her mad fashion and sped like a swallow to the lip of the foaming ford here before they could come up with her she threw off the outer cloak she wore and rushed into the water till the current bore her from her feet then while the whole regiment shouted in dismay she began to swim striking out for the further bank and being swept downwards by the stream now tamboosa who was almost crazed with fear lest she should drown called out that where the inkosazana went they must follow even to their deaths  it is so answered the soldiers as each man locking his arms round the middle of him who stood in front company by company they plunged into the water in a fourfold chain hoping thus to bridge it from bank to bank  meanwhile rachel swam on in the strength of her madness as a woman has seldom swum before again and again the muddy waters broke over her head and the soldiers groaned thinking that she was drowned but always that golden hair reappeared above them a great tree swept down upon her but she dived beneath it she was dashed against a tall rock but she warded herself away from it with her hands and still swam on till at length with a shout of joy the zulus saw her find her feet and struggle slowly to the further bank yes and up it till she reached its crest where she stood and watched them idly as though unconscious of the danger she had passed and of the water that ran from her hair and breast  where a woman can go we can follow said some but others answered  she is not a woman but a spirit death himself cannot kill her  now the fourfold chain was near the centre of the ford when suddenly those at the tip of it were lifted from their feet as rachel had been nor could those behind hold on to them they were torn from their grasp and swept away the most of them never to be seen again for of these men but few could swim thrice this happened until strong swimmers were sent to the front and at length these men won across as rachel had done and caught hold of the stones on the further side thus forming a living chain from bank to bank whereof the centre floated and was bent outwards by the weight of the water as the back of a bow bends when the string is drawn  by the help of this human rope thus formed the companies began to come over supporting themselves against it till presently the strain and the push of them and of the angry river overcame its strength and the chain burst in the middle so that many were borne down the stream and drowned yet with risk and toil and loss it joined itself together again and held fast until every man was over save the sick and some lads who were left to tend them and the cattle on the further bank then that cable of brave warriors began to struggle forward like a great snake dragging its tail after it and so by degrees drew itself to safety and gasping out foam and water saluted the inkosazana where she stood  many were drowned and others were bruised by rocks but of this they thought little since she was safe and they had found her again to have lost whom would have been a shame from generation to generation she watched the captains reckoning up the number of the dead and when tamboosa and some of them came to make report of it to her a shadow as of pity floated across her stony eyes  not on my head she cried not on my head there is blood between the inkosazana and her people of the zulus and that blood avenges itself in blood and she laughed her eerie laugh  it is true it is just o queen answered tamboosa solemnly the nation must pay for the sin of its children as the wild beast ibubesi has paid for his sins  then as they could travel no further that day they built a hut and lit a great fire by which rachel sat and dried herself nor did she take any harm from the water for as the zulus had said it seemed as though nothing could harm her now  the soldiers also lit fires and despatched messengers to neighbouring kraals commanding them to bring food and to send maidens to attend on the inkosazana while others went to a mountain to call all this illtidings from hill to hill till it came to the great place of the king    chapter xviii  the curse of the inkosazana   that night the regiment and rachel slept upon the bank of the river and nothing happened save that lions carried off two soldiers while two more who had been injured against the rocks died also others fell sick on the following morning food arrived in plenty from the neighbouring kraals and with it some girls of high birth to attend upon the inkosazana  but with these rachel would have nothing to do and when they came near to her only said  where is noie daughter of seyapi lead me to noie  so they began their march again rachel walking as before in the centre of a ring of soldiers and that night slept at a kraal upon a hill here messengers from the king met them charged with many fine words to which rachel listened without understanding them and then scared them away with her laughter also they brought a beautiful cloak made of the skins of a rare white monkey and this she took and wrapped herself in it for she seemed to understand that her clothes were ragged  that day they passed through fertile country where much corn was grown here they saw a strange sight for as they went clouds seemed to arise in the sky from behind them which presently were seen to be not clouds but tens of millions of great winged grasshoppers that lit upon the corn devouring it and every other green thing within a few hours nothing was left except the roots and bare branches while the women of that land ran to and fro wailing knowing that next winter they and their children must starve and the cattle lowed about them hungrily for the locusts had devoured all the grass moreover having eaten everything these insects themselves began to die in myriads so that soon the air was poisoned the waters were also poisoned with their dead bodies and at once sickness came which presently grew into a pestilence  now the men of the country sent a deputation to the inkosazana praying her to remove the curse but when they had spoken she only repeated the words she had used upon the banks of the buffalo river  not on my head not on my head there is blood between the inkosazana and her people of the zulus famine and war and death upon the people of the zulus because they have shed the holy blood  then the men grew afraid and went away and the regiment marched on accompanied by the myriads of the locusts that wasted all the land through which they passed  at length followed by a wail of misery they came to the great place and entered it preceded by the locusts which already were heaped up in the streets like winter leaves and for lack of other provender gnawed at the straw of the huts and the shields and moochas of the soldiers it was a strange sight to see the men trying to stamp them to death and the women and children rushing to and fro shrieking and brushing them from their hair  amid such scenes as these they passed through the town of umgugundhlovu into which rachel had been brought in order that the people might see that their inkosazana had returned and on to that kraal upon the hill where she had spent all those weary weeks until richard came she reached it as the sun was setting and although she did not seem to know any of them was received with joy and adoration by the women who had been her attendants here she slept that night for they thought that she must be too weary to see the king at once moreover he desired first to receive the reports of tamboosa and the captains and to learn all that had happened in this strange business  next morning whilst rachel sat by the pool in which once she had seen the vision of richard tamboosa and an escort came to bring her to dingaan when they told her this she said neither yea nor nay but refusing to enter a litter they had brought walked at the head of them back to the great place and watched by thousands through the locuststrewn streets to the intunkulu the house of the king here in front of his hut and surrounded by his council sat dingaan and the indunas who rose to greet her with the royal salute she advanced towards them slowly looking more beautiful than ever she had done but with wild wandering eyes they set a stool for her and she sat down on the stool staring at the ground then as she said nothing dingaan who seemed very sad and full of fear commanded tamboosa to report all that had happened in the ears of the council and he took up his tale  he told of the journey to the tugela and of how the inkosazana and the white lord dario had crossed the river alone but a few hours after ibubesi ordering him to follow next day also alone with the white ox that bore her baggage he told how he had done so and on reaching ramah had found the white umfundusi and his wife lying dead in their room and on the floor of it a zulu of the men who had been sent with ibubesi also dead and in the garden of the house a man of the people of ibubesi dying who with his last breath narrated to him the story of the taking of the inkosazana and the white lord by ibubesi he told of how he had run to the town of mafooti to find out the truth and of the message that he had sent by the herd boy to ibubesi and his people lastly he told all the rest of that story of how he had come back to zululand as though he had wings and finding the regiment that had escorted the inkosazana still in camp near the river had returned with them to attack mafooti which they discovered to be deserted by its people  while he described how by the flare of the lightning they saw the inkosazana standing on the roof of a hut how they captured the wild beast ibubesi how they learned that the spirit of the inkosazana was wandering and the dreadful words she said the burning of mafooti and the fearful death of ibubesi by fire all the council listened in utter silence thus they listened also whilst he showed how evil after evil had fallen upon the regiment evil by fire and water and sickness as evil had fallen upon the land also by the plague of locusts  at length tamboosas story was finished and certain men were brought forward bound who had been the captains of the band that went with ishmael among them those who had killed or caused to die the white teacher and his wife  upon the stern command of the king these men also told their story saying that they had not meant to kill the white man and that what they did was done at the word of ibubesi whom they were ordered to obey in all things but who as they now understood had dared to lay a plot to capture the inkosazana for himself when they had finished the king rose and poured out his wrath on them because through their deeds the spirit of the inkosazana had been driven away and her curse laid upon the land where already it was at work then he commanded that they should be led thence all of them and put to a terrible death and with them those captains of the regiment who had spoken against the following of the people of mafooti who should he said have been destroyed every one  at his words executioners rushed in to seize these wretched men and then it was that rachel who all this while had sat as though she heard nothing lifted her head and spoke for the first time  set them free set them free she commanded vengeance is from heaven and heaven will pour it out in plenty not on my hands not on my hands shall be the blood of those who sent the spirit of the inkosazana to wander in the skies who was it that bade an impi run to ramah and what did they there in the house of those who gave me birth when the master calls the dogs must search and kill set them free lest there be more blood between the inkosazana and her people of the zulus  when he heard these words spoken in a strange wailing voice dingaan trembled for he knew that it was he who had bidden his dogs to run  let them go he said and let the land see them no more for ever  so those men went thankfully enough and the land saw them no more as they passed the gate other men entered starved and hungrylooking men whose bones almost pierced their skins and who carried in their hands remnants of shields that looked as though they had been gnawed by rats they saluted the king with feeble voices and squatted down upon the ground  who are those skeletons he asked angrily who dare to break in upon my council  king answered their spokesman we are captains of the nobambe the nodwenge and the isangu regiments whom thou didst send to destroy the chief madaku and his people who dwell far away in the swamp land to the north near where the great river runs into the sea king we could not come at this chief because he fled away on rafts and in boats he and his people and we lost our path among the reeds where again and again we were ambushed and many of us sank in the swamps and were drowned also we found no food and were forced to live upon our shields and he held up a gnawed fragment in his hand so we perished by hundreds and of all who went forth but twentyone times ten remain alive  when dingaan heard this he groaned for his arms had been defeated and three of his best regiments destroyed but rachel laughed aloud the terrible laugh at which all who heard it shivered  did i not say she asked that heaven would pour out its vengeance in plenty because of the blood that runs between the spirit of the inkosazana and her people of the zulus  truly this curse works fast and well exclaimed dingaan then turning to the men he shouted be gone you starved rats you cowards who do not know how to fight and be thankful that the great elephant chaka is dead for surely he would have fed you upon shields until you perished  so these captains crept away also  ere they were well gone a man appeared craving audience a fat man who wore a woeful countenance for tears ran down his bloated cheeks dingaan knew him well for every week he saw him and sometimes oftener  what is it movo keeper of the kine he asked anxiously that you break in on me thus at my council  o king answered the fat man pardon me but o king my tidings are so sad that i availed myself of my privilege and pushed past the guards at the gate  those who bear ill news ever run quickly grunted the king stop that weeping and out with it movo  shaker of the earth eater up of enemies said movo thou thyself art eaten up or at least thy cattle are the cattle that i love a sore sickness has fallen on the great herd the royal herd the white herd with the twisted horns and here he paused to sob a thousand of them are dead and many more are sick soon there will be no herd left and he wept outright  now dingaan leapt up in his wrath and struck the man so sharply with the shaft of the spear he held that it broke upon his head  fat fool that you are he exclaimed what have you done to my cattle speak or you shall be slain for an evildoer who has bewitched them  is it a crime to be fat o king answered the indignant movo rubbing his skull when others are so much fatter and he looked reproachfully at dingaans enormous person can i help it if a thousand of thy oxen are now but hides for shields  will you answer or will you taste the other end of the spear asked dingaan grasping the broken shaft just above the blade what have you done to my cattle  o king i have done nothing to them can i help it if those accursed beasts choose to eat dead locusts instead of grass and foam at the mouth and choke can the cattle help it if all the grass has become locusts so that there is nothing else for them to eat i am not to blame and the cattle are not to blame blame the heavens above to whom thou or rather he added hastily some wicked wizard must have given offence for no such thing as this has been known before in zululand  again rachel broke in with her wild laughter and said  did i not tell thee that vengeance would be poured down in plenty poured down like the rain o dingaan vengeance on the king vengeance on the people vengeance on the soldiers vengeance on the corn vengeance on the kine vengeance on the whole land because blood runs between the spirit of the inkosazana and the race of the amazulu whom once she loved  it is true it is true white one but why dost thou say it so often groaned the maddened dingaan why show the whip to those who must feel the blow now you movo have you done  not quite o king answered the melancholy movo still rubbing his head the cattle of all the kraals around are dying of this same sickness and the crops are quite eaten so that next winter everyone must perish of famine  is that all o movo  not quite o king since messengers have come to me as head keeper of the kine to say that all the other royal herds within two days journey are also stricken although if i understand them right of some other pest also which i forgot to add  hunt out this bearer of illtidings roared dingaan hunt him out and send orders that his own cattle be taken to fill up the holes in my blanket  now some attendants sprang on the luckless movo and began to beat him with their sticks still before he reached the gates he succeeded in turning round weeping in good earnest and shouted  it is quite useless o king all my cattle are dead too they will find nothing but the horns and the hoofs for i have sold the hides to the shieldmakers  then they thrust him forth  he was gone and for a while there was silence for despair filled the hearts of the king and his councillors as they gazed at rachel dismayed wondering within themselves how they might be rid of her and of the evils which she had brought upon them because of the blood of her people which lay at her doors  whilst they still stared thus in silence yet another messenger came running through the gate like one in great haste  now i am minded to order this fellow to be killed before he opens his mouth said dingaan for of a surety he also is a bearer of illtidings  nay o king cried out the man in alarm my news is only that an embassy awaits without  from whom asked dingaan anxiously the white amaboona  nay o king from the queen of the ghostpeople to whom thou didst dispatch noie daughter of seyapi a while ago  hearing the name noie rachel lifted her head and for the first time her face grew human  i remember said dingaan admit the embassy  then followed a long pause at length the gate opened and through it appeared noie herself clad in a garb of spotless white and somewhat travelworn but beautiful as ever she was escorted by four gigantic men who were naked except for their moochas but wore copper ornaments on their wrists and ankles and great rings of copper in their ears after her came three litters whereof the grass curtains were tightly drawn carried by bearers of the same size and race and after these a bodyguard of fifty soldiers of a like stature this strange and barbarouslooking company advanced slowly whilst the council stared at them wondering for never before had they seen people so huge and arriving in front of the king set down the litters staring back in answer with their great round eyes  as they came rachel rose from her stool and turned slowly so that she and noie who walked in front of the embassy stood face to face for a moment they gazed at each other then noie running forward knelt before rachel and kissed the hem of her robe but rachel bent down and lifted her up in her strong arms embracing her as a mother embraces a child  where hast thou been sister she asked i have sought thee long  surely on thy business zoola answered noie scanning her curiously dost thou not remember  nay i remember naught noie save that i have sought thee long my spirit wanders noie  lady she said my people told me that it was so they told me many terrible things they who can see afar they for whom distance has no gates but i did not believe them now i see with my own eyes be at peace lady my people will give thee back thy spirit though perchance thou must travel to find it for in their land all spirits dwell be at peace and listen  with thee noie i am at peace replied rachel and still holding her hand she reseated herself upon the stool  where are the messengers asked dingaan i see none  king answered noie they shall appear  then she made signs to the escort of giants some of whom came forward and drew the curtains of the litters whilst others opened huge umbrellas of split cane which they carried in their hands  now what weapons are these asked dingaan daughter of seyapi you know that none may appear before the king armed  weapons against the sun o king which my people hate  and who are the wizards that hate the sun queried dingaan again in an astonished voice then he was silent for out of the first litter came a little man pale as the shoot from a bulb that has grown in darkness with large soft eyes like the eyes of an owl that blinked in the light and long hair out of which all the colour seemed to have faded  as the man who like noie was dressed in a white robe and in size measured no more than a twelveyearold child set his sandalled feet upon the ground one of the huge guards sprang forward to shield him with the umbrella but being awkward struck his leg against the pole of the litter and stumbled against him nearly knocking him to the ground and in his efforts to save himself letting fall the umbrella the little man turned on him furiously and holding one hand above his head as though to shield himself from the sun with the other pointed at him speaking in a low sibilant voice that sounded like the hiss of a snake thereon the guard fell to his knees and bending down with outstretched arms beat his forehead on the earth as though in prayer for mercy the sight of this giant making supplication to one whom he could have killed with a blow was so strange that dingaan unable to restrain his curiosity asked noie if the dwarf was ordering the other to be killed  nay king answered noie for blood is hateful to these people he is saying that the soldier has offended many times therefore he curses him and tells him that he shall wither like a plucked leaf and die without seeing his home again  and will he die asked dingaan  certainly king those upon whom the ghostpeople lay their curse must obey the curse moreover this man deserves his doom for on the journey he killed another to take his food  of a truth a terrible people said dingaan uneasily bid them lay no curse on me lest they should see more blood than they wish for  it is foolish to threaten the great ones of the ghostfolk king for they hear even what they seem not to understand answered noie quietly  wow exclaimed the king let my words be forgotten i am sorry that i troubled them to come so far to visit me  meanwhile the offender had crept back upon his hands and knees looking like a great beaten dog whilst another soldier taking his umbrella held it over the angry dwarf also from the other litters two more dwarfs had descended so like to the first that it was difficult to tell them apart and were in the same fashion sheltered by guards with umbrellas mats were brought for them also and on these they sat themselves down at right angles to dingaan and to rachel whose stool was set in front of the king whilst behind them stood three of their escort each holding an umbrella over the head of one of them with the left hand while with the right they fanned them with small branches upon which the leaves although they were dead remained green and shining  with dingaan and his council the three dwarfs did not seem to trouble themselves but at rachel they peered earnestly then one of them made a sign and muttered something whereon a soldier of the escort stepped forward with a fourth umbrella which he opened over the heads of rachel and of noie who stood at her side  why does he do that asked dingaan the inkosazana is not a bat that she fears the sun  he does it answered noie that the inkosazana may sit in the shade of the wisdom of the ghostpeople and that her heart which is hot with many wrongs may grow cool in the shade  what does he know about the inkosazana and her wrongs asked dingaan again but noie only shrugged her shoulders and made no answer  now one of the dwarfs made another sign whereon more guards advanced carrying small bowls of polished wood these bowls they set upon the ground before the three dwarfs one before each of them filling them to the brim with water from a gourd  if your people are thirsty noie exclaimed the king i have beer for them to drink for at least the locusts have left me that bid them throw away the water and i will give them beer  it is not water king she answered but dew gathered from certain trees before sunrise and it is their spirits that are thirsty for knowledge not their bodies for in this dew they read the truth  then the inkosazana must be of their family noie for she read of the coming of the white chief dario in water or so they say  perhaps o king if it is so these prophets will know it and acknowledge her  now for a long while there was silence so long a while indeed that dingaan and his councillors began to move uneasily for they felt as though the dwarf men were fingering their heartstrings at length the three dwarfs lifted their wrinkled faces that were bleached to the colour of halfripe corn and gazed at each other with their round owllike eyes then as though with one accord they said to each other  what seest thou priest and at same sign from them noie translated the words into zulu  now the first of them he who had cursed the soldier spoke in his low hissing voice a voice like to the whisper of leaves in the wind noie rendering his words  i see two maidens standing by a house that moves when cattle draw it one of them is darkskinned it is she and he pointed to noie the other is fairskinned it is she and he pointed to rachel they cast each of them a hair from her head into the air the black hair falls to the ground but a spirit catches the hair of gold and bears it northward it is the spirit of seyapi whom the zulus slew northwards he bears it and lays it in the hand of the mother of the trees and with it a message  yes with it a message repeated the other two nodding their heads  then one of them drew a little package wrapped in leaves from his robe and motioned to noie that she should give it to rachel noie obeyed and the man said  let us see if she has vision tell us thou white one what lies within the leaves  rachel who had been sitting like a person in a dream took the packet and without looking at it answered  many other leaves and within the last of them a hair from this head of mine i see it but three knots have been tied therein they are three great troubles  open said the dwarf to noie who cut the fibre binding the packet and unfolded many layers of leaves within the last leaf was a golden hair and in it were tied three knots  noie laid the hair upon the head of rachelit was hers then she showed it to the king and his council who stared at the knots not knowing what to say and after they had looked at it refolded it in the leaves and returned the packet to the dwarf  now the dwarf who had read the picture in his bowl turned to him who sat nearest and asked  what seest thou priest  the man stared at the limpid water and answered  i see this place at night i see yonder king and his councillors talking to a white man with evil eyes and the face of a hawk who has been wounded on the head and foot i read their lips they bargain together it is of the bringing of an old prophet and his wife hither by force i see the prophet and his wife in a house and with them zulus by the command of the white man with the evil eyes the zulus kill the prophet whose head is bald and his wife dies upon the bed before they kill the prophet he slays one of the zulus with smoke that comes from an iron tube  when he heard all this dingaan groaned but the dwarf who had spoken taking no heed of him said to the third dwarf  what seest thou priest to which that dwarf answered  i see the white one yonder standing on a hut but her spirit has fled from her it has fled from her to haunt the trees in her hand is a spear and below is the white man with the evil eyes held by zulus i read her words she says that there is blood and he shivered as he said the word yes blood between her spirit and the people of the zulus she prophesies evil to them i see the ill i see many burnt in a great fire i see many drowned in an angry river i see the demons of sickness lay hold of many i see her spirit call up the locusts from the coast land i see it bring disaster on their arms i see it scatter plague among their cattle i see a dim shape that it summons striding towards this land it travels fast over a winter veld and the head of it is the head of a skull and the name of it is famine  as he ended his words the three dwarfs bent forward and with one movement seized their bowls and emptied them on to the ground saying  earth earth drink drink and bear record of these visions  now the council was much disturbed for although there were great witch doctors among them none had known magic like to this only dingaan stared down brooding then he looked up and his fat body shook with hoarse laughter  you play pretty tricks little men he said with your giants and your boughs and your huts that open and your bowls of water but for all that they are only tricks since noie or others have told you of these things that happened in the past now if you are wizards indeed read me the riddle of the words of the inkosazana that she spoke before her spirit left her because of the evil acts of the wolf ibubesi show me the answer to them in your bowls of water little men or be driven hence as cheats and liars also tell us your names by which we may know you  when noie had translated this speech the three dwarfs gathered themselves under one umbrella and spoke to each other then they slid back to their places and the first of them he who had cursed the soldier said  king of the zulus i am eddo this on my right is pani and that on my left is hana we are children of the mother of the trees we are highpriests of the greypeople the dreampeople who rule by dreams and wisdom not by spears as thou dost o king we are the ghostkings whom the ghosts obey we are the masters of the dead and the readers of hearts those are our names and titles o king we have travelled hither because thou sentest a messenger of our own blood who whispered a strange tale in the ear of the mother of the trees a tale of one of whom we knew already but desired to see and all three of them nodded towards rachel seated on her stool we will read thy riddle o king but first thou must fix the fee  what do you demand ghostpeople asked dingaan cattle are somewhat scarce here just now and wives i think would be of little use to you what is there then that you desire and i can give  they looked at each other then eddo said pointing with his thin hand upon which the nails grew long  we ask for the white one who sits there we think that her spirit dwells with us already and we ask her body that we may join it to the spirit again  now the council murmured but dingaan replied  once we sought to keep her in whom dwelt the inkosazana of the zulus but things have gone amiss and she brings curses on us if shape and spirit were joined together again mayhap the curses would be taken off our heads yet we dare not give her to you unless she gives herself of her own will moreover first the divination then the pay is that enough  it is enough they answered speaking all together set out the matter king of the zulus and we will see what we can do  then dingaan beckoned to a man with a withered hand who sat close to him listening and noting all things but saying nothing and said  stand forth thou mopo and tell the tale  so mopo rose and began his story he told how he alone among the people of the zulus had thrice seen the spirit of the inkosazana in the days of the blackonewhowasgone he told how many moons ago the white man ibubesi had come to the great place speaking of a beautiful white maiden who was known by the name of the inkosazanayzoola a maiden who ruled the lightning and was not as other maidens are and how he had been sent to see her and found that as was the spirit of the inkosazana which he knew so was this maiden  wow he added save that the one walked on air and the other on earth they are the same  moreover as a spirit she seemed wise he told of the trapping of noie and of the decoying of rachel into zululand and of the interview between her and the king by moonlight when she smelt out noie now he was going on to speak of the question put by dingaan to the inkosazana and the answer that she gave to him when one of the little men who all this while sat as though they were asleep blinking their eyes in the lightit was eddosaid  surely thou forgettest something tongue of the king thou who are named mopo or umbopa son of makedama thou forgettest certain words which the inkosazana whispered to thee when she threw her cloak about thy head ere thou fleddest away from the council of the king of course we do not know the words but why dost thou not repeat them tongue of the king  mopo stared at them and his teeth chattered then he answered  because they have nothing to do with the story ghostmen because they were of my own death which is a little matter  the three dwarfs turned their heads towards each other and said each to the other  hearest thou priest and hearest thou priest and hearest thou priest he says that the words were of his own death and have nothing to do with the story and they smiled and nodded and appeared to go to sleep again  now mopo went on with his tale he told of the question of the king how he had asked the inkosazana whether he should fall upon the boers or let them be of how she had searched the heavens with her eyes of how the meteor had travelled before them and burst over the kraal umgugundhlovu that star which she said was thrown by the hand of the greatgreat the umkulunkulu and of how she had sworn that she also heard the feet of a people travelling over plain and mountain and saw the rivers behind them running red with blood lastly he told of how she had refused to add to or take from her words or to set out their meaning  then mopo sat himself down again in the circle of the councillors and watched and hearkened like a hungry wolf  ye have heard ghostmen said the king now if ye are really wise interpret to us the meaning of this saying of the inkosazana and of the running star which none can read  the priests awoke and consulted with each other then eddo said  this matter is too high for us king of the zulus  dingaan heard and laughed angrily  i thought it i thought it he cried ye are but cheats after all who like any common doctor repeat the gossip that ye have heard and pretend that it is a message from heaven now why should i not whip you from my town with rods till ye see that red blood which ye so greatly fear  at the mention of the word blood the little men seemed to curl up like cut grass before fire then eddo smiled a sickly smile and answered  be gentle king walk softly king we are but poor cheats yet we will do our best we or another for us a new bowl a big bowl a red bowl for the red king and fill it to the brink with dew  as he piped out the words a man from among their company appeared with a vessel much larger than those into which they had gazed and made of beautiful polished bloodhued wood that gleamed in the sunlight eddo took it in his hand and another slave filled it with water from the gourd the last drop of the water filled it to the brim then the three of them muttered invocations over it and eddo beckoning to noie bade her bear it to the inkosazana that she might gaze therein  rachel received it and looked as she looked all the emptiness left her eyes which grew quick and active and full of horror  thou seest something maiden queried eddo  aye answered rachel i see much must i speak  nay nay breathe on the water thrice and fix the visions now bear the bowl to yonder king and let him look perchance he also will see something  rachel breathed on the water thrice rose like one in a trance and advancing to dingaan placed the brimming bowl upon his knees  look king look cried eddo and tell us if in what thou seest lies an answer to the oracle of the inkosazana  dingaan stared at the water angrily at first as one who smells a trick then his face changed  by the head of the black one he said i see people fighting in this kraal white men and zulus and the white men are mastered and the zulus drag them out to death the zulus conquer o my people it is as i thought that it would bethat is the meaning of the riddle of the inkosazana  good good said the council doubtless it shall come to pass  but the dwarf eddo only smiled again and waved his hand  look once more king he said in his low hissing voice and dingaan looked  now his face darkened i see fire he said yes in this kraal umgugundhlovu burns my royal house burns and yonder come the white men riding upon horses oh they are gone  eddo waved his hand saying  look again and tell us what thou seest king  unwillingly enough but as though he could not resist dingaan looked and said  i see a mountain whereof the top is like the shape of a woman and between her knees is the mouth of a cave beneath the floor of that cave i see bodies the body of a great man and the body of a girl she must have been fair that girl  now when he heard this the councillor who was named mopo he with the withered hand started up then sat down again but all were so intent upon listening to dingaan that none noticed his movements save noie and the priests of the ghosts  i see a man a fat man come out of the cave went on dingaan he seems to be wounded and weary also his stomach is sunken as though with hunger two other men seize him a tall warrior with muscles that stand out on his legs and another that is thin and short they drag him up the mountain to a great cleft that is between the breasts of her who sits thereon they speak with him but i cannot see their faces for they are wrapped in mist or the face of the fat man for that also is wrapped in mist they hale him to the edge of the cleft they hurl him over he falls headlong and the mist is swept from his face ah it is my own face footnote see nada the lily chapter xxxv  priest whispered each of the little men to his fellow in the dead silence that followed priest this king says that he sees his own face priest tell me now has not the spirit of the inkosazana interpreted the oracle of the inkosazana will not yonder king be hurled down this cleft is he not the star that falls  and they nodded and smiled at each other  but dingaan leapt up in his rage and terror and with him leapt up the councillors and witch doctors all save he who was named mopo son of makedama who sat still gazing at the ground dingaan leapt up and seizing the bowl hurled it from him so that the water in it fell over rachel like rain from the clouds he leapt up and he cursed the ghostpriests as evil wizards bidding them begone from his land he raved at them he threatened them he cursed them again and again the little men sat still and smiled till he grew weary and ceased then they spoke to each other saying  he has sprinkled the white one with the dew of out trees and henceforth she belongs to the trees is it not so priest  they nodded in assent and eddo rose and addressed the king in a new voice a shrill commanding voice saying  o man thou that art called a king and causest much blood to flow thou are but a bubble on a river of blood thou slayer that shalt be slain thou thrower of spears upon whom the spear shall fall thou who shalt look upon the face of stone that knows not pity thou whom the earth shall swallow thou who shalt perish at the hands of  the faces of the slayers were veiled priest broke in the other two dwarfs peeping up at him from beneath the shadow of their umbrellas surely the faces of those slayers were veiled o priest  thou who shalt perish at the hands of avengers whose faces are veiled thy riddle is read for thee as the mother of the trees decreed that it should be read it is well read it is truly read it shall befall in its season now give to thy servants their reward and let them depart in peace give to them that white one whose lost spirit spoke to thee from the water  take her roared dingaan take her and begone for to the zulus she and noie the witch bring naught but ill  but one of the council cried  the inkosazana cannot be sent away with these magicians unless it is her will to go  then the little men nodded to noie and noie whispered in the ear of rachel  rachel listened and answered whither thou goest noie thither i go with thee i who seek my spirit  so noie took rachel by the hand and led her from the councilplace of the king and as she went followed by the ghostpriests and their escort for the last time all the councillors rose up and gave to her the royal salute only dingaan sat upon the ground and beat it with his fists in fury  thus did the inkosazanayzoola depart from the great place of the king of the zulus and mopo the son of makedama shading his eyes with his hand watched her go from between his withered fingers    chapter xix  rachel finds her spirit   northward ever northward journeyed rachel with the ghostpriests for days and weeks they journeyed slowly and for the most part at night since these people dreaded the glare of the sun sometimes she was borne along in a litter with noie upon the shoulders of the huge slaves but more often she walked between the litters in the midst of a guard of soldiers for now she was so strong that she never seemed to weary nor even in the fever swamps where many fell ill did any sickness touch her also this labour of the body seemed to soothe her wandering and tormented mind as did the touch of noies hand and the sound of noies voice at times however her madness got hold of her and she broke out into those bursts of wild laughter which had scared the zulus then eddo would descend from his litter and lay his long fingers on her forehead and look into her eyes in such a fashion that she went to sleep and was at peace but if noie spoke to her in these sleeps she answered her questions and even talked reasonably as she had done before the people of mafooti laid the body of richard at her feet and she stood upon the roof of the hut which ishmael strove to climb  thus it was that noie came to learn all that had happened to her since they parted for though she had gathered much from them the zulus could not or would not tell her everything in past days she had heard from rachel of the lad richard darrien who had been her companion years before through that night of storm on the island in the river and now she understood that her lady loved this richard and that it was because of his murder by the wild brute ibubesi that she had become mad  yes she was mad and for that reason noie rejoiced that the dwarf people were taking her to their home since if she could be cured at all they were able to heal her they the great doctors moreover if these priests and the zulus would have let her go whither else could she have gone whose parents and lover were dead except to the white people on the coast who did not reverence the insane as do all black folk but would have locked her up in a house with others like her until she died no although she knew that there were dangers before them many and great dangers noie rejoiced that things had befallen thus  also in her tender care already rachel improved much and noie believed that one day she would be herself again only she wished that she and her lady were alone together that there were no priests with them and above all no eddo for eddo as she knew well was jealous of her authority over rachel jealous too of the love that they bore one to the other he wished to use this crazed white chieftainess who had been accepted as their inkosazana by the great zulu people for his own purposes this had been clear from the beginning and that was why when he first heard of her he had consented to go on the embassy to dingaan since by his magic he could foresee much of the future that was dark to noie whose blood was mixed and who had not all the gifts of the ghostkings  moreover the mother of the trees was noies great aunt being the sister of her grandfather or of his father noie was not sure which for she had dwelt among them but a few days and never thought to inquire of the matter but of one thing she was sure that eddo the first priest hated this mother of the trees who was named nya and desired that when her tree fell the next mother should be his servant which nya was not perhaps reflected noie it was in his mind that her lady would fill this part and being mad obey him in all things  still she kept a watch upon her words and even on her thoughts for eddo and his fellowpriests pani and hana were able to peer into human hearts and read their secrets also she protected rachel from him as much as she was able never leaving her side for a moment however weary she might be for she feared lest he should become the master of her will only when the fits of madness fell upon her mistress she was forced to allow eddo to quell them with his touch and eye since herself she lacked this power nor dared she call the others to her help for they were under the hand of eddo  northward ever northward first they passed through the zulus and their subject tribes who knew of them and of the inkosazana all of these were suffering from the curse that lay upon the land because as they believed there was blood between the inkosazana and her people the locusts devoured their crops and the plague ravaged their cattle so that they were terrified of her and of the little greyfolk with whom she travelled the wizards who had shown fearful things to dingaan and left him sick with dread they fled at their approach only leaving a few of their old people to prostrate themselves before this inkosazana who wandered in search of her own spirit and the dreammen who dwelt with the ghosts in the heart of a forest and to pray her and them to lift this cloud of evil from the land bringing gifts of such things as were left to them  at length all the zulus were passed and they entered into the territories of other tribes wild wandering tribes   but even these knew of the ghostkings and attempted nothing against them as they had attempted nothing against noie and her escort when she travelled through this land on her embassy to the people of the trees indeed some of their doctors would visit them at their camps and ask an oracle or an interpretation of dreams or a charm against their enemies or a deadly poison offering great gifts in return at times eddo and his fellowpriests would listen and the giants would bring a tiny bowl filled with dew into which they gazed telling them the pictures they saw there though this they did but seldom as the supply of dew which they had brought with them from their own country ran low and since it could not be used twice they kept it for their own purposes  next they came to a country of vast swamps where dwelt few men and many wild beasts a country full of fevers and reeds and pools in which lived snakes and crocodiles yet no harm came to them from these things for the ghostpriests had medicines that warded off sickness and charms that protected them from all evil creatures and in their bowls they read what road to take and how dangers could be avoided so they passed the swamps safely only here that slave whom eddo had cursed at the kraal of dingaan and who from that day onward had wasted till he seemed to be nothing but a great skeleton sickened and died  did i not tell you that it should be so said eddo to the other slaves who trembled before him as reeds tremble in the wind be warned ye fools who think that the strength of men lies in their bodies and their spears then he kicked the corpse of the dead giant gently with his sandalled foot and bade his brothers throw him into a pool for the crocodiles to eat  having passed the swamps and many rivers at length they turned westward travelling for days over grassy uplands like to those of natal among which wandered pastoral tribes with their herds of cattle on these plains were multitudes of game and many lions especially in the bushclad slopes of great isolated mountains that rose up here and there these lions roared round them at night but the priests did not seem to be afraid for when the brutes became overbold they placed deadly poison in the carcases of buck that the nomad tribes brought them as offerings of which the lions ate and died in numbers also they sold some of the poison to the tribe for a great price in cattle as to the delivery of which cattle they gave minute directions for they knew that none dared to cheat the mother of the trees and her prophets  after the plains were left behind they reached a vast fertile and lowlying country that sloped upwards for miles and miles which as noie explained to rachel when she would listen was the outer territory of the ghostpeople for here dwelt the race of the umkulus or great ones who were their slaves that folk to which the soldiers of their escort belonged of these there were thousands and tens of thousands who earned their living by agriculture since although they were so huge and fiercelooking they did not fight unless they were attacked the chiefs of this people had their dwellings in vast caves in the sides of cliffs which if need be could be turned into impregnable fortresses but their real ruler was the mother of the trees and their office was to protect the country of the trees and furnish it with food since the treepeople were dreamers who did little work  while they travelled through this land all the headmen of the umkulus accompanied them and every morning a council was held at which these made report to the priests of all that had chanced of late and laid their causes before them for judgment these causes eddo and his fellowpriests heard and settled as seemed best to them nor did any dare to dispute their rulings indeed even when they deposed a high chief and set another in his place the man who had lost all knelt before them and thanked them for their goodness also they tried criminals who had stolen women or committed murder but they never ordered such men to be slain outright sometimes eddo would look at them dreamily and curse them in his slow hissing voice bidding them waste in body and in mind as he had done to the soldier at umgugundhlovu and die within one year or two or three as the case might be or sometimes if the crime was very bad he would command that they should be sent to travel in the desert that is wander to and fro without food or water until death found them now and again miserablelooking men mere skeletons with hollow cheeks and eyes that seemed to start from their heads would appear at their camps weeping and imploring that the curse which had been laid upon them in past days should be taken off their heads at such people eddo and his brotherpriests pani and hana would laugh softly asking them how they throve upon the wrath of the mother of the trees and whether they thought that others who saw them would be encouraged to sin as they had done but when the poor wretches prayed that they might be killed outright with the spear the priests shrank up in horror beneath their umbrellas and asked if they were mad that they should wish them to sprinkle their trees with blood  one morning a number of these bewitched umkulus men women and children appeared and when the three priests mocked them as was their wont and the guards some of whom were their own relatives sought to beat them away with sticks threw themselves upon the ground and burst into weeping rachel who was camped at a little distance with noie in a reed tent that the guard had made for her which they folded up and carried as they did the umbrellas heard the sound of this lamentation and came out followed by noie for a space she stood contemplating their misery with a troubled air then asked noie why these people seemed so starved and why they wept noie told her that when she was on her embassy the head of their kraal an enormous man of middle age whom she pointed out to rachel had sought to detain her because she was beautiful and he wished to make her his wife although he knew well that she was on an embassy to the mother of the trees she had escaped but it was for this reason that the curse of which they were perishing had been laid upon him and his folk  now rachel went on to where the three priests sat beneath their umbrellas dozing away the hours of sunlight beckoning to the doomed family to follow her  wake priests she cried in a loud voice and they looked up astonished rubbing their eyes and asked what was the matter  this said rachel i command you to lift the weight of your malediction off the head of these people who have suffered enough  thou commandest us exclaimed eddo astonished and if we will not beautiful one what then  then answered rachel i will lift it and set it on to your heads and you shall perish as they are perishing oh you think me mad you priests who kill more cruelly than did the zulus and mad i am whose spirit wanders yet i tell you that new powers grow within me though whence they come i know not and what i say i can perform  now they stared at her muttering together and sending for a wooden bowl peeped into it whatever it was they saw there did not please them for at length eddo addressed the crowd of suppliants saying  the mother of the trees forgives the knot she tied she looses the tree she planted she digs up you are forgiven bones put on strength mouths receive food eyes forget your blindness and feet your wanderings grow fat and laugh increase and multiply for the curse we give you a blessing such is the will of the mother of the trees  nay nay cried rachel when she understood their words believe him not ye starvelings such is the will of the inkosazana of the zulus she who has lost her spirit and anothers and travels all this weary way to find them  then her madness seemed to come upon her again for she tossed her arms on high and burst into one of her wild fits of laughter but those whom she had redeemed heeded it not for they ran to her and since they dared not touch her or even her robe kissed the ground on which she had stood and blessed her moreover from that moment they began to mend and within a few days were changed folk this noie knew for they followed up rachel to the confines of the desert and she saw it with her eyes also the fame of the deed spread among the umkulu people who groaned under the cruel rule of the ghostkings and mad or sane from that day forward they adored rachel even more than the zulus had done and like the zulus believed her to be a spirit no mere human being they declared could have lifted off the curse of the mother of the trees from those upon whom it had fallen  thenceforward eddo pani and hana hid their judgments from rachel and would not suffer such suppliants to approach the camp also when they seized a number of men because these had conspired together to rebel against the ghostpeople and brought them on towards their own country for a certain purpose they forced them to act as bearers like the others so that rachel might not guess their doom for now with all their power they also were afraid of this white inkosazana as dingaan had been afraid  so they travelled up this endless slope of fertile land leaving all the kraals of the giant umkulus behind them and one morning at the dawn camped upon the edge of a terrible desert a place of dry sands and sunblasted rocks that looked like the bottom of a drained ocean where nothing lived save the fire lizards and certain venomous snakes that buried themselves in the sand all except their heads and only crawled out at night after the people of the umkulus this horrible waste was the great defence of the ghostkings whose country it ringed about since none could pass it without guides and water indeed noie had been forced to stay here for days with her escort until the mother of the trees learning of her coming in some strange fashion had sent priests and guards to bring her to her land but the zulus who were with her they did not bring except one witchdoctor to bear witness to her words these they left among the umkulus till she should return nor were those zulus sorry who had already heard enough of the magic of the ghostkings and feared to come face to face with them  but it is true that they also feared the umkulus whom because of their great size and the fierceness of their air the zulus took to be evil spirits though if this were so they could not understand why they should obey a handful of grey dwarfs who lived far from them beyond the desert still these umkulus did them no harm for on her return noie found them all safe and well  that afternoon rachel and the dwarfs plunged into the dreadful wilderness heading straight for the ball of the sinking sun here although she wished to do so she was not allowed to walk for fear lest the serpents should bite her said eddo but must journey in the litter with noie so they entered it and were borne forward at a great pace the bearers travelling at a run and being often changed also many other bearers came with them and on the shoulders of each of them was strapped a hide bag of water of this they soon discovered the reason for the sand of that wilderness was white with salt the air also seemed to be full of salt so that the thirst of those who travelled there was sharp and constant and if it could not be satisfied they died  it was a very strange journey and although she did not seem to take much note of them at the time its details and surroundings burned themselves deeply into rachels mind the hush of the infinite desert the white moonlight gleaming upon the salt white sand the tall rocks which stood up here and there like unfinished obelisks and colossal statues the snowy clouds of dust that rose beneath the feet of the company the hoarse shouts of the guides the close heat the halts for water which was greedily swallowed in great gulps the occasional cry and confusion when a man fell out exhausted or because he had been bitten by one of the serpentsall these things amongst others were very strange  once rachel asked vaguely what became of these outworn and snakepoisoned men and noie only shook her head in answer for she did not think fit to tell her that they were left to find their way back or to perish as might chance  all that night and for the first hours of the day that followed they went forward swiftly camping at last to eat and sleep in the shadow of a mass of rock that looked like a gigantic castle with walls and towers here they remained in the burning heat until the sun began to sink once more and then went on again leaving some of the bearers behind them because there was no longer water for so many there the great men sat in patient resignation and watched them go they who knew that having little or no water few of them could hope to see their homes again still so great was their dread of the ghostpriests that they never dared to murmur or to ask that any of the store of water should be given to them they who were but cattle to be used until they died  the second nights journey was like the first for this desert never changed its aspect and on the following morning they halted beneath another pile of fantastic sandburnished rocks from some of which hung salt like icicles here one of the bearers who had been denied water as a punishment for laziness although in truth he was sick began to suck the salticicles suddenly he went raving mad and rushing with a knife at eddo pani and hana where they sat under their cane umbrellas that for the sake of coolness were damped with this precious water he tried to kill them  then as they saw the knife gleaming all their imperturbable calm departed from these dwarfs they squeaked in terror with thin voices as rats speak they rolled upon the ground yelling to the slaves to save them from a red death the man was seized and though he fought with all his giant strength held down and choked in the sand once however he twisted his head free howling a curse at them also he managed to hurl his knife at eddo and the point of it scratched him on the hand causing the pale blood to flow a sight at which eddo and the other priests broke into tears and lamentations that continued long after the umkulu was dead  why are they such cowards asked rachel dreamily for she had not seen the murder of the slave and thought that eddo had only scratched himself  because they fear the sight of blood zoola answered noie which is a very evil omen to them death they do not fear who are already among ghosts but if it is a red death their souls are spilt with their life or so they believe  towards noon that day the sky banked up with luridcoloured clouds the sun which should have shone so hotly went out and a hush that was almost fearful in its heat and intensity fell upon the desert the umkulu bearers became disturbed and gathered together into knots talking in low tones eddo and his brother priests who either because of the adventure of the morning or the oppressive air could not sleep as was usual with them were also disturbed they crept from beneath their umbrellas which as the sun had vanished were of no use to them and stood together staring at the salty plain which under that leaden and lowering sky looked white as snow and at the brooding clouds above they even sent for their bowls to read in them pictures of what was about to happen but there was no dew left so these could not be used  then they consulted with the captains of the bearers who told then what no magic was needed to guess that a mighty storm was gathering and that if it overtook them in the desert they would be buried beneath the drifting sand now this was a white death which the dwarfs did not seem to desire so they ordered an instant departure instead of delaying the start until sunset as they had intended for then if all went well they would have arrived at their homes by dawn and not in the middle of the night so that litters were made ready and they went forward through the overpowering heat that caused the bearers to hang out their tongues and reel as they walked  towards evening the storm began to stir little wandering puffs of wind blew upon them and died away and lightnings flickered intermittently then a hot breeze sprang up that gradually increased in strength until the sand rolled and rippled before it now one way and now another for this breeze seemed to blow in turn from every quarter of the heavens suddenly however after trying them all it settled in the west and drove straight into their faces with ever increasing force now eddo thrust out his head between the curtains of his litter and called to the bearers to hurry as they had but a little distance of desert left to pass after which came the grass country where there would be no danger from the sand they heard and obeyed changing the pole gangs frequently as those who carried the litters became exhausted  but the storm was quicker than they it burst upon them while they were still in the waste though not in its full strength then the darkness came utter darkness for no moon or stars could be seen and salt and sand drove down on them like hail through it all the bearers fought on though how they found their way noie who was watching them could not guess since no landmarks were left to guide them they fought on blinded choked with the salt sand that drove into their eyes and lungs till man after man they fell down and perished others took their places and yet they fought on  it must have been near to midnight when the company or those who were left of them staggered to the edge of that dreadful wilderness which was but a vast plain of stone and sand bordered on the west as on the east by slopes of fertile soil for a while the fierce tempest lifted a little and the light of the stars which struggled through breaks in the clouds showed that they were marching down a steep descent of grassland thus they went on for several more hours till at length the bearers of the litter in which were rachel and noie who for a long time had been staggering to and fro like drunken men came to a halt and litter and all sank to the ground utterly exhausted   rachel and noie disentangled themselves from the litter for they were unhurt and stood by it not knowing where to go till presently two other litters containing the priests came up for the third had been abandoned and its occupant crowded in with eddo now a great clamour arose in the darkness the priests hissing commands to the surviving bearers to take up the litter and proceed but great as was their strength this the poor men could not do there they lay upon the ground answering that eddo might curse them if he wished or even kill them as their brothers had been killed but they were unable to stir another step until they had rested and drunk where they were there they must lie until rain fell then the priests wished rachel to enter one of their litters leaving noie to walk which they were afraid to do themselves but when she understood rachel cut the matter short by answering  not so i will walk and picking up the spear of one of the fallen umkulu to serve as a staff she took noie by the hand and started forward down the hill  one of the priests clasped her robe to draw her back but she turned on him with the spear whereon he shrank back into his litter like a snail into his shell and left her alone so following the steep path they marched on and after them came the two litters with the priests carried by all the bearers who could still stand for these old men weighed no more than children from far below them rose a mighty sound as of an angry sea  what is that noise called rachel into the ear of noie for the gale was rising again  the sound of wind in the forest where the treefolk dwell she answered  then the dawn broke an awful bloodred dawn and by degrees they saw beneath them ran a shallow river and beyond it stretching for league upon league farther than the eye could see lay the mighty forest whereof the trees soared two hundred feet or more into the air the dark illimitable forest that rolled as the sea rolls beneath the pressure of the gale and indeed seen from above looked like a green and tossing ocean at the sight of the water rachel and noie began to run towards it hand in hand for they were parched with thirst whose mouths were full of the salt dust of the desert the bearers of the litters in which were the three priests ran also paying no heed to the cries of the dwarfs within at length it was reached and throwing themselves down they drank until that raging thirst of theirs was satisfied even eddo and his companions crawled out of their litters and drank then having washed their hands and faces in the cool water they forded the fleet stream and filled with a new life followed the road that ran beyond towards the forest scarcely had they set foot upon the farther bank when the heart of the tempest which had been eddying round them all night long burst over them in its fury the lightnings blazed the thunder rolled and the wild wind grew to a hurricane so fierce that the litters in which were eddo pani and hana were torn from the grasp of the bearers and rolled upon the ground from the wreck of them for they were but frail things the little grey priests emerged trembling or rather were dragged by the hands of their giant bearers to whom they clung as a frightened infant clings to its mother rachel saw them and laughed  look at the masters of magic she cried to noie those who kill with a curse those who rule the ghosts and she pointed to the tiny contemptible figures with fluttering robes being dragged along by those giants whom but a little while before they had threatened with death  i see them answered noie into her ear their spirits are strong when they are at peace but in trouble they fear doom more than others now if i were those umkulu i would make an end of them while they can  but these great patient men did otherwise indeed when the dwarfs worn out and bewildered by the hurricane could walk no more they took them up and carried them as a woman carries a babe  now they were passing a belt of open land between the river and the forest in which terrified mobs of cattle rushed to and fro while their herds slavemen of large size like the umkulu tried to drive them to some place where they would be safe from the tempest in this belt also grew broad fields of grain which furnished food for the treefolk at last they came to the confines of the forest and rachel looking round her with wondering eyes saw at the foot of each great tree a tiny hut shaped like a tent and in front of the hut a dwarf seated on the ground staring into a bowl of water and beating his breast with his hands  what do they she asked of noie  they strive to read their fates lady and weep because the wind ripples the dew in their bowls so that they can see nothing and cannot be sure whether their tree will stand or fall follow me follow me i know the way here we are not safe  the hurricane was at its height the huge trees about them rocked and bent like reeds great boughs came crashing down one of them fell upon a praying dwarf and crushed him to a pulp those around him saw it and uttered a wild shrill scream eddo pani and hana saw it and screamed also in the arms of their bearers for this sight of blood was terrible to them the forest was alive with the voices of the storm it seemed to howl and groan and the lightnings illumined its gloomy aisles the grandeur and the fearfulness of the scene excited rachel she waved the spear she carried and began to laugh in the wild fashion of her madness so that even the grey dwarfs seated each at the foot of his tree ceased from his prayers to glance at her askance  on they went expecting death at every step but always escaping it until they reached a wide clearing in the forest in the centre of this clearing grew a tree more huge than any that rachel had ever dreamed of the bole of it that sprang a hundred feet without a branch was thicker than dingaans great hut and its topmost boughs were lost in the scudding clouds in front of this tree was gathered a multitude of people men women and children all dwarfs and all of them on their knees engaged in prayer at its bole by a tentshaped house stood a little figure a woman whose long grey hair streamed upon the wind  the mother of the trees cried noie through the screaming gale come to her she will shelter us and she gripped rachels arm to lead her forward  scarcely had they gone a step when the lightning blazed above them fearfully and with it came an awful rush of wind perhaps that flash fell upon the tree or perhaps the wind snapped its roots at least its mighty trunk burst in twain and with a crash that for a moment seemed to master even the roar of the volleying thunder down it came to earth two huge limbs fell on either side of rachel and noie but they were not touched a bough struck the umkulu slave who was carrying eddo and swept off his head leaving the dwarf unharmed another bough fell upon pani and his bearer and buried them in the earth beneath its bulk so that they were never seen again as it chanced the most of the worshippers were beyond the reach of the falling branches but some of these that were torn loose in the fall or shattered by the lightning the wind caught and hurled among them slaying several and wounding others  in ten seconds the catastrophe had come and gone the queentree that had ruled the forest for a thousand years was down a stack of green leaves through which the shattered branches showed like bones and a prostrate splintered trunk the shock threw noie and rachel to the ground but rachel rising swiftly pulled noie to her feet after her then acting upon some impulse leapt forward and climbing on to the trunk where it forked ran down it till she almost reached its base and stood there against the great shield of earth that had been torn up with the roots after that last fearful outburst a stillness fell the storm seemed to have exhausted itself at any rate for a while rachel was able to get her breath and look about her  all around were lines of enormous trees solemn aisles that seemed to lead up to the queen of the trees and down these aisles piercing the shadows cast by the interlacing branches overhead shone the lights of that lurid morning rachel saw and something struggled in the darkness of her brain as the light struggled in the darkness of the forest aisles she rememberedoh what was it she remembered now she knew it was the dream she had dreamed upon the island in the river years and years ago a dream of such trees as these and of little grey people like to these and of the boy richard grown to manhood lashed to the trunk of one of the trees what had happened to her she could recall nothing since she saw the body of richard upon its bier in the kraal mafooti  but this was not the kraal mafooti nor had noie who stood at her side been with her there noie who had gone on an embassy to her fathers folk the dwarf people ah these people were dwarfs look at them running to and fro screaming like little monkeys she must have been dreaming a long bad dream whereof the pictures had escaped her doubtless she was still dreaming and presently would awake well the torment had gone out of it and the fear only the wonder remained she would stand still and see what happened something was happening now a little thin hand appeared gripping the rough bark at the side of the fallen tree  she peeped over the swell of it and saw an old dwarf woman with long white hair whose feet were set in a cleft of the shattered bole and who hung to it as an ape hangs beneath her to the ground was a fall of full thirty feet for the base of the bole was held high up by the roots so that the little womans hair hung down straight towards the ground whither she must presently fall and be killed rachel wondered how she had come there if she had clung to the trunk when it fell or been thrown up by the shock or lifted by a bough next she wondered how long it would be before she was obliged to leave go and whether her white head or her back would first strike the earth all that depth beneath then it occurred to her that she might be saved  hold my feet she said to noie who had followed her along the trunk speaking in her own natural voice at the sound of which noie looked at her in joyful wonder hold my feet i think i can reach that old woman and without waiting for an answer she laid herself down upon the bole her body hanging over the curve of it  now noie saw her purpose and seating herself with her heels set against the roughness of the bark grasped her by the ankles supporting some of her weight on one hand with the other rachel reached downwards all the length of her long arm and just as the grasp of the old woman below was slackening contrived to grip her by the wrist the dwarf swung loose hanging in the air but she was very light of the weight of a fiveyearold child perhaps no more and rachel was very strong with an effort she lifted her up till the monkeylike fingers gripped the rough bark again another effort and the little body was resting on the round of the tree one more and she was beside her  now rachel rose to her feet again and laughed but it was not the mad laughter that had scared ishmael and the zulus it was her own laughter that of a healthy cultured woman  the little creature crouching on hands and knees at rachels feet lifted her head and stared with her round eyes at that moment too the sun broke out and its rays shining where they had never shone for ages fell upon rachel upon her bright hair and the white robes in which the dwarfs had clothed her and the gleaming spear in her hand causing her to look like some ancient statue of a goddess upon a temple roof  who art thou said the dwarf woman in the hissing voice of her race thou beautiful one i know i know thou art that inkosazana of the zulus of whom we have had many visions she for whom i sent but the inkosazana was mad she had lost her spirit it has been seen here beautiful one thou art not mad  what does she say noie asked rachel i can only understand some words  noie told her and rachel hid her eyes in her hand presently she let it fall saying  she is right i lost my spirit for a while it went away with another spirit but i think that i have found it again tell her noie that i have travelled far to seek my spirit and that i have found it again  noie who could scarcely take her eyes from rachels face obeyed but the old woman hardly seemed to heed her words a grief had got hold of her she rocked herself to and fro like a monkey that has lost its young and cried out  my tree has fallen the tree of my house which stood from the beginning of the world has fallen but that of eddo still stands and she pointed to another giant of the forest that soared up unharmed at a little distance nyas tree has falleneddos tree still stands his magic has prevailed against me his magic has prevailed against me   as she spoke a man appeared scrambling along the bole towards them it was eddo himself his round eyes shone on his pale face there was a look of triumph for whoever might be lost the danger had passed him by  nya he piped tapping her on the shoulder thy ghost has deserted thee old woman thy tree is down see i spit upon it and he did so thou art no longer mother of the trees thou art only the old woman nya the ghost people the dream people the little grey people have a new queen and i am her minister for i rule her spirit yonder she stands and he pointed at the tall and glittering rachel now thou newborn mother of the trees who wast the inkosazana of the zulus obey me give death to this old woman the red death that her spirit may be spilt with her blood and lost for ever give it to her with that spear in thy hand while i hide my eyes and reign thou in her place through me and he bowed his head and waited  not the red death not the red death wailed nya give me the white death and save my soul beautiful one and in return i will give thee something that thou desirest who am still the wisest of them all although my tree is down  noie whispered for a while in rachels ear then while all the dwarf people gathered beneath them watching rachel bent forward and putting her arms about the trembling creature lifted her up as though she were a child and held her to her bosom  mother she said i give thee no death red or white i give thee love thy tree is down sit thou in my shadow and be safer on him who harms theeand she looked at eddoon him shall the red death fall    chapter xx  the mother of the trees   when eddo understood these words he lifted his head and stared at rachel amazed  this is thy doing bastard he said savagely addressing noie who had translated them i have felt thee fighting against me for long and now thou causest this inkosazana to defy me it was thou who didst work upon that old woman thine aunt to command that the white witch should be brought hither and because as yet i dared not disobey i made a terrible journey to bring her yes and i did this gladly for when my eyes fell upon her there in the town of dingaan i saw that she was great and beautiful but that her spirit had gone and i knew that i could make her mouth to speak my words and her pure eyes to see things that are denied to mine even the future as when i bade her she saw it yonder in the court of dingaan but now it seems that her spirit has returned to her so that there is no room for mine in her heart and she speaks her own words not my words and thou hast done this thing o bastard  perhaps answered noie unconcernedly  thou thinkest went on eddo in his fury beating the bole on which he sat thou thinkest to protect that old hag nya because her blood runs in thee but fool it is in vain for her tree is down her tree is down and as its leaves wither and its sap dries up so must she wither and her blood dry up until she dies she who thought to live on for many years  what does that matter asked noie seeing that then she will only join the great company of the ghosts with whom she longs to be and return with them to torment thee eddo until thou too art one of them and lookest on the face of judgment  thou thinkest screamed the dwarf ignoring this ominous suggestion thou thinkest when she is gone to be queen in her place or to rule as high priestess through this white one  if i do that will be a bad hour for thee eddo replied noie  it shall not be woman no bastard shall reign here as mother of the trees while the nations round cringe before her feet i have spells i have poisons i have slaves who can shoot with arrows  then use them if thou canst thou evildoer said noie contemptuously  aye i will use them all and not on thee only but on that white witch whom thou lovest she shall never pass living from this land that is ringed in by the desert and the forest she shall choose me to reign through her as her high priest or she shall diedie miserably for a little while that old hag nya may protect her with her wisdom but when she passes as she must and quickly for i will light fires beneath this fallen tree of hers then i tell thee the beautiful one shall choose between my rule and doom  now noie would hear no more  dog she cried filthy nightbird darest thou speak thus of the inkosazana another word and i will offer that heart of thine to the sun thou hatest and snatching the spear from rachels hand she charged at him holding it aloft  eddo saw her come with a scream of fear he leapt to his feet and ran swiftly along the bole till he reached the mass of the fallen branches into these he sprang swinging himself from bough to bough like an ape until he vanished amongst the dark green foliage then having quite lost sight of him noie returned laughing to rachel by whom stood the old mother of the trees who had slid from her arms and gave her back the spear saying in the dwarf language  this eddo speaks great words but he is also a great coward  yes yes answered the old woman he is a great coward because like all our folk he fears the red death but child i tell thee he is terrible he hates me because i rule through the white art not the black but while my tree stood he must obey me and i was safe now it is down and he may kill me if he can according to the custom of my land and set up another to be queen she at whose feet my tree bowed itself and fell by the will of the heavens and whom therefore the people will accept through her he will wield all the power of the ghostkings over whom no man may rule but a woman only come child and thou white one come also i know where we may hide lady the power that was mine is thine protect me till i die and in payment i will give thee whatever thy heart desires  i ask no payment rachel answered wearily when she understood the words and i think that it is i who need protection from that wicked dwarf  then guided by nya who clung to rachels hand they walked down the bole of the tree and along a great branch till at length they reached a place whence they could climb to the ground before they were clear of the boughs the dethroned mother from whose round eyes the tears fell turned and kissed the bark of one of them wailing aloud  farewell thou mighty one under whose shade i and the queens of my race before me have dreamed for centuries thou art fallen beneath the stroke of heaven and great was thy fall and i am fallen with thee save me from the red death o spirit of my tree that in the land of ghosts i still may sleep beneath thy shade for ever  then she ran to the very point of the tree and broke off its topmost twig which was covered with narrow and shining green leaves and holding it in her hand returned to rachel  i will plant it she said and perchance it will grow to be the house of queens unborn come now come and she turned her face towards the forest  the thunder had rolled away and from time to time the sun shone fiercely so fiercely that unable to bear its rays all the dwarfs who were gathered about the fallen tree had retreated into the shadow of the other trees around the open space there they stood and sat watching the three of them go by men women and children they all watched and rachel they saluted with their raised hands but to her who had been their mother for unknown years they did no reverence only one hideous little man ran up to her and called out  thou didst punish me once old woman now why should i not kill thee in payment thy tree is down at last  nya looked at him sadly and answered  i remember thou shouldst have died for thy sin was great but i laid a lesser burden on thee man thou canst not kill me yet my tree is down but it is not dead  she held up the green bough in her hand and looked at him from beneath it then went on slowly man my wisdom remains within me and i tell thee that before i die thou shalt die and not as thou desirest remember my words people of the ghosts  then she walked on with the others leaving the dwarf staring after her with a face wherein hate struggled with fear  thou liest he screamed after her thy power is gone with thy tree  scarcely were the words out of his mouth when they heard a crash which caused them to look round a bough broken by the storm had fallen from on high it had fallen on to the head of the dwarf and there he lay crushed and dead  ah piped the other dwarfs pointing towards the corpse with their fingers and closing their eyes to shut out the sight of blood ah nya is right she still has power those who would kill her must wait till her tree dies  taking no heed of what had happened nya walked on into the forest for a while rachel noted the little huts built each of them at the foot of a tree there were hundreds of these huts that they could see showing that the people were many but by degrees they grew fewer only one was visible here and there set beneath some particularly vigorous and handsome timber at last they ceased altogether they had passed through that city the strangest city in the world  treeseverywhere trees hundreds of trees tens of thousands of trees soaring up to heaven making a canopy of their interlacing boughs shutting out the light so that beneath them was a deep oppressive gloom there was silence also for if any beasts or birds dwelt there the hurricane had scared them away silence only broken from time to time by the crash of some giant of the forest that its length of days fulfilled at last sank suddenly to ruin to be buried in a tomb of brushwood whence in due course its successor would arise  another life gone said the old woman nya flitting before them like a little grey ghost every time that this weird sound struck upon their ears whose was it i wonder i will look in my bowl i will look in my bowl  for as rachel discovered afterwards these people believed that the spirit of each tree of the forest is attached to the spirit of a human being although that being may dwell in other lands far away which dies when the tree dies sometimes slowly by disease and sometimes in swift collapse so that they pass together into the world of ghosts  on they flitted through the gloom on for mile after mile although the leafstrewn ground showed no traces of it evidently they were following some kind of path for no fallen trunks barred their progress nor were there any creepers or brushwood although to right and left of them all these could be seen in plenty at last quite of a sudden for the bole of a tree at the end of the path had hidden it from them they came upon a clearing in the forest it seemed to be a natural or at any rate a very ancient clearing since in it no stumps were visible nor any scrub or creepers only tall grass and flowering plants in the centre of this place covering a quarter of it perhaps was a vast circular wall fifty feet or more in height and clothed with ferns this wall they noted was built of huge blocks of stone so huge indeed that it seemed wonderful that they could have been moved by human beings at the sight of that marvellous wall rachel and noie halted involuntarily and noie asked  who made it mother  the giants who lived when the world was young can our hands lift such stones nya answered as bending down she thrust the top shoot from her fallen tree deep into the humid soil then added on child there is danger here  as she spoke something hissed through the air just above her head and stuck fast in the bark of a sapling noie sprang forward and plucked it out it was a little reed feathered with grasses and having a sharp ivory point smeared with some green substance  touch it not cried nya it is deadly poison eddos work eddos work but my hour is not yet into the open before another comes   so they ran forward all three of them seeing and bearing nothing of the shooter of the arrow as they approached the titanic wall they saw that it enclosed a mound on the top of which mound grew a cedarlike tree with branches so wide that they seemed to overshadow half of the enclosure there were no gates to this wall but while they wondered how it could be entered nya led them to a kind of cleft in its stones not more than two feet in width across which cleft were stretched strings of plaited grass she pressed herself against them breaking them and walked forward followed by rachel and noie suddenly they heard a noise above them and looking up saw whiterobed dwarfs perched upon the stones of the cleft holding bent bows in their hands whereof the arrows were pointed at their breasts nya halted beckoning to them whereon recognising her they dropped the arrows into the little quivers which they wore and scrambled off whither rachel could not see  these are the guardians of the temple that cannot either speak or hear who were summoned by the breaking of the thread said nya and went forward again  now to the right and now to the left ran the narrow path that wound its way in the thickness of the mighty wall which towered so high above them that they walked almost in darkness and at each turn of it were recesses and above these projecting stones where archers could stand for its defence at length this path ended in a culdesac for in front of them was nothing but blank masonry whilst rachel and noie stared at it wondering whither they should go now a large stone in this wall turned leaving a narrow doorway through which they passed whereon it shut again behind them though by what machinery they could not see  thus they passed through the wall emerging however at a different point in its circumference to that at which they had entered in the centre of the enclosure rose the hill of earth that they had seen from without which evidently was kept free from weeds and swept and on its crest grew the huge cedarlike tree the tree of the tribe between the base of this hill and the foot of the wall was a wide ring of level ground also swept and weeded and on this space neatly arranged in lines were hundreds of little hillocks that resembled antheaps  the buryingplace of the ghostpriests lady said nya nodding at the hillocks soon my bones will be added to them  walking across this strange cemetery they came to the foot of the mound that was entirely overshadowed by the cedar above from the outspread limbs of which hung long grey moss that swayed ceaselessly in the wind here dwarfs appeared from right and left the same whom they had seen within the thickness of the wall or others like to them some male and some female melancholyeyed little creatures who bowed to nya and looked with fear and wonder at the tall while rachel evidently they were all of them deaf mutes for they made signs to nya who answered them with other signs the purport of which seemed to sadden and disturb them greatly  they have seen the fall of my tree in their bowls explained nya to noie and ask me if it is a true vision i tell them that i am come here to die and that is why they are sad this is the place of dying of all the ghostpriests whence they pass into the world of spirits and here no blood may be shed no not that of the most wicked evildoer if any one of the family of the priests reaches this place living the glory of the white death is won follow and see  so they followed her up the mound past what looked like the entrance to a cave until they reached a low fence of reeds whereof the gate stood open  the gate is open but enter not there whispered the old mother of the trees for those who enter there live not long look lady look  rachel peered through the gate but so dense was the gloom in that holy spot that at first she could only see the enormous red bole of the cedar and the ghostly mossclad branches which sprang from it at no great height above the ground presently however her eyes grown accustomed to the light distinguished several little whiterobed figures seated upon the earth at some distance from the trunk staring into vessels of wood which were placed before them these figures appeared to be those of both men and women while one was that of a child even as they watched the figure nearest to them fell forward over its bowl and lay quite still whereon those around it set up a feeble piping cry that yet had in it a note of gladness the dwarfmutes who had accompanied them and who alone seemed to have a right of entry into this sad place ran forward and looked then very gently they lifted up the fallen figure and bore it out as it was carried past them rachel noted that it was the body of quite a young woman whose little face wasted to nothing still looked sweet and gentle  was she ill asked rachel in an awed voice  perhaps answered the mother shaking her grey head or perhaps she was very unhappy and came here to die what does it matter she is happy now  ask her noie if all must die who sit beneath that tree said rachel  aye answered nya all save these dumb people who have been priests of the tree from generation to generation to touch its stem is to perish soon or late for it is the tree of life and death and in it dwells the spirit of the whole race  what then would happen if it fell down or was destroyed like your tree mother  then the race would perish also answered nya since their spirit would lack a home and depart to the world of ghosts whither they must follow when it dies of old age if it should ever die then the race will die with it  and if someone should cut it down mother what then  now when noie translated these words to her the face of the old queen was filled with horror and as her face was so was noies face  white maiden she gasped speak not such wickedness lest the very thought of it should bring the curse upon us all he who destroyed that tree would bring ruin upon this people they would fly away every one of them far into the heart of the forest and be seen no more by man moreover he who did this evil thing would perish and pass down to vengeance among the ghosts such vengeance as may not be spoken put that thought from thy mind i pray thee and let it never pass thy lips again  do you believe all this noie asked rachel in english with a smile  yes zoola answered noie shuddering for it is true my father told me of it and of what happened once to some wild men who broke into the sanctuary and shot arrows at the tree no no i will not tell the story it is dreadful  yet it must be foolishness noie for how can a tree have power over the lives of men  i do not know but it has it has if i were but to cast a stone at it i should be dead in a day and so would youyes even younothing could save you oh she went on earnestly swear to me sister that you will never so much as touch that tree i pray you swear  so rachel swore to please her for she was tired of this tree and its powers  then they went down the hill again till they came to the mouth of the cave  enter lady nya said for this must be thy home a while until thou goest to rule as mother of the trees after me or if it pleases thee better up yonder to die  they went into the cave having no choice it was a great place lit dimly by the outer light and farther down its length with lamps looking round her rachel saw that its roof was supported by white columns which she knew to be stalactites for as a child she had seen their like at the end of it where the lamps burned and a fountain bubbled from the ground rose a very large column shaped like the trunk of a tree with branches at the top that looked like the boughs of a tree gazing at it rachel understood why these dwarfs or some ancient people before them had chosen this cave as their temple  the ghost tree of my race said old nya pointing to it the only tree that never falls the tree that lives and grows for ever yes it grows for it is larger now than when my mother was a child  as they drew near to this wondrous and ghostly looking object rachel saw piled around and beyond it many precious things there was gold in dust and heaps and rings and nuggets there were shining stones red and green and white that she knew were jewels there were tusks of ivory and carvings in ivory there were karosses and furs mouldering to decay there were grotesque gods fetishes of wood and stone  offerings said nya which all the nations that live in darkness bring to the mother of the trees and the priests of the cave costly things which they value but we value them not who prize power and wisdom only yes yes costly things which they give to the mother of the trees the fools without a spirit when they come here to ask her oracle look there are some of the gifts which were sent by dingaan of the zulus in payment for the oracle of his death thou broughtest them noie my child  yes answered noie i brought them and the inkosazana here she delivered the oracle eddo gave her the bowl and she saw pictures in the bowl and showed them to dingaan  nay nay said the old woman testily it was i who saw the pictures and i showed them to eddo and to this white virgin you cannot understand but it was so it was so eddos gift of vision is small mine is great none have ever had it as i have it and that is why eddo and the others have suffered my tree to live so long because the light of my wisdom has shone about their heads and spoken through their tongues and when i am gone they will seek and find it not in thee they might have found it maiden had thy heart remained empty but now it is full again and what room is there for wisdom such as oursthe wisdom of the ghosts not the wisdom of life and love and beating hearts  noie translated the words but rachel seemed to take no heed of them   dingaan she asked is dingaan dead he was well enough whenwhen richard came to zululand and since then i have seen nothing of him how did he die  he did not die zoola answered noie though i think that ere long he will die for you told him so it was you who died for a while not dingaan byandbye you shall learn all that story now you are very weary and must rest  yes said rachel with a sob i think i died when richard died but now i seem to have come to life againthat is the worst of it oh noie noie why did you not let me remain dead instead of bringing me to life again in this dreadful place  because it was otherwise fated sister replied noie no do not begin to laugh and cry it was otherwise fated and bending down she whispered something into nyas ear  the old dwarf nodded then taking rachel by the hand led her to where some skins were spread upon the floor  lie down she said and rest rest beautiful white one and wake up to eat and be strong again and she gazed into rachels eyes as eddo had done when the fits of wild laughter were on her singing something as she gazed  while she sang the madness that was gathering there again went out of rachels eyes the lids closed over them and presently they were fast shut in sleep nor did she open them again for many hours  rachel awoke and sat up looking round her wonderingly then by the dim light of the lamps she saw noie seated at her side and the old dwarfwoman who was called mother of the trees squatted at a little distance watching them bothand remembered  thou hast had happy dreams lady and thou art well again is it not so queried nya  aye mother she answered too happy for they make my waking the more sad and i am well i who desire to die  then go up through the open gate which thou sawest not so long ago and satisfy thy desire as it is easy to do replied nya grimly nay she added in a changed voice go not up thou art too young and fair the blood runs too red in those blue veins of thine what hast thou to do with ghosts and death and the darkness of the trees thou child of the air and sunshine death for the dwarffolk death for the dealers in dreams death for the deathlovers but for thee lifelife   tell her noie said rachel that my mother who was foresighted always said that i should live out my days and i fear that it is true who must live them out alone  yes yes she was right that mother of thine answered nya and for the rest who knows but thou art hungry eat afterwards we will talk and she pointed to a stool upon which was food  rachel tasted and found it very good a kind of porridge made of she knew not what and with it forest fruits but no flesh so she ate heartily and noie ate with her nya ate also but only a very little  why should i trouble to eat she said i to whom death draws near  when they had finished eating at some signal which rachel did not perceive mutes came in who bore away the fragments of the meal after they had gone the three women washed themselves in the water of the fountain then noie combed out rachels golden hair and clothed her again in her robe of silken fur that she had cleansed throwing over it a mantle of snowy white fibre such as the dwarfs wove into cloth which she and nya had made ready while rachel slept  as noie put it about her mistress and stepped back to see how it became her beauty two of the dwarfmutes appeared creeping up the cave and squatting down before nya began to make signs to her  what is it asked rachel nervously  eddo is without answered the mother and would speak with us  i fear eddo and will not go exclaimed rachel  nay have no fear maiden for here he can not harm thee or any of us it is the place of sanctuary come let us see this priest perhaps we may learn something from him    chapter xxi  the city of the dead   nya led the way down the cave followed by rachel and noie squatted in its entrance so as to be out of reach of the rays of the sun sat eddo looking like a malevolent toad and with him were hana and some other priests as rachel approached they all rose and saluted but to nya and noie they gave no salute only to nya eddo said   why art thou not within the fence old woman and he pointed with his chin towards the place of death above thy tree is down and all last night we were hacking off its branches that it may dry up the sooner it is time for thee to die  i die when my tree dies not before priest answered nya i have still some work to do before i die also i have planted my tree again in good soil and it may grow  i saw said eddo it is without the wall there but many a generation must go by before a new mother sits beneath its shade well die when it pleases you it does not matter when since thou art no more our mother moreover learn that all have deserted thee save a very few most of whom have just now passed within the fence above that they may attend thee amongst the ghosts  i thank them said nya simply and in that world we will rule together  the rest went on eddo have turned against thee having heard how thou didst bring one of us to the red death yesterday by thy evil magic him upon whom the bough fell  who was it that strove to bring me to the red death before i reached the sanctuary who shot the poisoned arrow priest  i do not know answered eddo but it seems that he shot badly for thou art still here now enough of thee old woman for many years we bore thy rule which was always foolish and sometimes bad because we could not help it for the tree of her who went before thee fell at thy feet as thy tree has fallen at the feet of the white virgin there for long thou and i have struggled for the mastery and now thou art dead and i have won so be silent old woman and since that arrow missed thee go hence in peace for none need thee any more who hast neither youth nor comeliness nor power  aye answered nya stung to fury by these insults i shall go hence in peace but thou shalt not abide in peace thou traitor nor those who follow thee when youth and comeliness fade then wisdom grows and wisdom is power eddo true power i tell thee that last night i looked in my bowl and saw things concerning theeaye and all of our people that are hid from thy eyes terrible things things that have not befallen since the tree of the tribe was a seed and the spirit of the tribe came to dwell within it  speak them then said eddo striving to hide the fear which showed through his round eyes  nay priest i speak them not live on and thou shalt discover them thou and thy traitors well have i served you all for many years mercy have i given to all white magic have i practised and not black none have died that i could save none have suffered whom i could protect no not even the slavepeoples beneath our rule all this have i done knowing that ye plotted against me knowing that ye strove to kill my tree by spells knowing what the end must be it has come at last as come it must and i do not grieve fool i knew that it would come and i knew the manner of its coming it was i who sent for this virgin queen whom ye would set up to rule over you foreseeing that at her feet my tree would fall the ghost of seyapi who is of my blood seyapi whom years ago ye drove away for no offence to dwell in a strange land told me of her and of this noie his daughter and of the end of it all so she came thou didst not bring her as thou thoughtest i brought her and my tree fell at her feet as it was doomed to fall and she saved me from the red death as she was doomed to do giving me love not hate as i gave her love not hate for the rest ye shall seeall of you i am finishedi am deadbut i live on elsewhere and ye shall see  now eddo would have answered but the priest hana who appeared to be much frightened by nyas words plucked at his sleeve whispering in his ear and he was silent presently he spoke again but to rachel bidding noie translate  thou white maid he said who wast called princess of the zulus pay no heed to this old dotard but listen to me when thy spirit wandered yonder even then i saw the seeds of greatness in thee and begged thee from the savage dingaan also i and pani who is dead and hana who lives read by our magic that at thy feet the tree of nya would fall and that after her thou wast appointed to rule over us all the ghostpeople read it also and now they have named thee their mother and chosen thee a tree a great tree but young and strong that shall stand for ages come forth then and take thy seat beneath that tree and be our queen  why should i come asked rachel it seems that you dwarfs bring your queens to ill ends choose you another mother  inkosazana we cannot if we would answered eddo for these matters are not in our hands but in those of our spirit hearken we will deal well with thee we will make thee great and grow in thy greatness for thou shall give us of thy wisdom that although thou knowest it not thou hast above all other women we weary of little things we would rule the world all the nations from sea to sea shall bow down before thee and seek thine oracle thou shall take their wealth thou shalt drive them hither and thither as the wind drives clouds thou shalt make war thou shalt ordain peace at thy pleasure they shall rise up in life and lie down in death their kings shall cower before thee their princes shall bring thee tribute thou shalt reign a god  until it shall please eddo to bring thee to thine end lady as it pleases him to bring me to mine muttered nya behind her be not beguiled maiden remain a woman and uncrowned for so thou shalt find most joy  thou meanest eddo said rachel that thou wilt rule and i do thy bidding noie tell him that i will have none of it when i came here a great sorrow had made me mad and i knew nothing now i have found my spirit again and presently i go hence  at this answer eddo grew very angry  one thing i promise thee zoola he said in the name of all the ghostpeople i promise it that thou shalt not go hence alive in this sanctuary thou art safe indeed seated in the shadow of the deathtree that is the tree of life but soon or late a way will be found to draw thee hence and then thou shalt learn who is the strongerthou or eddoas the old woman behind thee has learned fare thee well for a while i will tell the people that thou art weary and restest and meanwhile i rule in thy name fare thee well inkosazana till we meet without the wall and he rose and went accompanied by hana and the other priests  when he had gone a little way he turned and pointing up the hill screamed back to nya  go and look within the fence old hag there thou wilt see the best of those that clung to thee seeking for peace art thou a coward that thou lingerest behind them  nay eddo she answered thou art the coward that hast driven them to death because they are good and thou art evil when my hour is ripe i join them not before nor shalt thou abide here long behind me one short day of triumph for thee eddo and then night black night for ever  eddo heard and his yellow face grew white with rage or fear he stamped upon the ground he shook his small fat fists and spat out curses as a toad spits venom nya did not stay to listen to them but walked up the cave and sat herself down upon her mat  why does he hate thee so mother asked rachel  because those that are bad hate those that are good maiden for many a year eddo has sought to rule through me and to work evil in the world but i have not suffered it he would abandon our secret ancient faith and reign a king as dingaan the zulu reigns he would send the slavetribes out to war and conquer the nations and build him a great house and have many wives but i held him fast so that he could do few of these things therefore he plotted against me but my magic was greater than his and while my tree stood he could not prevail at length it fell at thy feet as he knew that it was doomed to fall for all these things are foreordained and at once he would have slain me by the red death but thou didst protect me and for that blessed be thou for ever  and why does he wish to make me mother in thy place nya  because my tree fell at thy feet and all the people demand it because he thinks that once the bond of the priesthood is tied between you and his blood runs in thee thy pure spirit will protect his spirit from its sins and that thy wisdom which he sees in thee will make him greater than any of the ghostpeople that ever lived yet consent not for afterwards if thou dost thwart him he will find a way to bring down thy tree and with it thy life and set another to rule in thy place consent not for know that here thou art safe from him  it may be so mother but how can i dwell on in this dismal place already my heart is broken with its sorrows and soon like those poor folk i should seek peace within the fence  tell me of those sorrows said nya gently perhaps i do not know them all and perhaps i could help thee  so rachel sat herself down also and noie interpreting for her told all her tale up to that point when she saw the body of richard borne away for after this she remembered nothing until she found herself standing upon the fallen tree in the land of the ghost kings it was a long tale and before ever she finished it night fell but throughout its telling the old dwarfwoman said never a word only watched rachels face with her kind soft eyes at last it was done and she said  a sad story truly there is much evil in the world beyond the country of the trees for here at least we shed little blood now maiden what is thy desire  this is my desire said rachel to be joined again to him i love whom ishmael slew yes and to my father and mother also whom the zulus slew at the command of ishmael  if they are all dead how can that be maiden unless thou seekest them in death pass within the fence yonder and let the poison of the tree of the tribe fall upon thee and soon thou wilt find them   nay mother i may not for it would be selfmurder and my faith knows few greater crimes  then thou must wait till death finds thee and that road may be very long  already it is long mother so long that i know not how to travel it who am alone in the world without a friend save noie here and she began to weep  not so thou hast another friend and she laid her hand upon rachels heart though it is true that i may bide with thee but a little while  after this they were all silent for a space until nya looked up at rachel and asked suddenly  art thou brave  the zulus and others thought so mother but what can courage avail me now  courage of the body nothing maiden courage of the spirit much perhaps if thou sawest this lover of thine and knew for certain that he lives on beneath the world awaiting thee would it bring thee comfort  rachels breast heaved and her eyes sparkled with joy as she answered  comfort what is there that could bring so much but how can it be mother seeing that the last gulf divides us a gulf which mortals may not pass and live  thou sayest it still i have great power and thy spirit is white and clean perhaps i could despatch it across that gulf and call it back to earth again yet there are dangers dangers to me of which i reck little and dangers to thee whither i sent thee there thou mightest bide  i care not if i bide there mother if only it be with him oh send me on this journey to his side and living or dead i will bless thee  now nya thought a while and answered  for thy sake i will try what i would try for none other who has breathed or breathes for thou didst save me from the red death at the hands of eddo yes i will try but not yetfirst thou must eat and rest obey or i do nothing  so rachel ate and afterwards feeling drowsy even slept a while perhaps because she was still weary with her journeying and her newfound mind needed repose or perhaps because some drug had been mingled with her drink when she awoke nya led her to the mouth of the cave there they stood awhile studying the stars no breath of air stirred and the silence was intense only from time to time the sound of trees falling in the forest reached their ears sometimes it was quite soft as though a fleece of wool had been dropped to the earth that was when the tree that died had grown miles and miles away from them and sometimes the crash was as that of sudden thunder that was when the tree which died had grown near to them  a sense of the mystery and wonder of the place and hour sank into rachels heart the stars above the mighty entombing forest in which the trees fell unceasingly after their long centuries of life the encircling wall built perhaps by hands that had ceased from their labours hundreds of thousands of years before those trees began to grow the huge mossclad cedar upon the mound beneath the shadow of whose branches day by day its worshippers gave up their breath that immemorial cedar whereof as they believed the life was the life of the nation the wizened little witchwoman at her side with the seal of doom already set upon her brow and the stare of farewell in her eyes the sad spiritual face of noie who held her hand the loving faithful noie who in that light seemed half a thing of air the grey little dwarfmutes who squatted on their mats staring at the ground or now and again passed down the hill from the fence of death above bearing between them a body to its burial all were mysterious all were wonderful  as she looked and listened a new strength stirred in rachels heart at first she had felt afraid but now courage flowed into her and it seemed to come from the old old woman at her side the mistress of mysteries the mother of magic in whom was gathered the wisdom of a hundred generations of this half human race  look at the stars and the night she was saying in her soft voice for soon thou shalt be beyond them all and perchance thou shall never see them more art thou fearful if so speak and we will not try this journey in search of one whom we may not find  no answered rachel but mother whither go we  we go to the land of death come then the moment is at hand it is hard on midnight see yonder star stands above the holy tree and she pointed to a bright orb that hung almost over the topmost bough of the cedar it marks thy road and if thou wouldst pass it now is the hour  mother asked noie may i come with her i also have my dead and where my sister goes i follow  aye if thou wilt daughter of seyapi the path is wide enough for three and if i stay on high perchance thou that art of my blood mayest find strength to guide her earthwards through the wandering worlds  then nya walked up the cave and sat herself down within the circle of the lamps with her back to the stalactite that was shaped like a tree bidding rachel and noie be seated in front of her two of the dwarfmutes appeared women both of them and squatted to right and left each gazing into a bowl of limpid dew nya made a sign and still gazing into their bowls these dwarfs began to beat upon little drums that gave out a curious rolling noise while nya sang to the sound of the drums a wild low song with her thin little hands she grasped the right hand of rachel and of noie and gazed into their eyes  things changed to rachel the dwarfs to right and left vanished away but the low murmuring of their drums grew to a mighty music and the stars danced to it the song of nya swelled and swelled till it filled all the space between earth and heaven it was the rush of the gale among the forests it was the beating of the sea upon an illimitable coast it was the shout of all the armies of the world it was the weeping of all the women of the world it lessened again she seemed to be passing away from it she heard it far beneath her it grew tiny in its volumetiny as if it were an infinite speck or point of sound which she could still discern for millions and millions of miles till at length distance and vastness overcame it and it ceased it ceased this song of the earth but a new song began the song of the rushing worlds far away she could hear it that ineffable music far in the utter depths of space nearer it would come and nearer a ringing glorious sound a sound and yet a voice one mighty voice that sang and was answered by other voices as sun crossed the path of sun and caught up and reechoed by the innumerable choir of the constellations  they were falling past her those vast glowing suns those rounded planets that were now vivid with light and now steeped in gloom those infinite showers of distant stars they were gone they and their music together she was far beyond them in a region where all life was forgotten beyond the rush of the uttermost comet beyond the last glimmer of the spies and outposts of the universe one shape of light she sped into the black bosom of fathomless space and its solitude shrivelled up her soul she could not endure she longed for some shore on which to set her mortal feet  behold far away a shore appeared a towering cliffbound shore upon whose iron coasts all the black waves of space beat vainly and were eternally rolled back here there was light but no such light as she had ever known it did not fall from sun or star but changeful and radiant welled upward from that land in a thousand hues as light might well from a world of opal in its dazzling beautiful rays she saw fantastic palaces and pyramids she saw seas and pure white mountains she saw plains and newhued flowers she saw gulfs and precipices and pale lakes pregnant with wavering flame all that she had ever conceived of as lovely or as fearful she beheld far lovelier or a thousandfold more fearful  like a great rose of glory that world bloomed and changed beneath her petal by petal its splendours fell away and were swallowed in the sea of space whilst from the deep heart of the immortal rose new splendours took their birth and freshfashioned mysterious wonderful reappeared the measureless city with its columns its towers and its glittering gates it endured a moment or a million years she knew not which and lo where it had been stood another city different utterly different only a hundred times more glorious out of the prodigal heart of the worldrose were they created into the black bosom of nothingness were they gathered whilst others ever more perfect pressed into their place so too changed the mountains and so the trees while the gulfs became a garden and the fiery lakes a pleasant stream and from the seed of the strange flowers grew immemorial forests wreathed about with rosy mists and bedecked in glimmering dew with music they were born on the wings of music they fled away and after them that sweet music wailed like memories  a hand took hers and drew her downwards and up to meet her leapt myriads of points of light in every point a tiny face they gazed at her with their golden eyes they whispered together concerning her and the sound of their whispering was the sound of a sea at peace they accompanied her to the very heart of the opal rose of life whence all these wonders welled they set her in a great grey hall roofed in with leaning cliffs and there they left her desolate  fear came upon her the loneliness choked her it held her by the throat like a thing alive she seemed about to die of it when she became aware that once more she was companioned shapes stood about her she could not see the shapes save dimly now and again as they moved but their eyes she could see their great calm pitiful eyes which looked down on her as the eye of a giant might look down upon a babe they were terrible but she did not fear them so much as the loneliness for at least they lived  one of the shapes bent over her for its holy eyes drew near to her and she heard a voice in her heart asking her for what great cause she had dared to journey hither before the time she answered in her heart not with her lips that she was bereaved of all she loved and came to seek them then still in her heart she heard that voice command   let all this rachels dead be brought before her  instantly doors swung open at the end of that grey hall and through them with noiseless steps with shadowy wings floated a being that bore in its arms a child before her it stayed and the light of its starry head illumined the face of the child she knew it at onceit was that baby brother whose bones lay by the shore of the african sea it awoke from its sleep it opened its eyes it stretched out its arms and smiled at her then it was gone  other shapes appeared each of them bearing its burdena companion who had died at school friends of her youth and childhood whom she had thought yet living a young man who once had wished to marry her and who was drowned the soldier whom she had killed to save the life of noie at the sight of him she shrank for his blood was on her hands but he only smiled like the rest and was borne away to be followed by that witchdoctoress whom the zulus had slain because of her who neither smiled nor frowned but passed like one who wonders  then another shadow swept down the hall and in its arms her motherher mother with joyful eyes who held thin hands above her as though in blessing and to whom she strove to speak but strove in vain she was borne on still blessing her and where she had been was her father who blessed her also and whose presence seemed to shed peace upon her soul he pointed upwards and was gone gazing at her earnestly and lo a form of darkness cast something at her feet it was ishmael who knelt before her ishmael whose tormented face gazed up at her as though imploring pardon  a struggle rent her heart could she forgive oh could she forgive him who had slain them all now she was aware that the place was filled with the points of light that were spirits and that every one of them looked at her awaiting the free verdict of her heart rank upon rank also the mighty shapes gathered about her and in their arms her dead and all of them looked and looked awaiting the free verdict of her heart then it arose within her drawn how she knew not from every fibre of her infinite being it arose within her that spirit of pity and of pardon as the dead had stretched out their arms above her so she stretched out her arms over the head of that tortured soul and for the first time her lips were given power to speak  as i hope for pardon so i pardon she said go in peace  voices and trumpets caught up the words and through the grey hall they rang and echoed proclaimed for ever and as they died away he too was gone and with him went the myriad points of flame in each of which gleamed a tiny face she looked about her seeking another spirit that spirit she had travelled so far and dared so much to find but there came only a little dwarf that shambled alone down the great hall she knew him at once for pani the priest he who had been crushed in the tempest pani the brother of eddo no shape bore him for he who on earth had been half a ghost could walk this ghostworld on his mortal feet or so her mind conceived past her he shuffled shamefaced and was gone  now the great doors at the end of the hall closed from far away she could see them roll together like lightningsevered clouds and once more that awful loneliness overcame her her knees gave way beneath her she sank down upon the floor one little spot of white in its expanse wishing that the roof of rock would fall and hide her she covered her face with her golden hair and wept behind its veil she looked up and saw two great eyes gazing at herno face only two great steady eyes then a voice speaking in her heart asked her why she wept whose desire had been fulfilled and she answered that it was because she could not find him whom she sought richard darrien instantly the tongues and trumpets took up the name  richard darrien they cried richard darrien  but no shape swept in bearing the spirit of richard in its arms  he is not here said the voice in her heart go seek him in some other world  she grew angry  thou mockest me she answered he is dead and this is the home of the dead therefore he must be here shadow thou mockest me  i mock not came the swift answer mortal look now and learn  again the doors burst open and through them poured the infinite rout of the dead that hall would not hold them all therefore it grew and grew till her sight could scarcely reach from wall to wall shapes headed and marshalled them by races and by generations perhaps because thus only could her human heart imagine them but now none were borne in their arms they came in myriads and in millions in billions and tens of billions men and women and children kings and priests and beggars all wearing the garments of their age and country they came like an oceantide and their floating hair was the foam on the tide and their eyes gleamed like the first shimmer of dawn above the snows they came for hours and days and years and centuries they came eternally and as they came every finger of that host compared to which all the sands of all the seas were but as a handful was pointed at her and every mouth shaped the words  is it i whom thou seekest  million by million she scanned them all but the face of richard darrien was not there  now the dead zulus were marching by down the stream of time they marched in their marshalled regiments chaka stood over hershe knew him by his likeness to dingaanand threatened her with a little redhandled spear asking her how she dared to sit upon the throne of the spirit of his nation she began to tell him her story but as she spoke the wide receding walls of that grey hall fell apart and crumbled and amidst a mighty laughter the greateyed shapes rebuilt them to the fashion of the cave in the mound beneath the tree of the dwarffolk the sound of the trumpets died away the shrill sweet music of the spheres grew far and faint  rachel opened her eyes there in front of her sat nya crooning her low song and there on either side crouched the mutes tapping upon their little drums and gazing into their bowls of water while against her leaned noie who stirred like one awaking from sleep ages and ages ago when she started on that dread journey the dwarf to her left was stretching out her hand to steady the bowl at her feet and now it had but just reached the bowl a great moth had singed its wings in the lamp and was fluttering to the groundit was still in midair noie was placing her arm about her neck and it had but begun to fall upon her shoulder    chapter xxii  in the sanctuary   nya ceased her singing and the dwarf women their beating on the drums  hast thou been a journey maiden she asked looking at rachel curiously  aye mother she answered in a faint voice and a journey far and strange  and thou noie my niece  aye mother she answered shivering as though with cold or fear but i went not with my sister here i went alonefor years and years  a far journey thou sayest inkosazana and one that was for years and years thou sayest noie yet the eyes of both of you have been shut for so long only as it takes a burnt moth to fall from the lamp flame to the ground i think that you slept and dreamed a moment that is all  mayhap mother replied rachel but if so mine was a most wondrous dream such as has never visited me before and as i pray never may again for i was borne beyond the stars into the glorious cities of the dead and i saw all the dead and those that i had known in life were brought to me by shapes and powers whereof i could only see the eyes  and didst thou find him whom thou soughtest most of all  nay she answered him alone i did not find i sought him i prayed the guardians of the dead to show him to me and they called up all the dead and i scanned them every one and they summoned him by his name but he was not of their number and he came not only they spoke in my heart bidding me to look for him in some other world  ah exclaimed nya starting a little they said that to thee did they well worlds are many and such a search would be long then as though to turn the subject she added and what sawest thou noie  i mother i went not beyond the stars i climbed down endless ladders into the centre of the earth my feet are still sore with them i reached vast caves full of a blackness that shone and there many dead folk were walking going nowhere and coming back from nowhere they seemed strengthless but not unhappy and they looked at me and asked me tidings of the upper world but i could not answer them for whenever i opened my lips to speak a cold hand was laid upon my mouth i wandered among them for many moons only there was no moon nothing but the blackness that shone like polished coal wandered from cave to cave at length i came to a cave in which sat my father seyapi and near to him my mother and my other mothers his wives and my brothers and sisters all of whom the zulus killed as the wild beast ibubesi told them to do  i saw ibubesi and he prayed me for my pardon and i granted it to him broke in rachel  i did not see him went on noie fiercely nor would i have pardoned him if i had nor do i think that my father and his family pardon him i think that they wait to bear testimony against him before the lord of the dead  did seyapi tell you so asked rachel  nay he sat there beneath a black tree whereof i could not see the top and gazed into a bowl of black water and in that bowl he showed me many pictures of things that have been and things that are to come but they are secret i may say nothing of them  and what was the end of it my niece asked nya bending forward eagerly  mother the end of it was that the black tree which was shaped like the tree of our tribe above us took fire and went up in a fierce flame then the roofs of the caves fell in and all the people of the dwarfs flew through the roofs singing and rejoicing into a place of light only she added slowly it seemed to me that i was left alone amidst the ruins of the caves i and the white ghost of the tree then a voice cried to me to make my heart bold to bear all things with patience since to those who dare much for loves sake much will be forgiven so i woke but what those words mean i cannot guess seeing that i love no man and never shall and she rested her chin upon her hand and sat there musing  no replied nya thou lovest no man and therefore the riddle is hard but as she spoke her eyes fell upon rachel  mother said rachel presently my heart is the hungrier for all that it has fed upon can thy magic send me back to that country of the dead that i may search for him again if so for his sake i will dare the journey  not so answered nya shaking her head it is a road that very few have travelled and none may travel twice and live  now rachel began to weep  weep not maiden there are other roads and perchance tomorrow thou shall walk them now lie down and sleep both of you and fear no dreams  so they laid themselves down and slept but the old witchwife nya sat waiting and watched them  i think i understand she murmured to herself as she gazed at the slumbering rachel for to her who is so pure and good and who has suffered such cruel wrong the guardians would not lie i think that i understand and that i can find a path sleep on sweet maiden sleep on in hope  then she looked at noie and shook her grey head  i do not understand she muttered the black tree shaped like the tree of our tribe and seyapi of the old blood seated beneath it the tree that went up in fire and the maid of the old blood left alone with the ghost of it while the dwarf people fled into light and freedom what does it mean ah that picture in the bowl now i can guess those who dare much for love it did not say for love of man and woman can love woman but would she dare a deed that none of our race could even dream well the zulu blood is bold perhaps perhaps oh eddo thou black sorcerer whither art thou leading the children of the tree on thy head be it eddo not on mine on thy head for ever and for ever  when rachel awoke refreshed on the following day she lay a while thinking every detail of her vision was perfectly clear in her mind only now she was sure that it had been but a dream yet what a wonderful dream how even in her sleep had she found the imagination to conceive circumstances so inconceivable that magic rush beyond the stars that mighty world set round with black cliffs against which rolled the waves of space that changeful wondrous world which unfolded itself petal by petal like a rose every petal lovelier and different from the last that grey hall roofed with tilted precipices and then those dead those multitudes of the dead  what power had been born in her that she could imagine such things as these vision she had like her mother but not after this sort perhaps it was but an aftermath of her madness for into the minds of the mad creep strange sights and sounds and this place and the people amongst whom she sojourned the ghostpeople the grey dwarfpeople the dealers in dreams the dwellers in the sombre forest might well open new doors in such a soul as hers or perhaps she was still mad she did not know she did not greatly care all she knew was that her poor heart ached with love for a man who was dead and yet whom she could not find even among the dead she had wished to die but now she longed for death no more fearing lest after all there should be something in that vision which the magic of nya had summoned up and that when she reached the further shore she might not find him who dwelt in a different world oh if only she could find him then she would be glad enough to go wherever it was that he had gone  now noie was awake at her side and they talked together  we must have dreamt dreams noie she said perhaps the mother mingled some drug with our food  i do not know zoola answered noie but if so i want no more of those dreams which bode no good to me besides who can tell what is dream and what is truth mayhap this world is the dream and the truth is such things as we saw last night and she would say no more on the matter  nothing happened within the wall that daythat is nothing out of the common a certain number of the privileged priestly caste of the dwarfs were carried or conducted into the holy place and up to the fence of death that they might die there and a certain number were brought out for burial some of those who came in were folk weary of life or in other words suicides and these walked and some were sick of various diseases and these were carried but the end was the same they always died though whether this result was really brought about by some poison distilled from the tree as nya alleged or whether it was the effect of a physical collapse induced by that inherited belief rachel never discovered  at least they died some almost at once and some within a day or two of entering that deadly shade and were borne away to burial by the mutes who spent their spare time in the digging of little graves which they must fill indeed these mutes either knew or pretended that they knew who would be the occupant of each grave at least they intimated by signs that this was revealed to them in their bowls and when the victims appeared within the wall took pleasure in leading them to the holes they had prepared and showing to them with what care these had been dug to suit their stature for this service they received a fee that such moribund persons brought with them either of finely woven robes or of mats or of different sorts of food or sometimes of gold and copper rings manufactured by the umkulu or other subject savages which they wore upon their wrists and ankles  certain of these doomed folk however went to their fate with no light hearts which was not wonderful as it seemed that these were neither ill nor sought a voluntary euthanasia they were political victims sent thither by eddo as an alternative to the terror of the red death whereby according to their strange and ancient creed they would have risked the spilling of their souls for the most part the crime of these poor people was that they had been adherents and supporters of the old mother of the tree nya over whom eddo was at last triumphant on their way up to the fence such individuals would stop to exchange a last few sad words with their dethroned priestess  then without any resistance they went on with the rest but from them the mutes received scant offerings or none at all with the result that they were cast into the worst situated and most inconvenient graves or even tumbled two or three together into some shapeless corner hole but after all that mattered nothing to them so long as they received sepulchre within the wall which was their birthor rather their deathright  the priestmutes themselves were a strange folk and oddly enough rachel observed by comparison quite cheerful in their demeanour for when off duty they would smile and gibber at each other like monkeys and carry on a kind of market between themselves they lived in that part of the circumference of the wall which was behind the hill whereon grew the sacred tree here no burials took place and instead of graves appeared their tiny huts arranged in neat streets and squares in these they and their forefathers had dwelt from time immemorial indeed each little hut with a few yards of fencedin ground about it ornamented with dwarf trees was a freehold that descended from father to son for the mutes married and were given in marriage like other folk though their children were few a family of three being considered very large while many of the couples had none at all but those who were born to them were all deafmutes although their other senses seemed to be singularly acute  these mutes had their virtues thus some of them were very kind to each other and especially to those from the outer forest world who came hither to bid farewell to that world and others renouncing marriage and all earthly joys devoted their lives which appeared to be long to the worship of the spirit of the tree also they had their vices such as theft and the seducing away of the betrothed of others but the chief of them was jealousy which sometimes led to murder by poisoning an art whereof they were great masters  when such a crime was discovered and a case of it happened during the first days of rachels sojourn among them the accused was put upon his trial before the chief of the mutes evidence for and against him being given by signs which they all understood then if a case were established against him he was forced to drink a bowl of medicine if he did this with impunity he was acquitted but if it disagreed with him his guilt was held to be established now came the strange part of the matter all his life the evildoer had been accustomed to go within the fence about his business and take no harm but after such condemnation he was conducted there with the usual ceremonies and very shortly perished like any other uninitiated person whether this issue was due to magic or to mental collapse or to the previous administration of poison no one seemed to know not even nya herself so at least she declared to rachel  at each new moon these mutes celebrated what rachel was informed they looked upon as a festival that is they climbed the tree of the tribe and scattered themselves among its enormous branches where for several hours they mumbled and gibbered in the dark like a troop of baboons then they came down and mounting the huge surrounding wall crept around its circumference occasionally this journey resulted in an accident as one of them would fall from the wall and be dashed to pieces although it was noticed that the unfortunate was generally a person who although guilty of no actual crime chanced to be out of favour with the other priests and priestesses after the circuit of the wall had been accomplished with or without accidents the dwarfs feasted round a fire drinking some spirit that threw them into a sleep in which wonderful visions appeared to them such was their only entertainment if so it could be called since doubtless the ceremony was of a religious character for the rest they seldom if ever left the holy place which was known as within the wall most of them never doing so in the course of a long life  beyond the burial of the dead they did no work as their food was brought to them daily by outside people who were called the slaves of the wall their only method of conversation was by signs and they seemed to desire no other indeed if as occasionally happened a child was born to any of them who could hear or speak like other human beings it was either given over to the other dwarfs or if the discovery was not made until it was old enough to observe it was sacrificed by being bound to the trunk of the tribal tree lest it should tell the secret of the tree  such were the weird halfhuman folk among whom rachel was destined to dwell the zulus had been bad and bloodthirsty but compared to these little wizards they seemed to her as angels the zulus at any rate had left her her thoughts but these stunted wretches she was sure pried into them and read them with the help of their bowls for often she caught sight of them signing to each other about her as she passed and pointing with grins to pictures which they saw in the water    it was night again still silent night made odorous with the heavy cedar scents of the huge tree upon the mound rachel and noie sat before nya in the cave beneath the burning lamp about which fluttered the bigwinged gilded moths  thou didst not find him yonder among the shades said nya suddenly as though she were continuing a conversation say now maiden art thou satisfied or wouldst thou seek for him again  i would seek him through all the heavens and all the earths mother my soul burns for a sight of him and if i cannot find him then i must die and go perchance where he is not  good said nya the effort wearies me for i grow weak yet for thy sake i will try to help thee who saved me from the red death  then the dwarfwomen came in and beat upon their drums and as before the old mother of the trees began to sing but noie sat aside for in this nights play she would take no part again rachel sank into sleep and again it seemed to her that she was swept from the earth into the region of the stars and there searched world after world  she saw many strange and marvellous things things so wonderful that her memory was buried beneath the mass of them so that when she woke again she could not recall their details only of richard she saw nothing yet as her life returned to her it seemed to rachel that for one brief moment she was near to richard she could not see him and she could not hear him yet certainly he was near her then her eyes opened and nya ceasing from her song asked  what tidings wanderer  little she answered feebly for she was very tired and in a faint voice she told her all  good said nya nodding her grey head this time he was not so far away tomorrow i will make thy spirit strong and then perhaps he will come to thee now rest  so next night nya laid her charm upon rachel as before and again her spirit sought for richard this time it seemed to her that she did not leave the earth but with infinite pain with terrible struggling wandered to and fro about it bewildered by a multitude of faces led astray by myriads of footsteps yet in the end she found him she heard him not she saw him not she knew not where he was but undoubtedly for a while she was with him and awoke again exhausted but very happy  nya heard her story weighing every word of it but saying nothing then she signed to the dwarfs to bring her a bowl of dew and stared in it for a long while the dwarfwomen also stared into their bowls and afterwards came to her talking to her on their fingers after which all three of them upset the dew upon a rock breaking the pictures  hast thou seen aught asked rachel eagerly  yes maiden answered the mother i and these wise women have seen something the same thing and therefore a true thing but ask not what it was for we may not tell thee nor would it help thee if we did only be of a good courage for this i say there is hope for thee  so rachel went to sleep pondering on these words of which neither she nor noie could guess the meaning the next night when she prayed nya to lay the spell upon her the old mother would not  not so she said thrice have i rent thy soul from thy body and sent it afar and this i may do no more and keep thee living nor could i if i would for i grow feeble neither is it necessary seeing that although thou knowest it not that spirit of thine having found him is with him wherever he may be yes at his side comforting him  aye but where is he mother let me look in the bowl and see his face as i believe that thou hast done  look if thou wilt and she motioned to one of the dwarfwomen to place a bowl before her  so rachel looked long and earnestly but saw nothing of richard only many fantastic pictures most of which she knew again for scenes from her own past at length worn out she thrust away the bowl and asked in a bitter voice why they mocked her and how it came about that she who had seen the coming of richard in the pool in zululand and the fate of dingaan the king in the bowl of eddo could now see nothing of any worth  as regards the vision of the pool i cannot say maiden replied nya for that was born of thine own heart and had nothing to do with our magic as regards the visions in the bowl of eddo they were his visions not thine or rather my visions that i saw before he started hence i passed them on to him and he passed them on to thee and thou didst pass them on to king dingaan farsighted and puresouled as thou art yet not having been instructed in their wizardry thou wilt see nothing in the bowls of the dwarfs unless their blood is mingled with thy blood  their blood mingled with my blood what dost thou mean mother  what i say neither more nor less if eddo has his will thou wilt rule after me here as mother of the trees but first thy veins must be opened and the veins of eddo must be opened and eddos blood must be poured into thee and thy blood into him then thou wilt be able to read in the bowls as we can and eddo will be thy master and thou must do his bidding while you both shall live  if so answered rachel i think that neither of us will live long  that night rachel felt too exhausted to sleep though why this should be she could not guess as she had done nothing all day save watch the mutes at their dreary tasks and it was strange therefore that she should feel as though she had made a long journey upon her feet about an hour before the dawn she saw nya rise and glide past her towards the mouth of the cave carrying in her hand a little drum like those used by the mute women something impelled her to follow and waking noie at her side she bade her come also   outside of the cave by the faint starlight they saw the little shape of nya creeping down the mound and thence across the open space towards the wall and went after her thinking that she intended to pass the wall but this she did not do for when she came to its foot nya notwithstanding her feebleness began to climb the rough stones as actively as any cat and though their ascent seemed perilous enough reached the crest of the wall sixty feet above in safety and there sat herself down next they heard her beating upon the drum she bore single strokes always but some of them slow and some rapid with a pause between every five or ten strokes as though she were spelling out words thought rachel  after a while nya ceased her beating and in the utter silence of the night which was broken only as always by the occasional crash of falling trees for no breath of air stirred and all the beasts of prey had sought their lairs before light came both she and noie seemed to hear far infinitely far away the faint beat of an answering drum it would appear that nya heard it also for she struck a single note upon hers as though in acknowledgement after which the distant beating went on paused as though for a reply from some other unheard drum and again from time to time went on perhaps repeating that reply  for a long while this continued until the sky began to grow grey indeed when nya beat for several minutes and was answered by a single faroff note then glancing at the heavens she prepared to descend the wall while rachel and noie slipped back to the cave and feigned to be asleep soon she entered and stood over them shaking her grey head and asking how it came about that they thought that she the mother of the trees should be so easily deceived  so thou sawest us said rachel trying not to look ashamed  no i saw you not with my eyes either of you but i felt both of you following me and heard in my heart what you were whispering to each other well inkosazana art thou the wiser for this journey  no mother but tell us if thou wilt what thou wast beating on that drum  gladly she answered i was sending certain orders to the slave peoples who still know me as mother of the trees and obey my words perhaps thou dost not believe that while i sat upon yonder wall i talked across the desert to the chiefs of the marches upon the far border of the land of the umkulu and that by now at my bidding they have sent out men upon an errand of mine   what was the errand mother asked rachel curiously  i said the errand was mine not thine maiden it is not pressing but as i do not know how long my strength will last i thought it well that it should be settled then without more words she coiled herself up on her mat and seemed to go to sleep  it was after this incident of the drums that rachel experienced the strangest days or rather weeks of her life nya sent her into no more trances and to all outward seeming nothing happened yet within her much did happen her madness had utterly left her and still she was not as other women are or as she herself had been in health her mind seemed to wander and she knew not whither it wandered yet for long hours although she was awake and so noie said talking or eating or walking as usual it was away from her and afterwards she could remember nothing also this happened at night as well as during the day and ever more and more often  she could remember nothing yet out of this nothingness there grew upon her a continual sense of the presence of richard darrien a presence that seemed to come nearer and nearer closer and closer to her heart it was the assurance of this presence that made those long days so happy to her though when she was herself she felt that it could be naught but a dream yet why should a dream move her so strangely and why should a dream weary her so much why after sleeping all night should she awake feeling as though she had journeyed all night why should her limbs ache and she grow thin like one who travels without cease why should she seem time after time to have passed great dangers to have known cold and heat and want and struggle against waters and the battling against storms why should her knowledge of this richard of the very heart and soul of richard grow ever deeper till it was as though they were not twain but one  she could not answer these questions and noie could not answer them and when she asked nya the old mother shook her head and could not or would not answer only the dwarfmutes seemed to know the answer for when she passed them they nudged each other and grinned and thrust their little woolly heads together staring several of them into one bowl but if noie and nya knew nothing of the cause of these things the effect of them stirred them both for they saw that rachel the tall and strong grew faint and weak and began to fade away as one fades upon whom deadly sickness has laid its hand  thus three weeks or so went by until one day in some fashion of her own nya caused to arise an the mind of eddo a knowledge of her desire to speak with him early the next morning eddo arrived at the holy place accompanied only by his familiar hana and nya met them alone in the mouth of the cave  i see that thou art very white and thin but still alive old woman sneered eddo adding all the thousands of the people yonder thought that long ere this thou wouldst have passed within the fence may i take back that good tidings to them  the ancient mother of the trees looked at him sternly  it is true thou evil mocker she said that i am white and thin it is true that i grow like to the skeleton of a rotted leaf all ribs and netted veins without substance it is true that my round eyes start from my head like to those of a bush plover or the tree lizard and that soon i must pass within the fence as thou hast so long desired that i should do that thou mayest reign alone over the thousands of the people of the dwarfs and wield their wisdom to increase thy power thou poisonbloated toad all these things are true eddo yet ere i go i have a word to say to thee to which thou wilt do well to listen  speak on said eddo without doubt thou hast wisdom of a sort honey thou hast garnered during many years and it is well that i should suck the store before it is too late  eddo said nya i am not the only one in this holy place who grows white and thin look there is another and she nodded towards rachel who walked past them aimlessly with dreaming eyes attended by noie upon whose arm she leant  i see answered eddo this haunted deathprison presses the life out of her also i think that thou hast sent her spirit travelling as thou knowest how to do and such journeys sap the strength of flesh and blood  perhaps but now before it is too late i would send her body travelling also only thou who hast the power for a while dost bar the road  i know said eddo nodding his bead and looking at his companion we all know do we not hana we who have heard certain beatings of drums in the night and studied dew drops beneath the trees at dawn thou wouldst send her to meet another traveller  yes and if thou art wise thou wilt let her go  why should i let her go asked the priest passionately and with her all my greatness she must reign here after thee for at her feet thy tree fell and it is the will of the people who weary of dwarf queens and desire one that is tall and beautiful and white moreover when my blood has been poured into her her wisdom will be great greater than thine or that of any mother that went before thee for she is wensi the virgin and her soul is purer than them all i will not let her go if she leaves this holy place where none may do her harm she shall die and then her spirit may go to seek that other traveller  thou art mad eddo mad and blind with pride and folly let her be and choose another mother now there is noie  thy greatniece nya who thinks as thou thinkest and hates those whom thou hatest nay i will have none of that halfbreed yonder white inkosazana shall be our queen and no other  then eddo whispered nya leaning forward and looking into his eyes she shall be the last mother of this people fool there are those who fight for her against whom thou canst not prevail thou knowest them not but i know them and i tell thee that they make ready thy doom have thy way eddo it was not for her that i pleaded with thee but for the sake of the ancient people of the ghosts whose fate draws nigh to them fool have thy way spin thy web and be caught in it thyself i tell thee eddo that thy death shall be redder than any thou hast ever dreamed nor shall it fall on thee alone begone now and trouble me no more till in another place all that is left of thee shall creep to my feet praying me for a pardon thou shalt not find begone for the last leaf withers on my tree and tomorrow i pass within the fence say to the people that their mother against whom they rebelled is dead and that she bids them prepare to meet the evil which alive she warded from their heads  now eddo strove to answer but could not for there was something in the flaming eyes of nya which frightened him he looked at hana and hana looked back at him then taking each others hand they slunk away towards the wall staggering blindly through the sunshine towards the shade    chapter xxiii  the dream in the north   richard darrien remembered drinking a bowl of milk in the hut in which he was imprisoned at mafooti and instantly feeling a cold chill run to his heart and brain after which he remembered no more for many a day at length however by slow degrees and with sundry slips back into unconsciousness life and some share of his reason and memory returned to him he awoke to find himself lying in a hut roughly fashioned of branches and attended by a kaffir woman of middle age  who are you he asked  i am named mami she answered  mami mami i know the name and i know the voice say were you one of the wives of ibubesi she who spoke with me through the fence and he strove to raise himself on his arm to look at her but fell back from weakness  yes inkoos i was one of his wives  was then where is ibubesi now  dead inkoos the fire has burned him up with his kraal mafooti  with the kraal mafooti where then is the inkosazana answer woman and be swift he cried in a hollow voice  alas inkoos alas she is dead also for she was in the kraal when the fire swept it and was seen standing on the top of a hut where she had taken refuge and after that she was seen no more  then let me die and go to her exclaimed richard with a groan as he fell back upon his bed where he lay almost insensible for three more days  yet he did not die for he was young and very strong and mami poured milk down his throat to keep the life in him indeed little by little something of his strength came back so that at last he was able to think and talk with her again and learned all the dreadful story  he learned how the people of mafooti fearing the vengeance of dingaan had fled away from their kraal carrying what they thought to be his body with them lest it should remain in evidence against them and taking all the cattle that they could gather every one of them had fled that could travel only ibubesi and a few sick and certain folk who chanced to be outside the walls remaining behind it was from two of these who escaped during the burning of the kraal by the zulus or by fire from the heavens they knew not which that they had heard of the awful end of ibubesi and of his prisoner the inkosazana as for themselves they had travelled night and day till they reached a certain secret and almost inaccessible place in the great quathlamba mountains in which people had lived whom chaka wiped out and there hidden themselves in this place they remained hoping that dingaan would not care to follow them so far and purposing to make it their home since here they found good mealie lands and fortunately the most of their cattle remained alive that was all the story there was nothing more to tell  a day or two later richard was able to creep out of the hut and see the place it was as mami had said very strong a kind of tableland ringed round with precipices that could only be climbed through a single narrow nek and overshadowed by the great quathlamba range the people who were engaged in planting their corn gathered round him staring at him as though he were one risen from the dead and greeted him with respectful words he spoke to several of them including the two men who had seen the burning of mafooti though from a little distance but they could tell him no more than mami had done except that they were sure that the inkosazana had perished in the flames as had many of the zulus who broke into the town richard was sure of it alsowho would not have beenand crept back brokenhearted to his hut he who had lost all and longed that he might die  but he did not die he grew strong again and when he was well and fit to travel went to the headmen of the people saying that now he desired to leave them and return to his own place in the cape colony the headmen said no he must not leave for in their hearts they were sure that he would go not to the cape colony but to zululand there to discover all he could as to the death of the inkosazana so they told him that with them he must bide for then if the zulus tracked them out they would be able to produce him who otherwise would be put to the spear every man of them as his murderers the sin of ibubesi who had been their chief clung to them and they knew well what dingaan and tamboosa had sworn should happen to those who harmed the white chief dario who was under the mantle of their inkosazana  richard reasoned with them but it was of no use they would not let him go therefore in the end he appeared to fall in with their humour and meanwhile began to plan escape one dark night he tried it indeed only to be seized in the mouth of the nek and brought back to his hut next morning the headman spoke with him telling him that he should only depart thence over their dead bodies and that they watched him night and day that the nek moreover was always guarded then they made an offer to him he was a white man they said and cleverer than they were let them come under his wing let him be their chief for he would know how to protect them from the zulus and any other enemies he could take over the wives of ibubesi at this proposition richard shuddered and they would obey him in all things only he must not attempt to leave themwhich he should never do alive   richard put the proposal by but in the end not because he wished it but by the mere weight of his white mans blood and for the lack of anything else to do drifted into some such position only at the wives of ibubesi or any other wives he would not so much as look a slight that gave offence to those women but made the others laugh  so for certain long weeks he sat in that secret nook in the mountains as the chief of a little kaffir tribe occupying himself with the planting of crops the building of walls and huts the drilling of men and the settling of quarrels all day he worked thus but after the day came the night when he did not work and those nights he dreaded for then the languor not of body but of mind which the poison the old witchdoctoress had given to ishmael had left behind it would overcome him bringing with it black despair and his grief would get a hold of him torturing his heart for of the memory of rachel he could never be rid for a single hour and his love for her grew deeper day by day and she was dead oh she was dead leaving him living  one night he dreamed of rachel dreamed that she was searching for him and calling him it was a very vivid dream but he woke up and it passed away as such dreams do only all the day that followed he felt a strange throbbing in his head and found himself turning ever towards the north the next night he dreamed again of her and heard her say the search has been far and long but i have found you richard open your eyes now and you will see my face so he opened his eyes and there sure enough in the darkness he perceived the outline of her sweet remembered face about which fell her golden hair for one moment only he perceived it then it was gone and after that her presence never seemed to leave him he could not see her he could not touch her and yet she was ever at his side his brain ached with the thought of her her breath seemed to fan his hands and hair at night her face floated before him and in his dreams her voice called him saying come to me come to me richard i am in need of you come to me i myself will be your guide  then he would wake and remembering that she was dead grew sure and ever surer that the spirit of rachel was calling him down to death it called him from the north always from the north soon he could scarcely walk southwards or east or west for ere he had gone many yards his feet turned and set his face towards the north that was to the narrow nek between the precipices which the kaffirs guarded night and day  one evening he went to his hut to sleep if sleep would come to him it came and with it that face and voice but the face seemed paler and the voice more insistent  will you not listen to me it said you who were my love for how long must i plead with you soon my power will leave me the opportunity will be passed and then how will you find me richard my lover rise up rise up and follow ere it be too late for i myself will be your guide  he awoke he could bear it no more perhaps he was mad and these were visions of his madness mocking visions that led him to his death well if so he still would follow them perhaps her body was buried in the north if so he would be buried there also perhaps her soul dwelt in the north if so his soul would fly thither to join it the kaffirs would kill him in the pass well if so he would die with his face set northwards whither rachel drew him  he rose up and wrapped himself in a cloak of goatskins he filled a hide bag with sundried flesh and parched corn and hung it about his shoulders with a gourd of water for after all he might live a little while and need food and drink as he had no gun he took a staff and a knife and a broadbladed spear and leaving the hut set his face northward and walked towards the mouth of the nek at the first step which he took the torment in his head seemed to leave him who fought no longer who had seemed obedient to that mysterious summons quietness and confidence possessed him he was going to his end but what did it matter the dream beckoned and he must follow the moon shone bright but he took no trouble to hide himself it did not seem to be worth while  now he was in the nek and drawing near to the place where the guard was stationed still he marched on boldly openly as he thought they were on the alert they drew out from behind the rocks and barred his path  whither goest thou lord dario asked their captain thou knowest that here thou mayest not pass  i follow a ghost to the north he answered and living or dead i pass  ow said the captain he says that he follows a ghost well we have nothing to do with ghosts take him unharmed if possible but take him  so urged thereto by their own fears since for their safetys sake they dared not let him go the men sprang towards him they sprang towards him where he stood waiting the end for give back he would not and of a sudden fell down upon their faces hiding their heads among the stones richard did not know what had happened to them that they behaved thus strangely nor did he care only seeing them fallen he walked on over them and pursued his way along the nek and down it to the plains beyond  all that night he walked looking behind him from time to time to see if any followed but none came he was alone quite alone save for the dream that led him towards the north at sunrise he rested and slept a while then awaking after midday went on his road he did not know the road yet never was he in doubt for a moment it was always clear to him whither he should go that night he finished his food and again slept a while going forward at the dawn in the morning he met some kaffirs who questioned him but he answered only that he was following a dream to the north they stared at him seemed to grow frightened and ran away but presently some of them came back and placed food in his path which he took and left them  he came to the kraal mafooti it was utterly deserted and he wandered amidst its ashes here and there he found the bones of those who had perished in the fire and turned them over with his staff wondering whether any of them had belonged to rachel in that place he slept a night thinking that perhaps his journey was ended and that here he would die where he believed rachel had died but when he waked at the dawn it was to find that something within him still drew him towards the north more strongly indeed than ever before  so he left what had been the town mafooti walking along the edge of the cleft into which ishmael had leapt on fire he climbed the walls built with so much toil to keep out the zulus and at last came to the river which rachel had swum it was low now and wading it he entered zululand here the natives seemed to know of his approach for they gathered in numbers watching him and put food in his path but they would not speak to him and when he addressed them saying that he followed a dream and asking if they had seen the dream they cried out that he was tagali bewitched and fled away  he continued his journey finding each night a hut prepared for him to sleep in and food for him to eat till at length one evening he reached the great place umgugundhlovu through its streets he marched with a set face while thousands stared at him in silence then a captain pointed out a hut to him and into it he entered ate and slept at dawn he rose for he knew that here he must not tarry the spirit face of rachel still hung before him the spirit voice still whisperedforward forward to the north i myself will be your guide in his path sat the king and his councillors and around them a regiment of men he walked through them unheeding till at length when he was in front of the king they barred his road and he halted  who art thou and what is thy business asked an old councillor with a withered hand  i am richard darrien he answered and here i have no business i journey to the north stay me not  we know thee said the councillor thou art the lord dario that didst dwell in the shadow of the inkosazana thou art the white chief whom the wild beast ibubesi slew at the kraal mafooti why does thy ghost come hither to trouble us  living or dead ghost or man i travel to the north stay me not he answered  what seekest thou in the north thou lord dario  i seek a dream a spirit leads me to find a dream seest thou it not man with the withered hand  ah they repeated he seeks a dream a spirit leads him to find a dream in the north  what is this dream like asked mopo of the withered hand  come stand at my side and look there dost thou see it floating in the air before us thou who hast eyes that can read a dream  mopo came and looked then his knees trembled a little and he said  aye lord dario i see and i know that face  thou knowest the face old fool broke in dingaan angrily then whose is it  o king answered mopo dropping his eyes it is not lawful to speak the name but the face is the face of one who sat where that wanderer stands and showed thee certain pictures in a bowl of water  now dingaan trembled for the memory of those visions haunted him night and day moreover he thought at times that they drew near to their fulfilment  the white man is mad he said and thou mopo art mad also i have often thought it and that it would be well if thou wentest on a long journeyfor thy health this dario shall stay here a while i will not suffer him to wander through my land crazing the people with his tales of dreams and visions take him and hold him the circle of the doctors shall inquire into the matter  so dingaan spoke who in his heart was afraid lest this wildeyed dario should learn that he had given the inkosazana to the dwarf folk when she was mad to appease them after they had prophesied evil to him also he remembered that it was because of the murders done by ibubesi that the inkosazana had gone mad and did not understand if dario had been killed at the kraal mafooti how it could be that he now stood before him therefore he thought that he would keep him a prisoner until he found out all the truth of the matter and whether he were still a man or a ghost or a wizard clothed in the shape of the dead  at the bidding of the king guards sprang forward to seize richard but the old councillor mopo shrunk away behind him hiding his eyes with his withered hand they sprang forward and yet they laid no finger on him but fell oft to right and left saying  kill us if thou wilt black one we cannot  the wizard has bewitched them said dingaan angrily here you doctors you whose trade it is to catch wizards take this white fellow and bind him  unwillingly enough the doctors of whom there were eight or ten sitting apart rose to do the kings bidding they came on towards richard some of them singing songs and some muttering charms and as they came he laughed and said  beware you abangoma the dream is looking at you very angrily then they too broke away to right and left crying out that this was a wizard against whom they had no power  now dingaan grew mad with wrath and shouted to his soldiers to seize the white man and if he resisted them to kill him with their sticks for of witchcraft they had known enough in zululand of late  so thick as bees the regiment formed up in front of him shouting and waving their kerries for here in the kings place they bore no spears  make way there said richard i can stay no longer i must to the north  the soldiers did not stir only a captain stepped out bidding him give up his spear and yield himself or be killed richard walked forward and at a sign from the captain men sprang at him lifting their kerries to dash out his brains then suddenly in front of richard there appeared something faint and white something that walked before him the soldiers saw it and the kerries fell from their hands the regiment behind saw it and turning burst away like a scared herd of cattle they did not wait to seek the gates they burst through the fence of the enclosure and were gone leaving it flat behind them the king and his councillors saw it also and more clearly than the rest  the inkosazana they cried it is the inkosazana who walks before him that she loved and they fell upon their faces only dingaan remained seated on his stool  go he said hoarsely to richard go thou wizard north or south or east or west if only thou wilt take that spirit with thee for she bodes evil to my land   so richard who had seen nothing marched away from the kraal umgugundhlovu and once more set his face towards the north the north that drew him as it draws the needle of a compass  the road that rachel and the dwarfs had travelled he travelled also although from day to day he knew not where his feet would lead him still he travelled it step by step nor did any hurt come to him in the country where men dwelt being forewarned of his coming by messengers they brought him food and guarded him and when he passed out into the wilderness some other power guarded him he had no fear at all at night he would lie down without a fire and the lions would roar about him but they never harmed him he would plunge into a swamp or a river and always pass it safely when water failed he would find it without search when there was no food it would seem to be brought to him once an eagle dropped a bustard at his feet once he found a buck fresh slain by leopards once when he was very hungry he saw that he had laid down to sleep by a nest of ostrich eggs and this food he cooked making fire after the native fashion with sharp sticks as he knew how to do  at length all the swamps were passed and in the third week of his journeyings he reached the sloping uplands on the edge of which he awoke one morning to find himself surrounded by a circle of great men giants who stood staring at him he arose thinking that at last his hour had come as it seemed to him that they were about to kill him but instead of killing him these huge men saluted him humbly and offered him food upon their knees and new hide shoes for his feetfor his own were worn outand cloaks and garments of skin which things he accepted thankfully for by now he was almost naked then they brought a litter and wished him to enter it but this he refused heeding them no more as soon as he had eaten and filled his bag and waterbottle he started on towards the north indeed he could not have stayed if he had wished his brain seemed to be full of one thought only to travel till he reached his journeys end whatever it might be and before his eyes he saw one thing only the spirit face of rachel that led him on towards that end sometimes it was there for hours then for hours again it would be absent when it was present he looked at it when it was gone he dreamed of it for him it was the same but one thing was ever with him that magnet in his heart which drew his feet towards the north and from step to step showed him the road that he should travel  a number of the giant men accompanied him he noticed it but took no heed so long as they did not attempt to stay or turn him he was indifferent whether they came or went away as a result he travelled in much more comfort since now everything was made easy and ready for him thus he was fed with the best that the land provided and at night shelters were built for him to sleep in he discovered that a captain of the giants could understand a few words of some native language which he knew and asked him why they helped him the captain replied by order of mother of trees who or what mother of trees might be richard was unable to discover so he gave up his attempts at talk and walked on  they traversed the fertile uplands and reached the edge of the fearful desert it did not frighten him he plunged into it as he would have plunged into a sea or a lake of fire had it lain in his way he was like a bird whose instinct at the approach of summer or of winter leads it without doubt or error to some far spot beyond continents and oceans some land that it has never seen leads it in surety and peace to its appointed rest a guard of the giant men came with him into the desert also carriers who bore skins of water in that burning heat the journey was dreadful yet richard accomplished it wearing down all his escort until at its further lip but one man was left there even he sank exhausted and began to beat upon a little drum that he carried which drum had been passed on to him by those who were left behind but richard was not exhausted his strength seemed to be greater than it had ever been before or that which drew him forward had acquired more power he wondered vaguely why a man should choose such a place and time to play upon a drum and went on alone  before him some miles away he saw a forest of towering trees that stretched further than his eye could reach as he approached that forest heading for a certain tall tree why he knew not the sunset dyed it red as though it had been on fire and he thought that he discerned little shapes flitting to and fro amidst the boles of trees then he entered the forest whereof the boughs arched above him like the endless roof of a cathedral borne upon innumerable pillars there was deep gloom that grew presently to darkness wherein here and there glowworms shone faintly like tapers dying before an altar and winds sighed like echoes of evening prayers he could see to walk no longer sudden weariness overcame him so according to his custom he laid himself down to sleep at the bole of a great tree  a while had passed he never knew how long when richard was awakened from deep slumber by feeling many hands fiercely at work upon him these hands were small like those of children this he could tell from the touch of them although the darkness was so dense that he was able to see nothing two of them gripped him by the throat so as to prevent him from crying out others passed cords about his wrists ankles and middle until he could not stir a single limb then he was dragged back a few paces and lashed to the bole of a tree as he guessed that under which he had been sleeping the hands let go of him and his throat being free he called out for help but those vast forest aisles seemed to swallow up his voice it fell back on him from the canopy of huge boughs above it was lost in the immense silence only from close at hand he heard little peals of thin and mocking laughter so he too grew silent for who was there to help him here he struggled to loose himself for the impalpable power which had guided him so far was now at work within him more strongly than ever before it called to him to come it drew him onward it whispered to him that the goal was near but the more he writhed and twisted the deeper did the cruel cords or creepers cut into his flesh yet he fought on till utterly exhausted his head fell forward and he swooned away    chapter xxiv  the end and the beginning   on the day following that when she had summoned eddo to speak with her nya sat at the mouth of the cave it was late afternoon and already the shadows gathered so quickly that save for her white hair her little childlike shape withered now almost to a skeleton was scarcely visible against the black rock walking to and fro in her aimless fashion as she would do for hours at a time rachel accompanied by noie passed and repassed her till at length the old woman lifted her head and listened to something which was quite inaudible to their ears then she beckoned to noie who led rachel to her  maiden beloved she said in a feeble voice after they had sat down in front of her my hour has come i have sent for thee to bid thee farewell till we meet again in a country where thou hast travelled for a little while before the sun sets i pass within the fence  at this tidings rachel began to weep for she had learned to love this old dwarfwoman who had been so kind to her in her misery and she was now so weak that she could not restrain her fears  mother she said for thee it is joy to go i know it and therefore cannot wish that thou shouldst stay yet what shall i do when thou hast left me alone amidst all these cruel folk tell me what shall i do  perchance thou wilt seek another helper maiden and perchance thou shall find another to guard and comfort thee follow thy heart obey thy heart and remember the last words of nyathat no harm shall come to thee nayif i know it i may tell thee no more thou who couldst not hear what the drums said to me but now farewell and turning round she made a sign to certain dwarfmutes who were gathered behind her as though they awaited her commands  hast thou no last word for me mother asked noie  aye child she answered thy heart is very bold and thou also must follow it though thy sin should be great perchance thy greater love may pay its price at least thou art but an arrow set upon the string and that which must be will be i think that we shall meet again ere long come hither and kneel at my side  noie obeyed and for a little space nya whispered in her ear while as she listened rachel saw strange lights shining in noies eyes lights of terror and of pride lights of hope and of despair  what did she say to you noie asked rachel presently  i may not tell zoola she answered question me no more  now the mutes brought forward a slight litter woven of boughs on which the withered leaves still hung boughs from nyas fallen tree in this litter they placed her for she could no longer walk and lifted it on to their shoulders for one moment she bade them halt and calling rachel and noie to her kissed them upon the brow holding up her thin childlike hands over them in blessing then followed by them both the bearers went forward with their burden taking the road that ran up the hill towards the sacred tree as the sun set they passed within the fence and laying down the litter without a word by the bole of the tree turned and departed  the darkness fell and through it rachel and noie heard nya singing for a little while the song ceased and they descended the hill to the cave for there they feared to stay lest the tree should draw them also they ate a little food whilst the two women mutes who had sat on each side of nya when she showed her magic stared now at them and now into the bowls of dew that were set before them wherein they seemed to find something that interested them much noie prayed rachel to sleep and she tried to do so and could not for hour after hour she tossed and turned and at length sat up saying to noie   i have fought against it and i can stay here no longer noie i am being drawn from this place out into the forest and i must go  what draws thee sister asked noie is it eddo  no i think not nothing to do with eddo oh noie noie it is the spirit of richard darrien he is dead but for days and weeks his spirit has been with my spirit and now it draws me into the forest to die and find him  then that is an evil journey thou wouldst take zoola  not so noie it is the best and happiest of journeys the thought of it fills me with joy what said nya follow thy heart so i follow it noie farewell for i must go away  nay answered noie if thou goest i go who also was bidden to follow my heart that is sister to thy heart  rachel reasoned with her but she would not listen the end of it was that the two of them rose and threw on their cloaks also rachel took the great umkulu spear which she had used as a staff on her journey from the desert to the forest all this while the dwarfwomen watched her but did nothing only watched  they left the cave and walked to the mouth of the zigzag slit in the great wall which was open  perhaps the mutes will kill us in the heart of the wall said noie  if so the end will be soon and swift answered rachel  now they were in the cleft following its slopes and windings above them they could hear the movements of the guardians of the wall who sat amongst the rough stones but these did not try to stop them indeed once or twice when they did not know which way to turn in the darkness little hands took hold of rachels cloak and guided her so they passed through the wall in safety outside of it rachel paused a moment looking this way and that then of a sudden she turned and walked swiftly towards the south  it was dark densely dark in the forest yet she never seemed to lose her path holding noie by the hand she wound in and out between the treetrunks without stumbling or even striking her foot against a root for an hour or more they walked on this the strangest of strange journeys till at length rachel whispered  something tells me to stay here and she leaned against a tree and stayed while noie who was tired sat down between the jutting roots of the tree  it was a dead tree and the top of it had been torn off in some hurricane so that they could see the sky above them and by the grey hue of it knew that it was drawing near to dawn  the sun rose and its arrows that even at midday could never pass the canopy of foliage shot straight and vivid between the tall bare trunks oh rachel knew the place it was that place which she had dreamed of as a child in the island of the flooded river just so had the light of the rising sun fallen on the boles of the great trees and on her white cloak and outspread hair fallen on her and on another she strained her eyes into the gloom now those rays pierced it also and now by them she saw the yellowbearded halfnaked man of that longdead dream leaning against the tree his eyes were shut without doubt he was dead this was but a vision of him who had drawn her hither to share his death it was the spirit of richard darrien  she drew a little nearer and the eyes opened gazing at her also from that form of his was cast a long shadowthere it lay upon the dead leaves how came it she wondered that a spirit could throw a shadow and why was a spirit bound to a tree as now she perceived he was he saw her and in those grey eyes of his there came a wonderful look he spoke  you have drawn me from far rachel but i have never seen all of you before only your face floating in the air before me although others saw you now i see you also so i suppose that my time has come it will soon be over wait a little there where i can look at you and presently we shall be together again i am glad  rachel could not speak a lump rose in her throat and choked her betwixt fear and hope her heart stood still only with the spear in her hand she pointed at her own shadow thrown by the level rays of the rising sun he looked and notwithstanding the straitness of his bonds she saw him start  if you are a ghost why have you a shadow he asked hoarsely and if you are not a ghost how did you come into this haunted place  still rachel did not seem to be able to speak only she glided up to him and kissed him on the lips now at length he understoodthey both understood that they were still living creatures beneath the sky not the denizens of some dim world which lies beyond  free me he said in a faint voice for his brain reeled i was bound here in my sleep they will be back presently  her intelligence awoke with a few swift cuts of the spear she held rachel severed his bonds then picked up his own assegai that lay at his feet she thrust it into his numbed hand as he took it the forest about them seemed to become alive and from behind the boles of the trees around appeared a number of dwarfs who ran towards them headed by eddo noie sprang forward also and stood at their side rachel turned on eddo swiftly as a startled deer she seemed to tower over him the spear in her hand  what does this mean priest she asked  inkosazana he answered humbly it means that i have found a way to tempt thee from within the wall where none might break thy sanctuary thou drewest this man to thee from far with the strength that old nya gave thee we knew it all we saw it all and we waited day by day in our bowls of dew we watched him coming nearer to thee we heard the messages of nya on the drums bidding the umkulu meet and escort him we heard the last answering message from the borders of the desert telling her that he was nigh then while he followed his magic path through the darkness of the forest we seized and bound him knowing well that if he could not come to thee thou wouldst come to him and thou hast come  i understand what now eddo  this inkosazana thou hast been named mother of the trees by the people of the dwarfs be pleased to come with us that we may instal thee in thy great office  this lord here said rachel is my promised husband what of him  eddo bowed and smiled a fearful smile and answered  the mother of the trees has no husband wisdom is her husband he has served his purpose which was to draw thee from within the wall and for this reason only we permitted him to enter the holy forest living now he bides here to die and since he has won thy love we will honour him with the white death bind him to the tree again  in an instant the spear that rachel held was at eddos throat  dwarf she cried this is my man and i am no mother of trees and no pale ghost but a living woman let but one of these monkeys of thine lay a hand upon him and thou diest by the red death eddo aye by the red death stir a single inch and this spear goes through thy heart and thy spirit shall be spilled with thy blood  the little priest sank to his knees trembling glancing about him for a means of escape  if thou killest me thou diest also he hissed  what do i care if i die she answered if my man dies i wish to die then added in english richard take hold of him by one arm and noie take the other if he tries to escape kill him at once or if you are afraid i will  so they seized him by his arms  now said rachel let us go back to the sanctuary for there they dare not touch us we cannot try the desert without water also they would follow and kill us with their poisoned arrows tell them noie that if they do not attempt to harm us we will set this priest of theirs free within the wall but if a hand is lifted against us then he dies at onceby the red death  touch them not touch them not piped eddo lest my ghost should be spilt with my blood touch them not i command you  the company of dwarfs chattered together like parrots at the dawn and the march began first went eddo dragged along between richard and noie and after them the raised spear in her hand followed rachel while on either side hiding themselves behind the boles of the trees scrambled the people of the dwarfs back they went thus through the forest rachel telling them the road till at length the huge grey wall loomed up before them they came to the slit in it and noie asked  what shall we do now kill this priest take him in with us as a hostage or let him go  i said that he should be set free answered rachel and he would do us more harm dead than living also his blood would be on our hands take him through the wall and loose him there  so once more they passed the slopes and passages while the mutes above watched them from their stones with marvelling eyes till they reached the open space beyond and there they loosed eddo the priest sprang back out of reach of the dreaded spears and in a voice thick with rage cried to them  fools you should have killed me while you could for now you are in a trap not i you are strong and great but you cannot live without food we may not enter here to hurt you but you shall starve you shall starve until you creep out and beg my mercy  then making signs to the dwarfs who sat about above he vanished between the stones  you should have killed him zoola said noie for now he will live to kill us  i think not sister answered rachel nya said that i should follow my heart and my heart bid me let him go our hands are clean of his blood but if he had died who can tell blood is a bad seed to sow  then forgetting eddo she turned to richard and began to ply him with questions  but he seemed to be dazed and could answer little it was as though some unnatural supporting strength had been withdrawn and now all the fatigues of his fearful journey were taking effect upon him he could scarcely stand but reeled to and fro like a man in drink so that the two women were obliged to support him across the burial ground towards the cave advancing thus they entered into the shadow of the holy tree and there at the edge of it met another procession descending from the mound eight mutes bore a litter of boughs and on it lay nya dead her long white hair hanging down on either side of the litter with bowed heads they stood aside to let her pass to the grave made ready for her in a place of honour near the wall where for a thousand years only the mothers of the trees had been laid to rest  then they went on and entered the cave where the lamps burned before the great stalactite and the heap of offerings that were piled about it here sat the two women priests gazing into their bowls as they had left them the death of nya had not moved them the advent of this white man did not seem to move them perhaps they expected him at any rate food was made ready and a bed of rugs prepared on which he could lie  richard ate some of the food staring at rachel all the while with vacant eyes as though she were still but a vision the figment of a dream then he muttered something about being very tired and sinking back upon the rugs fell into a deep sleep  in that sleep he remained scarcely stirring for full fourandtwenty hours while rachel watched by his side till at length her weariness overcame her and she slept also when she opened her eyes again they saw no other light than that which crept in from the mouth of the cave the lamps which always burned there were out noie who was seated near by heard her stir and spoke  if thou art rested zoola she said i think that we had better carry the white lord from this place for the two witchwomen have gone and i can find no more oil to fill the lamps  so they felt their way to richard purposing to lift him between them but at rachels touch he awoke and with their help walked out of the cave in the open space beyond they saw a strange sight for across it were streaming all the dwarfmutes carrying their aged and sick and infants and bearing on their backs or piled up in litters their mats and cooking utensils evidently they were deserting the sanctuary  why are they going asked rachel  i do not know answered noie but i think it is because no food has been brought to them as usual and they are hungry you remember that eddo said we should starve only fear of death by hunger would make them leave a place where they and their forefathers have lived for generations  presently they were all gone not a living creature was left within the wall except these three nor were any more dwarfs brought in to die beneath the holy tree now at length richard seemed to awake and taking rachel by the hand began to ask questions of her in a low stammering voice since words did not seem to come readily to him who had not spoken his own language for so long  before you begin to talk sister broke in noie let us go and see if we can close the cleft in the wall for otherwise how shall we sleep in peace eddo and the dwarfs might creep in by night and murder us  i do not think they dare shed blood in their holy place answered rachel still let us see what we can do it may be best  so they went to the cleft and as the stone door was open and they could not shut it at one very narrow spot they rolled down rocks from the loose sides of the ancient wall above in such a fashion that it would be difficult to pass through or over them from without this hard task took them many hours moreover it was labour wasted since as rachel had thought probable the dwarfs never tried to pass the wall but waited till hunger forced them to surrender  towards evening they returned to the cave and collected what food they could find it was but little enough for two spare meals no more nor could they discover any in the town of the dwarfs behind the tree only of water they had plenty from the stream that ran out of the cave  they ate a few mouthfuls then took their mats and cloaks and went to camp by the opening in the wall so that they might guard against surprise now for the first time they found leisure to talk and rachel and richard told each other a little of their wonderful stories but they did not tell them all for their minds seemed to be bewildered and there was much that they were not able to explain it was enough for them to know that they had been brought together again thus marvellously by what power they knew not and that still living they who for long weeks had deemed the other dead were able to hold each others hands and gaze into each others eyes moreover now that this had been brought about they were tired so tired that they could scarcely speak above a whisper the end of it was that they fell asleep all of them and so slept till morning when they awoke somewhat refreshed and ate what remained of the food  the second day was like the first only hotter and more sultry noie climbed to the top of the wall to watch while richard and rachel wandered about among the little antheaplike graves and through the dwarf village talking and wondering happy even in their wretchedness but before the day was gone hunger began to get a hold of them also the terrible stifling heat oppressed them so that their words seemed to die between their lips and they could only sit against the wall looking at one another  towards evening noie descended from the wall and reported that large numbers of the dwarfs were keeping watch without flitting to and fro between the trunks of the trees like shadows the stifling night went by and another day dawned having no food they went to the stream and drank water then they sat down in the shadow and waited through the long hot hours towards evening when it grew a little cooler they gathered up their strength and tried to find some way of escape before it was too late richard suggested that as flight was impossible they should give themselves up to the dwarfs but rachel answered no for then eddo would certainly kill him and noie and take her to fill the place of mother of the trees until she became useless to him when she would be murdered also  then there is nothing left for us but to die said richard  nothing but to die she answered to die together and dear that should not be so hard seeing that for so long we have thought each other dead apart  yet it is hard answered richard after living through so much and being led so far to die at last and go whither we know not before our time  rachel looked at noie who sat opposite to them her head rested on her hand  have you anything to say sister she asked  yes zoola here is a little moss that i have found upon the stones and she produced a small bundle let us boil it and eat it will keep us alive for another day  what is the use asked rachel unless there is more  there is no more said noie for the leaves of yonder tree are deadly poison and here grows no other living thing still eat and live on for i wait a message  a message from whom asked rachel  a message from the dead sister it was promised to me by nya before she passed and if it does not come then it will be time to die  so they made fire and boiled the moss till it was a horrible sticky substance which they swallowed as best they could washing it down with gulps of water still it was food of a kind and for a while stayed the gnawing empty pains within them only noie ate but little so that there might be more for the others  that night was even hotter than those that had gone before and during the day which followed the place became like a hell they crept into the cave and lay there gasping while from without came loud cracking sounds caused as they thought by the trees of the forest splitting in the heat about midday the sky suddenly became densely overcast although no breath stirred the air was thicker than ever to breathe it was like breathing hot cream in their restless despair they wandered out of the cave and to their surprise saw a dwarf standing upon the top of the wall it was eddo who called to them to come out and give themselves up  what are the terms asked noie  that thou and the wanderer shall die by the white death and that the inkosazana shall be installed mother of the trees was the answer  we refuse them said noie let us go now and give us food and escort and thou shall be spared refuse and it is thou and thy people who will die by that red death which nya promised thee  that we shall learn before tomorrow said eddo with a mocking laugh and vanished down the wall  as he went a hot gust of wind burst upon them causing the forest without to rock and groan noie turned her face towards it and seemed to listen  what is it asked rachel  i heard a voice in the wind sister she answered the message i awaited has come to me  what message asked richard listlessly  that i will tell you by and by chief she answered come to the cave it is no longer safe here the hurricane breaks  so supporting each other they crept back to the cave and there noie made fire feeding it with the idols and precious woods that had been brought thither as offerings richard and rachel watched her wondering for it seemed strange that she should make a fire in that heat where there was nothing to cook meanwhile gust succeeded gust until a tempest of screaming wind swept over them though no rain fell soon it was so fierce that the deeprooted tree of the tribe rocked above them and loose stones were blown from the crest of the great wall  then of a sudden noie sprang up and seized a flaming brand from the fire it was the limb of a fetish made of some resinous wood she ran from the cave swiftly before they could stop her and vanished in the gathering gloom to return again in a few moments weak and breathless come out now she said and see a sight such as you shall never behold again and there was something so strange in her voice that notwithstanding their weakness they rose and followed her  outside the cave they could not stand because of the might of the hurricane but cast themselves upon the ground and following noies outstretched arm looked up towards the top of the mound then they saw that the tree of the tribe was on fire already its vast trunk and boughs were wrapped in flame which burnt furiously because of the resin within them while long flakes of blazing moss were being swept away to leeward to fall among the forest that lay beyond the wall  did you do this cried rachel to noie  aye zoola who else that was the message which came to me now my office is fulfilled but you two will live though i must die i who have destroyed the people of the dwarfs i who was born that i should destroy them  destroyed them exclaimed rachel what do you mean  i mean that when their tree dies they die the whole race of them oh nya told me nya told methey die as their tree dies by fire to the wall to the wall now and look follow me  forgetting their hungerbred weakness in the wild excitement of that moment rachel and richard struggled hand in hand after noies thin ethereal form across the open space they struggled through the furious bufferings of the gale sometimes on their feet sometimes on their hands and knees till they came to the great wall where a stairway ran up it to an outlook tower up this stair they climbed slowly since at times the weight of the wind pinned them against the blocks of stone till at length they reached its crest and crept into the shelter of the hollow tower hence looking through the loopholes in the ancient masonry they saw a fearful sight the flakes of burning moss from the tree of the tribe had fallen among the tops of the forest parched almost to tinder with drought and heat and fired them here and there fanned by the screaming gale the flames spread rapidly leaping from tree to tree now in one direction now in another as the hurricane veered which it did continually till the whole green forest became a sheet of fire an everwidening sheet which spread east and west and north and south for miles and miles and tens of miles  earth and sky were one blaze of light given out by the torchlike resinous trees as they burned from the top downwards by that intense light the three watchers could see hundreds of the people of the dwarfs flitting about between the trunks waving their arms and gibbering they rushed this way and that to the north to be met by fire to the south to be met by fire till at length the blazing boughs and boles fell upon them and they disappeared in showers of red sparks or more fortunate fled away never to return before the flame that leapt after them one company of them ran towards the sanctuary they could see them threading their path between the trees and growing ever fewer as the burning branches fell among them from above they leapt they ran they battled springing this way and that but ever the great flaring boughs crashed down among them crushing them shrivelling them up till at length of all their number but a single man staggered into the open belt between the edge of the forest and the wall his white hair and his garments seemed to be smouldering he gripped at them with his hands then coming to a little bushit was the top of nyas tree which she had thrust into the ground to grow theredragged it up and began to beat himself with it as though to extinguish the flames in an instant it took fire also burning him horribly so that with a yell he threw it to the ground and ran on towards the wall as he came they saw his face it was that of eddo  at this moment seized by some sudden weakness noie sank down upon the stones richard bent over her to lift her to her feet again but she thrust him away saying slowly and in gasps  let me be the doom has hold of me i am dying i passed within the fence to fire the tree and its poison is at work within me and the curse of all my people has fallen on my head yet i have saved thee my sister i have saved thee and thy lover for the dwarfs are no more the grey people are grey ashes for my loves sake i did the sin let my love atone the sin if it may or at the least think kindly of me through the long happy years that are to come and at the end of them then seek for lost noie in the world of ghosts if she may be found there  as she spoke they heard a sound of something scrambling among the stones and at one of the four entrances of the turret there appeared a hideous firetwisted face and a little form about which hung charred and smouldering strips of raiment it was eddo who had climbed the wall and found them out there he sat glowering at them or rather at noie who was crouched upon the floor  come hither daughter of seyapi he screamed in his hissing snakelike voice come hither and see thy work thou who hast made an end of the ancient people of the ghosts come hither and tell me why thou didst this thing for i would learn the truth before i die that i may make report of it to the fathers of our race  noie heard and crept towards him to rachel and richard it seemed as though she could not disobey that summons now they sat face to face outside the turret clinging to the stones and her long hair flowed outwards on the gale  i did it eddo she said to save one whom i love and him whom she loves i did it to avenge the death of nya upon you all as she bade me to do i did it because the cup of thy wickedness is full and because i was appointed to bring thy doom upon thee thus ends the greatness thou hast plotted so many years to win eddo  aye he answered thus it ends for the magic of the white one there has overcome me and thus with it ends the reign of the ghost kings and the forest wherein they reigned and thus too thou endest traitress who hast murdered them and whose soul shall be spilt with their souls  as the words left his lips suddenly eddo sprang upon noie and gripped her about the middle richard and rachel leapt forward but before ever they could lay a hand upon her to save her the dwarf in his rage and agony had dragged her to the edge of the wall for a moment they struggled there in the vivid light of the flaming forest then eddo screamed aloud one wild savage shriek and still holding noie in his arms hurled himself from the wall to fall crushed upon its foundation stones sixty feet beneath  thus perished noie who for loves sake gave her life to save rachel as once rachel had saved her                                       it was morning and after the tempest the sky was clear and cool for heavy rain had fallen when the wind dropped although far away the dense clouds of rolling smoke showed where the great fire still ate into the heart of the forest rachel and richard seated hand in hand in the little tower on the wall looked at one another in that pure light and saw signs in each others face that could not be mistaken  what shall we do asked richard death is very near to us  rachel thought awhile then answered  the dwarfs are gone we have nothing more to fear from them yonder where the fire did not burn dwell their slaves whose villages are full of food and beyond them live the umkulu who know and would befriend me let us go and seek food who desire to live on together if we may  so they climbed down the wall and with difficulty for they were very feeble crawled over the stones which they had piled up in the passage to keep out the dwarfs and thus passed to the open belt beyond a strange scene met their eyes all the wide lands that had been covered with giant trees were now piled over with white ashes amongst which here and there stood a black and smouldering

towards evening they went out of the town and standing on a mound looked at the firewasted plain behind and the green grassy slopes in front  they seemed quite alone in the world those two and yet their hearts were full of joy and thankfulness for while they were left to each other they knew that they could never be alone  see rachel said richard pointing to the smouldering wreck of the forest there lies our past and here in front of us spreads the future clothed with flowers  yes richard she answered but noie and all whom i love save you are buried in that past and in front of us the desert is not far away  life is ours rachel and love is ours and that which saved us through many a danger and brought me back to you will surely keep us safe do you fear to pass the desert at my side  she looked at him with shining eyes and answered  no richard i fear no more for now i seem to hear the voice of noie speaking in my heart telling me that trouble is behind us and that we shall live out our lives together as my mother foresaw that we should do  and there on the mound standing between that dead sea of ashes and the green slopes of flowering plain rachel stretched out her arms to the man to whom she was decreed
