brae     introduction  when the english publishers read a window in thrums in manuscript they thought it unbearably sad and begged me to alter the end  they warned me that the public do not like sad books  well the older i grow and the sadder the things i see the more do i wish my books to be bright and hopeful but an author may not always interfere with his story and if i had altered the end of a window in thrums i think i should never have had any more respect for myself  it is a sadder book to me than it can ever be to anyone else  i see jess at her window looking for the son who never came back as no other can see her and i knew that unless i brought him back in time the book would be a pain to me all my days but the thing had to be done  i think there are softhearted readers here and there who will be glad to know that there never was any jess  there is a little house still standing at the top of the brae which can be identified as her house i chose it for her though i was never in it myself but it is only the places in my books about thrums that may be identified  the men and women with indeed some very subsidiary exceptions who now and again cross the square are entirely imaginary and jess is of them  but anything in her that was rare or beautiful she had from my mother the imaginary woman came to me as i looked into the eyes of the real one and as it is the love of mother and son that has written everything of mine that is of any worth it was natural that the awful horror of the untrue son should dog my thoughts and call upon me to paint the picture  that i believe now though i had no idea of it at the time is how a window in thrums came to be written less by me than by an impulse from behind  and so it wrote itself very quickly  i have read that i rewrote it eight times but it was written once only nearly every chapter i think at a sitting     a window in thrums   chapter i  the house on the brae  on the bump of green round which the brae twists at the top of the brae and within cry of tnowhead farm still stands a onestorey house whose whitewashed walls streaked with the discoloration that rain leaves look yellow when the snow comes  in the old days the stiff ascent left thrums behind and where is now the making of a suburb was only a poor row of dwellings and a manse with hendrys cot to watch the brae  the house stood bare without a shrub in a garden whose paling did not go all the way round the potato pit being only kept out of the road that here sets off southward by a broken dyke of stones and earth  on each side of the slatecoloured door was a window of knotted glass  ropes were flung over the thatch to keep the roof on in wind  into this humble abode i would take any one who cares to accompany me but you must not come in a contemptuous mood thinking that the poor are but a stage removed from beasts of burden as some cruel writers of these days say nor will i have you turn over with your foot the shabby horsehair chairs that leeby kept so speckless and hendry weaved for years to buy and jess so loved to look upon  i speak of the chairs but if we go together into the room they will not be visible to you  for a long time the house has been to let here on the left of the doorway as we enter is the room without a shred of furniture in it except the boards of two closedin beds  the flooring is not steady and here and there holes have been eaten into the planks  you can scarcely stand upright beneath the decaying ceiling  worn boards and ragged walls and the rusty ribs fallen from the fireplace are all that meet your eyes but i see a round unsteady waxclothcovered table with four books lying at equal distances on it  there are six prim chairs two of them not to be sat upon backed against the walls and between the window and the fireplace a chest of drawers with a snowy coverlet  on the drawers stands a board with coloured marbles for the game of solitaire and i have only to open the drawer with the loose handle to bring out the dambrod  in the carved wood frame over the window hangs jamies portrait in the only other frame a picture of daniel in the den of lions sewn by leeby in wool  over the chimneypiece with its shells in which the roar of the sea can be heard are strung three rows of birds eggs  once again we might be expecting company to tea  the passage is narrow  there is a square hole between the rafters and a ladder leading up to it  you may climb and look into the attic as jess liked to hear me call my tiny garretroom  i am stiffer now than in the days when i lodged with jess during the summer holiday i am trying to bring back and there is no need for me to ascend  do not laugh at the newspapers with which leeby papered the garret nor at the yarn hendry stuffed into the windy holes  he did it to warm the house for jess  but the paper must have gone to pieces and the yarn rotted decades ago  i have kept the kitchen for the last as jamie did on the dire day of which i shall have to tell  it has a flooring of stone now where there used only to be hard earth and a broken pane in the window is indifferently stuffed with rags  but it is the other window i turn to with a pain at my heart and pride and fondness too the square foot of glass where jess sat in her chair and looked down the brae  illustration the square foot of glass where jess sat in her chair and looked down the brae  ah that brae  the history of tragic little thrums is sunk into it like the stones it swallows in the winter  we have all found the brae long and steep in the spring of life  do you remember how the child you once were sat at the foot of it and wondered if a new world began at the top  it climbs from a shallow burn and we used to sit on the brig a long time before venturing to climb  as boys we ran up the brae  as men and women young and in our prime we almost forgot that it was there  but the autumn of life comes and the brae grows steeper then the winter and once again we are as the child pausing apprehensively on the brig  yet are we no longer the child we look now for no new world at the top only for a little garden and a tiny house and a handloom in the house  it is only a garden of kail and potatoes but there may be a line of daisies white and red on each side of the narrow footpath and honeysuckle over the door  life is not always hard even after backs grow bent and we know that all braes lead only to the grave  this is jesss window  for more than twenty years she had not been able to go so far as the door and only once while i knew her was she ben in the room  with her husband hendry or their only daughter leeby to lean upon and her hand clutching her staff she took twice a day when she was strong the journey between her bed and the window where stood her chair  she did not lie there looking at the sparrows or at leeby redding up the house and i hardly ever heard her complain all the sewing was done by her she often baked on a table pushed close to the window and by leaning forward she could stir the porridge leeby was seldom off her feet but i do not know that she did more than jess who liked to tell me when she had a moment to spare that she had a terrible lot to be thankful for  to those who dwell in great cities thrums is only a small place but what a clatter of life it has for me when i come to it from my schoolhouse in the glen  had my lot been cast in a town i would no doubt have sought country parts during my september holiday but the schoolhouse is quiet even when the summer takes brakes full of sportsmen and others past the top of my footpath and i was always lighthearted when craigiebuckles cart bore me into the din of thrums i only once stayed during the whole of my holiday at the house on the brae but i knew its inmates for many years including jamie the son who was a barber in london  of their ancestry i never heard  with us it was only some of the articles of furniture or perhaps a snuffmull that had a genealogical tree  in the house on the brae was a great kettle called the boiler that was said to be fifty years old in the days of hendrys grandfather of whom nothing more is known  jesss chair which had carved arms and a seat stuffed with rags had been snecky hobarts fathers before it was hers and old snecky bought it at a roup in the tenements  jesss rarest possession was perhaps the christening robe that even people at a distance came to borrow  her mother could count up a hundred persons who had been baptized in it  every one of the hundred i believe is dead and even i cannot now pick out jess and hendrys grave but i heard recently that the christening robe is still in use  it is strange that i should still be left after so many changes one of the three or four who can today stand on the brae and point out jesss window  the little window commands the incline to the point where the brae suddenly jerks out of sight in its climb down into the town  the steep path up the commonty makes for this elbow of the brae and thus whichever way the traveller takes it is here that he comes first into sight of the window  here too those who go to the town from the south get their first glimpse of thrums  carts pass up and down the brae every few minutes and there comes an occasional gig  seldom is the brae empty for many live beyond the top of it now and men and women go by to their work children to school or play  not one of the children i see from the window today is known to me and most of the men and women i only recognize by their likeness to their parents  that sweetfaced old woman with the shawl on her shoulders may be one of the girls who was playing at the game of palaulays when jamie stole into thrums for the last time the man who is leaning on the commonty gate gathering breath for the last quarter of the brae may as a barefooted callant have been one of those who chased cree queery past the poorhouse  i cannot say but this i know that the grandparents of most of these boys and girls were once young with me  if i see the sons and daughters of my friends grown old i also see the grandchildren spinning the peerie and hunkering at idreeidreeidroppititas we did so long ago  the world remains as young as ever  the lovers that met on the commonty in the gloaming are gone but there are other lovers to take their place and still the commonty is here  the sun had sunk on a fine day in june early in the century when hendry and jess newly married he in a rich moleskin waistcoat she in a white net cap walked to the house on the brae that was to be their home  so jess has told me  here again has been just such a day and somewhere in thrums there may be just such a couple setting out for their home behind a horse with white ears instead of walking but with the same hopes and fears and the same love light in their eyes  the world does not age  the hearse passes over the brae and up the straight buryingground road but still there is a cry for the christening robe  jesss window was a beacon by night to travellers in the dark and it will be so in the future when there are none to remember jess  there are many such windows still with loving faces behind them  from them we watch for the friends and relatives who are coming back and some alas watch in vain  not every one returns who takes the elbow of the brae bravely or waves his handkerchief to those who watch from the window with wet eyes and some return too late  to jess at her window always when she was not in bed things happy and mournful and terrible came into view  at this window she sat for twenty years or more looking at the world as through a telescope and here an awful ordeal was gone through after her sweet untarnished soul had been given back to god     chapter ii  on the track of the minister  on the afternoon of the saturday that carted me and my two boxes to thrums i was ben in the room playing hendry at the dambrod  i had one of the room chairs but leeby brought a chair from the kitchen for her father  our door stood open and as hendry often pondered for two minutes with his hand on a man i could have joined in the gossip that was going on but the house  ay weel then leeby said jess suddenly ill warrant the minister ll no be preachin the morn  this took leeby to the window  yea yea she said and i knew she was nodding her head sagaciously i looked out at the room window but all i could see was a man wheeling an empty barrow down the brae  thats robbie tosh continued leeby an theres nae doot at hes makkin for the ministers for he has on his black coat  hell be to row the ministers luggage to the postcart  ay an thats davit lunnans barrow  i ken it by the shafts bein spliced wi yarn davit broke the

haen a puddin for the supper the nicht  thats a michty genteel thing ive heard  it turned out that jess was right in every particular     chapter iii  preparing to receive company  leeby was at the fire brandering a quarter of steak on the tongs when the house was flung into consternation by hendrys casual remark that he had seen tibbie mealmaker in the town with her man  the lord preservs cried leeby  jess looked quickly at the clock  half fower she said excitedly  then it canna be dune said leeby falling despairingly into a chair for they may be here ony meenute  its most michty said jess turning on her husband at ye should tak a pleasure in bringin this hoose to disgrace  hoo did ye no tells suner  i fair forgot hendry answered but whats a yer steer  jess looked at me she often did this in a way that meant what a man is this im tied to  steer she exclaimed  ist no time we was makkin a steer  theyll be in for their tea ony meenute an the room no sae muckle as sweepit ay an me lookin like a sweep an tibbie mealmaker ats sae partikler genteel seein you sic a sicht as ye are  jess shook hendry out of his chair while leeby began to sweep with the one hand and agitatedly to unbutton her wrapper with the other  she didna see me said hendry sitting down forlornly on the table  get aff that table cried jess  see haud o the besom she said to leeby  for mercys sake mother said leeby gie yer face a dicht an put on a clean mutch  ill open the door if they come afore youre ready said hendry as leeby pushed him against the dresser  ye daur to speak aboot openinthe door an you sic a mess cried jess with pins in her mouth  havers retorted hendry  a man canna be aye washin at imsel  seeing that hendry was as much in the way as myself i invited him upstairs to the attic whence we heard jess and leeby upbraiding each other shrilly  i was aware that the room was speckless but for all that leeby was turning it upside down  shes aye taen like that hendry said to me referring to his wife when shes expectin company  ay its a peety she canna tak things cannier  tibbie mealmaker must be some one of importance i asked  ou shes naething by the ordnar but ye see she was mairit to a tilliedrum man no lang syne an theyre said to hae a michty grand establishment  ay theyve a wardrobe spleet new an what think ye tibbie wears ilka day  i shook my head  it was chirsty miller at put it through the toon henry continued chirsty was in tilliedrum last teisday or wednesday an tibbie gae her a cup o tea  ay weel tibbie telt chirsty at she wears hose ilka day  wears hose  ay  its some michty grand kind o stockin  i never heard ot in this toon  na theres naebody in thrums at wears hose  and who did tibbie get i asked for in thrums they say wha did she get and wha did he tak  his names davit curly  ou a crittur fu o maggots an nae great match for hes juist the tilliedrum billsticker  at this moment jess shouted from her chair she was burnishing the society teapot as she spoke mind hendry mcqumpha at upon nae condition are you to mention the billstickin afore tibbie  tibbie hendry explained to me is a terrible vain tid an doesna think the billstickin genteel  ay they say at if she meets davit in the street wi his pastepot an the brush in his hands she pretends no to ken im  every time jess paused to think she cried up orders such as  dinna call her tibbie mind ye  always address her as mistress curly  shak hands wi baith o them an say ye hope theyre in the enjoyment o guid health  dinna put yer feet on the table  mind youre no to mention at ye kent they were in the toon  when onybody passes ye yer tea say thank ye  dinna stir yer tea as if ye was churnin butter nor let on at the scones is no our am bakin  if tibbie says onything aboot the china yer no to say at we dinna use it ilka day  dinna lean back in the big chair for its broken an leebys gien it a lick o glue this meenute  when leeby gies ye a kick aneath the table thatll be a sign to ye to say grace  hendry looked at me apologetically while these instructions came up  i winna dive my head wi sic nonsense he said its no for a man body to be sae crammed fu o manners  come awa doon jess shouted to him an put on a clean dickey  ill better dot to please her said hendry though for my ain part i dinna like the feel o a dickey on weekdays  na they maks think its the sabbath  ten minutes afterwards i went downstairs to see how the preparations were progressing  fresh muslin curtains had been put up in the room the grand footstool worked by leeby was so placed that tibbie could not help seeing it and a fine cambric handkerchief of which jess was very proud was hanging out of a drawer as if by accident  an antimacassar lying carelessly on the seat of a chair concealed a rent in the horsehair and the china ornaments on the mantelpiece were so placed that they looked whole  leebys black merino was hanging near the window in a good light and jesss sabbath bonnet which was never worn occupied a nail beside it  the teathings stood on a tray in the kitchen bed whence they could be quickly brought into the room just as if they were always ready to be used daily  leeby as yet in deshabille was shaving her father at a tremendous rate and jess looking as fresh as a daisy was ready to receive the visitors  she was peering through the tiny windowblind looking for them  be cautious leeby hendry was saying when jess shook her hand at him  wheesht she whispered theyre comin  hendry was hustled into his sabbath coat and then came a tap at the door a very genteel tap  jess nodded to leeby who softly shoved hendry into the room  the tap was repeated but leeby pushed her father into a chair and thrust barrows sermons open into his hand  then she stole but the house and swiftly buttoned her wrapper speaking to jess by nods the while  there was a third knock whereupon jess said in a loud englishy voice  was that not a chap knock at the door  hendry was about to reply but she shook her fist at him  next moment leeby opened the door  i was upstairs but i heard jess say  dear me if its not mrs curlyand mr curly  and hoo are ye  come in by  weel this is indeed a pleasant surprise     chapter iv  waiting for the doctor  jess had gone early to rest and the door of her bed in the kitchen was pulled to  from her window i saw hendry buying dulse  now and again the dulseman wheeled his slimy boxes to the top of the brae and sat there stolidly on the shafts of his barrow  many passed him by but occasionally some one came to rest by his side  unless the customer was loquacious there was no bandying of words and hendry merely unbuttoned his easttrouser pocket giving his body the angle at which the pocket could be most easily filled by the dulseman  he then deposited his halfpenny and moved on  neither had spoken yet in the country they would have roared their predictions about tomorrow to a ploughman half a field away  dulse is roasted by twisting it round the tongs fired to a redheat and the house was soon heavy with the smell of burning seaweed  leeby was at the dresser munching it from a brothplate while hendry on his knees at the fireplace gingerly tore off the blades of dulse that were sticking to the tongs and licked his singed fingers  whaurs yer mother he asked leeby  ou said leeby whaur would she be but in her bed  hendry took the tongs to the door and would have cleaned them himself had not leeby who often talked his interfering ways over with her mother torn them from his hands  leeby cried jess at that moment  ay answered leeby leisurely not noticing as i happened to do that jess spoke in an agitated voice  what ist asked hendry who liked to be told things  he opened the door of the bed  yer mothers no weel he said to leeby  leeby ran to the bed and i went ben the house  in another two minutes we were a group of four in the kitchen staring vacantly  death could not have startled us more tapping thrice that quiet night on the windowpane  its diphtheria said jess her hands trembling as she buttoned her wrapper  she looked at me and leeby looked at me  its no its no cried leeby and her voice was as a fist shaken at my face  she blamed me for hesitating in my reply  but ever since this malady left me a lonely dominie for life diphtheria has been a knockdown word for me  jess had discovered a great white spot on her throat  i knew the symptoms  ist dangerous asked hendry who once had a headache years before and could still refer to it as a reminiscence  them at has t never recovers said jess sitting down very quietly a stick fell from the fire and she bent forward to replace it  they do recover cried leeby again turning angry eyes on me  i could not face her i had known so many who did not recover  she put her hand on her mothers shoulder  mebbe ye would be better in yer bed suggested hendry  no one spoke  when i had the headache said hendry i was better in my bed  leeby had taken jesss handa worn old hand that had many a time gone out in love and kindness when younger hands were cold  poets have sung and fighting men have done great deeds for hands that never had such a record  if ye could eat something said hendry i would gae to the fleshers for t  i mind when i had the headache hoo a small steak  gae awa for the doctor rayther broke in leeby  jess started for sufferers think there is less hope for them after the doctor has been called in to pronounce sentence  i winna hae the doctor she said anxiously  in answer to leebys nods hendry slowly pulled out his boots from beneath the table and sat looking at them preparatory to putting them on  he was beginning at last to be a little scared though his face did not show it  i winna hae ye cried jess getting to her feet gaen to the doctors sic a sicht  yer coats a yarn  havers said hendry but jess became frantic  i offered to go for the doctor but while i was upstairs looking for my bonnet i heard the door slam  leeby had become impatient and darted off herself buttoning her jacket probably as she ran  when i returned to the kitchen jess and hendry were still by the fire hendry was beating a charred stick into sparks and his wife sat with her hands in her lap  i saw hendry look at her once or twice but he could think of nothing to say  his terms of endearment had died out thirtynine years before with his courtship  he had forgotten the words  for his life he could not have crossed over to jess and put his arm round her  yet he was uneasy  his eyes wandered round the poorly lit room  will ye hae a drink o watter he asked  there was a sound of footsteps outside  thatll be him said hendry in a whisper  jess started to her feet and told hendry to help her ben the house  the steps died away but i fancied that jess now highly strung had gone into hiding and i went after her  i was mistaken  she had lit the room lamp turning the crack in the globe to the wall  the sheepskin hearthrug which was generally carefully packed away beneath the bed had been spread out before the empty fireplace and jess was on the armchair hurriedly putting on her grand black mutch with the pink flowers  i was juist makkin mysel respectable she said but without life in her voice  this was the only time i ever saw her in the room  leeby returned panting to say that the doctor might be expected in an hour  he was away among the hills  the hour passed reluctantly  leeby lit a fire ben the house and then put on her sabbath dress  she sat with her mother in the room  never before had i seen jess sit so quietly for her way was to work until as she said herself she was ready to fall into her bed  hendry wandered between the two rooms always in the way when leeby ran to the window to see if that was the doctor at last  he would stand gaping in the middle of the room for five minutes then slowly withdraw to stand as drearily but the house  his face lengthened  at last he sat down by the kitchen fire a bible in his hand  it lay open on his knee but he did not read much  he sat there with his legs outstretched looking straight before him  i believe he saw jess young again  his face was very solemn and his mouth twitched  the fire sank into ashes unheeded  i sat alone at my attic window for hours waiting for the doctor  from the attic i could see nearly all thrums but until very late the night was dark and the brae except immediately before the door was blurred and dim  a sheet of light canopied the square as long as a cheap jack paraded his goods there  it was gone before the moon came out  figures tramped tramped up the brae passed the house in shadow and stole silently on  a man or boy whistling seemed to fill the valley  the moon arrived too late to be of service to any wayfarer everybody in thrums was asleep but ourselves and the doctor who never came  about midnight hendry climbed the attic stair and joined me at the window  his hand was shaking as he pulled back the blind  i began to realize that his heart could still overflow  shes waur he whispered like one who had lost his voice  for a long time he sat silently his hand on the blind  he was so different from the hendry i had known that i felt myself in the presence of a strange man  his eyes were glazed with staring at the turn of the brae where the doctor must first come into sight  his breathing became heavier till it was a gasp  then i put my hand on his shoulder and he stared at me  nineandthirty years come june he said speaking to himself  for this length of time i knew he and jess had been married  he repeated the words at intervals  i mind he began and stopped  he was thinking of the springtime of jesss life  the night ended as we watched then came the terrible moment that precedes the daythe moment known to shuddering watchers by sickbeds when a chill wind cuts through the house and the world without seems cold in death  it is as if the heart of the earth did not mean to continue beating  this is a fearsome nicht hendry said hoarsely  he turned to grope his way to the stairs but suddenly went down on his knees to pray     there was a quick step outside  i arose in time to see the doctor on the brae  he tried the latch but leeby was there to show him in  the door of the room closed on him  from the top of the stair i could see into the dark passage and make out hendry shaking at the door  i could hear the doctors voice but not the words he said  there was a painful silence and then leeby laughed joyously  its gone cried jess the white spots gone  ye juist touched it an its gone  tell hendry  but hendry did not need to be told  as jess spoke i heard him say huskily thank god and then he tottered back to the kitchen  when the doctor left hendry was still on jesss armchair trembling like a man with the palsy  ten minutes afterwards i was preparing for bed when he cried up the stair  come awa doon  i joined the family party in the room hendry was sitting close to jess  let us read he said firmly in the fourteenth of john     chapter v  a humorist on his calling  after the eight oclock bell had rung hendry occasionally crossed over to the farm of tnowhead and sat on the pigsty  if no one joined him he scratched the pig and returned home gradually  here what was almost a club held informal meetings at which two or four or even half a dozen assembled to debate when there was any one to start them the meetings were only memorable when tammas haggart was in fettle to pronounce judgments in his wellknown sarcastic way  sometimes we had got off the pigsty to separate before tammas was properly yoked there we might remain a long time planted round him like trees for he was a mesmerising talker  there was a pail belonging to the pigsty which some one would turn bottom upwards and sit upon if the attendance was unusually numerous tammas liked however to put a foot on it now and again in the full swing of a harangue and when he paused for a sarcasm i have seen the pail kicked toward him  he had the wave of the arm that is so convincing in argument and such a natural way of asking questions that an audience not used to public speaking might have thought he wanted them to reply  it is an undoubted fact that when he went on the platform at the time of the election to heckle the colonel he paused in the middle of his questions to take a drink out of the tumbler of water which stood on the table  as soon as they saw what he was up to the spectators raised a ringing cheer  on concluding his perorations tammas sent his snuffmull round but we had our own way of passing him a vote of thanks  one of the company would express amazement at his gift of words and the others would add man man or ye cow tammas or what a crittur ye are all which ejaculations meant the same thing  a new subject being thus ingeniously introduced tammas again put his foot on the pail  i tak no creedit he said modestly on the evening i remember of willie pyatts funeral in bein able to speak wi a sort o faceelity on topics at ive made my ain  ay said tnowhead but its no the faceelity o speakin at taks me  theres davit lunan at can speak like as if he had learned it aff a paper an yet i canna thole im  davit said hendry doesna speak in a wy at a body can follow im he doesna gae even on  jess says hes juist like a man ay at the crossroads an no sure o his wy  but the stock has words an no ilka body has that  if i was bidden to put tammass gift in a word said tnowhead i would say at he had a wy  thats what i would say  weel i suppose i have tammas admitted but wy or no wy i couldna put a point on my words if it wasna for my sense o humour  lads humours what gies the nip to speakin  its what maks ye a sarcesticist tammas said hendry but what i wonder at is yer sayin the humorous things sae aisy like  some says ye mak them up aforehand but i ken thats no true  no only ist no true said tammas but it couldna be true  them at says sic things an weel i ken youre meanin davit lunan hasna nae idea o what humour is  its a think at spouts oot o its ain accord some of the maist humorous things ive ever said cam oot as a body may say by themsels  i suppose thats the case said tnowhead an yet it maun be you at brings them up  theres no nae doubt aboot its bein the case said tammas for ive watched mysel often  there was a vara guid instance occurred sune after i married easie  the earls son met me one day aboot that time i the tenements and he didna ken at chirsty was deid an id married again  well haggart he says in his frank wy and how is your wife  shes vara weel sir i maks answer but shes no the ane you mean  na he meant chirsty said hendry  is that a the story asked tnowhead  tammas had been looking at us queerly  theres no nane o ye lauchin he said but i can assure ye the earls son gaed east the toon lauchin like onything  but what wast he lauched at  ou said tammas a humorist doesna tell whaur the humour comes in  no but when you said that did you mean it to be humorous  am no sayin i did but as ive been tellin ye humour spouts oot by itsel  ay but do ye ken noo what the earls son gaed awa lauchin at  tammas hesitated  i dinna exactly seet he confessed but thats no an oncommon thing  a humorist would often no ken at he was ane if it wasna by the wy he makes other fowk lauch  a body canna be expeckit baith to mak the joke an to seet  na that would be doin twa fowks wark  weel thats reasonable enough but i have often seen ye lauchin said hendry lang afore other fowk lauched  nae doubt tammas explained an thats because humour has twa sides juist like a penny piece  when i say a humorous thing mysel im dependent on other fowk to tak note o the humour ot bein mysel taen up wi the makkin ot  ay but theres things i see an hear at maks me lauch an thats the other side o humour  i never heard it put sae plain afore said tnowhead an sal am no nane sure but what am a humorist too  na na no you tnowhead said tammas hotly  weel continued the farmer i never set up for bein a humorist but i can juist assure ye at i lauch at queer things too  no lang syne i woke up i my bed lauchin like onything an lisbeth thocht i wasna weel  it was something i dreamed at made me lauch i couldna think what it was but i laughed richt  was that no fell like a humorist  that was neither here nor there said tammas  na dreams dinna coont for were no responsible for them  ay an whats mair the mere lauchins no the important side o humour even though ye hinna to be telt to lauch  the important sides the other side the sayin the humorous things  ill tell ye what the humorists like a man firin at a targethe doesna ken whether he hits or no till them at the target tells im  i would be of opeenion said hendry who was one of tammass most staunch admirers at another mark o the rale humorist was his seein humour in all things  tammas shook his heada way he had when hendry advanced theories  i dinna haud wi that ava he said  i ken fine at davit lunan gaes aboot sayin he sees humour in everything but theres nae surer sign at hes no a genuine humorist  na the rale humorist kens vara weel at theres subjects withoot a spark o humour in them  when a subject rises to the sublime it should be regairded philosophically an no humorously  davit would lauch at the grandest thochts whaur they only fill the true humorist wi awe  ive found it necessary to rebuke im at times whaur his lauchin was oot o place  he pretended aince on this vara spot to see humour i the origin o cockfightin  did he man said hendry i wasna here  but what is the origin o cockfechtin  it was a i the cheap magazine said tnowhead  was i sayin it wasna demanded tammas  it was through me readin the account oot o the cheap magazine at the discussion arose  but what said the cheapy was the origin o cockfechtin  tnowhead ll tell ye answered tammas he says i dinna ken  i never said naething o the kind returned tnowhead indignantly i mind o ye readint oot fine  ay weel said tammas thats a richt  ou the origin o cockfightin gangs back to the time o the greek wars a thoosand or twa years syne mair or less  there was ane miltiades by name at was the captain o the greek army an one day he led them doon the mountains to attack the biggest army at was ever gathered thegither  they were persians interposed tnowhead  are you tellin the story or am i asked tammas  i kent fine at they were persians  weel miltiades had the matter o twenty thoosand men wi im and when they got to the foot o the mountain behold there was two cocks fechtin  man man said hendry an was there cocks in thae days  ondoubtedly said tammas or hoo could thae twa hae been fechtin  ye have me there tammas admitted hendry  yere perfectly richt  ay then continued the stonebreaker when miltiades saw the cocks at it wi all their micht he stopped the army and addressed it behold he cried at the top o his voice these cocks do not fight for their household gods nor for the monuments of their ancestors nor for glory nor for liberty nor for their children but only because the one will not give way unto the other  it was nobly said declared hendry na cocks wouldna hae sae muckle understandin as to fecht for thae things  i wouldna wonder but what it was some laddies at set them at ane another  hendry doesna see what miltydes was after said tnowhead  yeve taent up wrang hendry tammas explained  what miltiades meant was at if cocks could fecht sae weel oot o mere deviltry surely the greeks would fecht terrible for their gods an their bairns an the other things  i see i see but what was the monuments of their ancestors  ou that was the gravestanes they put up i their kirkyards  i wonder the other billies would want to tak them awa  they would be a michty wecht  ay but they wanted them an natrally the greeks stuck to the stanes they paid for  so so an did davit lunan mak oot at there was humour in that  he do so  he said it was a humorous thing to think o a hale army lookin on at twa cocks fechtin  i assure ye i telt im at i saw nae humour int  it was ane o the most impressive sichts ever seen by man an the greeks was sae inspired by what miltiades said at they sweepit the persians oot o their country  we all agreed that tammass was the genuine humour  an an enviable possession it is said hendry  in a wy admitted tammas but no in a wys  he hesitated and then added in a low voice  as sure as death hendry it sometimes taks grip o me i the kirk itsel an i can hardly keep frae lauchin     chapter vi  dead this twenty years  in the lustiness of youth there are many who cannot feel that they too will die  the first fear stops the heart  even then they would keep death at arms length by making believe to disown him  loved ones are taken away and the boy the girl will not speak of them as if that made the conquerors triumph the less  in time the fire in the breast burns low and then in the last glow of the embers it is sweeter to hold to what has been than to think of what may be  twenty years had passed since joey ran down the brae to play  jess his mother shook her staff fondly at him  a cart rumbled by the driver nodding on the shaft  it rounded the corner and stopped suddenly and then a woman screamed  a handful of men carried joeys dead body to his mother and that was the tragedy of jesss life  twenty years ago and still jess sat at the window and still she heard that woman scream  every other living being had forgotten joey even to hendry he was now scarcely a name but there were times when jesss face quivered and her old arms went out for her dead boy  gods will be done she said but oh i grudged him my bairn terrible sair  i dinna want him back noo an ilka day is takkin me nearer to him but for mony a lang year i grudged him sair sair  he was juist five minutes gone an they brocht him back deid my joey  on the sabbath day jess could not go to church and it was then i think that she was with joey most  there was often a blessed serenity on her face when we returned that only comes to those who have risen from their knees with their prayers answered  then she was very close to the boy who died  long ago she could not look out from her window upon the brae but now it was her seat in church  there on the sabbath evenings she sometimes talked to me of joey  its been a fine day she would say juist like that day  i thank the lord for the sunshine noo but oh i thocht at the time i couldna look at the sun shinin again  in all thrums she has told me and i know it to be true theres no a better man than hendry  theres them ats cleverer in the wys o the world but my man hendry mcqumpha never did naething in all his life at wasna weel intended an though his words is common its to the lord he looks  i canna think but what hendrys pleasin to god oh i dinna ken what to say wi thankfulness to him when i mind hoo guid hes been to me  theres leeby at i couldna hae done withoot me bein sae silly weak bodily an ay leebys stuck by me an gien up her life as ye micht say for me  jamie  but then jess sometimes broke down  hes so far awa she said after a time an aye when he gangs back to london after his holidays he has a fear hell never see me again but hes terrified to mention it an i juist ken by the wy he taks haud o me an comes runnin back to tak haud o me again  i ken fine what hes thinkin but i daurna speak  guid is no word for what jamie has been to me but he wasna born till after joey died  when we got jamie hendry took to whistlin again at the loom an jamie juist filled joeys place to him  ay but naebody could fill joeys place to me  its different to a man  a bairns no the same to him but a fell bit o me was buried in my laddies grave  jamie an joey was never nane the same nature  it was aye something in a shop jamie wanted to be an he never cared muckle for his books but joey hankered after being a minister young as he was an a minister hendry an me would hae done our best to mak him  mony mony a time after he came in frae the kirk on the sabbath he would stand up at this very window and wave his hands in a reverent way juist like the minister  his first text was to be thou god seest me  yell wonder at me but ive sat here in the lang forenichts dreamin at joey was a grown man noo an at i was puttin on my bonnet to come to the kirk to hear him preach  even as far back as twenty years an mair i wasna able to gang aboot but joey would say to me well get a carriage to ye mother so at ye can come and hear me preach on thou god seest me  he would say to me it doesna do mother for the minister in the pulpit to nod to ony of die fowk but ill gie you a look an yell ken its me  oh joey i would hae gien you a look too an ye would hae kent what i was thinkin  he often said yell be proud o me will ye no mother when ye see me comin sailin alang to the pulpit in my gown  so i would hae been proud o him an i was proud to hear him speakin ot  the other fowk he said will be sittin in their seats wonderin what my texts to be but youll ken mother an youll turn up to thou god seest me afore i gie oot the chapter  ay but that day he was coffined for all the minister prayed i found it hard to say thou god seest me  its the text i like best noo though an when hendry an leeby is at the kirk i turnt up often often in the bible  i read frae the beginnin o the chapter but when i come to thou god seest me i stop  na its no at theres ony rebellion to the lord in my heart noo for i ken he was lookin doon when the cart gaed ower joey an he wanted to tak my laddie to himsel  but juist when i come to thou god seest me i let the book lie in my lap for aince a bodys sure o that theyre sure o all  ay yell laugh but i think mebbe juist because i was his mother at though joey never lived to preach in a kirk hes preached frae thou god seest me to me  i dinna ken at i would ever hae been sae sure o that if it hadna been for him an so i think i see im sailin doon to the pulpit juist as he said he would do  i seen him gien me the look he spoke oay he looks my wy first an i ken its him  naebody sees him but me but i see him gien me the look he promised  hes so terrible near me an him dead at wen my time comes ill be rale willin to go  i dinna say that to jamie because he all trembles but im auld noo an im no nane loth to gang  jesss staff probably had a history before it became hers for as known to me it was always old and black  if we studied them sufficiently we might discover that staves age perceptibly just as the hair turns grey  at the risk of being thought fanciful i dare to say that in inanimate objects as in ourselves there is honourable and shameful old age and that to me jesss staff was a symbol of the good the true  it rested against her in the window and she was so helpless without it when on her feet that to those who saw much of her it was part of herself  the staff was very short nearly a foot having been cut as i think she once told me herself from the original of which to make a porridge thieval or stick with which to stir porridge and in moving jess leant heavily on it  had she stood erect it would not have touched the floor  this was the staff that jess shook so joyfully at her boy the forenoon in may when he ran out to his death  joey however was associated in jesss memory with her staff in less painful ways  when she spoke of him she took the dwarf of a staff in her hands and looked at it softly  its hard to me she would say to believe at twa an twenty years hae come and gone since the nicht joey hod hid my staff  ay but hendry was straucht in thae days by what he is noo an jamie wasna born  twa an twenty years come the back end o the year an it wasna thocht at i could live through the winter  yell no last mair than anither month jess was what my sister bell said when she came to see me and yet here i am aye sittin at my window an bells been i the kirkyard this dozen years  leeby was saxteen month younger than joey an mair quiet like  her heart was juist set on helpin aboot the hoose an though she was but fower year auld she could kindle the fire an red up clean up the room  leebys been my savin ever since she was fower year auld  ay but it was joey at hung aboot me maist an he took notice at i wasna gaen out as i used to do  since sune after my marriage ive needed the stick but there was days at i could gang across the road an sit on a stane  joey kent there was something wrang when i had to gie that up an syne he noticed at i couldna even gang to the window unless hendry kind o carried me  na ye wouldna think at there could hae been days when hendry did that but he did  he was a sort o ashamed if ony o the neighbours saw him so affectionate like but he was terrible taen up aboot me  his loom was doon at tnowheads bells fathers an often he cam awa up to see if i was ony better  he didna lat on to the other weavers at he was comin to see what like i was  na he juist said hed forgotten a pirn or his cruizey lamp or ony thing  ah but he didna mak nae pretence o no carin for me aince he was inside the hoose  he came crawlin to the bed no to wauken me if i was sleepin an mony a time i made belief at i was juist to please him  it was an awfu business on him to hae a young wife sae helpless but he wasna the man to cast that at me  i mind o sayin to him one day in my bed ye made a poor bargain hendry when ye took me  but he says not one soul in thrums ll daur say that to me but yersel jess  na na my dawty youre the wuman o my choice theres juist one wuman i the warld to me an thats you my ain jess  twa an twenty years syne ay hendry called me fond like names thae no everyday names  what a straucht man he was  the doctor had said he could do no more for me an hendry was the only ane at didna gie me up  the bairns of course didna understan and joey would come into the bed an play on the top o me  hendry would hae taen him awa but i liked to hae im  ye see we war long married afore we had a bairn an though i couldna bear ony other weight on me joey didna hurt me somehoo  i liked to hae im so close to me  it was through that at he came to bury my staff  i couldna help often thinkin o what like the hoose would be when i was gone an aboot leeby an joey left so young  so when i could say it without greetin i said to joey at i was goin far awa an would he be a terrible guid laddie to his father and leeby when i was gone  he aye juist said dinna gang mother dinna gang but one day hendry came in frae his loom and says joey father whaurs my mother gaen to awa frae uset  i ll never forget hendrys face  his mooth juist opened an shut twa or three times an he walked quick ben to the room  i cried oot to him to come back but he didna come so i sent joey for him  joey came runnin back to me sayin mother mother am awfu fleid frightened for my fathers greetin sair  a thae things took a haud o joey an he ended in gien us a fleg fright  i was sleepin ill at the time an hendry was ben sleepin in the room wi leeby joey bein wi me  ay weel one nicht i woke up in the dark an put oot my hand to im an he wasna there  i sat up wi a terrible start an syne i kent by the cauld at the door maun be open  i cried oot quick to hendry but he was a soond sleeper an he didna hear me  ay i dinna ken hoo i did it but i got ben to the room an shook him up  i was near daft with fear when i saw leeby wasna there either  hendry couldna tak it in a at aince but sune he had his trousers on an he made me lie down on his bed  he said he wouldna move till i did it or i wouldna hae dune it  as sune as he was oot o the hoose crying their names i sat up in my bed listenin sune i heard speakin an in a minute leeby comes runnin in to me roarin an greetin  she was barefeeted and had juist her nichtgown on an her teeth was chatterin  i took her into the bed but it was an hour afore she could tell me onything she was in sic a state  sune after hendry came in carryin joey  joey was as naked as leeby and as cauld as lead but he wasna greetin  instead o that he was awfu satisfied like and for all hendry threatened to lick him he wouldna tell what he an leeby had been doin  he says though says he yell no gang awa noo mother no yell bide noo  my bonny laddie i didna fathom him at the time  it was leeby at i got it frae  ye see joey had never seen me gaen ony gait withoot my staff an he thocht if he hod it i wouldna be able to gang awa  ay he planned it all oot though he was but a bairn an lay watchin me in my bed till i fell asleep  syne he creepit oot o the bed an got the staff and gaed ben for leeby  she was fleid but he said it was the only wy to mak me at i couldna gang awa  it was juist ower there whaur thae cabbages is at he dug the hole wi a spade an buried the staff  hendry dug it up next mornin     chapter vii  the statement of tibbie birse  on a thursday pete lownie was buried and when hendry returned from the funeral jess asked if davit lunan had been there  na said hendry who was shut up in the closetbed taking off his blacks i heard tell he wasna bidden  yea yea said jess nodding to me significantly  ay weel she added well be haen tibbie ower here on saturday to deaves weary us to death aboot it  tibbie davits wife was sister to marget petes widow and she generally did visit jess on saturday night to talk about marget who was fast becoming one of the most fashionable persons in thrums tibbie was hopelessly plebeian  she was none of your proud kind and if i entered the kitchen when she was there she pretended not to see me so that if i chose i might escape without speaking to the like of her  i always grabbed her hand however in a frank way  on saturday tibbie made her appearance  from the rapidity of her walk and the way she was sucking in her mouth i knew that she had strange things to unfold  she had pinned a grey shawl about her shoulders and wore a black mutch over her dangling grey curls  its you tibbie i heard jess say as the door opened  tibbie did not knock not considering herself grand enough for ceremony and indeed jess would have resented her knocking  on the other hand when leeby visited tibbie she knocked as politely as if she were collecting for the precentors present  all this showed that we were superior socially to tibbie  ay hoo are ye jess tibbie said  muckle aboot it answered jess juist aff an on ay an hoo hae ye been yersel  ou said tibbie  i wish i could write ou as tibbie said it  with her it was usually a sentence in itself  sometimes it was a mere bark again it expressed indignation surprise rapture it might be a check upon emotion or a way of leading up to it and often it lasted for half a minute  in this instance it was i should say an intimation that if jess was ready tibbie would begin  so pete lownies gone said jess whom i could not see from ben the house  i had a good glimpse of tibbie however through the open doorways  she had the armchair on the south side as she would have said of the fireplace  hes awa assented tibbie primly  i heard the lid of the kettle dancing and then came a prolonged ou tibbie bent forward to whisper and if she had anything terrible to tell i was glad of that for when she whispered i heard her best  for a time only a murmur of words reached me distant music with an ou now and again that fired tibbie as the beating of his drum may rouse the martial spirit of a drummer  at last our visitor broke into an agitated whisper and it was only when she stopped whispering as she did now and again that i ceased to hear her  jess evidently put a question at times but so politely for she had on her best wrapper that i did not catch a word  though i should be struck deid this nicht tibbie whispered and the sibilants hissed between her few remaining teeth i wasna sae muckle as speired to the layin oot  there was mysy cruickshanks there an kitty wobster at was nae friends to the corpse to speak o but marget passed by me me at is her ain flesh an blood though it mayna be for the like o me to say it  its gospel truth jess i tell ye when i say at for all i ken officially as ye micht say pete lownie may be weel and hearty this day  if i was to meet marget in the face i couldna say he was deid though i ken at the wricht coffined him na an whats mair i wouldna gie marget the satisfaction o hearin me say it  no jess i tell ye i dinna pertend to be on an equalty wi marget but equalty or no equalty a body has her feelings an lat on at i ken petes gone i will not  eh  ou weel     na faags a na na  i ken my place better than to gang near marget i dinna deny at shes grand by me and her keeps a bakehoose o her ain an glad am i to see her doin sae weel but let me tell ye this jess pride goeth before a fall  yes it does its scripture ay its nae makup o mine its scripture  and this i will say though kennin my place at davit lunan is as dainty a man as is in thrums an theres no one ats better behaved at a bural being particularly wiselike presentable ins blacks an them spleet new  na na jess davit may hae his faults an tak a dram at times like anither but he would shame naebody at a bural an marget deleeberately insulted him no speirin him to petes  whats mair when the minister cried in to see me yesterday an me on the floor washin says he so margets lost her man an i said say ye so nae for let on at i kent and neither me at the laying oot nor davit lunan at the funeral i would not  david should hae gone to the funeral says the minister for i doubt not he was only omitted in the invitations by a mistake  ay it was weel meant but says i jess says i as lang as am livin to tak chairge o im davit lunan gangs to nae burals at hes no bidden to  an i tell ye i says to the minister if there was one body at had a richt to be at the bural o pete lownie it was davit lunan him bein my man an marget my ain sister  yes says i though am no o the boastin kind davit had maist richt to be there next to pete imsel  ou jess     this is no a maiter i like to speak aboot na i dinna care to mention it but the neighbours is natrally taen up aboot it and chirsty tosh was sayin what i would wager at marget hadna sent the minister to hint at davits bein overlookit in the invitations was juist an accident  losh losh jess to think at a woman could hae the michty assurance to mak a tool o the very minister  but sal as far as that gangs marget would do it an gae twice to the kirk next sabbath too but if she thinks shes to get ower me like that she taks me for a bigger fule than i tak her for  na na marget ye dinna draw my leg deceive me  ou no     mind ye jess i hae no desire to be friends wi marget  naething could be farrer frae my wish than to hae helpit in the layin oot o pete lownie an i assure ye davit wasna keen to gang to the bural if they dinna want me to their burals davit says they hae nae mair to do than to say sae  but i warn ye tibbie he says if theres a bural frae this hoose be it your bural or be it my bural not one o the family o lownies casts their shadows upon the corp  thae was the very words davit said to me as we watched the hearse frae the skylicht  ay he bore up wonderfu but he felt it jesshe felt it as i could tell by his takkin to drink again that very nicht  jess jess     margets getting waur an waur  ay ye may say so though ill say naething agin her mysel  of coorse am no on equalty wi her especially since she had the bell put up in her hoose  ou i hinna seen it mysel na i never gang near the hoose an as mony a body can tell ye when i do hae to gang that wy i mak my feet my friend  ay but as i was sayin margets sae grand noo at she has a bell in the house  as i understan theres a rope in the wast room an when ye pu it a bell rings in the east room  weel when marget has company at their tea in the wast room an they need mair watter or scones or onything she rises an rings the bell  syne jean the auldest lassie gets up frae the table an lifts the jug or the plates an gaes awa ben to the east room for whats wanted  ay its a wy o doin ats juist like the gentry but ill tell ye jess pete juist fair hated the soond o that bell an theres them at says it was the death o im to think o marget haen sic an establishment     na i hinna seen the mournin ive

mcquhatty at the bonnets a crape and three yairds o crape on the dress the which marget calls a costume     ay i wouldna wonder but what it was hale watter the morn for it looks michty like rain an if it is itll serve marget richt an mebbe bring doon her pride a wee  no at i want to see her humbled for in coorse shes grand by the like o me  ou but        chapter viii  a cloak with beads  on weekdays the women who passed the window were meagrely dressed mothers in draggled winsey gowns carrying infants that were armfuls of grandeur  the sabbath clothed every one in her best and then the women went by with their hands spread out  when i was with hendry cloaks with beads were the fashion and jess sighed as she looked at them  they were known in thrums as the eleven and a bits threepenny bits that being their price at kyowowys in the square  kyowowy means finicky and applied to the draper by general consent  no doubt it was very characteristic to call the cloaks by their market value in the glen my scholars still talk of their schoolbooks as the tupenny the fowerpenny the saxpenny  they finish their education with the tenpenny  jesss opportunity for handling the garments that others of her sex could finger in shops was when she had guests to tea  persons who merely dropped in and remained to tea got their meal as a rule in the kitchen  they had nothing on that jess could not easily take in as she talked to them  but when they came by special invitation the meal was served in the room the guests things being left on the kitchen bed jess not being able to go ben the house had to be left with the things  when the time to go arrived these were found on the bed just as they had been placed there but jess could now tell leeby whether they were imitation why bell elshioners feather went far round the bonnet and chirsty lownies reason for always holding her left arm fast against her side when she went abroad in the black jacket  ever since my hobarts eleven and a bit was left on the kitchen bed jess had hungered for a cloak with beads  mys was the very marrows of the one tnowheads wife got in dundee for tenandsixpence indeed we would have thought that lisbeths also came from kyowowys had not sanders elshioners sister seen her go into the dundee shop with tnowhead who was loth and hung about to discover what she was after  hendry was not quick at reading faces like tammas haggart but the wistful look on jesss face when there was talk of eleven and a bits had its meaning for him  theyre grand to look at no doubt i have heard him say to jess but theyre richt annoyin  that new wife o peter dickies had ane on in the kirk last sabbath an wi her sittin juist afore us i couldna listen to the sermon for tryin to count the beads  hendry made his way into these gossips uninvited for his opinions on dress were considered contemptible though he was worth consulting on material  jess and leeby discussed many things in his presence confident that his ears were not doing their work but every now and then it was discovered that he had been hearkening greedily  if the subject was dress he might then become a little irritating  oh theyre grand jess admitted they set a body aff oncommon  they would be no use to you said hendry for ye canna wear them except ootside  a body doesna buy cloaks to be wearin at them steady retorted jess  no no but you could never wear yours though ye had ane  i dinna want ane  theyre far ower grand for the like o me  theyre no nae sic thing  am thinkin yere juist as fit to wear an eleven and a bit as my hobart  weel mebbe i am but its oot o the queistion gettin ane theyre sic a price  ay an though we had the siller it would surely be an awfu like thing to buy a cloak at ye could never wear  ou but i dinna want ane  jess spoke so mournfully that hendry became enraged  its most michty he said at ye would gang an set yer heart on sic a completely useless thing  i hinna set my heart ont  dinna blether  yeve been speakin aboot thae eleven and a bits to leeby aff an on for twa month  then hendry hobbled off to his loom and jess gave me a look which meant that men are trying at the best once you are tied to them  the cloaks continued to turn up in conversation and hendry poured scorn upon jesss weakness telling her she would be better employed mending his trousers than brooding over an eleven and a bit that would have to spend its life in a drawer  an outsider would have thought that hendry was positively cruel to jess  he seemed to take a delight in finding that she had neglected to sew a button on his waistcoat his real joy however was the knowledge that she sewed as no other woman in thrums could sew  jess had a genius for making new garments out of old ones and hendry never tired of gloating over her cleverness so long as she was not present  he was always athirst for fresh proofs of it and these were forthcoming every day  sparing were his words of praise to herself but in the evening he generally had a smoke with me in the attic and then the thought of jess made him chuckle till his pipe went out  when he smoked he grunted as if in pain though this really added to the enjoyment  it doesna matter he would say to me what jess turns her hand to she can mak ony mortal thing  she doesna need nae teachin na juist gie her a guid look at onything be it clothes or furniture or in the bakin line its all the same to her  shell mak another exactly like it  ye canna beat her  her bannocks is so superior at a tilliedrum woman took to her bed after tastin them an when the lawyer has company his wife gets jess to mak some bannocks for her an syne pretends theyre her ain bakin  ay theres a story aboot that  one day the auld doctor him ats deid was at his tea at the lawyers an says the guidwife try the cakes mr riach theyre my own bakin  weel he was a fearsomely outspoken man the doctor an nae suner had he the bannock atween his teeth for he didna stop to swallowt than he says mistress geddie says he i wasna born on a sabbath  na na youre no the first grand leddy at has gien me bannocks as their ain bakin at was baked and fired by jess logan her ats hendry mcqumphas wife  ay they say the lawyers wife didna ken which wy to look she was that mortified  its juist the same wi sewin  theres wys o ornamentin christenin robes an the like ats kent to naebody but hersel an as for stockins weel though ive seen her mak sae mony she amazes me yet  i mind o a furry waistcoat i aince had  weel when it was fell dune do you think she gae it awa to some gaen aboot body vagrant  na she made it into a richt neat coat to jamie wha was a bit laddie at the time  when he grew out o it she made a slipbody ot for hersel  ay i dinna ken a the different things it became but the last time i saw it was ben in the room whaur shed covered a footstool wi t  yes jess is the cleverest crittur i ever saw  leebys handy but shes no a patch on her mother  i sometimes repeated these panegyrics to jess  she merely smiled and said that the men haver most terrible when they are not at their work  hendry tried jess sorely over the cloaks and a time came when only by exasperating her could he get her to reply to his sallies  wha wants an eleven an a bit she retorted now and again  its you at wants it said hendry promptly  did i ever say i wanted ane  what use could i hae fort  thats the queistion said hendry  ye canna gang the length o the door so ye would never be able to weart  ay weel replied jess ill never hae the chance o no bein able to weart for hooever muckle i wanted it i couldna get it  jesss infatuation had in time the effect of making hendry uncomfortable  in the attic he delivered himself of such sentiments as these  theres nae understandin a woman  theres jess at hasna her equal for cleverness in thrums man or woman an yet shes fair skeered about thae cloaks  aince a woman sets her mind on something to wear shes mair onreasonable than the stupidest man  ay it micht mak them humble to see hoo foolish they are syne  no but it doesna dot  if it was a thing to be useful noo i wouldna think the same ot but she could never weart  she kens she could never weart an yet shes juist as keen to haet  i dinna like to see her so wantin a thing an no able to get it but its an awfu sum eleven an a bit  he tried to argue with her further  if ye had eleven an a bit to fling awa he said ye dinna mean to tell me at ye would buy a cloak instead o cloth for a gown or flannel for petticoats or some useful thing  as sure as death said jess with unwonted vehemence if a cloak i could get a cloak i would buy  hendry came up to tell me what jess had said  its a michty infatooation he said but it shows hoo her hearts set on thae cloaks  aince ye had it he argued with her ye would juist hae to lock it awa in the drawers  ye would never even be seein t  ay would i said jess  i would often tak it oot an look at it ay an i would aye ken it was there  but naebody would ken ye had it but yersel said hendry who had a vague notion that this was a telling objection  would they no answered jess  it would be a through the toon afore nicht  weel all i can say said hendry is at yere terrible foolish to tak the want o sic a useless thing to heart  am no takkin t to heart retorted jess as usual  jess needed many things in her days that poverty kept from her to the end and the cloak was merely a luxury  she would soon have let it slip by as something unattainable had not hendry encouraged it to rankle in her mind  i cannot say when he first determined that jess should have a cloak come the money as it liked for he was too ashamed of his weakness to admit his project to me  i remember however his saying to jess one day  ill warrant you could mak a cloak yersel the marrows o thae eleven and a bits at half the price  it would cost said jess sax an saxpence exactly  the cloth would be five shillins an the beads a shillin  i have some braid at would do fine for the front but the buttons would be saxpence  yere sure o that  i ken fine for i got leeby to price the things in the shop  ay but it maun be ill to shape the cloaks richt  there was a queer cut aboot that ane peter dickies new wife had on  queer cut or no queer cut said jess i took the shape o my hobarts ane the day she was here at her tea an i could mak the identical ot for sax and sax  i dinna believet said hendry but when he and i were alone he told me theres no a doubt she could mak it  ye heard her say she had taen the shape  ay that shows shes rale set on a cloak  had jess known that hendry had been saving up for months to buy her material for a cloak she would not have let him do it  she could not know however for all the time he was scraping together his pence he kept up a ringdingdang about her folly  hendry gave jess all the wages he weaved except threepence weekly most of which went in tobacco and snuff  the dulseman had perhaps a halfpenny from him in the fortnight  i noticed that for a long time hendry neither smoked nor snuffed and i knew that for years he had carried a shilling in his snuffmull  the remainder of the money he must have made by extra work at his loom by working harder for he could scarcely have worked longer  it was one day shortly before jamies return to thrums that jess saw hendry pass the house and go down the brae when he ought to have come in to his brose  she sat at the window watching for him and by and by he reappeared carrying a parcel  whaur on earth hae ye been she asked an whats that youre carryin  did ye think it was an eleven an a bit said hendry  no i didna answered jess indignantly  then hendry slowly undid the knots of the string with which the parcel was tied  he took off the brown paper  theres yer cloth he said an heres one an saxpence for the beads an the buttons  while jess still stared he followed me ben the house  its a terrible haver he said apologetically but she had set her heart ont     chapter ix  the power of beauty  one evening there was such a gathering at the pigsty that hendry and i could not get a board to lay our backs against  circumstances had pushed pete elshioner into the place of honour that belonged by right of mental powers to tammas haggart and tammas was sitting rather sullenly on the bucket boring a hole in the pig with his sarcastic eye  pete was passing round a card and in time it reached me  with mr and mrs david alexanders compliments was printed on it and pete leered triumphantly at us as it went the round  weel what think ye he asked with a pretence at modesty  ou said tnowhead looking at the others like one who asked a question ou i think ay ay  the others seemed to agree with him all but tammas who did not care to tie himself down to an opinion  ou ay tnowhead continued more confidently it is so deceededly  yell no ken said pete chuckling what it means  na the farmer admitted na i canna say i exacly ken that  i ken though said tammas in his keen way  weel then what ist demanded pete who had never properly come under tammass spell  i ken said tammas  oot wit then  i dinna say its lyin on my tongue tammas replied in a tone of reproof but if yell juist speak awa aboot some other thing for a meenute or twa ill tell ye syne  hendry said that this was only reasonable but we could think of no subject at the moment so we only stared at tammas and waited  i fathomed it he said at last as sune as my een lichted ont its one o the bit cards at grand fowk slip aneath doors when they mak calls an their friends is no in  ay thats what it is  i dinna say yere wrang pete answered a little annoyed  ay weel lads of course david alexanders oor dite as we called im dite elshioner an thats his wy o signifyin to us at hes married  i assure ye said hendry dites doin the thing in style  ay we said that when the card arrived pete admitted  i kent said tammas at that was the wy grand fowk did when they got married  ive kent it a lang time  its no nae surprise to me  hes been lang in marryin hookey crewe said  he was thirty at martinmas said pete  thirty was he said hookey  man id buried twa wives by the time i was that age an was castin aboot for a third  i mind o them hendry interposed  ay hookey said the first twa was angels  there he paused  an sos the third he added in many respects  but whas the woman dites taen tnowhead or some one of the more silent members of the company asked of pete  ou we dinna ken wha she is answered pete but shell be some glasca lassie for hes there noo  look lads look at this  he sent this at the same time its her picture  pete produced the silhouette of a young lady and handed it round  what do ye think he asked  i assure ye said hookey  sal said hendry even more charmed dites done weel  lats see her in a better licht said tammas  he stood up and examined the photograph narrowly while pete fidgeted with his legs  fairish said tammas at last  ou ay no what i would selec mysel but a dainty bit stocky  ou a tasty crittury ay an shes weel in order  lads shes a fine stoot kimmer  i conseeder her a beauty said pete aggressively  shes a that said hendry  a i can say said hookey is at she taks me most michty  shes no a beauty tammas maintained na she doesna juist come up to that but i dinna deny but what shes weel faured  what taut do ye find wi her tammas asked hendry  conseedered critically said tammas holding the photograph at arms length i would say at shelets see noo ay i would say at shes defeecient in genteelity  havers said pete  na said tammas no when conseedered critically  ye see shes drawn lauchin an the genteel things no to lauch but juist to put on a bit smirk  ay thats the genteel thing  a smile they ca it interposed tnowhead  i said a smile continued tammas  then theres her waist  i say naething agin her waist speakin in the ordnar meanin but conseedered critically theres a want o suppleness as ye micht say aboot it  ay it doesna compare wi the waist o   here tammas mentioned a young lady who had recently married into a local county family  that was a pretty tiddy said hookey ou losh ay it made me a kind o queery to look at her  yere ower kyowowy particular tammas said pete  i may be pete tammas admitted but i maun say im fond o a bonnylooken wuman an no aisy to please na im natrally ane o the critical kind  its extrornar said tnowhead what a pooer beauty has  i mind when i was a callant readin aboot mary queen o scots till i was fair mad lads yes i was fair mad at her bein deid  ou i could hardly sleep at nichts for thinking o her  mary was spunky as weel as a beauty said hookey an thats the kind i like  lads what a persuasive tid she was  she got roond the men said hendry ay she turned them roond her finger  thats the warst o thae beauties  i dinna gainsay said tnowhead but what there was a little o the deevil in mary the crittur  here tnowhead chuckled and then looked scared  what mary needed said tammas was a strong man to manage her  ay man but its ill to manage thae beauties  they gie ye a glint o their een an syne whaur are ye  ah they can be managed said tammas complacently  theres naebody natrally safter wi a pretty stocky o a bit wumany than mysel but for a that if i had been marys man i would hae stood nane o her tantrums  na mary my lass i would hae said this winna do na na yere a bonny body but ye maun mind at mans the superior ay mans the lord o creation an so ye maun juist sing sma  thats hoo i would hae managed mary the speerity crittur at she was  ye would hae haen yer wark cut oot for ye tammas  ilka mornin pursued tammas i would hae said to her mary i would hae said whas to wear thae breeks the day you or me  ay syne i would hae ordered her to kindle the fire or if i had been the king of coorse i would hae telt her instead to ring the bell an hae the cloth laid for the breakfast  ay thats the wy to mak the like o mary respec ye  pete and i left them talking  he had written a letter to david alexander and wanted me to back it     chapter x  a magnum opus  two bibles a volume of sermons by the learned dr isaac barrow a few numbers of the cheap magazine that had strayed from dunfermline and a pilgrims progress were the works that lay conspicuous ben in the room  hendry had also a copy of burns whom he always quoted in the complete poem and a collection of legends in song and prose that leeby kept out of sight in a drawer  the weight of my box of books was a subject hendry was very willing to shake his head over but he never showed any desire to take off the lid  jess however was more curious indeed she would have been an omnivorous devourer of books had it not been for her conviction that reading was idling  until i found her out she never allowed to me that leeby brought her my books one at a time  some of them were novels and jess took about ten minutes to each  she confessed that what she read was only the last chapter owing to a consuming curiosity to know whether she got him  she read all the london part however of the heart of midlothian because london was where jamie lived and she and i had a discussion about it which ended in her remembering that thrums once had an author of its own  bring oot the book she said to leeby it was put awa i the bottom drawer ben i the room sax year syne an i sepad its there yet  leeby came but with a faded little book the title already rubbed from its shabby brown covers  i opened it and then all at once i saw before me again the man who wrote and printed it and died  he came hobbling up the brae so bent that his body was almost at right angles to his legs and his broken silk hat was carefully brushed as in the days when janet his sister lived  there he stood at the top of the brae panting  i was but a boy when jimsy duthie turned the corner of the brae for the last time with a score of mourners behind him  while i knew him there was no janet to run to the door to see if he was coming  so occupied was jimsy with the great affair of his life which was brewing for thirty years that his neighbours saw how he missed his sister better than he realized it himself  only his hat was no longer carefully brushed and his coat hung awry and there was sometimes little reason why he should go home to dinner  it is for the sake of janet who adored him that we should remember jimsy in the days before she died  jimsy was a poet and for the space of thirty years he lived in a great epic on the millennium  this is the book presented to me by jess that lies so quietly on my topmost shelf now  open it however and you will find that the work is entitled the millennium an epic poem in twelve books by james duthie  in the little hole in his wall where jimsy kept his books there was i have no doubtfor his effects were rouped before i knew him except by namea wellread copy of paradise lost  some people would smile perhaps if they read the two epics side by side and others might sigh for there is a great deal in the millennium that milton could take credit for  jimsy had educated himself after the idea of writing something that the world would not willingly let die came to him and he began his book before his education was complete  so far as i know he never wrote a line that had not to do with the millennium  he was ever a man sparing of his plural tenses and the millennium says has for have a vain word indeed which thrums would only have permitted as a poetical licence the one original character in the poem is the devil of whom jimsy gives a picture that is startling and graphic and received the approval of the auld licht minister  by trade jimsy was a printer a masterprinter with no one under him and he printed and bound his book ten copies in all as well as wrote it  to print the poem took him i dare say nearly as long as to write it and he set up the pages as they were written one by one  the book is only printed on one side of the leaf and each page was produced separately like a little handbill  those who may pick up the bookbut who will care to do sowill think that the author or his printer could not spellbut they would not do jimsy that injustice if they knew the circumstances in which it was produced  he had but a small stock of type and on many occasions he ran out of a letter  the letter e tried him sorely  those who knew him best said that he tried to think of words without an e in them but when he was baffled he had to use a little a or an o instead  he could print correctly but in the book there are a good many capital letters in the middle of words and sometimes there is a note of interrogation after alas or woes me because all the notes of exclamation had been used up  jimsy never cared to speak about his great poem even to his closest friends but janet told how he read it out to her and that his whole body trembled with excitement while he raised his eyes to heaven as if asking for inspiration that would enable his voice to do justice to his writing  so grand it was said janet that her stocking would slip from her fingers as he readand janets stockings that she was always knitting when not otherwise engaged did not slip from her hands readily  after her death he was heard by his neighbours reciting the poem to himself generally with his door locked  he is said to have declaimed part of it one still evening from the top of the commonty like one addressing a multitude and the idlers who had crept up to jeer at him fell back when they saw his face  he walked through them they told with his old body straight once more and a queer light playing on his face  his lips are moving as i see him turning the corner of the brae  so he passed from youth to old age and all his life seemed a dream except that part of it in which he was writing or printing or stitching or binding the millennium  at last the work was completed  it is finished he printed at the end of the last book  the task of thirty years is over  it is indeed over  no one ever read the millennium  i am not going to sentimentalize over my copy for how much of it have i read  but neither shall i say that it was written to no end  you may care to know the last of jimsy though in one sense he was blotted out when the last copy was bound  he had saved one hundred pounds by that time and being now neither able to work nor to live alone his friends cast about for a home for his remaining years  he was very spent and feeble yet he had the fear that he might be still alive when all his money was gone  after that was the workhouse  he covered sheets of paper with calculations about how long the hundred pounds would last if he gave away for board and lodgings ten shillings nine shillings seven and sixpence a week  at last with sore misgivings he went to live with a family who took him for eight shillings  less than a month afterwards he died     chapter xi  the ghost cradle  our dinnerhour was twelve oclock and hendry for a not incomprehensible reason called this meal his brose  frequently however while i was there to share the expense broth was put on the table with beef to follow in clean plates much to hendrys distress for the comfortable and usual practice was to eat the beef from the brothplates  jess however having three whole white plates and two cracked ones insisted on the meals being taken genteelly and her husband with a look at me gave way  half a pound o boiling beef an a penny bone was leebys almost invariable order when she dealt with the flesher and jess had always neighbours poorer than herself who got a plateful of the broth  she never had anything without remembering some old body who would be the better of a little of it  among those who must have missed jess sadly after she was gone was johnny proctor a halfwitted man who because he could not work remained straight at a time of life when most weavers male and female had lost some inches of their stature  for as far back as my memory goes johnny had got his brose three times a week from jess his custom being to walk in without ceremony and drawing a stool to the table tell leeby that he was now ready  one day however when i was in the garden putting some rings on a fishingwand johnny pushed by me with no sign of recognition on his face  i addressed him and after pausing undecidedly he ignored me  when he came to the door instead of flinging it open and walking in he knocked primly which surprised me so much that i followed him  is this whaur mistress mcqumpha lives he asked when leeby with a face ready to receive the minister himself came at length to the door  i knew that the gentility of the knock had taken both her and her mother aback  hoots johnny said leeby what havers this  come awa in  johnny seemed annoyed  is this whaur mistress mcqumpha lives he repeated  say at it is cried jess who was quicker in the uptake than her daughter  of course this is whaur mistress mcqumpha lives leeby then said as weel ye ken for ye had yer dinner here no twa hours syne  then said johnny mistress tullys compliments to her and would she kindly lend the christenin robe an also the teatray if the same be na needed  having delivered his message as instructed johnny consented to sit down until the famous christening robe and the tray were ready but he would not talk for that was not in the bond  jesss sweet face beamed over the compliment mrs tully known on ordinary occasions as jean mctaggart had paid her and after johnny had departed laden she told me how the tray which had a great bump in the middle came into her possession  yeve often heard me speak aboot the time when i was a lassie workin at the farm o the bog  ay that was afore me an hendry kent ane anither an i was as fleet on my feet in thae days as leeby is noo it was saml fletcher at was the farmer but he maun hae been gone afore you was mair than born  mebbe though ye ken at he was a terrible invalid an for the hinmost years o his life he sat in a muckle chair nicht an day  ay when i took his denner to im on that very tray at johnny cam for i little thocht at by an by i would be sae keepit in a chair mysel  but the thinkin o saml fletchers case is ane o the things at maks me awfu thankfu for the lenient wy the lord has aye dealt wi me for saml couldna move oot o the chair aye sleepin int at nicht an i can come an gang between mine an my bed  mebbe ye think im no much better off than saml but thats a terrible mistak  what a glory it would hae been to him if he could hae gone frae one end o the kitchen to the ither  ay im sure o that  saml was rale weel liked for he was saftspoken to everybody an fond o haen a gossip wi ony ane at was aboot the farm  we didna care sae muckle for the wife eppie lownie for she managed the farm an she was fell hard an terrible reserved we thocht no even likin ony body to get friendly wi the mester as we called saml  ay we made a richt mistak  as i had heard frequently of this queer mournful mistake made by those who considered saml unfortunate in his wife i turned jess on to the main line of her story  it was the ghost cradle as they named it at i meant to tell ye aboot  the bog was a bigger farm in thae days than noo but i daursay it has the new steadin yet  ay it winna be new noo but at the time there were sic a commotion aboot the ghost cradle they were juist puttin the new steadin up  there was sax or mair masons at it wi the lads on the farm helpin an as they were all sleepin at the farm there was great stir aboot the place  i couldna tell ye hoo the story aboot the farms bein haunted rose to begin wi but i mind fine hoo fleid i was ay an no only me but every manbody an womanbody on the farm  it was aye late at the soond began an we never saw naething we juist heard it  the masons said they wouldna hae been sae fleid if they could hae seent but it never was seen  it had the soond o a cradle rockin an when we lay in our beds hearkenin it grew louder an louder till it wasna to be borne an the womenfolk fair skirled wi fear  the mester was intimate wi a the stories aboot ghosts an waterkelpies an sic like an we couldna help listenin to them  but he aye said at ghosts at was juist heard an no seen was the maist fearsome an wicked  for all there was sic fear ower the hale farmtoon at naebody would gang ower the door alane after the gloamin cam the mester said he wasna fleid to sleep i the kitchen by imsel  we thocht it richt brave o im for ye see he was as helpless as a bairn  richt queer stories rose aboot the cradle an travelled to the ither farms  the wife didna like them ava for it was said at there maun hae been some awful murder o an infant on the farm or we wouldna be haunted by a cradle  syne folk began to mind at there had been na bairns born on the farm as far back as onybody kent an it was said at some lang syne crime had made the bog cursed  dinna think at we juist lay in our beds or sat round the fire shakkin wi fear  everything at could be dune was dune  in the daytime when naething was heard the masons explored ae place i the farm in the hope o findin oot at the sound was caused by sic a thing as the wind playin on the wood in the garret  even at nichts when they couldna sleep wi the soond ive kent them rise in a body an gang all ower the house wi lichts  ive seen them climbin on the new steadin crawlin alang the rafters haudin their cruizey lamps afore them an us womenbodies shiverin wi fear at the door  it was on ane o thae nights at a mason fell off the rafters an broke his leg  weel sic a state was the men in to find oot what it was at was terrifyin them sae muckle at the rest o them climbed up at aince to the place hed fallen frae thinkin there was something there at had fleid im  but though they crawled back an forrit there was naething ava  the rockin was louder we thocht after that nicht an syne the men said it would go on till somebody was killed  that idea took a richt haud o them an twa ran awa back to tilliedrum whaur they had come frae  they gaed thegither i the middle o the nicht an it was thocht next mornin at the ghost had spirited them awa  ye couldna conceive hoo lowspirited we all were after the masons had gien up hope o findin a natral cause for the soond  at ordnar times theres no ony mair lichtsome place than a farm after the men hae come in to their supper but at the bog we sat dour an sullen an there wasna a mason or a farmservant at would gang by imsel as far as the end o the hoose whaur the peats was keepit  the mistress maun hae saved some siller that spring through the egyptians gypsies keepin awa for the farm had got sic an ill name at nae tinkler would come near t at nicht  the tailorman an his laddie at should hae bidden wi us to sew things for the men walkit off fair skeered one mornin an settled doon at the farm o craigiebuckle fower mile awa whaur our lads had to gae to them  ay i mind the tailors sendin the laddie for the money owin him he hadna the speerit to venture again within soond o the cradle imsel  the men on the farm though couldna blame im for that  they were juist as flichtered themsels an mony a time i saw them hittin the dogs for whinin at the soond  the wy the dogs took on was fearsome in itsel for they seemed to ken aye when nicht cam on at the rockin would sune begin an if they werena chained they cam runnin to the hoose  i hae heard the hale glen fu as ye micht say wi the whinin o dogs for the dogs on the other farms took up the cry an in a glen ye can hear soonds terrible far awa at nicht  as lang as we sat i the kitchen listenin to what the mester had to say aboot the ghosts in his young days the cradle would be still but we were nae suner awa speeritless to our beds than it began an sometimes it lasted till mornin  we lookit upon the mester almost wi awe sittin there sae helpless in his chair an no fleid to be left alane  he had lang white hair an a saft bonny face at would hae made im respeckit by onybody an aye when we speired if he wasna fleid to be left alane he said them at has a clear conscience has naething to fear frae ghosts  there was some at said the curse would never leave the farm till the house was razed to the ground an its the truth im tellin ye when i say there was talk among the men aboot settin t on fire  the mester was richt stern when he heard o that quotin frae scripture in a solemn wy at abashed the masons but he said at in his opeenion there was a bairn buried on the farm an till it was found the cradle would go on rockin  after that the masons dug in a lot o places lookin for the body an they found some queer things too but never nae sign o a murdered litlin  ay i dinna ken what would hae happened if the commotion had gaen on muckle langer  one thing im sure o is at the mistress would hae gaen daft she took it a sae terrible to heart  i lauch at it noo but i tell ye i used to tak my heart to my bed in my mooth  if ye hinna heard the story i dinna think ye ll be able to guess what the ghost cradle was  i said i had been trying to think what the tray had to do with it  it had everything to do wit said jess an if the masons had kent hoo that cradle was rockit i think they would hae killed the mester it was eppie at found oot an she telt naebody but me though mony a ane kens noo  i see ye canna mak it oot yet so ill tell ye what the cradle was  the tray was keepit against the kitchen wall near the mester an he played ont wi his foot  he made it gang bump bump an the soond was just like a cradle rockin  ye could hardly believe sic a thing would hae made that din but it did an ye see we lay in our beds hearkenin fort  ay when eppie telt me i could scarce believe at that guid devoutlookin man could hae been sae wicked  ye see when he found hoo terrified we a were he keepit it up  the wy eppie found out i the tail o the day was by wonderin at im sleepin sae muckle in the daytime  he did that so as to be fresh for his sport at nicht  what a fine releegious man we thocht im too  eppie couldna bear the very sicht o the tray after that an she telt me to break it up but i keepit it ye see  the lump i the middles the mark as ye may say o the auld mans foot     chapter xii  the tragedy of a wife  were jess still alive to tell the lifestory of saml fletcher and his wife you could not hear it and sit still  the ghost cradle is but a page from the black history of a woman who married to be blotted out from that hour  one case of the kind i myself have known of a woman so good mated to a man so selfish that i cannot think of her even now with a steady mouth  hers was the tragedy of living on more mournful than the tragedy that kills  in thrums the weavers spoke of lousing from their looms removing the chains and there is something woeful in that  but pity poor nanny coutts who took her chains to bed with her  nanny was buried a month or more before i came to the house on the brae and even in thrums the dead are seldom remembered for so long a time as that  but it was only after sanders was left alone that we learned what a woman she had been and how basely we had wronged her she was an angel sanders went about whining when he had no longer a woman to illtreat  he had this sentimental way with him but it lost its effect after we knew the man  a deevil couldna hae deserved waur treatment tammas haggart said to him gang oot o my sicht man  ill blame mysel till i die jess said with tears in her eyes for no understandin puir nanny better  so nanny got sympathy at last but not until her forgiving soul had left her tortured body  there was many a kindly heart in thrums that would have gone out to her in her lifetime but we could not have loved her without upbraiding him and she would not buy sympathy at the price  what a little story it is and how few words are required to tell it  he was a bad husband to her and she kept it secret  that is nannys life summed up  it is all that was left behind when her coffin went down the brae  did she love him to the end or was she only doing what she thought her duty  it is not for me even to guess  a good woman who suffers is altogether beyond mans reckoning  to such heights of selfsacrifice we cannot rise  it crushes us it ought to crush us on to our knees  for us who saw nanny infirm shrunken and so weary yet a type of the noblest womanhood suffering for years and misunderstood her to the end what expiation can there be  i do not want to storm at the man who made her life so burdensome  too many years have passed for that nor would nanny take it kindly if i called her man names  sanders worked little after his marriage  he had a sore back he said which became a torture if he leant forward at his loom  what truth there was in this i cannot say but not every weaver in thrums could louse when his back grew sore  nanny went to the loom in his place filling as well as weaving and he walked about dressed better than the common and with cheerful words for those who had time to listen nanny got no approval even for doing his work as well as her own for they were understood to have money and sanders let us think her merely greedy  we drifted into his opinions  had jess been one of those who could go about she would i think have read nanny better than the rest of us for her intellect was bright and always led her straight to her neighbours hearts  but nanny visited no one and so jess only knew her by hearsay  nannys standoffishness as it was called was not a popular virtue and she was blamed still more for trying to keep her husband out of other peoples houses  he was so frank and full of gossip and she was so reserved  he would go everywhere and she nowhere  he had been known to ask neighbours to tea and she had shown that she wanted them away or even begged them not to come  we were not accustomed to go behind the face of a thing and so we set down nannys inhospitality to churlishness or greed  only after her death when other women had to attend him did we get to know what a tyrant sanders was at his own hearth  the ambition of nannys life was that we should never know it that we should continue extolling him and say what we chose about herself  she knew that if we went much about the house and saw how he treated her sanders would cease to be a respected man in thrums  so neat in his dress was sanders that he was seldom seen abroad in corduroys  his blue bonnet for everyday wear was such as even welltodo farmers only wore at fairtime and it was said that he had a handkerchief for every day in the week  jess often held him up to hendry as a model of courtesy and polite manners  him an nannys no weel matched she used to say for he has grand ideas an shes o the commonest  it maun be a richt trial to a man wi his fine tastes to hae a wife ats wrappers never even on an wha doesna wash her mutch aince in a month  it is true that nanny was a slattern but only because she married into slavery  she was kept so busy washing and ironing for sanders that she ceased to care how she looked herself  what did it matter whether her mutch was clean  weaving and washing and cooking doing the work of a breadwinner as well as of a housewife hers was soon a body prematurely old on which no wrapper would sit becomingly  before her face sanders would hint that her slovenly ways and dress tried him sorely and in company at least she only bowed her head  we were given to respecting those who worked hard but nanny we thought was a woman of means and sanders let us call her a miser  he was always anxious he said to be generous but nanny would not let him assist a starving child  they had really not a penny beyond what nanny earned at the loom and now we know how sanders shook her if she did not earn enough his vanity was responsible for the story about her wealth and she would not have us think him vain  because she did so much we said that she was as strong as a carthorse  the doctor who attended her during the last week of her life discovered that she had never been well  yet we had often wondered at her letting sanders pit his own potatoes when he was so unable  them ats strong ye see sanders explained doesna ken what illness is an so its natral they shouldna sympathize wi onweel fowk  ay im rale thankfu at nanny keeps her health  i often envy her  these were considered creditable sentiments and so they might have been had nanny uttered them  thus easily saunders built up a reputation for never complaining  i know now that he was a hard and cruel man who should have married a shrew but while nanny lived i thought he had a beautiful nature  many a time i have spoken with him at hendrys gate and felt the better of his heartiness  i mauna complain he always said na we maun juist fecht awa  little indeed had he to complain of and little did he fight away  sanders went twice to church every sabbath and thrice when he got the chance  there was no man who joined so lustily in the singing or looked straighter at the minister during the prayer  i have heard the minister say that sanderss constant attendance was an encouragement and a help to him  nanny had been a great churchgoer when she was a maiden but after her marriage she only went in the afternoons and a time came when she ceased altogether to attend  the minister admonished her many times telling her among other things that her irreligious ways were a distress to her husband  she never replied that she could not go to church in the forenoon because sanders insisted on a hot meal being waiting him when the service ended  but it was true that sanders for appearances sake would have had her go to church in the afternoons  it is now believed that on this point alone did she refuse to do as she was bidden  nanny was very far from perfect and the reason she forsook the kirk utterly was because she had no sabbath clothes  she died as she had lived saying not a word when the minister thinking it his duty drew a cruel comparison between her life and her husbands  i got my first glimpse into the real state of affairs in that house the doctor told me one night on the brae the day before she died youre sure theres no hope for me she asked wistfully and when i had to tell the truth she sank back on the pillow with a look of joy  nanny died with a lie on her lips  ay she said sanders has been a guid man to me     chapter xiii  making the best of it  hendry had a way of resuming a conversation where he had left off the night before  he would revolve a topic in his mind too and then begin aloud hes a queer ane or say ye so which was at times perplexing  with the whole day before them none of the family was inclined to waste strength in talk but one morning when he was blowing the steam off his porridge hendry said suddenly  hes hame again  the womenfolk gave him time to say to whom he was referring which he occasionally did as an afterthought  but he began to sup his porridge making eyes as it went steaming down his throat  i dinna ken wha ye mean jess said while leeby who was on her knees rubbing the hearthstone a bright blue paused to catch her fathers answer  jeames geogehan replied hendry with the horn spoon in his mouth  leeby turned to jess for enlightenment  geogehan repeated jess what no little jeames at ran awa  ay ay but hes a muckle stoot man noo an gey grey  ou i dinna wonder at that  its a guid forty year since he ran off  i waurant ye couldna say exact hoo lang syne it is  hendry asked this question because jess was notorious for her memory and he gloried in putting it to the test  lets see she said  but wha is he asked leeby  i never kent nae geogehans in thrums  weel its fortyone years syne come michaelmas said jess  hoo do ye ken  i ken fine  ye mind his father had been lickin im an he ran awa in a passion cryin oot at he would never come back  ay then he had a pair o boots on at the time an his father ran after im an took them aff im  the boots was the last at davie mearns made an its fully aneanforty years since davie fell ower the quarry on the day o the hillmarket  that settlest  ay an jeames ll be turned fifty noo for he was comin on for ten year auld at that time  ay ay an hes come back  what a state eppie ll be in  tells wha he is mother  od hes eppie guthries son  her man was william geogehan but he died afore you was born an as jeames was their only bairn the name o geogehans been a kind o lost sicht o  hae ye seen him hendry ist true at he made a fortune in thae farawa countries  eppie ll be blawin aboot him richt  theres nae doubt aboot the siller said hendry for he drove in a carriage frae tilliedrum an they say he needs a closet to hing his claes in theres sic a heap o them  ay but thats no a hes brocht na far frae a  dinna gang awa till yeve telts a aboot im  what mair has he brocht  hes brocht a wife said hendry twisting his face curiously  theres naething surprisin in that  ay but there is though  ye see eppie had a letter frae im no mony weeks syne sayin at he wasna deid an he was comin hame wi a fortune  he said too at he was a single man an shes been boastin aboot that so you may think at she got a surprise when he hands a wuman oot o the carriage  an no a pleasant ane said jess  had he been leein  na he was single when he wrote an single when he got the length o tilliedrum  ye see he fell in wi the lassie there an juist gaed clean aft his heid aboot her  after managin to withstand the women o foreign lands for a thae years he gaed fair skeer aboot this stocky at tilliedrum  shes juist seventeen years auld an the auld fule sits wi his airm round her in eppies hoose though theyve been mairit this fortnicht  the doited fule said jess  jeames geogehan and his bride became the talk of thrums and jess saw them from her window several times  the first time she had only eyes for the jacket with fur round it worn by mrs geogehan but subsequently she took in jeames  hes tryin to carryt aff wi his heid in the air she said but i can see hes fell shamefaced an nae wonder  ay ise uphaud hes mair ashamed ot in his heart than she is  its an awful like thing o a lassie to marry an auld man  she had dunet for the siller  ay theres pounds worth o fur aboot that jacket  they say she had siller hersel said tibbie birse  dinna tell me said jess  i ken by her wy o carryin hersel at she never had a jacket like that afore  eppie was not the only person in thrums whom this marriage enraged stories had long been alive of jeamess fortune which his cousins children were some day to divide among themselves and as a consequence these young men and women looked on mrs geogehan as a thief  dinna bring the wife to our hoose jeames one of them told him for we would be fair ashamed to hae her  we used to hae a respect for yer name so we couldna look her i the face  shes mair like yer dochter than yer wife said another  na said a third naebody could mistak her for yer dochter  shes ower younglike for that  wi the siller youll leave her jeames tammas haggart told him shell get a younger man for her second venture  all this was very trying to the newlymarried man who was thirsting for sympathy  hendry was the person whom he took into his confidence  it may hae been foolish at my time o life hendry reported him to have said but i couldna help it  if they juist kent her better they couldna but see at shes a terrible takkin crittur  jeames was generous indeed he had come home with the intention of scattering largess  a beggar met him one day on the brae and got a shilling from him  she was waving her arms triumphantly as she passed hendrys house and leeby got the story from her  eh hes a fine man that an a saft ane the woman said  i juist speired at im hoo his bonny wife was an he oot wi a shillin  leeby did not keep this news to herself and soon it was through the town  jeamess face began to brighten  theyre comin round to a mair sensible wy o lookin at things he told hendry  i was walkin wi the wife i the buryin ground yesterday an we met kitty mcqueen  she was ane o the warst agin me at first but she telt me i the buryin ground at when a man mairit he should please imsel  oh theyre comin round  what kitty told jess was  i minded o the tinkler wuman at he gae a shillin to so i thocht i would butter up at the auld fule too  weel i assure ye i had nae suner said at he was rale wise to marry wha he likit than he slips a pound note into my hand  ou jess weve taen the wrang wy wi jeames  ive telt a my bairns at if they meet him theyre to praise the wife terrible an im far mistaen if that doesna mean five shillins to ilka ane o them  jean whamond got a pound note for saying that jeamess wife had an uncommon pretty voice and davit lunan had ten shillings for a judicious word about her attractive manners  tibbie birse invited the newlymarried couple to tea one pound  theyre takkin to her theyre takkin to her jeames said gleefully  i kent they would come round in time  ay even my mother at was sae mad at first sits for hours noo aside her haudin her hand  theyre juist inseparable  the time came when we had mr and mrs geogehan and eppie to tea  its true enough leeby ran ben to tell jess at eppie an the wifes fond o ane another  i wouldna hae believed it o eppie if i hadna seen it but i assure ye they sat even at the teatable haudin ane anothers hands  i waurant theyre doint this meenute  i wasna born on a sabbath retorted jess  na na dinna tell me eppies fond o her  tell eppie to come but to the kitchen when the teas ower  jess and eppie had half an hours conversation alone and then our guests left  its a richt guid thing said hendry at eppie has taen sic a notion o the wife  ou ay said jess  then hendry hobbled out of the house  what said eppie to ye leeby asked her mother  juist what i expeckit jess answered  ye see shes dependent on jeames so she has to butter up at im  did she say onything aboot haudin the wifes hand sae fondlike  ay she said it was an awfu trial to her an at it sickened her to see jeames an the wife baith believin at she likit to dot     chapter xiv  visitors at the manse  on bringing home his bride the minister showed her to us and we thought she would do when she realized that she was not the minister she was a grand lady from edinburgh though very frank and we simple folk amused her a good deal especially when we were sitting cowed in the manse parlour drinking a dish of tea with her as happened to leeby her father and me three days before jamie came home  leeby had refused to be drawn into conversation like one who knew her place yet all her actions were genteel and her monosyllabic replies in the englishy tongue as of one who was after all a little above the common  when the ministers wife asked her whether she took sugar and cream she said politely if you please though she did not take sugar a reply that contrasted with hendrys equally wellintended answer to the same question  im no partikler was what hendry said  hendry had left home glumly declaring that the white collar jess had put on him would throttle him but her feikieness ended in his surrender and he was looking unusually perjink  had not his daughter been present he would have been the most at ease of the company but her manners were too fine not to make an impression upon one who knew her on her everyday behaviour and she had also ways of bringing hendry to himself by a touch beneath the table  it was in church that leeby brought to perfection her manner of looking after her father when he had confidence in the preachers soundness he would sometimes have slept in his pew if leeby had not had a watchful foot  she wakened him in an instant while still looking modestly at the pulpit however reverently he might try to fall over leebys foot went out she was such an artist that i never caught her in the act  all i knew for certain was that now and then hendry suddenly sat up  the ordeal was over when leeby went upstairs to put on her things after tea hendry had become bolder in talk his subject being ministerial  he had an extraordinary knowledge got no one knew where of the matrimonial affairs of all the ministers in these parts and his stories about them ended frequently with a chuckle  he always took it for granted that a ministers marriage was womanhoods great triumph and that the particular woman who got him must be very clever  some of his tales were even more curious than he thought them such as the one leeby tried to interrupt by saying we must be going  theres mr pennycuick noo said hendry shaking his head in wonder at what he had to tell him ats minister at tilliedrum  weel when he was a probationer he was michty poor an one day he was walkin into thrums frae glen quharity an he taks a rest at a little housey on the road  the fowk didna ken him ava but they saw he was a minister an the lassie was sorry to see him wi sic an auld hat what think ye she did  come away father said leeby reentering the parlour but hendry was now in full pursuit of his story  ill tell ye what she did he continued  she juist took his hat awa an put her fathers new ane in its place an mr pennycuick never kent the differ till he landed in thrums  it was terrible kind o her  ay but the old man would be in a michty rage when he found she had swappit the hats  come away said leeby still politely though she was burning to tell her mother how hendry had disgraced them  the minister said hendry turning his back on leeby didna forget the lassie  na as sune as he got a kirk he married her  ay she got her reward  he married her  it was rale noble of im  i do not know what leeby said to hendry when she got him beyond the manse gate for i stayed behind to talk to the minister  as it turned out the ministers wife did most of the talking smiling goodhumouredly at country gawkiness the while  yes she said i am sure i shall like thrums though those teas to the congregation are a little trying  do you know thrums is the only place i was ever in where it struck me that the men are cleverer than the women  she told us why  well tonight affords a case in point  mr mcqumpha was quite brilliant was he not in comparison with his daughter  really she seemed so put out at being at the manse that she could not raise her eyes  i question if she would know me again and i am sure she sat in the room as one blindfolded  i left her in the bedroom a minute and i assure you when i returned she was still standing on the same spot in the centre of the floor  i pointed out that leeby had been awestruck  i suppose so she said but it is a pity she cannot make use of her eyes if not of her tongue  ah the thrums women are good i believe but their wits are sadly in need of sharpening  i daresay it comes of living in so small a place  i overtook leeby on the brae aware as i saw her alone that it had been her father whom i passed talking to tammas haggart in the square hendry stopped to have what he called a tove with any likely person he encountered and indeed though he and i often took a walk on saturdays i generally lost him before we were clear of the town  in a few moments leeby and i were at home to give jess the news  whaurs yer father asked jess as if hendrys way of dropping behind was still unknown to her  ou i left him speakin to gavin birse said leeby  i daursay hes awa to some hoose  its no very silvendy safe his comin ower the brae by himsel said jess adding in a bitter tone of conviction but hell gang in to no hoose as lang as hes so weel dressed  na he would think it boastfu  i sat down to a book by the kitchen fire but as leeby became communicative i read less and less  while she spoke she was baking bannocks with all the might of her and jess leaning forward in her chair was arranging them in a semicircle round the fire  na was the first remark of leebys that came between me and my book it is no new furniture  but there was three cartloads ot leeby sent on frae edinbory tibbie birse helpit to lift it in and she said the parlour furniture beat a  ou its substantial but it is no new  i sepad it had been bocht cheap secondhand for the chair i had was terrible scratched like an whats mair the airmchair was a heap shinnier than the rest  ay ay i wager it had been new stuffed  tibbie said the carpet cowed for grandeur  oh i dinna deny its a guid carpet but if its been turned once its been turned half a dozen times so its far frae new  ay an forby it was rale threadbare aneath the table so ye may be sure theyve been cuttint an puttin the worn pairt whaur it would be least seen  they say at theres twa grand gas brackets i the parlour an a wonderfu gasoliery i the dininroom  we wasna i the dininroom so i ken naething aboot the gasoliery but ill tell ye what the gas brackets is  i recognized them immeditly  ye mind the auld gasoliery i the dininroom had twa lichts  ay then the parlour brackets is made oot o the auld gasoliery  weel leeby as sure as yere standin there that passed through my head as sune as tibbie mentioned them  theres nae doot about it  ay i was in ane o the bedrooms too  it would be grand  i wouldna say at it was partikler grand but there was a great mask quantity o things int an near everything was covered wi cretonne  but the chairs dinna match  there was a very bonnypainted cloth alang the chimleywhat they call a mantelpiece border i warrant  sal ive often wondered what they was  well i assure ye they winna be ill to mak for the border was juist nailed upon a board laid on the chimley  theres naething to henders makin ane for the room  ay we could sew something on the border instead o paintint  the room lookit weel ye say  yes but it was economically furnished  there was nae carpet below the waxcloth na there was nane below the bed either  wast a grand bed  it had a fell lot o brass aboot it but there was juist one pair o blankets  i thocht it was gey shabby haen the ewer a different pattern frae the basin ay an there was juist a poker in the fireplace there was nae tangs  yea yea theyll hae but one set o bedroom fireirons  the tangsll be in anither room  tod thats no sae michty grand for edinbory what like was she hersel  ou very ladylike and saft spoken  shes a canty body an frank  she wears her hair low on the left side to hod hide a scar an theres twa warts on her richt hand  there hadna been a fire i the parlour  no but it was ready to licht  there was sticks and paper int  the paper was oot o a dressmakers journal  ye say so  shell mak her ain frocks i sepad  when hendry entered to take off his collar and coat before sitting down to his evening meal of hot water porter and bread mixed in a bowl jess sent me off to the attic  as i climbed the stairs i remembered that the ministers wife thought leeby in need of sharpening     chapter xv  how gavin birse put it to mag lownie  in a wet day the rain gathered in blobs on the road that passed our garden  then it crawled into the carttracks until the road was streaked with water  lastly the water gathered in heavy yellow pools if the onding still continued clods of earth toppled from the garden dyke into the ditch  on such a day when even the dulseman had gone into shelter and the women scudded by with their wrappers over their heads came gavin birse to our door  gavin who was the glen quharity post was still young but had never been quite the same man since some amateurs in the glen ironed his back for rheumatism  i thought he had called to have a crack with me  he sent his compliments up to the attic however by leeby and would i come and be a witness  gavin came up and explained  he had taken off his scarf and thrust it into his pocket lest the rain should take the colour out of it  his boots cheeped and his shoulders had risen to his ears  he stood steaming before my fire  if its no ower muckle to ask ye he said i would like ye for a witness  a witness  but for what do you need a witness gavin  i want ye he said to come wi me to mags and be a witness  gavin and mag birse had been engaged for a year or more  mag was the daughter of janet ogilvy who was best remembered as the body that took the hill that is wandered about it for twelve hours on the day mr dishart the auld licht minister accepted a call to another church  you dont mean to tell me gavin i asked that your marriage is to take place today  by the twist of his mouth i saw that he was only deferring a smile  far frae that he said  ah then you have quarrelled and i am to speak up for you  na na he said i dinna want ye to do that above all things  it would be a favour if ye could gie me a bad character  this beat me and i daresay my face showed it  im no juist what ye would call anxious to marry mag noo said gavin without a tremor  i told him to go on  theres a lassie oot at craigiebuckle he explained workin on the farmjeanie luke by name  ye may hae seen her  what of her i asked severely  weel said gavin still unabashed im thinkin noo at i would rather hae her  then he stated his case more fully  ay i thocht i liked mag oncommon till i saw jeanie an i like her fine yet but i prefer the other ane  that state o matters canna gang on for ever so i came into thrums the day to settle t one wy or another  and how i asked do you propose going about it  it is a somewhat delicate business  ou i see nae great difficulty in t  ill speir at mag blunt oot if shell let me aff  yes ill put it to her plain  youre sure jeanie would take you  ay oh theres nae fear o that  but if mag keeps you to your bargain  weel in that case theres nae harm done  you are in a great hurry gavin  ye may say that but i want to be married  the wifie i lodge wi canna last lang an i would like to settle doon in some place  so you are on your way to mags now  ay well get her in atween twal and ane  oh yes but why do you want me to go with you  i want ye for a witness  if she winna let me aff weel and guid and if she will its better to hae a witness in case she should go back on her word  gavin made his proposal briskly and as coolly as if he were only asking me to go fishing but i did not accompany him to mags  he left the house to look for another witness and about an hour afterwards jess saw him pass with tammas haggart  tammas cried in during the evening to tell us how the mission prospered  mind ye said tammas a drop of water hanging to the point of his nose i disclaim all responsibility in the business  i ken mag weel for a thrifty respectable woman as her mither was afore her and so i said to gavin when he came to speir me  ay mony a pirn has lisbeth filled to me said hendry settling down to a reminiscence  no to be ower hard on gavin continued tammas forestalling hendry he took what i said in guid part but aye when i stopped speakin to draw breath he says the queistion is will ye come wi me  he was michty made up in s mind  weel ye went wi him suggested jess who wanted to bring tammas to the point  ay said the stonebreaker but no in sic a hurry as that  he worked his mouth round and round to clear the course as it were for a sarcasm  fowk often say he continued at am quick beyond the ordinar in seeing the humorous side o things  here tammas paused and looked at us  so ye are tammas said hendry  losh ye mind hoo ye saw the humorous side o me wearin a pair o boots at wisna marrows  no the ane had a toepiece on an the other hadna  ye juist wore them sometimes when ye was delvin broke in jess ye have as guid a pair o boots as ony in thrums  ay but i had worn them said hendry at odd times for mair than a year an i had never seen the humorous side o them  weel as fac as death here he addressed me tammas had juist seen them twa or three times when he saw the humorous side o them  syne i saw their humorous side too but no till tammas pointed it oot  that was naething said tammas naething ava to some things ive done  but what aboot mag said leeby  we wasna that length was we said tammas  na we was speakin aboot the humorous

gavin proposes to me after i had haen my laugh  yes cried hendry banging the table with his fist it has a humorous side  yere richt again tammas  i wish ye wadna blatter beat the table said jess and then tammas proceeded  gavin wanted me to tak paper an ink an a pen wi me to write the proceedins doon but i said na na ill tak paper but no nae ink nor nae pen for therell be ink an a pen there  that was what i said  an did she let him aff asked leeby  weel said tammas aff we goes to mags hoose an sure enough mag was in  she was alone too so gavin no to waste time juist sat doon for politeness

that ended it  did ye tak it doun in writin asked hendry  there was nae need said tammas handing round his snuffmull  no i never touched paper  when i saw the thing was settled i left them to their coortin  theyre to tak a look at snecky hobarts auld hoose the nicht  its to let     chapter xvi  the son from london  in the spring of the year there used to come to thrums a painter from nature whom hendry spoke of as the drawer  he lodged with jess in my attic and when the weavers met him they said weel drawer and then passed on grinning  tammas haggart was the first to say this  the drawer was held a poor man because he straggled about the country looking for subjects for his draws and jess as was her way gave him many comforts for which she would not charge  that i daresay was why he painted for her a little portrait of jamie  when the drawer came back to thrums he always found the painting in a frame in the room here i must make a confession about jess  she did not in her secret mind think the portrait quite the thing and as soon as the drawer departed it was removed from the frame to make way for a calendar  the deception was very innocent jess being anxious not to hurt the donors feelings  to those who have the artists eye the picture which hangs in my schoolhouse now does not show a handsome lad jamie being short and dapper with strawcoloured hair and a chin that ran away into his neck  that is how i once regarded him but i have little heart for criticism of those i like and despite his madness for a season of which alas i shall have to tell i am always jamies friend  even to hear any one disparaging the appearance of jesss son is to me a pain  all jesss acquaintances knew that in the beginning of every month a registered letter reached her from london  to her it was not a matter to keep secret  she was proud that the help she and hendry needed in the gloaming of their lives should come from her beloved son and the neighbours esteemed jamie because he was good to his mother  jess had more humour than any other woman i have known while leeby was but sparingly endowed yet as the month neared its close it was the daughter who put on the humorist jess thinking money too serious a thing to jest about  then if leeby had a moment for gossip as when ironing a dickey for hendry and the iron was a trifle too hot she would look archly at me before addressing her mother in these words  will he send think ye  jess who had a conviction that he would send affected surprise at the question  will jamie send this month do ye mean  na oh losh no its no to be expeckit  na he couldna dot this time  thats what ye aye say but he aye sends  yes an vara weel ye ken at he will send  na na leeby dinna let me ever think o sic a thing this month  as if ye wasna thinkin ot day an nicht  hes terrible mindfu leeby but he doesna haet  na no this month mebbe next month  do you mean to tell me mother at yell no be up oot o yer bed on monunday an hour afore yer usual time lookin for the post  na no this time  i may be up an tak a look for im but no expeckin a registerdy na na that wouldna be reasonable  reasonable here reasonable there up youll be keekin peering through the blind to see if the posts comin ay an whats mair the post will come and a registerdy in his hand wi fifteen shillings int at the least  dinna say fifteen leeby i would never think o sic a sum  mebbe five  five  i wonder to hear ye  vera weel you ken at since he had twentytwa shillings in the week hes never sent less than half a sovereign  no but we canna expeck  expeck  no but its no expeck its get  on the monday morning when i came downstairs jess was in her chair by the window beaming a piece of paper in her hand  i did not require to be told about it but i was told  jess had been up before leeby could get the fire lit with great difficulty reaching the window in her bare feet and many a time had she said that the post must be by  havers said leeby he winna be for an hour yet  come awa back to your bed  na he maun be by jess would say in a few minutes ou we couldna expeck this month  so it went on until jesss hand shook the blind  hes comin leeby hes comin  hell no hae naething na i couldna expeck  hes by  i dinna believe it cried leeby running to the window hes juist at his tricks again  this was in reference to a way our saturnine post had of pretending that he brought no letters and passing the door  then he turned back mistress mcqumpha he cried and whistled  run leeby run said jess excitedly  leeby hastened to the door and came back with a registered letter  registerdy she cried in triumph and jess with fond hands opened the letter  by the time i came down the money was hid away in a box beneath the bed where not even leeby could find it and jess was on her chair hugging the letter  she preserved all her registered envelopes  this was the first time i had been in thrums when jamie was expected for his ten days holiday and for a week we discussed little else though he had written saying when he would sail for dundee there was quite a possibility of his appearing on the brae at any moment for he liked to take jess and leeby by surprise  hendry there was no surprising unless he was in the mood for it and the coolness of him was one of jesss grievances  just two years earlier jamie came north a week before his time and his father saw him from the window instead of crying out in amazement or hacking his face for he was shaving at the time henry calmly wiped his razor on the windowsill and said  ay theres jamie  jamie was a little disappointed at being seen in this way for he had been looking forward for four and forty hours to repeating the sensation of the year before  on that occasion he had got to the door unnoticed where he stopped to listen  i daresay he checked his breath the better to catch his mothers voice for jess being an invalid jamie thought of her first  he had leeby sworn to write the truth about her but many an anxious hour he had on hearing that she was complaining fell considerably about her back the day leeby as he knew being frightened to alarm him  jamie too had given his promise to tell exactly how he was keeping but often he wrote that he was fine when jess had her doubts  when hendry wrote he spread himself over the table and said that jess was juist about it or aff and on which does not tell much  so jamie hearkened painfully at the door and by and by heard his mother say to leeby that she was sure the teapot was running out  perhaps that voice was as sweet to him as the music of a maiden to her lover but jamie did not rush into his mothers arms  jess has told me with a beaming face how craftily he behaved  the old man of lungs that shook thrums by night who went from door to door selling firewood had a way of shoving doors rudely open and crying  ony rozetty roots and him jamie imitated  juist think jess said as she recalled the incident what a startle we got  as we think pete kicks open the door and cries oot ony rozetty roots and leeby says no and gangs to shut the door  next minute she screeches what what what and in walks jamie  jess was never able to decide whether it was more delightful to be taken aback in this way or to prepare for jamie  sudden excitement was bad for her according to hendry who got his medical knowledge secondhand from persons under treatment but with jamies appearance on the threshold jesss health began to improve  this time he kept to the appointed day and the house was turned upside down in his honour such a polish did leeby put on the flagons which hung on the kitchen wall that passing between them and the window i thought once i had been struck by lightning  on the morning of the day that was to bring him leeby was up at two oclock and eight hours before he could possibly arrive jess had a nightshirt warming for him at the fire  i was no longer anybody except as a person who could give jamie advice jess told me what i was to say  the only thing he and his mother quarrelled about was the underclothing she would swaddle him in and jess asked me to back her up in her entreaties  theres no a doubt she said but what its a hantle caulder here than in london an it would be a terrible business if he was to tak the cauld  jamie was to sail from london to dundee and come on to thrums from tilliedrum in the postcart  the road at that time however avoided the brae and at a certain point jamies custom was to alight and take the short cut home along a farm road and up the commonty  here too hookey crewe the post deposited his passengers box which hendry wheeled home in a barrow  long before the cart had lost sight of tilliedrum jess was at her window  tell her hookeys often late on monundays leeby whispered to me for shell gang oot o her mind if she thinks theres onything wrang  soon jess was painfully excited though she sat as still as salt  it maun be yer time she said looking at both leeby and me for in thrums we went out and met our friends  hoots retorted leeby trying to be hardy hookey canna be oot o tilliedrum yet  he maun hae startit lang syne  i wonder at ye mother puttin yersel in sic a state  yell be ill when he comes  na am no in nae state leeby but therell no be nae accident will there  its most provokin at ye will think at every time jamie steps into a machine therell be an accident  am sure if ye would tak mair after my father it would be a blessin  look hoo cool he is  whaur is he leeby  oh i dinna ken  the henmost time i saw him he was layin doon the law aboot something to tnowhead  its an awfu wy that he has o gaen oot withoot a word  i wouldna wonder at hes no bein in time to meet jamie an that would be a pretty business  od yere sure hell be in braw time  but he hasna taen the barrow wi him an hoo is jamies luggage to be brocht up withoot a barrow  barrow  he took the barrow to the sawmill an hour syne to pick it up at rob anguss on the wy  several times jess was sure she saw the cart in the distance and implored us to be off  ill tak no settle till yere awa she said her face now flushed and her hands working nervously  weve time to gang and come twa or three times yet remonstrated leeby but jess gave me so beseeching a look that i put on my hat then hendry dandered in to change his coat deliberately and when the three of us set off we left jess with her eye on the door by which jamie must enter  he was her only son now and she had not seen him for a year  on the way down the commonty leeby had the honour of being twice addressed as miss mcqumpha but her father was hendry to all which shows that we make our social position for ourselves  hendry looked forward to jamies annual appearance only a little less hungrily than jess but his pulse still beat regularly  leeby would have considered it almost wicked to talk of anything except jamie now but hendry cried out comments on the tatties yesterdays roup the fall in jute to everybody he encountered  when he and a crony had their say and parted it was their custom to continue the conversation in shouts until they were out of hearing  only to jess at her window was the cart late that afternoon  jamie jumped from it in the long greatcoat that had been new to thrums the year before and hendry said calmly  ay jamie  leeby and jamie made signs that they recognized each other as brother and sister but i was the only one with whom he shook hands  he was smart in his movements and quite the gentleman but the thrums ways took hold of him again at once  he even inquired for his mother in a tone that was meant to deceive me into thinking he did not care how she was  hendry would have had a talk out of him on the spot but was reminded of the luggage  we took the heavy farm road and soon we were at the sawmill  i am naturally leisurely but we climbed the commonty at a stride  jamie pretended to be calm but in a dark place i saw him take leebys hand and after that he said not a word  his eyes were fixed on the elbow of the brae where he would come into sight of his mothers window  many many a time i know that lad had prayed to god for still another sight of the window with his mother at it  so we came to the corner where the stile is that saml dickie jumped in the race for tnowheads bell and before jamie was the house of his childhood and his mothers window and the fond anxious face of his mother herself  my eyes are dull and i did not see her but suddenly jamie cried out my mother and leeby and i were left behind  when i reached the kitchen jess was crying and her sons arms were round her neck  i went away to my attic  there was only one other memorable event of that day  jamie had finished his tea and we all sat round him listening to his adventures and opinions  he told us how the country should be governed too and perhaps put on airs a little  hendry asked the questions and jamie answered them as pat as if he and his father were going through the shorter catechism  when jamie told anything marvellous as how many towels were used at the shop in a day or that twopence was the charge for a single shave his father screwed his mouth together as if preparing to whistle and then instead made a curious clucking noise with his tongue which was reserved for the expression of absolute amazement  as for jess who was given to making much of me she ignored my remarks and laughed hilariously at jokes of jamies which had been received in silence from me a few minutes before  slowly it came to me that leeby had something on her mind and that jamie was talking to her with his eyes  i learned afterwards that they were plotting how to get me out of the kitchen but were too impatient to wait  thus it was that the great event happened in my presence jamie rose and stood near jessi daresay he had planned the scene frequently  then he produced from his pocket a purse and coolly opened it  silence fell upon us as we saw that purse  from it he took a neatlyfolded piece of paper crumpled it into a ball and flung it into jesss lap  i cannot say whether jess knew what it was  her hand shook and for a moment she let the ball of paper lie there  opent up cried leeby who was in the secret  what st asked hendry drawing nearer  its juist a bit paper jamie flung at me said jess and then she unfolded it  its a fivepound note cried hendry  na na oh keep us no said jess but she knew it was  for a time she could not speak  i canna tak it jamie she faltered at last  but jamie waved his hand meaning that it was nothing and then lest he should burst hurried out into the garden where he walked up and down whistling  may god bless the lad thought i  i do not know the history of that fivepound note but well aware i am that it grew slowly out of pence and silver and that jamie denied his passions many things for this great hour  his sacrifices watered his young heart and kept it fresh and tender  let us no longer cheat our consciences by talking of filthy lucre  money may always be a beautiful thing  it is we who make it grimy     chapter xvii  a home for geniuses  from hints he had let drop at odd times i knew that tammas haggart had a scheme for geniuses but not until the evening after jamies arrival did i get it out of him  hendry was with jamie at the fishing and it came about that tammas and i had the pigsty to ourselves  of course he said when we had got a grip of the subject i dount pretend as my ideas is to be followed withoot deeviation but ondootedly something should be done for geniuses them bein aboot the only class as we do naething for  yet theyre fowk to be prood o an we shouldna let them overdo the thing nor run into debt na na there was robbie burns noo as real a genius as ever  at the pigsty where we liked to have more than one topic we had frequently to tempt tammas away from burns  your scheme i interposed is for living geniuses of course  ay he said thoughtfully them ats gone canna be brocht back weel my idea is at a home should be built for geniuses at the public expense whaur they could all live thegither an be decently looked after  na no in london thats no my plan but i would haet within an hours distance o london say five mile frae the marketplace an standin in a bit garden whaur the geniuses could walk aboot arminarm composin their minds  you would have the grounds walled in i suppose so that the public could not intrude  weel theres a difficulty there because yell observe as the public would support the institootion they would hae a kind o richt to look in  howsomeever i daur say we could arrange to fling the grounds open to the public once a week on condition at they didna speak to the geniuses  im thinkin at if there was a small chairge for admission the home could be made selfsupportin  losh to think at if there had been sic an institootion in his time a man micht hae sat on the bit dyke and watched robbie burns danderin roond the  you would divide the home into suites of rooms so that every inmate would have his own apartments  not by no means na na  the mair i read aboot geniuses the mair clearly i see as their wy o living alane ower muckle is ane o the things as breaks doon their health and makes them meeserable  i the home they would hae a bedroom apiece but the parlour an the other sittinrooms would be for all so as they could enjoy ane anothers company  the management  oh thats aisy  the superintendent would be a medical man appointed by parliament and he would hae menservants to do his biddin  not all menservants surely  every one o them  man geniuses is no to be trusted wi womenfolk no even robbie bu  so he did but would the inmates have to put themselves entirely in the superintendents hands  nae doubt an they would see it was the wisest thing they could do he would be careful o their health an send them early to bed as weel as hae them up at eight sharp  geniuses healths is always breakin doon because of late hours as in the case o the lad wha used often to begin his immortal writins at twal oclock at nicht a thing at would ruin ony constitootion  but the superintendent would see as they had a tasty supper at nine oclocksomething as agreed wi them  then for half an hour they would quiet their brains readin oot aloud time about frae sic a book as the pilgrims progress an the gas would be turned aff at ten precisely  when would you have them up in the morning  at sax in summer an seven in winter  the superintendent would see as they were all properly bathed every mornin cleanliness bein most important for the preservation o health  this sounds well but suppose a genius broke the ruleslay in bed for instance reading by the light of a candle after hours or refused to take his bath in the morning  the superintendent would hae to punish him  the genius would be sent back to his bed maybe  an if he lay lang i the mornin he would hae to gang withoot his breakfast  that would be all very well where the inmate only broke the regulations once in a way but suppose he were to refuse to take his bath day after day and you know geniuses are said to be eccentric in that particular what would be done  you could not starve him geniuses are too scarce  na na in a case like that he would hae to be reported to the public the thing would hae to come afore the hoose of commons  ay the superintendent would get a member o the opposeetion to ask a queistion such as can the honourable gentleman the secretary of state for home affairs inform the hoose whether it is a fac that mr sicaone the wellknown genius at present resident in the home for geniuses has contrairy to regulations perseestently and obstinately refused to change his linen and if so whether the government proposes to take ony steps in the matter  the newspapers would report the discussion next mornin an so it would be made public withoot onnecessary ootlay  in a general way however you would give the geniuses perfect freedom  they could work when they liked and come and go when they liked  not so  the superintendent would fix the hours o wark an they would all write or whatever it was thegither in one large room  man man it would mak a grand draw for a painterchield that room wi all the geniuses working awa thegither  but when the labors of the day were over the genius would be at liberty to make calls by himself or to run up say to london for an hour or two  hoots no that would spoil everything  its the drink ye see as does for a terrible lot o geniuses  even rob  alas yes  but would you have them all teetotalers  what do ye tak me for  na na the superintendent would allow them one glass o toddy every nicht an mix it himsel but he would never get the keys o the press whaur he kept the drink oot o his hands they would never be allowed oot o the gairden either withoot a man to look after them an i wouldna burthen them wi ower muckle pocketmoney  saxpence in the week would be suffeecient  how about their clothes  they would get twa suits a year wi the letter g sewed on the shoulders so as if they were lost they could be recognized and brocht back  certainly it is a scheme deserving consideration and i have no doubt our geniuses would jump at it but you must remember that some of them would have wives  ay an some o them would hae husbands  ive been thinkin that oot an i daur say the best plan would be to partition aff a pairt o the home for female geniuses  would parliament elect the members  i wouldna trust them  the election would hae to be by competitive examination  na i canna say wha would draw up the queistions  the schemes juist growin i my mind but the mair i think ot the better i like it     chapter xviii  leeby and jamie  by the bank of the quharity on a summer day i have seen a barefooted girl gaze at the running water until tears filled her eyes  that was the birth of romance  whether this love be but a beautiful dream i cannot say but this we see that it comes to all and colours the whole future life with gold  leeby must have dreamt it but i did not know her then  i have heard of a man who would have taken her far away into a county where the corn is yellow when it is still green with us but she would not leave her mother nor was it him she saw in her dream  from her earliest days when she was still a child staggering round the garden with jamie in her arms her duty lay before her straight as the buryingground road  jess had need of her in the little home at the top of the brae where god looking down upon her as she scrubbed and gossipped and sat up all night with her ailing mother and never missed the prayermeeting and adored the minister did not perhaps think her the least of his handmaids  her years were less than thirty when he took her away but she had few days that were altogether dark  those who bring sunshine to the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves  the love leeby bore for jamie was such that in their younger days it shamed him  other laddies knew of it and flung it at him until he dared leeby to let on in public that he and she were related  hoo is your lass they used to cry to him inventing a new game  i saw leeby lookin for ye they would say shes wearyin for ye to gang an play wi her  then if they were not much bigger boys than himself jamie got them against the dyke and hit them hard until they publicly owned to knowing that she was his sister and that he was not fond of her  it distressed him mair than ye could believe though jess has told me an when he came hame he would greet an say at leeby disgraced him  leeby of course suffered for her too obvious affection  i wonder at ye dinna try to control yersel jamie would say to her as he grew bigger  am sure said leeby i never gie ye a look if theres onybody there  a look  youre ay lookin at me sae fondlike at i dinna ken what wy to turn  weel i canna help it said leeby probably beginning to whimper  if jamie was in a very bad temper he left her after this to her own reflections but he was naturally softhearted  am no tellin ye no to care for me he told her but juist to keep it mair to yersel  naebody would ken frae me at am fond o ye  mebbe yer no said leeby  ay am i but i can keep it secret  when were in the hoose am juist richt fond o ye  do ye love me jamie  jamie waggled his head in irritation  love he said is an awful like word to use when fowks weel  ye shouldna speir sic annoyin queistions  but if ye juist say ye love me ill never let on again afore fowk at yer onything to me ava  ay ye often say that  do ye no believe my word  i believe fine ye mean what ye say but ye forget yersel when the time comes  juist try me this time  weel then i do  do what asked the greedy leeby  what ye said  i said love  well said jamie i dot  what do ye do  say the word  na said jamie i winna say the word  its no a word to say but i dot  that was all she could get out of him unless he was stricken with remorse when he even went the length of saying the word  leeby kent perfectly weel jess has said at it was a trial to jamie to tak her ony gait an i often used to say to her at i wondered at her want o pride in priggin wi him  ay but if she could juist get a promise wrung oot o him she didna care hoo muckle she had to prig  syne they quarrelled an ane or baith o them grat cried afore they made it up  i mind when jamie went to the fishin leeby was aye terrible keen to get wi him but ye see he wouldna be seen gaen through the toon wi her  if ye let me gang she said to him ill no seek to go through the toon wi ye  na ill gang roond by the roods an you can tak the buryinground road so as we can meet on the hill  yes leeby was willin to agree wi a that juist to get gaen wi him  ive seen lassies makkin themsels sma for lads often enough but i never saw ane at prigged so muckle wi her ain brother  na its other lassies brothers they like as a rule  but though jamie was terrible reserved aboot it said leeby he was as fond o me as ever i was o him  ye mind the time i had the measles mother  am no likely to forget it leeby said jess an you blind wi them for three days  ay ay jamie was richt taen up aboot ye  i mind he broke open his pirly moneybox an bocht a hapenny worth o something to ye every day  an ye hinna forgotten the stick  deed no i hinna  ye see jess explained to me leeby was lyin ben the hoose an jamie wasna allowed to gang near her for fear o infection  weel he gat a lang stickit was a peastickan put it aneath the door an waggled it  ay he did that a curran times every day juist to let her see he was thinkin o her  mair than that said leeby he cried oot at he loved me  ay but juist aince jess said i dinna mind ot but aince  it was the time the doctor came late an jamie being waukened by him thocht ye was deein  i mind as if it was yesterday hoo he cam runnin to the door an cried oot i do love ye leeby i love ye richt  the doctor got a start when he heard the voice but he laughed loud when he unerstood  he had nae business though said leeby to tell onybody  he was a rale clever man the doctor jess explained to me ay he kent me as weel as though hed gaen through me wi a lichted candle it got oot through him an the young billies took to sayin to jamie ye do love her jamie ay ye love her richt  the only reglar fecht i ever kent jamie hae was wi a lad at cried that to him  it was bowlegs chirstys laddie  ay but when she got better jamie blamed leeby  he no only blamed me said leeby but he wanted me to pay him back a the bawbees he had spent on me  ay an i sepad he got them too said jess  in time jamie became a barber in tilliedrum trudging many heavy miles there and back twice a day that he might sleep at home trudging bravely i was to say but it was what he was born to and there was hardly an alternative  this was the time i saw most of him and he and leeby were often in my thoughts there is as terrible a bubble in the little kettle as on the cauldron of the world and some of the scenes between jamie and leeby were great tragedies comedies what you will until the kettle was taken off the fire  hers was the more placid temper indeed only in one way could jamie suddenly rouse her to fury  that was when he hinted that she had a large number of frocks  leeby knew that there could never be more than a sabbath frock and an everyday gown for her both of her mothers making but jamies insinuations were more than she could bear  then i have seen her seize and shake him  i know from jess that leeby cried herself hoarse the day joey was buried because her little black frock was not ready for wear  until he went to tilliedrum jamie had been more a stayathome boy than most  the warmth of jesss love had something to do with keeping his heart aglow but more i think he owed to leeby  tilliedrum was his introduction to the world and for a little it took his head  i was in the house the sabbath day that he refused to go to church  he went out in the forenoon to meet the tilliedrum lads who were to take him off for a holiday in a cart  hendry was more wrathful than i remember ever to have seen him though i have heard how he did with the lodger who broke the lords day  this lodger was a tourist who thought in folly surely rather than in hardness of heart to test the religious convictions of an auld licht by insisting on paying his bill on a sabbath morning  he offered the money to jess with the warning that if she did not take it now she might never see it  jess was so kind and good to her lodgers that he could not have known her long who troubled her with this poor trick  she was sorely in need at the time and entreated the thoughtless man to have some pity on her  now or never he said holding out the money  put it on the dresser said jess at last an ill get it the morn  the few shillings were laid on the dresser where they remained unfingered until hendry with leeby and jamie came in from church  what sillers that asked hendry and then jess confessed what she had done  i wonder at ye woman said hendry sternly and lifting the money he climbed up to the attic with it  he pushed open the door and confronted the lodger  take back yer siller he said laying it on the table an leave my hoose  man youre a pitiable crittur to tak the chance when i was oot o playin upon the poverty o an onweel woman  it was with such unwonted severity as this that hendry called upon jamie to follow him to church but the boy went off and did not return till dusk defiant and miserable  jess had been so terrified that she forgave him everything for sight of his face and hendry prayed for him at family worship with too much unction  but leeby cried as if her tender heart would break  for a long time jamie refused to look at her but at last he broke down  if ye go on like that he said ill gang awa oot an droon mysel or be a sojer  this was no uncommon threat of his and sometimes when he went off banging the door violently she ran after him and brought him back this time she only wept the more and so both went to bed in misery it was after midnight that jamie rose and crept to leebys bedside leeby was shaking the bed in her agony  jess heard what they said  leeby said jamie dinna greet an ill never dot again  he put his arms round her and she kissed him passionately  o jamie she said hae ye prayed to god to forgie ye  jamie did not speak  if ye was to die this nicht cried leeby an you no made it up wi god ye wouldna gang to heaven  jamie i canna sleep till yeve made it up wi god  but jamie still hung back  leeby slipped from her bed and went down on her knees  o god o dear god she cried mak jamie to pray to you  then jamie went down on his knees too and they made it up with god together  this is a little thing for me to remember all these years and yet how fresh and sweet it keeps leeby in my memory  away up in the glen my lonely schoolhouse lying deep as one might say in a sea of snow i had many hours in the years long by for thinking of my friends in thrums and mapping out the future of leeby and jamie  i saw hendry and jess taken to the churchyard and leeby left alone in the house  i saw jamie fulfil his promise to his mother and take leeby that stainless young woman far away to london where they had a home together  ah but these were only the idle dreams of a dominie  the lord willed it otherwise     chapter xix  a tale of a glove  so long as jamie was not the lad jess twinkled gleefully over tales of sweethearting  there was little kitty lamby who used to skip in of an evening and squatting on a stool near the window unwind the roll of her enormities  a wheedling thing she was with an ambition to drive men crazy but my presence killed the gossip on her tongue though i liked to look at her  when i entered the wag at the wa clock had again possession of the kitchen  i never heard more than the end of a sentence  an did he really say he would fling himsel into the dam kitty  ortrue as death jess he kissed me  then i wandered away from the kitchen where i was not wanted and marvelled to know that jess of the tender heart laughed most merrily when he really did say that he was going straight to the dam  as no body was found in the dam in those days whoever he was he must have thought better of it  but let kitty or any other maid cast a glinting eye on jamie then jess no longer smiled  if he returned the glance she sat silent in her chair till leeby laughed away her fears  jamies no the kind mother leeby would say  na hes quiet but he sees through them  they dinna draw his leg get over him  ye never can tell leeby  the laddies ats maist ill to get sometimes gangs up in a flame a at aince like a bit o paper  ay weel at ony rate jamies no on fire yet  though clever beyond her neighbours jess lost all her sharpness if they spoke of a lassie for jamie  i warrant tibbie birse said one day in my hearing at theres some leddie in london hes thinkin o  ay hes been a guid laddie to ye but i the course o nature hell be settlin dune soon  jess did not answer but she was a picture of woe  yere lettin what tibbie birse said lie on yer mind leeby remarked when tibbie was gone  what can it maiter what she thinks  i canna help it leeby said jess  na an i canna bear to think o jamie bein mairit  it would lay me low to loss my laddie  no yet no yet  but mother said leeby quoting from the minister at weddings ye wouldna be lossin a son but juist gainin a dochter  dinna haver leeby answered jess i want nane o thae dochters na na  this talk took place while we were still awaiting jamies coming  he had only been with us one day when jess made a terrible discovery  she was looking so mournful when i saw her that i asked leeby what was wrong  shes brocht it on hersel said leeby  ye see she was up sune i the mornin to begin to the darnin o jamies stockins an to warm his sark at the fire afore he put it on  he woke up an cried to her at he wasna accustomed to haen his things warmed for him  ay he cried it oot fell thrawn so she took it into her head at there was something in his pouch he didna want her to see  she was even onaisy last nicht  i asked what had aroused jesss suspicions last night  ou ye would notice at she sat devourin him wi her een she was so lifted up at haen im again  weel she says noo at she saw im twa or three times put his hand in his pouch as if he was findin to mak sure at something was safe  so when he fell asleep again this mornin she got haud o his jacket to see if there was onything int  i advised her no to dot but she couldna help herself  she put in her hand an pud it oot  thats whats makkin her look sae ill  but what was it she found  did i no tell ye  im gaen dottle i think  it was a glove a womans glove in a bit paper  ay though shes sittin still shes near frantic  i said i supposed jess had put the glove back in jamies pocket  na said leeby deed no  she wanted to fling it on the back o the fire but i wouldna let her  thats it she has aneath her apron  later in the day i remarked to leeby that jamie was very dull  hes missed it she explained  has any one mentioned it to him i asked or has he inquired about it  na said leeby there hasna been a syltup syllable aboot it  my mothers fleid to mentiont an he doesna like to speak aboot it either  perhaps he thinks he has lost it  nae fear o him leeby said  na he kens fine wha hast  i never knew how jamie came by the glove nor whether it had originally belonged to her who made him forget the window at the top of the brae at the time i looked on as at playacting rejoicing in the happy ending  alas in the real life how are we to know when we have reached an end  but this glove i say may not have been that womans and if it was she had not then bedevilled him  he was too sheepish to demand it back from his mother and already he cared for it too much to laugh at jesss theft with leeby  so it was that a curious game at chess was played with the glove the players a silent pair  jamie cared little to read books but on the day following jesss discovery i found him on his knees in the attic looking through mine a little box without a lid held them all but they seemed a great library to him  theres readin for a lifetime in them he said  i was juist takkin a look through them  his face was guilty however as if his hand had been caught in a moneybag and i wondered what had enticed the lad to my books  i was still standing pondering when leeby ran up the stair she was so active that she generally ran and she grudged the time lost in recovering her breath  ill put yer books richt she said making her word good as she spoke  i kent jamie had been ransackin up here though he came up rale canny  ay ye would notice he was in his stockin soles  i had not noticed this but i remembered now his slipping from the room very softly  if he wanted a book i told leeby he could have got it without any display of cunning  its no a book hes lookin for she said na its his glove  the time of day was early for leeby to gossip but i detained her for a moment  my mothers hodded hid it she explained an he winna speir nae queistions  but hes lookin fort  he was ben in the room searchin the drawers when i was up i the toon in the forenoon  ye see he pretends no to be carin afore me an though my mothers sittin sae quietlike at the window shes hearkenin a the time  ay an he thocht i had hod it up here  but where i asked was the glove hid  i ken nae mair than yersel said leeby  my mothers gien to hoddin things  she has a place aneath the bed whaur she keeps the siller an shes no speakin aboot the glove to me noo because she thinks jamie an mes in comp company  i speired at her whaur she had hod it but she juist said what would i be doin hoddint  shell never admit to me at she hods the siller either  next day leeby came to me with the latest news  hes found it she said ay hes got the glove again  ye see what put him on the wrang scent was a notion at i had put it some gait  he kent at if shed hod it the kitchen maun be the place but he thocht shed gien it to me to hod  he came upont by accident  it was aneath the paddin o her chair  here i thought was the end of the glove incident but i was mistaken there were no presses or drawers with locks in the house and jess got hold of the glove again  i suppose she had reasoned out no line of action  she merely hated the thought that jamie should have a womans glove in his possession  she beats a wi cuteness leeby said to me  jamie didna put the glove back in his pouch  na he kens her ower weel by this time  she was up though lang afore he was wauken an she gaed almost strecht to the place whaur he had hod it  i believe she lay waukin a nicht thinkin oot whaur it would be  ay it was aneath the mattress  i saw her hoddent i the back o the drawer but i didna let on  i quite believed leeby when she told me afterwards that she had watched jamie feeling beneath the mattress  he had a face she said i assure ye he had a face when he discovered the glove was gone again  he maun be terrible taen up aboot it jess said to leeby or he wouldna keep it aneath the mattress  od said leeby it was yersel at drove him tot  again jamie recovered his property and again jess got hold of it this time he looked in vain  i learnt the fate of the glove from leeby  ye mind at she keepit him at hame frae the kirk on sabbath because he had a cauld leeby said  ay me or my father would hae a gey ill cauld afore she would lets bide at hame frae the kirk but jamies different  weel mair than ance shes been near speakin to im aboot the glove but she grew fleid aye  she was so terrified there was something int  on sabbath though she had him to hersel an he wasna so bright as usual  she sat wi the bible on her lap pretendin to read but a the time she was takkin keeks glances at him  i dinna ken at he was broodin ower the glove but she thocht he was an just afore the kirk came oot she couldna stand it nae langer  she put her hand in her pouch an pud oot the glove wi the paper round it just as it had been when she came upont  thats yours jamie she said it was illdune o me to tak it but i couldna help it  jamie put oot his hand an syne he drewt back  its no a thing o nae consequence mother he said  wha is she jamie my mother said  he turned awa his heidso she telt me  its a lassie in london he said i dinna ken her muckle  ye maun ken her weel my mother persisted to be carryin aboot her glove im dootin yere gey fond o her jamie  na said jamie am no  theres no naebody i care for like yersel mother  ye wouldna carry aboot onything o mine jamie my mother said but he says oh mother i carry aboot yer face wi me aye an sometimes at nicht i kind o greet to think o ye  ay after that ive nae doot he was sittin wi his airms aboot her she didna tell me that but weel he kens its what she likes an she maks nae pretence o its no bein  but for a he said an did she noticed him put the glove back in his inside pouch  its wrang o me jamie she said but i canna bear to think o ye carryin that aboot sae carefu  no i canna help it  weel jamie the crittur took it oot o his pouch an kind o hesitated  syne he layst on the back o the fire an they sat thegither glowerin at it  noo mother he says youre satisfied are ye no  ay leeby ended her story she said she was satisfied  but she saw at he laid it on the fire fell fondlike     chapter xx  the last night  juist another sax nichts jamie jess would say sadly  juist fower nichts noo an youll be awa  even as she spoke seemed to come the last night  the last night  reserve slipped unheeded to the floor  hendry wandered ben and but the house and jamie sat at the window holding his mothers hand  you must walk softly now if you would cross that humble threshold  i stop at the door  then as now i was a lonely man and when the last night came the attic was the place for me  this family affection how good and beautiful it is  men and maids love and after many years they may rise to this  it is the grand proof of the goodness in human nature for it means that the more we see of each other the more we find that is lovable  if you would cease to dislike a man try to get nearer his heart  leeby had no longer any excuse for bustling about  everything was readytoo soon  hendry had been to the fishcadger in the square to get a bervie for jamies supper and jamie had eaten it trying to look as if it made him happier  his little box was packed and strapped and stood terribly conspicuous against the dresser  jess had packed it herself  ye mauna trachle trouble yersel mother jamie said when she had the empty box pulled toward her  leeby was wiser  let her dot she whispered itll keep her frae broodin  jess tied ends of yarn round the stockings to keep them in a little bundle by themselves  so she did with all the other articles  no at its ony great affair she said for on the last night they were all thirsting to do something for jamie that would be a great affair to him  ah ye would wonder mother jamie said when i open my box an find athing tied up wi strings sae careful it a comes back to me wi a rush wha did it an am as fond o thae strings as though they were a grand present  theres the pocky bag ye gae mi to keep sewin things in  i get the wifie i lodge wi to sew to me but often when i come upon the pocky i sit an look at it  two chairs were backed to the fire with underclothing hanging upside down on them  from the string over the fireplace dangled two pairs of muchdarned stockings  yell put on baith thae pair o stockins jamie said jess juist to please me  when he arrived he had rebelled against the extra clothing  ay will i mother he said now  jess put her hand fondly through his ugly hair  how handsome she thought him  ye have a fine brow jamie she said  i mind the day ye was born sayin to mysel at ye had a fine brow  but ye thocht he was to be a lassie mother said leeby  na leeby i didna  i kept sayin i thocht he would be a lassie because i was fleid he would be but a the time i had a presentiment he would be a laddie  it was wi joey deein sae sudden an i took on sae terrible aboot im at i thocht all alang the lord would gie me another laddie  ay i wanted im to be a laddie mysel said hendry so as he could tak joeys place  jesss head jerked back involuntarily and jamie may have felt her hand shake for he said in a voice out of hendrys hearing  i never took joeys place wi ye mother  jess pressed his hand tightly in her two worn palms but she did not speak  jamie was richt like joey when he was a bairn hendry said  again jesss head moved but still she was silent  they were sae like continued hendry at often i called jamie by joeys name  jess looked at her husband and her mouth opened and shut  i canna mind at you ever did that hendry said  she shook her head  na said hendry you never mixed them up  i dinna think ye ever missed joey sae sair as i did  leeby went ben and stood in the room in the dark jamie knew why  ill just gang ben an speak to leeby for a meenute he said to his mother ill no be lang  ay do that jamie said jess  what leebys been to me nae tongue can tell  ye canna bear to hear me speak i ken o the time when hendry an mell be awa but jamie when that time comes yell no forget leeby  i winna mother i winna said jamie  therell never be a roof ower me ats no hers too  he went ben and shut the door  i do not know what he and leeby said many a time since their earliest youth had these two been closeted together often to make up their little quarrels in each others arms they remained a long time in the room the shabby room of which jess and leeby were so proud and whatever might be their fears about their mother they were not anxious for themselves  leeby was feeling lusty and well and she could not know that jamie required to be reminded of his duty to the folk at home  jamie would have laughed at the notion yet that woman in london must have been waiting for him even then leeby who was about to die and jamie who was to forget his mother came back to the kitchen with a happy light on their faces  i have with me still the look of love they gave each other before jamie crossed over to jess  yell gang anower noo mother leeby said meaning that it was jesss bedtime  no yet leeby jess answered ill sit up till the readins ower  i think ye should gang mother jamie said an ill come an sit aside ye after yere i yer bed  ay jamie ill no hae ye to sit aside me the morns nicht an hap cover me wi the claes  but yell gang suner to yer bed mother  i may gang but i winna sleep  ill aye be thinkin o ye tossin on the sea  i pray for ye a lang time ilka nicht jamie  ay i ken  an i pictur ye ilka hour o the day  ye never gang hame through thae terrible streets at nicht but im thinkin o ye  i would try no to be sae sad mother said leeby  weve haen a richt fine time have we no  its been an awfu happy time said jess  weve haen a pleasantness in oor lives at comes to few  i ken naebody ats haen sae muckle happiness one wy or another  its because yere sae guid mother said jamie  na jamie am no guid ava  its because my fowks been sae guid you an hendry an leeby an joey when he was livin  ive got a lot mair than my deserts  well juist look to meetin next year again mother  to think o that keeps me up a the winter  ay if its the lords will jamie but am gey dune noo an hendrys fell worn too  jamie the boy that he was said dinna speak like that mother and jess again put her hand on his head  fine i ken jamie she said at all my days on this earth be they short or lang ive you for a staff to lean on  ah many years have gone since then but if jamie be living now he has still those words to swallow  by and by leeby went ben for the bible and put it into hendrys hands he slowly turned over the leaves to his favourite chapter the fourteenth of johns gospel  always on eventful occasions did hendry turn to the fourteenth of john  let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me  in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you  i go to prepare a place for you  as hendry raised his voice to read there was a great stillness in the kitchen  i do not know that i have been able to show in the most imperfect way what kind of man hendry was  he was dense in many things and the cleverness that was jesss had been denied to him  he had less booklearning than most of those with whom he passed his days and he had little skill in talk  i have not known a man more easily taken in by persons whose speech had two faces  but a more simple modest upright man there never was in thrums and i shall always revere his memory  and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also  the voice may have been monotonous  i have always thought that hendrys reading of the bible was the most solemn and impressive i have ever heard  he exulted in the fourteenth of john pouring it forth like one whom it intoxicated while he read  he emphasized every other word it was so real and grand to him  we went upon our knees while hendry prayed all but jess who could not  jamie buried his face in her lap  the words hendry said were those he used every night  some perhaps would have smiled at his prayer to god that we be not puffed up with riches nor with the things of this world  his head shook with emotion while he prayed and he brought us very near to the throne of grace  do thou o our god he said in conclusion spread thy guiding hand over him whom in thy great mercy thou hast brought to us again and do thou guard him through the perils which come unto those that go down to the sea in ships  let not our hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid for this is not our abiding home and may we all meet in thy house where there are many mansions and where there will be no last night  amen  it was a silent kitchen after that though the lamp burned long in jesss window  by its meagre light you may take a final glance at the little family you will never see them together again     chapter xxi  jess left alone  there may be a few who care to know how the lives of jess and hendry ended  leeby died in the backend of the year i have been speaking of and as i was snowed up in the schoolhouse at the time i heard the news from gavin birse too late to attend her funeral  she got her death on the commonty one day of sudden rain when she had run out to bring in her washing for the terrible cold she woke with next morning carried her off very quickly  leeby did not blame jamie for not coming to her nor did i for i knew that even in the presence of death the poor must drag their chains  he never got hendrys letter with the news and we know now that he was already in the hands of her who played the devil with his life  before the spring came he had been lost to jess  them at has got sae mony blessins mair than the generality hendry said to me one day when craigiebuckle had given me a lift into thrums has nae shame if they would pray aye for mair  the lord has gien this hoose sae muckle at to pray for muir looks like no bein thankfu for what weve got  ay but i canna help prayin to him at in his great mercy hell take jess afore me  no at leebys gone an jamie never lets us hear frae him i canna gulp doon the thocht o jess bein left alane  this was a prayer that hendry may be pardoned for having so often in his heart though god did not think fit to grant it  in thrums when a weaver died his womenfolk had to take his seat at the loom and those who by reason of infirmities could not do so went to a place the name of which i thank god i am not compelled to write in this chapter  i could not even at this day have told any episodes in the life of jess had it ended in the poorhouse  hendry would probably have recovered from the fever had not this terrible dread darkened his intellect when he was still prostrate  he was lying in the kitchen when i saw him last in life and his parting words must be sadder to the reader than they were to me  ay richt ye are he said in a voice that had become a childs i hae muckle muckle to be thankfu for an no the least is at baith me an jess has aye belonged to a bural society  we hae nae cause to be anxious aboot a thing bein dune rerespectable aince were gone it was jess at insisted on oor joinin a the wisest things i ever did i was put up to by her  i parted from hendry cheered by the doctors report but the old weaver died a few days afterwards  his end was mournful yet i can recall it now as the not unworthy close of a good mans life  one night poor worn jess had been helped ben into the room tibbie birse having undertaken to sit up with hendry  jess slept for the first time for many days and as the night was dying tibbie fell asleep too hendry had been better than usual lying quietly tibbie said and the fever was gone  about three oclock tibbie woke and rose to mend the fire  then she saw that hendry was not in his bed  tibbie went ben the house in her stockingsoles but jess heard her  what ist tibbie she asked anxiously  ou its no naething tibbie said hes lyin rale quiet  then she went up to the attic  hendry was not in the house  she opened the door gently and stole out  it was not snowing but there had been a heavy fall two days before and the night was windy a tearing gale had blown the upper part of the brae clear and from tnowheads fields the snow was rising like smoke  tibbie ran to the farm and woke up tnowhead  for an hour they looked in vain for hendry  at last some one asked who was working in elshioners shop all night  this was the long earthenfloored room in which hendrys loom stood with three others  itll be sanders whamond likely tnowhead said and the other men nodded  but it happened that tnowheads bell who had flung on a wrapper and hastened across to sit with jess heard of the light in elshioners shop  its hendry she cried and then every one moved toward the workshop  the light at the diminutive yarncovered window was pale and dim but bell who was at the house first could make the most of a cruizeys glimmer  its him she said and then with swelling throat she ran back to jess  the door of the workshop was wide open held against the wall by the wind  tnowhead and the others went in  the cruizey stood on the little window  hendrys back was to the door and he was leaning forward on the silent loom  he had been dead for some time but his fellowworkers saw that he must have weaved for nearly an hour  so it came about that for the last few months of her pilgrimage jess was left alone  yet i may not say that she was alone  jamie who should have been with her was undergoing his own ordeal far away where we did not now even know  but though the poorhouse stands in thrums where all may see it the neighbours did not think only of themselves  than thomas haggart there can scarcely have been a poorer man but tammas was the first to come forward with offer of help  to the day of jesss death he did not once fail to carry her water to her in the morning and the luxuriously living men of thrums in those present days of pumps at every corner can hardly realize what that meant  often there were lines of people at the well by three oclock in the morning and each had to wait his turn  tammas filled his own pitcher and pan and then had to take his place at the end of the line with jesss pitcher and pan to wait his turn again  his own house was in the tenements far from the brae in winter time but he always said to jess it was naething ava  every saturday old robbie angus sent a bag of sticks and shavings from the sawmill by his little son rob who was afterwards to become a man for speaking about at nights  of all the friends that jess and hendry had tnowhead was the ablest to help and the sweetest memory i have of the farmer and his wife is the delicate way they offered it  you who read will see jess wince at the offer of charity  but the poor have fine feelings beneath the grime as you will discover if you care to look for them and when jess said she would bake if any one would buy you would wonder to hear how many kindly folk came to her door for scones  she had the house to herself at nights but tibbie birse was with her early in the morning and other neighbours dropped in  not for long did she have to wait the summons to the better home  na she said to the minister who has told me that he was a better man from knowing her my thochts is no nane set on the vanities o the world noo  i kenra hoo i could ever hae haen sic an ambeetion to hae thae stuffbottomed chairs  i have tried to keep away from jamie whom the neighbours sometimes upbraided in her presence  it is of him you who read would like to hear and i cannot pretend that jess did not sit at her window looking for him  even when she was bakin tibbie told me she aye had an eye on the brae  if jamie had come at ony time when it was licht she would hae seen im as sune as he turned the corner  if he ever comes back the sacket rascal tnowhead said to jess well show im the door gey quick  jess just looked and all the women knew how she would take jamie to her arms  we did not know of the london woman then and jess never knew of her jamies mother never for an hour allowed that he had become anything but the loving laddie of his youth  i ken im ower weel she always said my ain jamie  toward the end she was sure he was dead  i do not know when she first made up her mind to this nor whether it was not merely a phrase for those who wanted to discuss him with her  i know that she still sat at the window looking at the elbow of the brae  the minister was with her when she died  she was in her chair and he asked her as was his custom if there was any particular chapter which she would like him to read  since her husbands death she had always asked for the fourteenth of john hendrys chapter as it is still called among a very few old people in thrums  this time she asked him to read the sixteenth chapter of genesis  when i came to the thirteenth verse the minister told me and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her  thou god seest me she covered her face with her two hands and said joeys text joeys text  oh but i grudged ye sair joey  i shut the book the minister said when i came to the end of the chapter and then i saw that she was dead  it is my belief that her heart broke oneandtwenty years ago     chapter xxii  jamies homecoming  on a summer day when the sun was in the weavers workshops and bairns hopped solemnly at the game of palaulays or gaily shook their bottles of sugarelly water into a froth jamie came back  the first man to see him was hookey crewe the post  when he came frae london hookey said afterwards at tnowheads pigsty jamie used to wait for me at zoar i the north end o tilliedrum  he carried his box ower the market muir an sat ont at zoar waitin for me to catch im up  ay the day afore yesterday me an the powny was clatterin by zoar when there was jamie standin in his identical place  he hadna nae box to sit upon an he was far frae bein weel in order but i kent im at aince an i saw at he was waitin for me  so i drew up an waved my hand to im  i would hae drove straucht by im said tnowhead them at leaves their auld mother to want doesna deserve a lift  ay ye say that sittin there hookey said but lads i saw his face an as sure as death it was sic an awfu meeserable face at i couldna but pu the powny up  weel he stood for the space o a meenute lookin straucht at me as if he would like to come forrit but dauredna an syne he turned an strided awa ower the muir like a huntit thing  i sat still i the cart an when he was far awa he stoppit an lookit again but a my cryin wouldna bring him a step back an i the end i drove on  ive thocht since syne at he didna ken whether his fowk was livin or deid an was fleid to speir  he didna ken said tnowhead but the faut was his ain  its ower late to be taen up aboot jess noo  ay ay tnowhead said hookey its aisy to you to speak like that ye didna see his face  it is believed that jamie walked from tilliedrum though no one is known to have met him on the road  some two hours after the post left him he was seen by old rob angus at the sawmill  i was sawin awa wi a my micht rob said an little rob was haudin the booards for they were silly but things when something made me look at the window  it couldna hae been a tap ont for the birds has used me to that an it would hardly be a shadow for little rob didna look up  whatever it was i stoppit i the middle o a booard an lookit up an there i saw jamie mcqumpha  he joukit back when our een met but i saw him weel ay its a queer thing to say but he had the face o a man at had come straucht frae hell  i stood starin at the window angus continued after hed gone an robbie cried oot to ken what was the maiter wi me  ay that brocht me back to mysel an i hurried oot to look for jamie but he wasna to be seen  that face gae me a turn  from the sawmill to the house at the top of the brae some may remember the road is up the commonty  i do not think any one saw jamie on the commonty though there were those to say they met him  he gae me sic a look a woman said at i was fleid an ran hame but she did not tell the story until jamies homecoming had become a legend  there were many women hanging out their washing on the commonty that day and none of them saw him  i think jamie must have approached his old home by the fields and probably he held back until gloaming  the young woman who was now mistress of the house at the top of the brae both saw and spoke with jamie  twa or three times she said i had seen a man walk quick up the brae an by the door  it was gettin dark but i noticed at he was short an thin an i would hae said he wasna nane weel if it hadna been at he gaed by at sic a steek  he didna look our wyat least no when he was close up an i set im doon for some gaen aboot body na i saw naething aboot im to be fleid at  the aucht oclock bell was ringin when i saw im to speak to  my twayearauld bairn was standin aboot the door an i was makkin some porridge for my mans supper when i heard the bairny skirlin  she came runnin in to the hoose an hung i my wrapper an she was hingin there when i gaed to the door to see what was wrang  it was the man id seen passin the hoose  he was standin at the gate which as abody kens is but sax steps frae the hoose an i wondered at im neither runnin awa nor comin forrit  i speired at im what he meant by terrifyin a bairn but he didna say naething  he juist stood  it was ower dark to see his face richt an i wasna nane taen aback yet no till he spoke  oh but he had a fearsome word when he did speak  it was a kind o like a man hoarse wi a cauld an yet no that either  wha bides i this hoose he said ay standin there  its davit patullos hoose i said an am the wife  whaurs hendry mcqumpha he speired  hes deid i said  he stood still for a fell while  an his wife jess he said  shes deid too i said  i thocht he gae a groan but it may hae been the gate  there was a dochter leeby he said  ay i said she was taen first  i saw im put up his hands to his face an he cried out leeby too an syne he kind o fell agin the dyke  i never kent im nor nane o his fowk but i had heard aboot them an i saw at it would be the son frae london  it wasna for me to judge im an i said to im would he no come in by an tak a rest  i was nearer im by that time an its an awfu haver to say at he had a face to frichten fowk  it was a rale guid face but no ava what a body would like to see on a young man  i felt mair like greetin mysel when i saw his face than drawin awa frae im  but he wouldna come in  rest he said like ane speakin to imsel na theres nae mair rest for me  i didna weel ken what mair to say to im for he aye stood on an i wasna even sure at he saw me  he raised his heid when he heard me tellin the bairn no to tear my wrapper  dinna set yer heart ower muckle on that bairn he cried oot sharp like  i was aince like her an i used to hing aboot my mother too in that very roady  ay i thocht i was fond o her an she thocht it too  tak a care wuman at that bairn doesna grow up to murder ye  he gae a lauch when he saw me tak haud o the bairn an syne a at aince he gaed awa quick  but he wasna far doon the brae when he turned an came back  yell mebbe tell me he said richt low if ye hae the furniture at used to be my mothers  na i said it was roupit an i kenna whaur the things gaed for me an my man comes frae tilliedrum  ye wouldna hae heard he said wha got the muckle airmchair at used to sit i the kitchen i the window at looks ower the brae  i couldna be sure i said but there was an airmchair at gaed to tibbie birse  if it was the ane ye mean it a gaed to bits an i think they burned it  it was gey dune  ay he said it was gey dune  there was the chairs ben i the room he said after a while  i said i thocht sanders elshioner

gaed doon the brae  we learnt afterwards from the gravedigger that some one spent great part of that night in the graveyard and we believe it to have been jamie  he walked up the glen to the schoolhouse next forenoon and i went out to meet him when i saw him coming down the path  ay he said its me come back  i wanted to take him into the house and speak with him of his mother but he would not cross the threshold  i came oot he said to see if ye would gie me her staffno at i deserve t  i brought out the staff and handed it to him thinking that he and i would soon meet again  as he took it i saw that his eyes were sunk back into his head  two great tears hung on his eyelids and his mouth closed in agony  he stared at me till the tears fell upon his cheeks and then he went away  that evening he was seen by many persons crossing the square  he went up the brae to his old home and asked leave to go through the house for the last time  first he climbed up into the attic and stood looking in his feet still on the stair  then he came down and stood at the door of the room but he went into the kitchen  ill ask one last favour o ye he said to the woman i would like ye to leave me here alane for juist a little while  i gaed oot the woman said meanin to leave im to imsel but my bairn wouldna come an he said never mind her so i left her wi im an closed the door  he was in a lang time but i never kent what he did for the bairn juist aye greets when i speir at her  i watched im frae the corner window gang doon the brae till he came to the corner  i thocht he turned round there an stood lookin at the hoose  he would see me better than i saw him for my lamp was i the window whaur ive heard tell his mother keepit her cruizey  when my man came in i speired at im if hed seen onybody standin at the corner o the brae an he said he thocht hed seen somebody wi a little staff in his hand  davit gaed doon to see if he was aye there after suppertime but he was gone  jamie was never again seen in thrums
