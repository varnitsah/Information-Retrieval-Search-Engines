chronological order  the affair of james de la cloche only attracted the authors attention after most of the volume was in print  but any reader curious in the veiled intrigues of the restoration will probably find it convenient to peruse the mystery of james de la cloche after the essay on the valets master as the puzzling adventures of de la cloche occurred in the years 16681669 when the valet was consigned to lifelong captivity and the master was broken on the wheel  what would have been done to giacopo stuardo had he been a subject of louis xiv tis better only guessing  but his fate whoever he may have been lay in the hands of lord ailesburys good king charles ii and so he had a good deliverance  the author is well aware that whosoever discusses historical mysteries pleases the public best by being quite sure and offering a definite and certain solution  unluckily science forbids and conscience is on the same side  we verily do not know how the false pucelle arrived at her success with the family of the true maid we do not know or pretend to know who killed sir edmund berry godfrey or how amy robsart came by her death or why the valet was so important a prisoner  it is only possible to restate the cases and remove if we may the errors and confusions which beset the problems  such a tiny point as the year of amy robsarts marriage is stated variously by our historians  to ascertain the truth gave the author half a days work and at last he would have voted for the wrong year had he not been aided by the superior acuteness of his friend mr hay fleming  he feels morally certain that in trying to set historians right about amy robsart he must have committed some conspicuous blunders these always attend such enterprises of rectification  with regard to sir edmund berry godfrey mr a w crawleyboevey points out to me that in an unpublished letter of mr alexander herbert phaire in 174344 addit mss british museum 4291 fol 150 godfrey is spoken of in connection with his friend valentine greatrakes the miraculous conformist or irish stroker of the restoration  it is a pity mr phaire remarks that sir edmunds letters to the number of 104 are not in somebodys hands that would oblige the world by publishing them  they contain many remarkable things and the best and truest secret history in king charles iis reign  where are these letters now  mr phaire does not say to whom they were addressed perhaps to greatrakes who named his second son after sir edmund or to colonel phaire the regicide  this mr phaire of 1744 was of colonel phaires family it does not seem quite certain whether le fevre or lee phaire was the real name of the socalled jesuit whom bedloe accused of the murder of sir edmund  of the studies here presented the valets master the mystery of sir edmund berry godfrey the false jeanne darc the mystery of amy robsart and the mystery of james de la cloche are now published for the first time  part of the voices of jeanne darc is from a paper by the author in the proceedings of the society for psychical research  the valets tragedy is mainly from an article in the monthly review revised corrected and augmented the queens marie is a recast of a paper in blackwoods magazine the truth about fishers ghost and junius and lord lytteltons ghost are reprinted with little change from the same periodical  the mystery of lord bateman is a recast of an article in the cornhill magazine  the earlier part of the essay on shakespeare and bacon appeared in the quarterly review  the author is obliged to the courtesy of the proprietors and editors of these serials for permission to use his essays again with revision and additions  essays by the author on the false pucelle and on sir edmund berry godfrey have appeared in the nineteenth century 1895 and in the cornhill magazine but these are not the papers here presented  the author is deeply indebted to the generous assistance of father gerard and father pollen sj and for making transcripts of unpublished documents to miss e m thompson and miss violet simpson  since passing the volume for the press the author has received from mr austin west at rome a summary of armannis letter about giacopo stuardo  he is led thereby to the conclusion that giacopo was identical with the eldest son of charles iijames de la clochebut conceives that at the end of his life james was insane or at least was a megalomaniac or was not author of his own will      i the valets tragedy    1  the legend of the man in the iron mask  the mystery of the man in the iron mask is despite a pleasant saying of lord beaconsfields one of the most fascinating in history  by a curious coincidence the wildest legend on the subject and the correct explanation of the problem were offered to the world in the same year 1801  according to this form of the legend the man in the iron mask was the genuine louis xiv deprived of his rights in favour of a child of anne of austria and of mazarin  immured in the isles saintemarguerite in the bay of cannes where you are shown his cell looking north to the sunny town he married and begot a son  that son was carried to corsica was named de buona parte and was the ancestor of napoleon the emperor was thus the legitimate representative of the house of bourbon  this legend was circulated in 1801 and is referred to in a proclamation of the royalists of la vendee  in the same year 1801 roux fazaillac a citoyen and a revolutionary legislator published a work in which he asserted that the man in the iron mask as known in rumour was not one man but a myth in which the actual facts concerning at least two men were blended  it is certain that roux fazaillac was right or that if he was wrong the man in the iron mask was an obscure valet of french birth residing in england whose real name was martin  before we enter on the topic of this poor menials tragic history it may be as well to trace the progress of the romantic legend as it blossomed after the death of the man whose mask was not of iron but of black velvet  later we shall show how the legend struck root and flowered from the moment when the poor valet martin by his prison pseudonym eustache dauger was immured in the french fortress of pignerol in piedmont august 1669  the man in connection with the mask is first known to us from a kind of notebook kept by du junca lieutenant of the bastille  on september 18 1698 he records the arrival of the new governor of the bastille m de saintmars bringing with him from his last place the isles saintemarguerite in the bay of cannes an old prisoner whom he had at pignerol  he keeps the prisoner always masked his name is not spoken   and i have put him alone in the third chamber of the bertaudiere tower having furnished it some days before with everything by order of m de saintmars  the prisoner is to be served and cared for by m de rosarges the officer next in command under saintmars  funckbrentano legendes et archives de la bastille pp 86 87 paris 1898 p 277 a facsimile of this entry  the prisoners death is entered by du junca on november 19 1703 to that entry we return later  the existence of this prisoner was known and excited curiosity  on october 15 1711 the princess palatine wrote about the case to the electress sophia of hanover a man lived for long years in the bastille masked and masked he died there  two musketeers were by his side to shoot him if ever he unmasked  he ate and slept in his mask  there must doubtless have been some good reason for this as otherwise he was very well treated well lodged and had everything given to him that he wanted  he took the communion masked was very devout and read perpetually  on october 22 1711 the princess writes that the mask was an english nobleman mixed up in the plot of the duke of berwick against william iiifenwicks affair is meant  he was imprisoned and masked that the dutch usurper might never know what had become of him   op cit 98 note 1  the legend was now afloat in society  the subcommandant of the bastille from 1749 to 1787 chevalier declared obviously on the evidence of tradition that all the masks furniture and clothes were destroyed at his death lest they might yield a clue to his identity  louis xv is said to have told madame de pompadour that the mask was the minister of an italian prince  louis xvi told marie antoinette according to madame de campan that the mask was a mantuan intriguer the same person as louis xv indicated  perhaps he was it is one of two possible alternatives  voltaire in the first edition of his siecle de louis xiv merely spoke of a young handsome masked prisoner treated with the highest respect by louvois the minister of louis xiv  at last in questions sur lencyclopedie second edition voltaire averred that the mask was the son of anne of austria and mazarin an elder brother of louis xiv  changes were rung on this note  the mask was the actual king louis xiv was a bastard  others held that he was james duke of monmouthor moliere  in 1770 heiss identified him with mattioli the mantuan intriguer and especially after the appearance of the book by roux fazaillac in 1801 that was the generally accepted opinion  it may be true in part  mattioli may have been the prisoner who died in the bastille in november 1703 but the legend of the masks prison life undeniably arose out of the adventure of our valet martin or eustache dauger    2  the valets history    after reading the arguments of the advocates of mattioli i could not but perceive that whatever captive died masked at the bastille in 1703 the valet dauger was the real source of most of the legends about the man in the iron mask  a study of m lairs book nicholas foucquet 1890 confirmed this opinion  i therefore pushed the inquiry into a source neglected by the french historians namely the correspondence of the english ambassadors agents and statesmen for the years 1668 1669  one result is to confirm a wild theory of my own to the effect that the man in the iron mask if dauger were he may have been as great a mystery to himself as to historical inquirers  he may not have known what he was imprisoned for doing  more important is the probable conclusion that the long and mysterious captivity of eustache dauger and of another perfectly harmless valet and victim was the mere automatic result of the red tape of the old french absolute monarchy  these wretches were caught in the toils of the system and suffered to no purpose for no crime  the two men at least dauger were apparently mere supernumeraries in the obscure intrigue of a conspirator known as roux de marsilly  the papers are in the record office for the contents see the following essay the valets master  this truly abominable tragedy of roux de marsilly is another story narrated in the following essay  it must suffice here to say that in 1669 while charles ii was negotiating the famous or infamous secret treaty with louis xivthe treaty of alliance against holland and in favour of the restoration of roman catholicism in englandroux de marsilly a french huguenot was dealing with arlington and others in favour of a protestant league against france  when he started from england for switzerland in february 1669 marsilly left in london a valet called by him martin who had quitted his service and was living with his own family  this man is the eustache dauger of our mystery  the name is his prison pseudonym as lestang was that of mattioli  the french government was anxious to lay hands on him for he had certainly as the letters of marsilly prove come and gone freely between that conspirator and his english employers  how much dauger knew what amount of mischief he could effect was uncertain  much or little it was a matter which strange to say caused the greatest anxiety to louis xiv and to his ministers for very many years  probably long before dauger died the date is unknown but it was more than twentyfive years after marsillys execution his secret if secret he possessed had ceased to be of importance  but he was now in the toils of the french red tape the system of secrecy which rarely released its victim  he was guarded we shall see with such unheardof rigour that popular fancy at once took him for some great perhaps royal personage  marsilly was publicly tortured to death in paris on june 22 1669 by july 19 his exvalet dauger had entered on his mysterious term of captivity  how the french got possession of him whether he yielded to cajolery or was betrayed by charles ii is uncertain the french ambassador at st jamess colbert brother of the celebrated minister writes thus to m de lyonne in paris on july 1 1669  monsieur joly has spoken to the man martin dauger and has really persuaded him that by going to france and telling all that he knows against roux he will play the part of a lad of honour and a good subject  transcripts from paris mss vol xxxiii record office  but martin after all was not persuaded  martin replied to joly that he knew nothing at all and that once in france people would think he was well acquainted with the traffickings of roux and so he would be kept in prison to make him divulge what he did not know  the possible man in the iron mask did not know his own secret  but later in the conversation martin foolishly admitted that he knew a great deal perhaps he did this out of mere fatal vanity  cross to france however he would not even when offered a safeconduct and promise of reward  colbert therefore proposes to ask charles to surrender the valet and probably charles descended to the meanness  by july 19 at all events louvois the war minister of louis xiv was bidding saint mars at pignerol in piedmont expect from dunkirk a prisoner of the very highest importancea valet  this valet now called eustache dauger can only have been marsillys valet martin who by one means or another had been brought from england to dunkirk  it is hardly conceivable at least that when a valet in england is wanted by the french police on july 1 for political reasons and when by july 19 they have caught a valet of extreme political importance the two valets should be two different men  martin must be dauger  here then by july 19 1669 we find our unhappy servingman in the toils  why was he to be handled with such mysterious rigour  it is true that state prisoners of very little account were kept with great secrecy  but it cannot well be argued that they were all treated with the extraordinary precautions which in the case of dauger were not relaxed for twentyfive or thirty years  the king says according to louvois that the safe keeping of dauger is of the last importance to his service  he must have intercourse with nobody  his windows must be where nobody can pass several bolted doors must cut him off from the sound of human voices  saintmars himself the commandant must feed the valet daily  you must never under any pretence listen to what he may wish to tell you you must threaten him with death if he speaks one word except about his actual needs  he is only a valet and does not need much furniture  the letters are printed by roux fazaillac jung lair and others  saintmars replied that in presence of m de vauroy the chief officer of dunkirk who carried dauger thence to pignerol he had threatened to run dauger through the body if he ever dared to speak even to him saintmars  he has mentioned this prisoner he says to no mortal  people believe that dauger is a marshal of france so strange and unusual are the precautions taken for his security  a marshal of france  the legend has begun  at this time 1669 saintmars had in charge fouquet the great fallen minister the richest and most dangerous subject of louis xiv  byandby he also held lauzun the adventurous wooer of la grande mademoiselle  but it was not they it was the valet dauger who caused sensation  on february 201672 saintmars for the sake of economy wished to use dauger as valet to lauzun  this proves that saintmars did not after all see the necessity of secluding dauger or thought the kings fears groundless  in the opinion of saintmars dauger did not want to be released would never ask to be set free  then why was he so anxiously guarded  louvois refused to let dauger be put with lauzun as valet  in 1675 however he allowed dauger to act as valet to fouquet but with lauzun said louvois dauger must have no intercourse  fouquet had then another prisoner valet la riviere this man had apparently been accused of no crime  he was of a melancholy character and a dropsical habit of body  fouquet had amused himself by doctoring him and teaching him to read  in the month of december 1678 saintmars the commandant of the prison brought to fouquet a sealed letter from louvois the seal unbroken  his own reply was also to be sealed and not to be seen by saintmars  louvois wrote that the king wished to know one thing before giving fouquet ampler liberty  had his valet eustache dauger told his other valet la riviere what he had done before coming to pignerol de ce a quoi il a ete employe auparavant que detre a pignerol  his majesty bids me ask you fouquet this question and expects that you will answer without considering anything but the truth that he may know what measures to take these depending on whether dauger has or has not told la riviere the story of his past life  moreover lauzun was never said louvois to be allowed to enter fouquets room when dauger was present  the humorous point is that thanks to a hole dug in the wall between his room and fouquets lauzun saw dauger whenever he pleased  lair nicholas foucquet ii pp 463 464  from the letter of louvois to fouquet about dauger december 23 1678 it is plain that louis xiv had no more pressing anxiety nine years after daugers arrest than to conceal what it was that dauger had done  it is apparent that saintmars himself either was unacquainted with this secret or was supposed by louvois and the king to be unaware of it  he had been ordered never to allow dauger to tell him  he was not allowed to see the letters on the subject between louvois and fouquet  we still do not know and never shall know whether dauger himself knew his own secret or whether as he had anticipated he was locked up for not divulging what he did not know  the answer of fouquet to louvois must have satisfied louis that dauger had not imparted his secret to the other valet la riviere for fouquet was now allowed a great deal of liberty  in 1679 he might see his family the officers of the garrison and lauzunit being provided that lauzun and dauger should never meet  in march 1680 fouquet died and henceforth the two valets were most rigorously guarded dauger because he was supposed to know something la riviere because dauger might have imparted the real or fancied secret to him  we shall return to these poor serving men but here it is necessary to state that ten months before the death of their master fouquet an important new captive had been brought to the prison of pignerol  this captive was the other candidate for the honours of the mask count mattioli the secretary of the duke of mantua  he was kidnapped on italian soil on may 2 1679 and hurried to the mountain fortress of pignerol then on french ground  his offence was the betraying of the secret negotiations for the cession of the town and fortress of casal by the duke of mantua to louis xiv the disappearance of mattioli was of course known to the world the cause of his enlevement and the place of his captivity pignerol were matters of newspaper comment at least as early as 1687  still earlier in 1682 the story of mattiolis arrest and seclusion in pignerol had been published in a work named la prudenza trionfante di casale  there was thus no mystery at the time about mattioli his crime and punishment were perfectly well known to students of politics  he has been regarded as the mysterious man in the iron mask but for years after his arrest he was the least mysterious of state prisoners  brentano op cit p 117  here then is mattioli in pignerol in may 1679  while fouquet then enjoyed relative freedom while lauzun schemed escapes or made insulting love to mademoiselle fouquet mattioli lived on the bread and water of affliction  he was threatened with torture to make him deliver up some papers compromising to louis xiv  it was expressly commanded that he should have nothing beyond the barest necessaries of life  he was to be kept dans la dure prison  in brief he was used no better than the meanest of prisoners  the awful life of isolation without employment without books without writing materials without sight or sound of man save when saintmars or his lieutenant brought food for the day drove captives mad  in january 1680 two prisoners a monk and one dubreuil had become insane  by february 14 1680 mattioli was daily conversing with god and his angels  i believe his brain is turned says saint mars  in march 1680 as we saw fouquet died  the prisoners not counting lauzun released soon after were now five  1 mattioli mad 2 dubreuil mad 3 the monk mad 4 dauger and 5 la riviere  these two being employed as valets kept their wits on the death of fouquet louvois wrote to saintmars about the two valets  lauzun must be made to believe that they had been set at liberty but in fact they must be most carefully guarded in a single chamber  they were shut up in one of the dungeons of the tour den bas  dauger had recently done something as to which louvois writes  let me know how dauger can possibly have done what you tell me and how he got the necessary drugs as i cannot suppose that you supplied him with them july 10 1680  a monk who may have been this monk appears in the following essay  lair nicholas foucquet ii pp 476 477  here then by july 1680 are the two valets locked in one dungeon of the tour den bas  by september saintmars had placed mattioli with the mad monk in another chamber of the same tower he writes  mattioli is almost as mad as the monk who arose from bed and preached naked  mattioli behaved so rudely and violently that the lieutenant of saintmars had to show him a whip and threaten him with a flogging  this had its effect  mattioli to make his peace offered a valuable ring to blainvilliers  the ring was kept to be restored to him if ever louis let him go freea contingency mentioned more than once in the correspondence  apparently mattioli now sobered down and probably was given a separate chamber and a valet he certainly had a valet at pignerol later  by may 1681 dauger and la riviere still occupied their common chamber in the tour den bas  they were regarded by louvois as the most important of the five prisoners then at pignerol  they not mattioli were the captives about whose safe and secret keeping louis and louvois were most anxious  this appears from a letter of louvois to saintmars of may 12 1681 the gaoler saintmars is to be promoted from pignerol to exiles thither says louvois the king desires to transport such of your prisoners as he thinks too important to have in other hands than yours  these prisoners are the two in the low chamber of the tower the two valets dauger and la riviere  from a letter of saintmars june 1681 we know that mattioli was not one of these  he says  i shall keep at exiles two birds merles whom i have here  they are only known as the gentry of the low room in the tower mattioli may stay on here at pignerol with the other prisoners dubreuil and the mad monk  it is at this point that le citoyen roux fazaillac writing in the year ix of the republic 1801 loses touch with the secret  roux finds in the state papers the arrival of eustache dauger at pignerol in 1669 but does not know who he is or what is his quality  he sees that the mask must be either mattioli dauger the monk one dubreuil or one calazio  but overlooking or not having access to the letter of saintmars of june 1681 roux holds that the prisoners taken to les exiles were the monk and mattioli  one of these must be the mask and roux votes for mattioli  he is wrong  mattioli beyond all doubt remained at pignerol  recherches historiques sur lhomme au masque de fer paris  an ix  mountains of argument have been built on these words deux merles two gaolbirds  one of the two we shall see became the source of the legend of the man in the iron mask  how can a wretched gaolbird merle have been the mask asks m topin  the rogues whole furniture and tablelinen were sold for 1 pound 19 shillings he only got a new suit of clothes every three years  all very true but this gaolbird and his mate by the direct statement of louvois are the prisoners too important to be entrusted to other hands than yoursthe hands of saintmarswhile mattioli is so unimportant that he may be left at pignerol under villebois  the truth is that the offence and the punishment of mattioli were well known to european diplomatists and readers of books  casal moreover at this time was openly ceded to louis xiv and mattioli could not have told the world more than it already knew  but for some inscrutable reason the secret which dauger knew or was suspected of knowing became more and more a source of anxiety to louvois and louis  what can he have known  the charges against his master roux de marsilly had been publicly proclaimed  twelve years had passed since the dealings of arlington with marsilly yet louvois became more and more nervous  in accordance with commands of his on march 2 1682 the two valets who had hitherto occupied one chamber at exiles as at pignerol were cut off from all communication with each other  says saintmars since receiving your letter i have warded the pair as strictly and exactly as i did m fouquet and m lauzun who cannot brag that he sent out or received any intelligence  night and day two sentinels watch their tower and my own windows command a view of the sentinels  nobody speaks to my captives but myself my lieutenant their confessor and the doctor who lives eighteen miles away and only sees them when i am present  years went by on january 1687 one of the two captives died we really do not know which with absolute certainty  however the intensified secrecy with which the survivor was now guarded seems more appropriate to dauger and m funckbrentano and m lair have no doubt that it was la riviere who expired  he was dropsical that appears in the official correspondence and the dead prisoner died of dropsy  as for the strange secrecy about dauger here is an example  saint mars in january 1687 was appointed to the fortress of the isles saintemarguerite that sun themselves in the bay of cannes  on january 20 he asks leave to go to see his little kingdom  he must leave dauger but has forbidden even his lieutenant to speak to that prisoner  this was an increase of precaution since 1682  he wishes to take the captive to the isles but how  a sedan chair covered over with oilcloth seems best  a litter might break down litters often did and some one might then see the passenger  now m funckbrentano says to minimise the importance of dauger he was shut up like so much luggage in a chair hermetically closed with oilcloth carried by eight piedmontese in relays of four  luggage is not usually carried in hermetically sealed sedan chairs but saintmars has explained why by surplus of precaution he did not use a litter  the litter might break down and dauger might be seen  a new prison was built specially at the cost of 5000 livres for dauger at saintemarguerite with large sunny rooms  on may 3 1687 saintmars had entered on his island realm dauger being nearly killed by twelve days journey in a closed chair  he again excited the utmost curiosity  on january 8 1688 saintmars writes that his prisoner is believed by the world to be either a son of oliver cromwell or the duc de beaufort who was never seen again dead or alive after a night battle in crete on june 25 1669 just before dauger was arrested  saintmars sent in a note of the total of daugers expenses for the year 1687  he actually did not dare to send the items he says lest they if the bill fell into the wrong hands might reveal too much  the duc de beaufort whom athos releases from prison in dumass vingt ans apres  meanwhile an italian newsletter copied into a leyden paper of august 1687 declared that mattioli had just been brought from pignerol to saintemarguerite  there was no mystery about mattioli the story of his capture was published in 1682 but the press on one point was in error  mattioli was still at pignerol  the known advent of the late commandant of pignerol saintmars with a single concealed prisoner at the island naturally suggested the erroneous idea that the prisoner was mattioli  the prisoner was really dauger the survivor of the two valets  from 1688 to 1691 no letter about dauger has been published apparently he was then the only prisoner on the island except one chezut who was there before dauger arrived and gave up his chamber to dauger while the new cells were being built  between 1689 and 1693 six protestant preachers were brought to the island while louvois the minister died in 1691 and was succeeded by barbezieux  on august 13 1691 barbezieux wrote to ask saintmars about the prisoner whom he had guarded for twenty years  the only such prisoner was dauger who entered pignerol in august 1669 mattioli had been a prisoner only for twelve years and lay in pignerol not in saintemarguerite where saintmars now was saintmars replied  i can assure you that nobody has seen him but myself  by the beginning of march 1694 pignerol had been bombarded by the enemies of france presently louis xiv had to cede it to savoy the prisoners there must be removed  mattioli in pignerol at the end of 1693 had been in trouble  he and his valet had tried to smuggle out letters written on the linings of their pockets  these were seized and burned  on march 20 1694 barbezieux wrote to laprade now commanding at pignerol that he must take his three prisoners one by one with all secrecy to saintemarguerite laprade alone must give them their food on the journey  the military officer of the escort was warned to ask no questions already february 26 1694 barbezieux had informed saintmars that these prisoners were coming  they are of more consequence one of them at least than the prisoners on the island and must be put in the safest places  the one is doubtless mattioli  in 1681 louvois had thought dauger and la riviere more important than mattioli who in march 1694 came from pignerol to sainte marguerite  now in april 1694 a prisoner died at the island a prisoner who like mattioli had a valet  we hear of no other prisoner on the island except mattioli who had a valet  a letter of saintmars january 6 1696 proves that no prisoner then had a valet for each prisoner collected his own dirty plates and dishes piled them up and handed them to the lieutenant  m funckbrentano argues that in this very letter january 6 1696 saintmars speaks of les valets de messieurs les prisonniers  but in that part of the letter saintmars is not speaking of the actual state of things at saintemarguerite but is giving reminiscences of fouquet and lauzun who of course at pignerol had valets and had money as he shows  dauger had no money  m funckbrentano next argues that early in 1694 one of the preacher prisoners melzac died and cites m jung la verite sur le masque de fer p 91 this is odd as m jung says that melzac or malzac died in the end of 1692 or early in 1693  why then does m funckbrentano cite m jung for the death of the preacher early in 1694 when m jung conjecturally dates his decease at least a year earlier  it is not a mere conjecture as on march 3 1693 barbezieux begs saintmars to mention his protestant prisoners under nicknames there are three and malzac is no longer one of them  malzac in 1692 suffered from a horrible disease discreditable to one of the godly and in october 1692 had been allowed medical expenses whether they included a valet or not malzac seems to have been non existent by march 1693  had he possessed a valet and had he died in 1694 why should his valet have been shut up in the vaulted prison  this was the fate of the valet of the prisoner who died in april 1694 and was probably mattioli  m funckbrentanos statement is in revue historique lvi p 298 malzac died at the beginning of 1694 citing jung p 91  now on p 91 m jung writes at the beginning of 1694 saintmars had six prisoners of whom one melzac dies  but m jung pp 269 270 later writes it is probable that melzac died at the end of 1692 or early in 1693 and he gives his reasons which are convincing m funckbrentano must have overlooked m jungs change of opinion between his p 91 and his pp 269 270  mattioli certainly had a valet in december 1693 at pignerol  he went to saintemarguerite in march 1694  in april 1694 a prisoner with a valet died at saintemarguerite  in january 1696 no prisoner at saintemarguerite had a valet  therefore there is a strong presumption that the prisonnier au valet who died in april 1694 was mattioli  after december 1693 when he was still at pignerol the name of mattioli freely used before never occurs in the correspondence but we still often hear of lancien prisonnier the old prisoner  he was on the face of it dauger by far the oldest prisoner  in 1688 saintmars having only one prisoner dauger calls him merely my prisoner  in 1691 when saintmars had several prisoners barbezieux styles dauger your prisoner of twenty years standing  when in 16961698 saintmars mentions mon ancien prisonnier my prisoner of long standing he obviously means dauger not mattioliabove all if mattioli died in 1694  m funckbrentano argues that mon ancien prisonnier can only mean my erstwhile prisoner he who was lost and is restored to methat is mattioli  this is not the view of m jung or m lair or m loiseleur  friends of mattiolis claims rest much on this letter of barbezieux to saintmars november 17 1697  you have only to watch over the security of all your prisoners without ever explaining to any one what it is that your prisoner of long standing did  that secret it is argued must apply to mattioli  but all the world knew what mattioli had done  nobody knew and nobody knows what eustache dauger had done  it was one of the arcana imperii  it is the secret enforced ever since daugers arrest in 1669  saintmars 1669 was not to ask  louis xiv could only lighten the captivity of fouquet 1678 if his valet la riviere did not know what dauger had done  la riviere apparently a harmless man lived and died in confinement the sole reason being that he might perhaps know what dauger had done  consequently there is the strongest presumption that the ancien prisonnier of 1697 is dauger and that what he had done which saintmars must tell to no one was what dauger did not what mattioli did  all europe knew what mattioli had done his whole story had been published to the world in 1682 and 1687  on july 19 1698 barbezieux bade saintmars come to assume the command of the bastille  he is to bring his old prisoner whom not a soul is to see  saintmars therefore brought his man masked exactly as another prisoner was carried masked from provence to the bastille in 1695  m funckbrentano argues that saintmars was now quite fond of his old mattioli so noble so learned  at last on september 18 1698 saintmars lodged his old prisoner in the bastille an old prisoner whom he had at pignerol says the journal of du junca lieutenant of the bastille  his food we saw was brought him by rosarges alone the major a gentleman who had always been with saintmars  argues m funckbrentano all this proves that the captive was a gentleman not a valet  why  first because the bastille under louis xiv was une prison de distinction  yet m funckbrentano tells us that in mazarins time valets mixed up with royal plots were kept in the bastille again in 1701 in this noble prison the mask was turned out of his room to make place for a female fortuneteller and was obliged to chum with a profligate valet of nineteen and a beggarly bad patriot who blamed the conduct of france and approved that of other nations especially the dutch  m funckbrentano himself publishes these facts 1898 in part published earlier 1890 by m lair  not much noblesse here  next if rosarges a gentleman served the mask saintmars alone 1669 carried his food to the valet dauger  so the service of rosarges does not ennoble the mask and differentiate him from dauger who was even more nobly served by saintmars  legendes de la bastille pp 8689  citing du juncas journal april 30 1701  on november 19 1703 the mask died suddenly still in his velvet mask and was buried on the 20th  the parish register of the church names him marchialy or marchioly one may read it either way du junca the lieutenant of the bastille in his contemporary journal calls him mr de marchiel  now saintmars often spells mattioli marthioly  this is the one strength of the argument for mattiolis claims to the mask  m lair replies saintmars had a mania for burying prisoners under fancy names and gives examples  one is only a gardener francois eliard 1701 concerning whom it is expressly said that as he is a state prisoner his real name is not to be given so he is registered as pierre maret others read navet peter turnip  if saintmars looking about for a false name for daugers burial register hit on marsilly the name of daugers old master that might be miswritten marchialy  however it be the age of the mask is certainly falsified the register gives about forty five years old  mattioli would have been sixtythree dauger cannot have been under fiftythree  there the case stands  if mattioli died in april 1694 he cannot be the man in the iron mask  of daugers death we find no record unless he was the man in the iron mask and died in 1703 in the bastille  he was certainly in 1669 and 1688 at pignerol and at saintemarguerite the centre of the mystery about some great prisoner a marshal of france the duc de beaufort or a son of oliver cromwell  mattioli was no mystery no secret  dauger is so mysterious that probably the secret of his mystery was unknown to himself  by 1701 when obscure wretches were shut up with the mask the secret whatever its nature had ceased to be of moment  the captive was now the mere victim of cruel routine  but twenty years earlier saintmars had said that dauger takes things easily resigned to the will of god and the king  to sum up on july 1 1669 the valet of the huguenot intriguer roux de marsilly the valet resident in england known to his master as martin was wanted by the french secret police  by july 19 a valet of the highest political importance had been brought to dunkirk from england no doubt  my hypothesis assumes that this valet though now styled eustache dauger was the martin of roux de marsilly  he was kept with so much mystery at pignerol that already the legend began its course the captive valet was said to be a marshal of france  we then follow dauger from pignerol to les exiles till january 1687 when one valet out of a pair dauger being one of them dies  we presume that dauger is the survivor because the great mystery still is what he has done whereas the other valet had done nothing but may have known daugers secret again the other valet had long been dropsical and the valet who died in 1687 died of dropsy  in 1688 dauger at saintemarguerite is again the source and centre of myths he is taken for a son of oliver cromwell or for the duc de beaufort  in june 1692 one of the huguenot preachers at saintemarguerite writes on his shirt and pewter plate and throws them out of window  legend attributes these acts to the man in the iron mask and transmutes a pewter into a silver plate  now in 16891693 mattioli was at pignerol but dauger was at sainte marguerite and the huguenots act is attributed to him  thus dauger not mattioli is the centre round which the myths crystallise  the legends concern him not mattioli whose case is well known and gives rise to no legend  finally we have shown that mattioli probably died at saintemarguerite in april 1694  if so then nobody but dauger can be the old prisoner whom saintmars brought masked to the bastille in september 1698 and who died there in november 1703  however suppose that mattioli did not die in 1694 but was the masked man who died in the bastille in 1703 then the legend of dauger came to be attributed to mattioli  these two mens fortunes are combined in the one myth  saintmars au ministre june 4 1692  the central problem remains unsolved  what had the valet eustache dauger done  one marvels that nobody has recognised in the mask james stuart james de la cloche eldest of the children of charles ii  he came to england in 1668 was sent to rome and disappears from history see the mystery of james de la cloche    ii  the valets master    the secret of the man in the iron mask or at least of one of the two persons who have claims to be the mask was what had eustache dauger done  to guard this secret the most extraordinary precautions were taken as we have shown in the foregoing essay and yet if secret there was it might have got wind in the simplest fashion  in the vicomte de bragelonne dumas describes the tryst of the secrethunters with the dying chief of the jesuits at the inn in fontainebleau  they come from many quarters there is a baron of germany and a laird from scotland but aramis takes the prize  he knows the secret of the mask the most valuable of all to the intriguers of the company of jesus  now despite all the precautions of louvois and saintmars despite sentinels for ever posted under daugers windows despite arrangements which made it impossible for him to signal to people on the hillside at les exiles despite the suppression even of the items in the accounts of his expenses his secret if he knew it could have been discovered as we have remarked by the very man most apt to make mischievous use of itby lauzun  that brilliant and reckless adventurer could see dauger in prison at pignerol when he pleased for he had secretly excavated a way into the rooms of his fellowprisoner fouquet on whom dauger attended as valet lauzun was released soon after fouquets death  it is unlikely that he bought his liberty by the knowledge of the secret and there is nothing to suggest that he used it if he possessed it in any other way  the natural clue to the supposed secret of dauger is a study of the career of his master roux de marsilly  as official histories say next to nothing about him we may set forth what can be gleaned from the state papers in our record office  the earliest is a letter of roux de marsilly to mr joseph williamson secretary of lord arlington december 1668  marsilly sends martin on our theory eustache dauger to bring back from williamson two letters from his own correspondent in paris  he also requests williamson to procure for him from arlington a letter of protection as he is threatened with arrest for some debt in which he is not really concerned martin will explain  the next paper is endorsed received december 28 1668 mons de marsilly  as it is dated december 27 marsilly must have been in england  the contents of this piece deserve attention because they show the terms on which marsilly and arlington were or at least how marsilly conceived them  1 marsilly reports on the authority of his friends at stockholm that the king of sweden intends first to intercede with louis xiv in favour of the french huguenots and next if diplomacy fails to join in arms with the other protestant powers of europe  2 his correspondent in holland learns that if the king of england invites the states to any holy resolution they will heartily lend forces  no leader so good as the english kingcharles ii marsilly had shown arlingtons letter to a dutch friend who bade him approach the dutch ambassador in england  he has dined with that diplomatist  arlington had then gone so far as to write an encouraging letter  the dutch ambassador had just told marsilly that he had received the same news namely that holland would aid the huguenots persecuted by louis xiv  3 letters from provence languedoc and dauphine say that the situation there is unaltered  4 the canton of zurich write that they will keep their promises and that berne is anxious to please the king of great britain and that it is ready to raise with zurich 15000 men  they are not afraid of france  5 zurich fears that if charles is not represented at the next diet bale and saint gal will be intimidated and not dare to join the triple alliance of spain holland and england  the best plan will be for marsilly to represent england at the diet of january 25 1669 accompanied by the swiss general balthazar  this will encourage friends to give his brittanic majesty the satisfaction which he desires and will produce a close union between holland sweden the cantons and other protestant states  this reads as if charles had already expressed some desire  6 geneva grumbles at a reply of charles through a bishop who is their enemy the bishop of london a persecutor of our religion that is of presbyterianism  however nothing will dismay the genevans si s m b ne change  then comes a blank in the paper  there follows a copy of a letter as if from charles ii himself to the right high and noble seigneurs of zurich  he has heard of their wishes from roux de marsilly whom he commissions to wait upon them  i would not have written by my bishop of london had i been better informed but would myself have replied to your obliging letter and would have assured you as i do now that i desire     it appears as if this were a draft of the kind of letter which marsilly wanted charles to write to zurich and there is a similar draft of a letter for arlington to follow if he and charles wish to send marsilly to the swiss diet  the dutch ambassador with whom marsilly dined on december 26 the constable of castille and other grandees are all of opinion that he should visit the protestant swiss as from the king of england  the scheme is for an alliance of england holland spain and the protestant cantons against france and savoy  another letter of marsilly to arlington only dated jeudi avers that he can never repay arlington for his extreme kindness and liberality  no man in england is more devoted to you than i am and shall be all my life  state papers france vol 125 106  on the very day when marsilly drafted for charles his own commission to treat with zurich for a protestant alliance against france charles himself wrote to his sister madame henriette dorleans he spoke of his secret treaty with france  you know how much secrecy is necessary for the carrying on of the business and i assure you that nobody does nor shall know anything of it here but myself and that one person more till it be fit to be public is that one person de la cloche  madame by julia cartwright p 275  thus marsilly thought charles almost engaged for the protestant league while charles was secretly allying himself with france against holland  arlington was probably no less deceived by charles than marsilly was  the bishop of londons share in the dealing with zurich is obscure  it appears certain that arlington was not consciously deceiving marsilly  madame wrote on february 12 as to arlington the mans attachment to the dutch and his inclination towards spain are too well known  not till april 25 1669 does charles tell his sister that arlington has an inkling of his secret dealings with france how he knows charles cannot tell  it is impossible for us to ascertain how far charles himself deluded marsilly who went to the continent early in spring 1669  before may 1525 1669 in fact on april 14 marsilly had been kidnapped by agents of louis xiv and his doom was dight  madame by julia cartwright p 281  ibid p 285  here is the account of the matter written to  by perwich in paris  w perwich to                                         paris may 25 69  honored sir                                                      the cantons of switzerland are much troubled at the french kings having sent 15 horsemen into switzerland from whence the sr de maille the kings resident there had given information of the sr roux de marsillys being there negociating the bringing the cantons into the triple league by discourses much to the disadvantage of france giving them very ill impressions of the french kings government who was betrayed by a monk that kept him company and intercepted by the said horsemen brought into france and is expected at the bastille  i believe you know the man     i remember him in england   can this monk be the monk who went mad in prison at pignerol sharing the cell of mattioli  did he too suffer for his connection with the secret  we do not know but the position of charles was awkward  marsilly dealing with the swiss had come straight from england where he was lie with charless minister arlington and with the dutch and spanish ambassadors  the king refers to the matter in a letter to his sister of may 24 1669 misdated by miss cartwright may 24 1668  you have i hope received full satisfaction by the last post in the matter of marsillac marsilly for my ld arlington has sent to mr montague english ambassador at paris his history all the time he was here by which you will see how little credit he had here and that particularly my lord arlington was not in his good graces because he did not receive that satisfaction in his negotiation he expected and that was only in relation to the swissers and so i think i have said enough of this matter  madame by julia cartwright p 264  charles took it easily  on may 1525 montague acknowledged arlingtons letter to which charles refers he has been approached as to marsilly by the spanish resident but i could not tell how to do anything in the business never having heard of the man or that he was employed by my master charles in any business  i have sent you also a copy of a letter which an englishman writ to me that i do not know in behalf of roux de marsilly but that does not come by the post being too secret  state papers france vol 126  france had been well informed about marsilly while he was in england  he then had a secretary two lackeys and a valet de chambre and was frequently in conference with arlington and the spanish ambassador to the english court  colbert the french ambassador in london had written all this to the french government on april 25 before he heard of marsillys arrest  bibl nat fonds francais no 10665  the belief that marsilly was an agent of charles appears to have been general and if accepted by louis xiv would interfere with charless private negotiations for the secret treaty with france on may 18 prince daremberg had written on the subject to the spanish ambassador in paris  marsilly he says was arrested in switzerland on his way to berne with a monk who was also seized and a curious fact marsillys valet was killed in the struggle this valet of course was not dauger whom marsilly had left in england  marsilly doit avoir demande la protection du roy de la grande bretagne en faveur des religionaires huguenots de france et passer en suisse avec quelque commission de sa part  daremberg begs the spanish ambassador to communicate all this to montague the english ambassador at paris but montague probably like perwich knew nothing of the business any more than he knew of charless secret dealings with louis through madame  state papers france vol 126  to darembergs letter is pinned an unsigned english note obviously intended for arlingtons reading  roux de marsilly is still in the bastille though they have a mind to hang him yet they are much puzzled what to do with him  de lionne has beene to examine him twice or thrice but there is noe witnes to prove anything against him  i was told by one that the french king told it to that in his papers they find great mention of the duke of bucks  and your name and speak as if he were much trusted by you  i have enquired what this marsilly is and i find by one mr marsilly that i am acquainted withall and a man of quality that this mans name is onely roux and borne at nismes and having been formerly a soldier in his troope ever since has taken his name to gain more credit in switserland where hee marsilly formerly used to bee employed by his coll  the mareschall de schomberg who invaded switserland  we next find a very curious letter from which it appears that the french government inclined to regard marsilly as in fact an agent of charles but thought it wiser to trump up against him a charge of conspiring against the life of louis xiv  on this charge or another he was executed while the suspicion that he was an agent of english treachery may have been the real cause of the determination to destroy him  the balthazar with whom marsilly left his papers is mentioned with praise by him in his paper for arlington of december 27 1668  he is the general who should have accompanied marsilly to the diet  the substance of the letter given in full in note i is to the following effect  p du moulin paris may 1929 1669 writes to arlington  ever since ruvigny the late french ambassador a protestant was in england the french government had been anxious to kidnap roux de marsilly  they hunted him in england holland flanders and franchecomte  as we know from the case of mattioli the government of louis xiv was unscrupulously daring in breaking the laws of nations and seizing hostile personages in foreign territory as napoleon did in the affair of the duc denghien  when all failed louis bade turenne capture roux de marsilly wherever he could find him  turenne sent officers and gentlemen abroad and after four months search they found marsilly in switzerland  they took him as he came out of the house of his friend general balthazar and carried him to gex  no papers were found on him but he asked his captors to send to balthazar and get the commission he had from england which he probably thought would give him the security of an official diplomatic position  having got this document marsillys captors took it to the french ministers nothing could be more embarrassing if this were true to charless representative in france montague and to charless secret negotiations also to arlington who had dealt with marsilly  on his part the captive marsilly constantly affirmed that he was the envoy of the king of england  the common talk of paris was that an agent of charles was in the bastille though at court they pretend to know nothing of it  louis was overjoyed at marsillys capture giving out that he was conspiring against his life  monsieur told montague that he need not beg for the life of a wouldbe murderer like marsilly  but as to this idea they begin now to mince it at court and ruvigny assured du moulin that they had no such thoughts  de lyonne had seen marsilly and observed that it was a blunder to seize him  the french government was nervous and turennes secretary had been pumping several ambassadors as to what they thought of marsillys capture on foreign territory  one ambassador replied with spirit that a crusade by all europe against france as of old against the moslems would be necessary  would charles du moulin asked own or disown marsilly  montagues position was now awkward  on may 23 his account of the case was read at whitehall to the foreign committee in london see note ii for the document  he did not dare to interfere in marsillys behalf because he did not know whether the man was an agent of charles or not  such are the inconveniences of a secret royal diplomacy carried on behind the backs of ministers  louis xv later pursued this method with awkward consequences  the french court montague said was overjoyed at the capture of marsilly and a reward of 100000 crowns i am told very privately is set upon his head  the french ambassador in england colbert had reported that charles had sent marsilly to draw the swisses into the triple league against france  montague had tried to reassure monsieur charless brotherinlaw but was himself entirely perplexed  as monsieurs wife charless sister was working with charles for the secret treaty with louis the state and family politics were clearly in a knot  meanwhile the spanish ambassador kept pressing montague to interfere in favour of marsilly  after montagues puzzled note had been read to the english foreign committee on may 23 arlington offered explanations  marsilly came to england he said when charles was entering into negotiations for peace with holland and when france seemed likely to oppose the peace  no proposition was made to him or by him  peace being made marsilly was given money to take him out of the country  he wanted the king to renew his alliance with the swiss cantons but was told that the cantons must first expel the regicides of charles i  he undertook to arrange this and some eight months later came back to england  he was coldly used and i was complained of for not using so important a man well enough  cf le secret du roi by the duc de broglie  as we saw marsilly expressed the most effusive gratitude to arlington which does not suggest cold usage  arlington told the complainers that marsilly was another mans spy what mans dutch spanish or even french he does not explain  so charles gave marsilly money to go away  he was never trusted with anything but the expulsion of the regicides from switzerland  arlington was ordered by charles to write a letter thanking balthazar for his good offices  these explanations by arlington do not tally with marsillys communications to him as cited at the beginning of this inquiry nothing is said in these about getting the regicides of charles i out of switzerland  the paper is entirely concerned with bringing the protestant cantons into antifrench league with england holland spain and even sweden  on the other hand arlingtons acknowledged letter to balthazar carried by marsilly may be the commission of which marsilly boasted  in any case on june 2 charles gave colbert the french ambassador an audience turning even the duke of york out of the room  he then repeated to colbert the explanations of arlington already cited and arlington in a separate interview corroborated charles  so colbert wrote to louis june 3 1669 but to de lyonne on the same day i trust that you will extract from marsilly much matter for the kings service  it seemed to me that milord darlington was uneasy about it en avait de linquietude     there is here in england one martin eustace dauger who has been that wretchs valet and who left him in discontent  colbert then proposes to examine martin who may know a good deal and to send him into france  on june 10 colbert writes to louis that he expects to see martin  bibl nat fonds francais no 10665  on june 24 colbert wrote to louis about a conversation with charles  it is plain that proofs of a murderplot by marsilly were scanty or nonexistent though colbert averred that marsilly had discussed the matter with the spanish ministers  charles knew that he had had much conference with isola the spanish ambassador meanwhile up to july 1 colbert was trying to persuade marsillys valet to go to france which he declined to do as we have seen however the luckless lad by nods and by veiled words indicated that he knew a great deal  but not by promise of security and reward could the valet be induced to return to france  i might ask the king to give up martin the valet of marsilly to me colbert concludes and by hook or by crook he secured the person of the wretched man as we have seen  in a postscript colbert says that he has heard of the execution of marsilly  by july 19 as we saw in the previous essay louvois was bidding saintmars expect at pignerol from dunkirk a prisoner of the highest political importance to be guarded with the utmost secrecy yet a valet  that valet must be martin now called eustache dauger and his secret can only be connected with marsilly  it may have been something about arlingtons negotiations through marsilly as compromising charles ii  arlingtons explanations to the foreign committee were certainly incomplete and disingenuous  he if not charles was more deeply engaged with marsilly than he ventured to report  but marsilly himself avowed that he did not know why he was to be executed  executed he was in circumstances truly hideous  perwich june 5 wrote to an unnamed correspondent in england  they have all his papers which speak much of the triple alliance but i know not whether they can lawfully hang him for this having been naturalised in holland and taken in a privileged country switzerland montague paris june 22 1669 writes to arlington that marsilly is to die so it has been decided for a rape which he formerly committed at nismes and after the execution on june 26 declares that when broken on the wheel marsilly still persisted that he was guilty of nothing nor did know why he was put to death  like eustache dauger marsilly professed that he did not know his own secret  the charge of a rape long ago at nismes was obviously trumped up to cover the real reason for the extraordinary vindictiveness with which he was pursued illegally taken and barbarously slain  mere protestant restlessness on his part is hardly an explanation  there was clearly no evidence for the charge of a plot to murder louis xiv in which colbert in england seems to have believed  even if the french government believed that he was at once an agent of charles ii and at the same time a wouldbe assassin of louis xiv that hardly accounts for the intense secrecy with which his valet eustache dauger was always surrounded  did marsilly know of the secret treaty and was it from him that arlington got his first inkling of the royal plot  if so marsilly would probably have exposed the mystery in protestant interests  we are entirely baffled  in any case francis vernon writing from paris to williamson  june 1929 1669 gave a terrible account of marsillys death for the letter see note v  with a broken piece of glass as we learn from another source marsilly in prison wounded himself in a ghastly manner probably hoping to die by loss of blood  they seared him with a redhot iron and hurried on his execution  he was broken on the wheel and was two hours in dying june 22 contrary to usage a protestant preacher was brought to attend him on the scaffold  he came most reluctantly expecting insult but not a taunt was uttered by the fanatic populace  he came up the scaffold great silence all about  marsilly lay naked stretched on a st andrews cross  he had seemed half dead his head hanging limp like a drooping calf  to greet the minister of his own faith he raised himself to the surprise of all and spoke out loud and clear  he utterly denied all share in a scheme to murder louis the rest may be read in the original letter note v  so perished roux de marsilly the history of the master throws no light on the secret of the servant  that secret for many years caused the keenest anxiety to louis xiv and louvois  saintmars himself must not pry into it  yet what could dauger know  that there had been a conspiracy against the kings life  but that was the public talk of paris  if dauger had guilty knowledge his life might have paid for it why keep him a secret prisoner  did he know that charles ii had been guilty of double dealing in 16681669 probably charles had made some overtures to the swiss as a blind to his private dealings with louis xiv but even so how could the fact haunt louis xiv like a ghost  we leave the mystery much darker than we found it but we see reason good why diplomatists should have murmured of a crusade against the cruel and brigand government which sent soldiers to kidnap in neighbouring states men who did not know their own crime  to myself it seems not improbable that the king and louvois were but stupidly and cruelly nervous about what dauger might know  saint mars when he proposed to utilise dauger as a prison valet manifestly did not share the trembling anxieties of louis xiv and his minister anxieties which grew more keen as time went on however a soldier only has his orders and saintmars executed his orders with minute precision taking such unheardof precautions that in legend the valet blossomed into the rightful king of france                                            appendix  original papers in the case of roux de marsilly  note i  letter of mons p du moulin to arlington                                   paris may ye 1929 1669  my lord                                                      ever since that monsieur de ruvigny was in england last and upon the information he gave this king had a very great desire to seize if it were possible this roux de marsilly and several persons were sent to effect it into england holland flanders and franche comte  amongst the rest one la grange exempt des gardes was a good while in holland with fifty of the guards dispersed in severall places and quarters but all having miscarried the king recommended the thing to monsieur de turenne who sent some of his gentlemen and officers under him to find this man out and to endeavour to bring him alive  these men after foure months search found him att last in switzerland and having laid waite for him as he came out from monsr balthazars house a commander well knowne they took him and carryed him to gex before they could be intercepted and he rescued this was done only by a warrant from monsieur de turenne but as soone as they came into the french dominions they had full powers and directions from this court for the bringing of him hither those that tooke him say they found no papers about him but that he desired them to write to monsr balthazar to desire him to take care of his papers and to send him the commission he had from england and a letter being written to that effect it was signed by the prisoner and instead of sending it as they had promised they have brought it hither along with them  they do all unanimously report that he did constantly affirme that he was imployed by the king of great brittain and did act by his commission so that the general discourse here in towne is that one of the king of englands agents is in the bastille though att court they pretend to know nothing of it and would have the world think they are persuaded he had no relacion to his majesty  your lordship hath heard by the publique newes how overjoyed this king was att the bringing of this prisoner and how farr he expressed his thanks to the cheife person employed in it declaring openly that this man had long since conspired against his life and agreable to this monsieur fearing that mylord ambr was come to interpose on the prisoners behalfe asked him on friday last att st germains whether that was the cause of his coming and told him that he did not think he would speake for a man that attempted to kill the king  the same report hath been hitherto in everybodys mouth but they begin now to mince it att court and monsieur de ruvigny would have persuaded me yesterday they had no such thoughts  the truth is i am apt to believe they begin now to be ashamed of it  and i am informed from a very good hand that monsieur de lionne who hath been at the bastille to speake with the prisoner hath confessed since that he can find no ground for this pretended attempting to the kings life and that upon the whole he was of opinion that this man had much better been left alone than taken and did look upon what he had done as the intemperancy of an illsettled braine  and to satisfy your lordship that they are nettled here and are concerned to know what may be the issue of all this monsieur de turennes secretary was on munday last sent to several forreigne ministers to pump them and to learne what their thoughts were concerning this violence committed in the dominions of a sovereign and an allye whereupon he was told by one of them that such proceedings would bring europe to the necessity of entering into a croisade against them as formerly against the infidels  if i durst i would acquaint your lordship with the reflexions of all publique ministers here and of other unconcerned persons in relation

my master hath imployed him or noe besides he is a man as i have beene told by many people here of worth that has given out that hee is resolved to kill the french king at one time or other and i think such men are as dangerous to one king as to another  hee is brought to the bastille and i believe may be proceeded against and put to death in very few daies  there is great joy in this court for his being taken and a hundred thousand crownes i am told very privately set upon his head the french ambassador in england watcht him and hee has given the intelligence here of his being employed by the king and sent into switzerland by my master to draw the swisses into the triple league  hee aggravates the business as much as hee can to the prejudice of my master to value his owne service the more and they seeme here to wonder that the king my master should have imployed or countenanced a man that had so base a design against the kings person i had a great deal of discourse with monsieur about it but i did positively say that he had noe relation to my knowledge to the king my master and if he should have i make a question or noe whither in this case the king will owne him

probable the opposition to the peace would bee on the side of france  marsilly was heard telling of longe things but noe proposition made to him or by him  presently the peace was made and marsilly told more plainly wee had no use of him  a little summe of money was given him to returne as he said whither he was to goe in switzerland  upon which hee wishing his maty would renew his allience wth the cantons hee was answerd his mty would not enter into any comerce with them till they had sent the regicides out of their country hee undertooke it should bee done  seven or eight months after wth out any intimation given him from hence or any expectation of him he comes hither but was so coldly used i was complained off for not using so important a man well enough  i answerd i saw noe use the king could make of him because he had no credit in switzerlande and for any thing else i thought him worth nothing to us but above all because i knew by many circumstances hee was another mans spy and soe ought not to be paid by his majesty  notwithstanding this his maty being moved from compassion commanded hee should have some money given him to carry him away and that i should write to monsieur balthazar thanking him in the kings name for the good offices hee rendered in advancing a good understanding betwixt his maty and the cantons and desiring him to continue them in all occasions  the man was always looked upon as a hot headed and indiscreete man and soe accordingly handled hearing him but never trusting him with anything but his own offered and undesired endeavours to gett the

wounded himself wch he did not because hee was confronted with ruvigny as the gazettes speake  for he knew before hee should dye butt he thought by dismembering himself that the losse of blood would carry him out of the world before it should come to bee knowne that he had wounded himselfe  and when the governor of the bastille spied the blood hee said it was a stone was come from him which caused that effusion  however the governor mistrusted the worst and searcht him to see what wound he had made so they seared him and sent word to st germaines which made his execution be hastened  saturday about 1 of the clock hee was brought on the skaffold before the chastelet and tied to st andrews crosse all wch while he acted the dying man and scarce stirred and seemed almost breathlesse and fainting  the lieutenant general presst him to confesse and ther was a doctor of the sorbon who was a counsellr of the castelet there likewise to exhort him to disburthen his mind of any thing which might be upon it  butt he seemed to take no notice and lay panting  then the lieutenant criminel bethought himself that the only way to make him speake would bee to sende for a ministre soe hee did to monsr daillie butt hee because the edicts dont permitt ministres to come to condemned persons in publique butt only to comfort them in private before they goe out of prison refused to come till hee sent a huissier who if hee had refused the second time would have brought him by force  at this second summons hee came butt not without great expectations to bee affronted in a most notorious manner beeing the first time a ministre came to appeare on a scaffold and that upon soe sinister an occasion  yet when he came found a great presse of people  all made way none lett fall soe much as a taunting word  hee came up the scaffold great silence all about hee found him lying bound stretched on st andrews crosse naked ready for execution  hee told him hee was sent for to exhort him to die patiently and like a christian  then immediately they were all surprized to see him hold up his head wch he lett hang on one side before like a drooping calfe and speake as loud and clear as the ministre to whom he said with a chearful air hee was glad to see him that hee need not question butt that hee would dye like a christian and patiently too  then hee went and spoke some places of scripture to encourage him which he heard with great attention they afterward came to mention some things to move him to contrition and there hee tooke an occasion to aggravate the horrour of a crime of attempting against the kings person  hee said hee did not know what hee meant  for his part hee never had any evill intention against the person of the king  the lieutenant criminel stood all the while behind monsieur daillie and hearkened to all and prompted monsr daillie to aske him if hee had said there were 10 ravillacs besides wch would doe the kings businesse  hee protested solemnly hee never said any such words or if hee did hee never remembred butt if hee had it was with no intention of malice  then monsieur daillie turned to the people and made a discourse in vindication of those of the religion that it was no principle of theirs attempts on the persons of kings butt only loyalty and obedience  this ended hee went away hee staid about an hour in all and immediately as soon as he was gone they went to their worke and gave him eleven blows with a barre and laid him on the wheele  hee was two houres dying  all about monsr daillie i heard from his own mouth for i went to wait on him because it was reported hee had said something concerning the king of england butt hee could tell mee nothing of that  there was a flying report that he should say going from the chasteletthe

the wheele hee was heard to say le roy est grand tyrant le roy me traitte dun facon fort barbare  all that you read concerning oaths and dying en enrage is false all the oaths hee used being only asseverations to monsr daillie that he was falsely accused as to the kings person                                               sr i am etc                                                  frans

of it already  they hastened his execution for feare he should have dyed of the hurt he had done himself the day before they sent for a minister to him when he was upon the scaffold to see if he would confesse anything but he still persisted that he was guilty of nothing nor did not know why he was put to death       iii  the mystery of sir edmund berry godfrey    when london was a pleasanter place than it is today when anglers stretched their legs up tottenham hill on their way to fish in the lee when the best stands on hackney river were competed for eagerly by bottom fishers when a gentleman in st martins lane between the hedges could ask the way to paddington woods when a hare haunted primrose hill and was daily pursued by a gallant pack of harriers enfin between three and four on the afternoon of october 17 1678 two common fellows stepped into the white house tavern in the fields north of marylebone a house used as a club by a set of catholic tradesmen  they had been walking in that region and as the october afternoon was drawing in and rain was falling they sought refuge in the white house  it would appear that they had not the means of assuaging a reasonable thirst for when they mentioned that they had noticed a gentlemans cane a scabbard a belt and some add a pair of gloves lying at the edge of a deep dry ditch overgrown with thick bush and bramble the landlord offered the new comers a shilling to go and fetch the articles  but the rain was heavy and probably the men took the shilling out in ale till about five oclock when the weather held up for a while  a rather different account by the two original finders bromwell and walters is in lestranges brief history iii pp 97 98  the account above is the landlords  lords mss hist mss com xi pp 2 46 47  the delay was the more singular if as one account avers the men had not only observed the cane and scabbard outside of the ditch on the bank but also a dead body within the ditch under the brambles  by five oclock the rain had ceased but the tempestuous evening was dark and it was night before constable brown with a posse of neighbours on foot and horseback reached the ditch herein they found the corpse of a man lying face downwards the feet upwards hung upon the brambles thus half suspended he lay and the point of a sword stuck out of his back through his black camlet coat  by the lights at the inn the body was identified as that of sir edmund berry godfrey a justice of the peace for westminster who had been missing since saturday october 12  it is an undeniable fact that between two and three oclock before the body was discovered and identified dr lloyd dean of st asaphs and bishop burnet had heard that godfrey had been found in leicester fields with his own sword in his body  dr lloyd mentioned his knowledge in the funeral sermon of the dead magistrate  he had the story from a mr angus a clergyman who had it from a young man in a grey coat in a booksellers shop near st pauls about two oclock in the afternoon  angus hurried to tell bishop burnet who sent him on to dr lloyd  either the young man in the grey coat knew too much or a mere rumour based on a conjecture that godfrey had fallen on his own sword proved to be accurate by accident a point to be remembered  according to roger frith at two oclock he heard salvetti the ambassador of the duke of tuscany say  sir e godfrey is dead    the young jesuits are grown desperate the old ones would do no such thing  this again may have been a mere guess by salvetti  pollock popish plot pp 95 96 brown in brief history iii pp 212215 222 lestrange brief history iii pp 8789 lords mss p 48 october 24  in the circumstances of the finding of the body it would have been correct for constable brown to leave it under a guard till daylight and the arrival of surgical witnesses but the night was threatening and brown ordered the body to be lifted he dragged out the sword with difficulty and had the dead man carried to the white house inn  there under the candles the dead man as we said was recognised for sir edmund berry godfrey a very wellknown justice of the peace and wood and coal dealer  all this occurred on thursday october 17 and sir edmund had not been seen by honest men and thoroughly credible witnesses at least since one oclock on saturday october 12  then he was observed near his house in green lane strand but into his house he did not go  who then killed sir edmund  the question has never been answered though three guiltless men were later hanged for the murder  every conceivable theory has been tried the latest is that of mr pollock  godfrey was slain by the queens confessor le fevre a jesuit and some other jesuits with lay assistance  i have found no proof that le fevre was either a jesuit or confessor of the queen  pollock the popish plot duckworth london 1903  as david hume says the truth might probably have been discovered had proper measures been taken at the moment  but a little mob of horse and foot had trampled round the ditch in the dark disturbing the original traces  the coroners jury which sat long and late on october 18 and 19 was advised by two surgeons who probably like the rest of the world were biassed by the belief that godfrey had been slain by the bloody papists  in the reign of mad terror which followed every one was apt to accommodate his evidence naturally to that belief  if they did not then like the two original finders bromwell and walters they might be thrown heavily ironed into newgate  lords mss p 47 note 1  but when the popish plot was exploded and charles ii was firm on his throne still more under james ii every one was apt to be biassed in the opposite direction and to throw the guilt on the fallen party of oates bedloe dugdale and the other deeply perjured and infamous informers  thus both the evidence of 1678 1680 and that collected in 16841687 by sir roger lestrange jp who took great trouble and was allowed access to the manuscript documents of the earlier inquiries must be regarded with suspicion  lestrange brief history of the times london 1687  the first question is cui bono who had an interest in godfreys death  three parties had an interest first the catholics if godfrey knew their secrets next the managers of the great whig conspiracy in favour of the authenticity of oatess popish plot last godfrey himself who was of an hereditary melancholy his father had suicidal tendencies and who was involved in a quandary whence he could scarcely hope to extricate himself with life and honour  of the circumstances of godfreys quandary an account is to follow but meanwhile the theory of godfreys suicide though danby is said to have accepted it was rejected probably with good reason despite the doubts of lestrange hume sir george sitwell and others by the coroners jury  sitwell the first whig sacheverell  privately printed 1894 sir georges booka most interesting volume based on public and private papersunluckily is introuvable  some years have passed since i read a copy which he kindly lent me  the evidence which determined the verdict of murder was that of two surgeons  they found that the body had been severely bruised on the chest by kicks blows of a blunt weapon or by mens knees  a swordthrust had been dealt but had slipped on a rib godfreys own sword had then been passed through the left pap and out at the back  there was said to be no trace of the shedding of fresh living blood on the clothes of godfrey or about the ditch  what blood appeared was old the surgeons averred and malodorous and flowed after the extraction of the sword  lestrange 1687 argues at great length but on evidence collected later and given under the antiplot bias that there was much more bloud than was allowed for at the inquest  but the early evidence ought to be best  again the surgeons declared that godfrey had been strangled with a cloth as the jury found and his neck dislocated  bishop burnet who viewed the body writes long after the event  a mark was all round his neck an inch broad which showed he was strangled     and his neck was broken  all this i saw  burnet history of his own time ii p 741 1725   lestrange argued that the neck was not broken giving an example of a similar error in the case of a dead child and that the mark round the neck was caused by the tightness of the collar and the flow of blood to the neck the body lying head downwards  in favour of this view he produced one surgeons opinion  he also declares that godfreys brothers for excellent reasons of their own refused to allow a thorough postmortem examination  none of them had ever been opened they said  their true motive was that if godfrey were a suicide his estate would be forfeited to the crown a point on which they undoubtedly showed great anxiety  evidence was also given to prove that on tuesday and wednesday october 15 and 16 godfreys body was not in the ditch  on tuesday mr forsett on wednesday mr harwood had taken mr forsetts harriers over the ground in pursuit of the legendary hare  they had seen no cane or scabbard the dogs had found no corpse lestrange replied that as to the cane the men could not see it if they were on the further side of the bramblecovered ditch  as to the dogs they later hunted a wood in which a dead body lay for six weeks before it was found  lestrange discovered witnesses who had seen godfrey in st martins lane on the fatal saturday asking his way to paddington woods others who had seen him there or met him returning thence  again either he or the devil in his clothes was seen near the ditch on saturday afternoon  again his clerk moore was seen hunting the fields near the ditch for his master on the monday afternoon  hence lestrange argued that godfrey went to paddington woods on saturday morning to look for a convenient place of suicide  that he could not screw his courage to the sticking place that he wandered home did not enter his house roamed out again and near primrose hill found the ditch and the sticking place  his rambles said lestrange could neither have been taken for business nor pleasure  this is true if godfrey actually took the rambles but the evidence was not adduced till several years later in 1678 the witnesses would have been in great danger  still if we accept lestranges witnesses for godfreys trip to paddington and return perhaps we ought not to reject the rest  brief history iii pp 252 300 174 175 state trials viii pp 1387 1392 1393 13591389  on the whole it seems that the evidence for murder not suicide is much the better though even here absolute certainty is not attained  granting godfreys constitutional hereditary melancholy and the double quandary in which he stood he certainly had motives for suicide  he was a man of humanity and courage had bravely faced the plague in london had withstood the court boldly on a private matter serving a writ as justice on the kings physician who owed him money in his capacity as a coal dealer and he was lenient in applying the laws against dissenters and catholics  to be lenient was well but godfreys singular penchant for jesuits and especially for the chief catholic intriguer in england was probably the ultimate cause of his death whether inflicted by his own hand or those of others  2  we now study godfreys quandary  on june 23 1678 the infamous miscreant titus oates had been expelled from the jesuit college of st omers in france  there he may readily have learned that the usual triennial consult of english jesuits was to be held in london on april 24 but where it was held namely in the duke of yorks chambers in st jamess palace oates did not know or did not say  the duke by permitting the jesuits to assemble in his house had been technically guilty of treason in harbouring jesuits certainly a secret of great importance as he was the head and hope of the catholic cause and the butt of the whigs who were eager to exclude him from the succession  oates had scraps of other genuine news  he returned to london after his expulsion from st omers was treated with incautious kindness by jesuits there and with tonge constructed his monstrous fable of a popish plot to kill the king and massacre the protestant public  in august charles was apprised of the plot as was danby the lord treasurer the duke of york also knew how much he knew is uncertain  the myth was little esteemed by the king  on september 6 oates went to godfrey and swore before him as a magistrate to the truth of a written deposition as to treason but godfrey was not then allowed to read the paper nor was it left in his hands the king he was told had a copy  the thing might have passed off but as king james ii himself writes he being then duke of york pressd the king and lord treasurer several times that the letters letters forged by oates might be produced and read and the business examined into at the committee of foreign affairs  mr pollock calls the dukes conduct tactless  like charles i in the mystery of the incident he knew himself guiltless and demanded an inquiry  kirkby complete narrative pp 2 3 cited by mr pollock  at the time it was believed that godfrey saw the depositions clarkes life of james ii i p 518  cited from the kings original memoirs  on september 28 oates was to appear before the council  earlier on that day he again visited godfrey handed to him a copy of his deposition took oath to its truth and carried another copy to whitehall  as we shall see oates probably adopted this course by advice of one of the kings ministers danby or another  oates was now examined before the king who detected him in perjury  but he accused coleman the secretary of the duchess of york of treasonable correspondence with la chaise the confessor of louis xiv  he also said that on april 24 he himself was present at the jesuit consult in the white horse tavern strand where they decided to murder the king  this was a lie but they had met on ordinary business of the society on april 24 at the palace of the duke of york  had the jesuits when tried proved this they would not have saved their lives and oates would merely have sworn that they met again at the white horse  godfrey having oatess paper before him now knew that coleman was accused  godfrey was very intimate with many jesuits says warner who was one of them in his manuscript history  with coleman certainly a dangerous intriguer godfrey was so familiar that it was the form arranged between them for use when godfrey was in company and coleman wished to see him that coleman should be announced under the name of mr clarke   pollock p 91 note 1 ibid p 151 note 3  weldens evidence before the lords committee house of lords mss p 48  mr pollock rather overstates the case  we cannot be certain from weldens words that coleman habitually used the name clarke on such occasions  it is extraordinary enough to find a rigid british magistrate engaged in clandestine dealings with an intriguer like coleman who for the purpose receives a cant name  if that fact came out in the inquiry into the plot godfreys doom was dight the general frenzy would make men cry for his blood  but yet more extraordinary was godfreys conduct on september 28  no sooner had he oatess confession accusing coleman in his hands than he sent for the accused  coleman went to the house of a mr or colonel welden a friend of godfreys and to godfrey it was announced that one clarke wished to see him there  when they were together at my house they were reading papers said welden later in evidence it cannot be doubted that after studying oatess deposition godfreys first care was to give coleman full warning  james ii tells us this himself in his memoirs  coleman being known to depend on the duke sir edmund bury sic godfrey made choice of him to send to his highness an account of oatess and tongues depositions as soon as he had taken them that is on september 28  apparently the duke had not the precise details of oatess charges as they now existed earlier than september 28 when they were sent to him by godfrey  see previous note pollock p 151 note 3 life of james ii i p 534  it is mr pollocks argument that when godfrey and coleman went over the oates papers coleman would prove oatess perjury and would to this end let out that on april 24 the jesuits met not as oates swore at a tavern but at the duke of yorks house a secret fatal to the duke and the catholic cause  the jesuits then slew godfrey to keep the secret safe  pollock p 153  now first i cannot easily believe that coleman would blab this secret quite unnecessarily for this proof of oatess perjury could not be and was not publicly adduced unless godfrey was already deep in the catholic intrigues  he may have been judging by his relations with coleman  if godfrey was not himself engaged in catholic intrigues coleman need only tell him that oates was not in england in april and could not have been as he swore he was at the consult  next godfrey was not the man as mr pollock supposes to reveal his knowledge to the world from a sense of duty even if the court stifled the plot  mr pollock says godfrey was by virtue of his position as justice of the peace a government official     sooner or later he would certainly reveal it     the secret    had come into the hands of just one of the men who could not afford even if he might wish to retain it  mr pollock may conceive though i do not find him saying so that godfrey communicated oatess charges to coleman merely for the purpose of pumping him and surprising some secret if so he acted foolishly  pollock p 154  in fact godfrey was already stifling the plot  a government official he was putting coleman in a posture to fly and to burn his papers had he burned all of them the plot was effectually stifled  next godfrey could not reveal the secret without revealing his own misprision of treason  he would be asked how he knew the secret  godfreys lips were thus sealed he had neither the wish nor the power to speak out and so his knowledge of the secret if he knew it was innocuous to the jesuits  what is it nearer coleman was reported by a perjured informer to have asked  state trials vii 1319  trial of lord stafford 1680  to this point i return later  meanwhile let it be granted that godfrey knew the secret from coleman and that though since godfrey could not speak without selfbetrayalthough it was no nearerstill the jesuits thought well to mak sikker and slay him  still what is the evidence that godfrey had a mortal secret  mr pollock gives it thus  he had told mr wynnel that he was master of a dangerous secret which would be fatal to him  oates he said is sworn and is perjured  these sentences are not thus collocated in the original  the secret was not as from mr pollocks arrangement it appears to be that oates was perjured  pollock p 150  the danger lay not in knowledge that oates was perjuredall the council knew the king to have discovered that  many believed it says mr pollock  it was not an uncommon thing to say  the true peril on mr pollocks theory was godfreys possession of proof that oates was perjured that proof involving the secret of the jesuit consult of april 14 at the duke of yorks house  but by a singular oversight mr pollock quotes only part of what godfrey said to wynell or wynnel about his secret  he does not give the whole of the sentence uttered by wynell  the secret of which godfrey was master on the only evidence wynells had nothing to do with the jesuit meeting of april 24  wynell is one of lestranges later witnesses  his words are  godfrey  the catholic lords are as innocent as you or i coleman will die but not the lords  wynell  if so where are we then  godfrey  oates is sworn and is perjured                                            upon wynells asking sir edmund some time why he was so melancholy his answer has been he was melancholy because he was master of a dangerous secret that would be fatal to him that his security was oates deposition that the said oates had first declared it to a public minister and secondly that he came to sir edmund by his the ministers direction  pollock p 152 lestrange part iii p 187  we must accept all of mr wynells statement or none we cannot accept like mr pollock only godfreys confession of owning a dangerous secret without godfreys explanation of the nature of the danger  against that danger his knowing and taking no action upon what oates had deposed godfreys security was oatess other deposition that his information was already in the ministers hands and that he had come to godfrey by the ministers orders the invidiousness of knowing and not acting on oatess dangerous secret godfrey hoped fell on the minister rather than on himself and it did fall on danby who was later accused of treason on this very ground among others  such is wynells evidence true or false  cest a prendre ou a laisser in bulk and in bulk is of no value to mr pollocks argument  that godfrey was in great fear after taking oatess deposition and dealing with coleman is abundantly attested  but of what was he afraid and of whom  lestrange says of being made actual party to the plot and not of bare misprision only the misprision of not acting on oatess information  it is to prove this point that lestrange cites wynell as quoted above  bishop burnet reports that to him godfrey said that he believed he himself should be knocked on the head  knocked on the head by whom  by a frightened protestant mob or by catholic conspirators  to mr robinson an old friend he said i do not fear them if they come fairly and i shall not part with my life tamely  quils viennent as tartarin said but who are they  godfrey said that he had taken the depositions very unwillingly and would fain have had it done by others     i think i shall have little thanks for my pains     upon my conscience i believe i shall be the first martyr  he could not expect thanks from the catholics  it was from the frenzied protestants that he expected little thanks  lestrange iii p 187 burnet ii p 740 state trials vii pp 168 169  oates swore and for once is corroborated that godfrey complained of receiving affronts from some great persons whose names i name not now for being so zealous in this business  if oates by great persons means the duke of york it was in the dukes own cause that godfrey had been zealous sending him warning by coleman  oates added that others threatened to complain to parliament which was to meet on october 21 that godfrey had been too remiss  oates was a liar but godfrey in any case was between the devil and the deep sea  as early as october 24 mr mulys attested before the lords godfreys remark he had been blamed by some great men for not having done his duty and by other great men for having done too much  mulys corroborates oates  if godfrey knew a secret dangerous to the jesuits which later was a current theory he might be by them silenced for ever  if his conduct being complained of was examined into by parliament misprision of treason was the lowest at which his offence could be rated  never was magistrate in such a quandary  but we do not know in the state of the evidence which of his many perils he feared most and his possession of a dangerous secret namely the secret of the consult of april 24 is a pure hypothesis  it is not warranted but refuted by godfreys own words as reported by wynell when unlike mr pollock we quote wynells whole sentence on the subject  see previous exchange between godfrey and wynell  lords mss p 48  3  the theories of godfreys death almost defy enumeration  for suicide being a man of melancholic temperament he had reasons as many and as good as mortal could desire  that he was murdered for not being active enough in prosecuting the plot is most improbable that he was taken off by danbys orders for giving coleman and the duke of york early warning is an absurd idea for danby could have had him on that score by ordinary process of law  that he was slain by oatess gang merely to clinch the fact that a plot there veritably was is improbable  at the same time godfrey had been calling oates a perjurer  he knew that oates was forsworn  this was an unsafe thing for any man to say but when the man was the magistrate who had read oatess deposition he invited danger  such were the chances that godfrey risked from the plot party  the catholics on the other hand if they were aware that godfrey possessed the secret of the jesuit meeting of april 24 and if they deemed him too foolish to keep the secret in his own interest could not but perceive that to murder him was to play into the hands of the whigs by clinching the belief in a popish plot  had they been the murderers they would probably have taken his money and rings to give the idea that he had been attacked and robbed by vulgar villains  if they were not the damnedest fools thus freely speaks lestrange they would not have taken deliberate steps to secure the instant discovery of the corpse  whoever pitched godfreys body into the bramblecovered ditch meant it to be found for his cane scabbard and so on were deliberately left outside of the ditch  your wily jesuit would have caused the body to disappear leaving the impression that godfrey had merely absconded as he had the best reasons for doing  on the other hand oatess gang would not if they first strangled godfrey have run his own sword through his body as if he had committed suicideunless indeed they calculated that this would be a likely step for your wily jesuit to take in the circumstances  again an educated jesuit like le fevre the queens confessor would know that the sword trick was futile even a plain man let alone a surgeon could detect a wound inflicted on a corpse four or five days old  two other theories existed first that godfrey hanged himself and that his brothers and heirs did the sword trick to suggest that he had not committed suicide by strangulation but had been set on and stabbed with his own sword  in that case of course the brothers would have removed his rings and money to prove that he had been robbed  the other theory plausible enough held that godfrey was killed by catholics not because he took oatess deposition which he was bound to do but because he officiously examined a number of persons to make discoveries  the attorneygeneral at the trial of godfreys alleged murderers february 1679 declared that sir edmund had taken such examinations  we have proof that he had some    perhaps some more than are now extant  this theory then held that he was taken off to prevent his pursuing his zealous course and to seize the depositions which he had already taken when this was stated to charles ii on november 7 1678 by the perjured bedloe the king naturally remarked  the parties were still alive the deponents to give the informations  bedloe answered that the papers were to be seized in hopes the second informations taken from the parties would not have agreed with the first and so the thing would have been disproved  this was monstrously absurd for the slayers of godfrey could not have produced the documents of which they had robbed him  state trials vii p 163 pollock p 385  the theory that sir edmund was killed because coleman had told him too many secrets did not come to general knowledge till the trial of lord stafford in 1680  the hypothesisgodfrey slain because through coleman he knew too many catholic secretsis practically that of mr pollock  it certainly does supply a motive for godfreys assassination  hotheaded catholics who knew or suspected that godfrey knew too much may have killed him for that reason or for the purpose of seizing his papers but it is improbable that catholics of education well aware that if he blabbed godfrey must ruin himself would have put their hands into his blood on the mere chance that if left alive he might betray both himself and them  4  it is now necessary to turn backward a little and see what occurred immediately after the meeting of coleman and godfrey on september 28  on that day oates gave his lying evidence before the council he was allowed to go on a jesuit drive with warrants and officers he caught several of the most important jesuits  on september 29 the king heard his tale and called him a lying knave  none the less he was sent on another drive and says mr pollock before dawn most the jesuits of eminence in london lay in gaol  but le fevre the queens confessor and the other jesuits whom mr pollock suspects of godfreys murder were not taken  is it likely it is of course possible that they stayed on in town and killed godfrey twelve days later  meanwhile coleman thanks to godfreys warning had most of september 28 the night of that day and september 29 wherein to burn his papers and abscond  he did neither if he destroyed some papers he left others in his rooms letters which were quite good enough to hang him for high treason as the law stood  apparently coleman did not understand his danger  on sunday night september 29 a warrant for his apprehension was issued and for the seizure of his papers  he came voluntarily in on monday morning having heard of the warrant  this is not the conduct of a man who knows himself guilty  he met the charges with disdain and made so good a case that instead of being sent to newgate he was merely entrusted to a messenger who was told to be very civil to mr coleman  charles ii went to the newmarket autumn meeting colemans papers were examined and sounded so strange to the lords that they sent him to newgate october 1  the papers proved that coleman years before had corresponded as oates had sworn with the confessor of louis xiv and had incurred the technical guilt of treason  either coleman did not understand the law and the measure of his offence as seems probable or he thought his papers safely hidden  but the heather was on fire  the belief in oatess impossible plot blazed up hell was let loose  state trials vii p 29  coleman had thought himself safe says james ii then duke of york the duke perceiving from godfreys information of september 28 oates had named coleman bade him look to himself for he was sure to find no favour and therefore if he had any papers that might hurt him to secure them immediately but he apprehending no danger let them be seized however kept close himself and sent to advise with the duke whether he should deliver himself up or not the duke replyd he knew best what was in his papers if they containd any expression which could be wrested to an ill sence he had best not appear otherwise the surrendering himself would be an argument of innocency  he did accordingly and was condemned in november and hanged  life of james ii i p 534  king jamess tale agrees with the facts of colemans surrender  he came in voluntarily  he did not appreciate the resources of civilisation at the service of the english law of treason  he had dabbled in intrigue without taking counsels advice and knowing for certain that oates was an inconsistent liar coleman took his chance with a light heart  however not only did some of his letters bring him though he could not understand the fact within the elastic law of treason but oatess evidence was accepted when conspicuously false coleman was not allowed to produce his diary and prove an alibi as to one of oatess accusations and a new witness bedloe a perjurer who rivalled oates had sprung up out of the filth of london streets  so coleman swung for it as godfrey according to wynell had prophesied that he would  colemans imprisonment began twelve days before godfreys disappearance  at colemans trial late in november a mere guess was given that godfrey was slain to prevent him a protestant martyr from blabbing catholic secrets  this cause of godfreys taking off was not alleged by bedloe  this man a notorious cosmopolitan rogue who had swindled his way through france and spain was first heard of in the godfrey case at the end of october he wrote to the secretaries of state from bristol lestrange says from newbury on his way to bristol offering information as pardon and reward had been promised to contrite accomplices in the murder he came to town and on november 7 gave evidence before the king bedloe gave himself out as a jesuit agent concerning the plot he added monstrous inventions to those of oates  as to sir edmund godfrey was promised 2000 guineas to be in it by le fere le fevre the queens confessor by my lord bellasis gentleman and the youngest of the waiters in the queenes chapel in a purple gown and to keep the people orderly  see pollock pp 384 387  the report is from secretary coventrys mss at longleat  the evidence as to bedloes deposition before the king november 7 is in a confused state  mr pollock prints pp 383 384 cf p 110 a document from brit mus addit ms 11058 f 244 this is also given with the same erroneous reference by mr foley in records of the english province of the society of jesus vol v p 30 note  the right reference is 11055  the document is quite erroneously printed with variations in error by mr foley and mr pollock  bedloe really said that godfrey was lured into somerset house yard not into some house yard foley or into a house yard pollock  bedloe so far agreed with prance but in another set of notes on his deposition longleat mss coventry papers xi 272274 pollock 384387 he made somerset house the scene of the murder  there are other errors  mr pollock and mr foley make bedloe accuse father eveley sj in whom i naturally recognised father evers or every who was then at tixall in staffordshire  the name in the ms is welch not eveley  the ms was manifestly written not before september 12 it does not appear that bedloe on november 7 knew the plot as invented by oates on which compare mr pollock p 110 who thinks that it is quite possible that charles ii deceived him bishop burnet intentionally on this head burnet ii 745746 1725 by printing he acquainted instead of he acquainteth the lords in the british museum ms and by taking the document apparently to be of november 7 mr pollock has been led to an incorrect conclusion  i am obliged to father gerard sj for a correct transcript of the british museum ms see also note iii the jesuit murderers at the end of this chapter and father gerards the popish plot and its latest historian longmans 1903  bedloe here asserts distinctly that one accomplice was an official of the queens chapel in her residence somerset house  a kind of verger in a purple gown  this is highly important for the man whom he later pretended to recognise as this accomplice was not a waiter did not wear a purple gown and by his own account was not in the chapel once a month  bedloes recognition of him therefore was worthless  he said that godfrey was smothered with a pillow or two pillows in a room in somerset house for the purpose of securing the examinations that godfrey had taken  coleman and lord bellasis advised to destroy him  his informant was le fevre  one walsh a jesuit le fevre lord bellasiss man and the chapel keeper did the deed  the chapel keeper carried him godfrey off  he did not see him godfrey after he was dead  on the following day bedloe told his tale at the bar of the house of lords  he now contradicting himself swore that he saw godfreys dead body in somerset house  he was offered 2000 guineas to help to carry him off  this was done by chairmen retainers to somerset house on monday night october 14  pollock p 387 lords journals xiii p 343  on that night bedloe saw samuel atkins mr pepyss clerk beside the corpse by the light of a dark lantern  atkins had an alibi so bedloe shuffled and would not swear to him  on november 14 before the lords committee bedloe again gave evidence  the 2100 pounds were now 4000 pounds offered to bedloe by le fevre early in october to kill a man  the attendant in the queens chapel was at the scene a pure figment of the corpse exposed under the dark lantern  the motive of the murder was to seize godfreys examinations which he said he had sent to whitehall  at a trial which followed in february 1679 mr robinson who had known godfrey for some forty years deposed that he had said to him i understand you have taken several examinations  truly said he i have  pray sir have you the examinations about you will you please to let me see them no i have them not i delivered them to a person of quality  state trials vii 168  this person of quality was not the duke of york for it may be noted that on the day before his disappearance godfrey had in fact received back from the lord chief justice the original copy of oatess depositions  this copy was found in his house after his death and handed over by his brother to the government  to get the examinations was always the motive of the murder with bedloe the hour of godfreys death was now 2 pm now 3 or 4 or 5 pm on october 12  the body was hidden in various rooms of somerset house or under the high altar in the queens chapel  the discrepancies never affected the faith given to bedloe  lords mss hist mss commission report xi appendix part ii pp 23  at the end of december came in a new accomplicewitness  this was an irishman miles prance a silversmith who had a business among catholics and worked for the queens chapel  unlike all the other informers prance had hitherto been an ordinary fellow enough with a wife and family not a swindling debauchee  he was arrested on december 21 on information given by john wren a lodger of his with whom he had quarrelled  wren had noticed that prance lay out of his own house while godfrey was missing which prance admitted to be true  op cit p 51  prance both said and denied that he slept out while sir edmund was missing  he was flurried and self contradictory  bedloe passing through a room in the house of commons saw prance in custody and at once pretended to recognise in him the chapel keeper under waiter or man in the purple gown whom he had seen by the light of a dark lantern beside godfreys body in a room of somerset house on october 14  there was very little light on that occasion bedloe had said and he finally refused we saw to swear to atkins who had an alibi  but as to prance he said  this is one of the rogues that i saw with a dark lantern about the body of sir edmund but he was then in a periwig  the periwig was introduced in case prance had an alibi  oates had used the same hedge a periwig doth disguise a man very much in colemans case  lestrange iii pp 52 53 65 state trials vii 27  what was bedloes recognition of prance worth  manifestly nothing he had probably seen prance not as a waiter in the queens chapel  now he found him in custody  cautious as regards atkins six weeks earlier bedloe was emboldened now by a train of successes  he had sworn away colemans life  his self contradictions had been blindly swallowed  if prance could prove an alibi what was that to bedloe  the light of the dark lantern had been very bad the rogue under that light had worn a periwig which doth disguise a man very much  bedloe could safely say that he had made an innocent error  much worse blunders had not impaired his credit later he made much worse blunders undetected  he saw his chance and took it  prance who denied everything was hurried to newgate and thrown without bed or covering into the freezing condemned hole where he lay perishing of cold through the night of december 21 december 22 and the night of that day  on december 23 he offered no wonder to confess  he was examined by the lords and december 24 by the council  prance knew all the world knew the details about godfreys bruises the state of his neck and the swordthrusts  he knew that bedloe had located the murder in somerset house  as proclamations for the men accused by bedloe had long been out he may have guessed that le fevre walsh and pritchard were wanted for godfreys murder and had been denounced by bedloe  but this is highly improbable for nothing about godfreys murder is hinted at in the proclamation for le fevre walsh and pritchard  we have no reason then to suppose that prance knew who the men were that bedloe had accused consequently he had to select other victims innocent men of his acquaintance  but as a tradesman of the queen prance knew her residence somerset house the courts outer stairs passages and so on  he knew that bedloe professed to have recognised him there in the scene of the dark lantern  lords journals xiii p 346 lords mss p 59  prance had thus all the materials of a confession ready made but not of a confession identical with bedloes  he was one of the most acute and audacious of the jesuit agents says mr pollock yet mr pollock argues that for prance to tell the tale which he did tell in his circumstances of cold and terror required a most improbable wealth of mental equipment phenomenal powers of memory imagination and coolness if the tale was false therefore prances story of the murder was true except in the details as to the men whom he accused  on december 24 he was taken to the places which he described certainly lying in his tale and preserved consistency though after long search he could not find one of the rooms in which he said that the corpse was laid  pollockp166 ibid p 146 lords journals xii pp 436438  as prance by mr pollocks theory was one of the most acute of jesuit agents and as he had all the materials and all the knowledge necessary for a confession he had obviously no difficulty in making up his evidence  even by mr pollocks showing he was cool and intellectual enough for on that showing he adapted into his narrative very subtly circumstances which were entirely false  if as mr pollock holds prance was astute enough to make a consistent patchwork of fact and lie how can it be argued that with the information at his command he could not invent a complete fiction  again prance by misstating dates wildly hoped says mr pollock to escape as a mere liar  but when prance varied in almost every detail of time place motive and person from bedloe mr pollock does not see that his own explanation holds for the variations  if prance wished to escape as a babbling liar he could not do better than contradict bedloe  he did but the protestant conscience swallowed the contradictions  but again if prance did not know the details of bedloes confession how could he possibly agree with it  pollock p 160  the most essential point of difference was that bedloe accused jesuits le fevre walsh and pritchard who had got clean away prance accused two priests who escaped and three hangers on of somerset house hill berry the porter and green  all three were hanged and all three confessedly were innocent  mr pollock reasons that prance if guilty and he believes him guilty must have known the real authors of the crime that is the jesuits accused by bedloe  he must have accused the innocent not from necessity but from choice and in order to conceal the guilty he knew bedloe to have exposed the real murderers and    he wished to shield them  how did he know whom bedloe had exposed how could he even know the exact spot a room in somerset house where bedloe placed the murder  prance placed it in somerset yard  pollock p 148  it is just as easy to argue on mr pollocks other line that prance varied from bedloe in order that the inconsistencies might prove his own falsehood  but we have no reason to suppose that prance did know the details of bedloes confession as to the motive of the murder the hour the exact spot and the names of the criminals  later he told lestrange a palpable lie  bedloes confession had been shown to him before he made his own  if that were true he purposely contradicted bedloe in detail  but mr pollock rejects the myth  then how did prance know the details given by bedloe  ignorant of bedloes version except in two or three points prance could not but contradict it  he thus could not accuse bedloes jesuits  he did not name other men as mr pollock holds to shield the jesuits  practically they did not need to be shielded  jesuits with seven weeks start of the law were safe enough  even if they were caught were guilty and had the truth extracted from them involving prance the truth about him would come out whether he now denounced them or not  but he did not know that bedloe had denounced them  pollock pp 142 143  mr pollocks theory of the relation of bedloe to godfreys murder is this  bedloe had no hand in the murder and never saw the corpse  the crime was done in somerset house the queens confessor father le fevre sj having singular facilities for entering with his friends and carrying a dead body out through a private doora door not mentioned by any witnesses nor proved to exist by the evidence of a chart  this le fevre with walsh lived in the same house as bedloe  from them bedloe got his information it is easy to conjecture how he could have obtained it  walsh and le fevre were absent from their rooms for a considerable part of the nights of saturday and wednesday october 12 and 16  bedloes suspicions must have been aroused and either by threats or cajolery he wormed part of the secret out of his friends  he obtained a general idea of the way in which the murder had been committed and of the persons concerned in it  one of these was a frequenter of the queens chapel whom he knew by sight  he thought him to be a subordinate official there  pollock pp 157 158  on this amount of evidence bedloe invented his many contradictions why he did not cleave to the facts imparted to him by his jesuit friends we do not learn  a general idea of the way in which the murder was committed any man could form from the state of godfreys body  there was no reason why walsh and le fevre should be absent from their rooms on a considerable part of the night of saturday 12 and so excite bedloes suspicions for on his versions they slew godfrey at 2 pm 5 pm or any hour between  no proof is given that they were in their lodgings or in london during the fortnight which followed oatess three successful jesuit drives of september 2830  in all probability they had fled from london before godfreys murder  no evidence can i find that bedloes jesuits were at their lodgings on october 1216  they were not sought for there but at somerset house  two sisters named salvin were called before the lords committee and deposed that bedloe and le fevre had twice been at their house when walsh said mass there  lords journals xiii pp 343 346 ibid p 353  that is all  bedloe had some acquaintance with the men he accused so had prance with those he denounced  prances victims were innocent and against bedloes there is not so far evidence to convict a cat on for stealing cream  he recognised prance therefore he really knew the murderersthat is all the argument  mr pollocks theory reposes on the belief rejected by lestrange that the jesuits were the damnedest fools  suppose them guilty the first step of a jesuit or of any gentleman about to commit a deliberate deeply planned murder is to secure an alibi  le fevre did not or when questioned on mr pollocks theory by bedloe he would have put him off with his alibi  again a jesuit the queens confessor does not do his murders in the queens house no gentleman does  but if le fevre did commit this solecism he would have told bedloe a different story if he confessed to him at all  these things are elementary  prances confession as to the share of hill berry and green in the murder was admittedly false  on one point he stumbled always were there no guards at the usual places at the time of the carrying on this work he was asked by one of the lords on december 241678  he mumbled i did not take notice of any  he never on later occasions could answer this question about the sentries prance saw no sentries and there is nowhere any evidence that the sentries were ever asked whether they saw either prance le fevre or godfrey in somerset house or the adjacent somerset yard on october 12  they were likely to know both the queens silversmith and the queens confessor and godfrey they may have known prance and the sentries had for each other the secret of fern seed they walked invisible  this of itself is fatal to prances legend  lords journals xiii p 438  no sooner had prance confessed than he withdrew his confession  he prayed to be taken before the king knelt and denied all  next day he did the same before the council  he was restored to his pleasant quarters in newgate and recanted his recantation  he again withdrew and maintained that his confession was false before king and council december 30 he knows nothing in the world of all he has said  the lord chancellor proposed to have him have the rack  state papers domestic charles ii dec 30 1678 bundle 408  probably he did not have the rack but he had the promise of it and nearly died of cold ironed in the condemned cell  he was almost dead with the disorder in his mind and with cold in his body said dr lloyd who visited him to burnet  lloyd got a bed and a fire for the wretch who revived and repeated his original confession  lloyd believed in his sincerity says burnet writing many years later  in 1686 lloyd denied that he believed  burnet ii p 773  prances victims hill berry and green were tried on february 5 1679  prance told his story  on one essential point he professed to know nothing  where was godfrey from five to nine oclock the hour when he was lured into somerset house  he was dogged in fields near holborn to somewhere unknown in st clements  it is an odd fact that though at the dinner hour one oclock close to his own house and to that of mr welden who had asked him to dine sir edmund seems to have dined nowhere  had he done so even in a tavern he must have been recognised  probably godfrey was dead long before 9 pm  mr justice wild pressed prance on this point of where godfrey was he could say nothing  much evidence on one point absurd was collected later by lestrange and is accepted by north in his examen to prove that by some of his friends godfrey was reckoned missing in the afternoon of the fatal saturday  but no such evidence was wanted when hill berry and green were tried  the prosecution with reckless impudence mingled bedloes and prances contradictory lies and accused bedloes jesuits walsh and le fevre in company with prances priests gerald and kelly  bedloe in his story before the jury involved himself in even more contradictory lies than usual but even now he did not say anything that really implicated the men accused by prance while prance said not a word in court or elsewhere about the men accused by bedloe  state trials vii 177 this is said in 1681 in a letter to miles prance north examen p 201 state trials vii 178 speech of serjeant stringer ibid vii 179183  lord chief justice scroggs actually told the jury that for two witnesses to agree as to many material circumstances with one another that had never conversed together is impossible    they agree so in all things  the two witnesses did not agree at all as we have abundantly seen but in the fury of protestant fear any injustice could be committed and every kind of injustice was committed at this trial  prance later pleaded guilty on a charge of perjury and well he might  bedloe died and went to his own place with lies in his mouth  state trials vii 216  5  if i held a brief against the jesuits i should make much of a point which mr pollock does not labour  just about the time when prance began confessing in london december 24 1678 one stephen dugdale styled gentleman was arrested in staffordshire examined and sent up to town  he was a catholic and had been in lord astons service but was dismissed for dishonesty  in the country at tixall he knew a jesuit named evers and through evers he professed to know much about the mythical plot to kill the king and the rest of the farrago of lies  at the trial of the five jesuits in june 1679 dugdale told what he had told privately under examination on march 21 1679  this revelation was that harcourt a jesuit had written from town to evers a jesuit at tixall by the night post of saturday october 12 1678 this very night sir edmundbury sic godfrey is dispatched  the letter reached tixall by monday october 14  fitzherbert mss state trials vii 338  mr pollock writes  dugdale was proved to have spoken on tuesday october 15 1678 of the death of a justice of the peace in westminster which does not go far  but if this is proved it appears to go all the way unless we can explain dugdales information without involving the guilty knowledge of harcourt  the proof that dugdale on tuesday october 15 spoke at tixall of godfreys death two days before godfreys body was found near london stands thus  at the trial of the jesuits a gentleman chetwyn gave evidence that on the morning of tuesday october 15 a mr sanbidge told him that dugdale had talked at an alehouse about the slaying of a justice of peace of westminster  chetwyn was certain of the date because on that day he went to litchfield races  at litchfield he stayed till saturday october 19 when he heard from london of the discovery of godfreys body  chetwyn asked dugdale about this when dugdale was sent to town in december 1678  dugdale said he remembered the facts but as he did not report them to his examiners a singular omission he was not called as a witness at the trial of berry green and hill  chetwyn later asked dugdale why he was not called and said  pray let me see the copy of your deposition sworn before the council  he showed it me and there was not a syllable of it that i could see but afterwards it appeared to be there  pollock p 341 note 2 state trials vii 339 341  lord chief justice  that is not very material if the thing itself be true   chetwyn  but its not being there made me remember it  its later appearance there shows how depositions were handled  chetwyn in june 1679 says that he heard of dugdales words as to the murder from mr sanbidge or sambidge or sawbridge  at the trial of lord stafford 1680 sanbidge took it upon his salvation that dugdale told him nothing of the matter and vowed that dugdale was a wicked rogue  mr wilson the parish clergyman of tixall was said to have heard dugdale speak of godfreys death on october 14  he also remembered no such thing  hanson a runningman heard dugdale talk of the murder of a justice of the peace at westminster as early as the morning of monday october 14 1678  the london saturday post arrived at tixall on monday morning  two gentlemen birch and turton averred that the news of the murder was all over the country near tixall on tuesday october 15 but turton was not sure that he did not hear first of the fact on friday october 18 which by ordinary post from london was impossible  state trials vii 1406  such was the evidence to show that dugdale spoke of godfreys death in the country two or three days before godfreys body was found the fact can scarcely be said to be proved considering the excitement of mens minds the fallacies of memory the silence of dugdale at his first examination before the council sanbidges refusal to corroborate chetwyn and wilsons inability to remember anything about a matter so remarkable and so recent  to deny like sanbidge to be unable to remember like wilson demanded some courage in face of the frenzied terror of the protestants  birch confessedly took no notice of the rumour when it first reached him but at the trial of green berry and hill i told several gentlemen that i did perfectly remember before thursday it was discoursed of in the country by several gentlemen where i lived the several gentlemen whom birch told were not called to corroborate him  in short the evidence seems to fall short of demonstrative proof  state trials vii 1455  but if it were all true lestrange and a writer who made the assertion in 1681 collected a good deal of evidence to show that a rumour of godfreys disappearance and probable murder by bloody papists was current in london on the afternoon of the day when he disappeared saturday october 12  mr pollock says that the evidence is not to be relied on and part of it attributing the rumour to godfreys brothers is absurd  they were afraid that godfrey had killed himself not that he was murdered by papists that his household could not have known that he would not return is not to the point  the people who raised the rumour were not of godfreys household  nor is it to the point exactly that being invited to dine on saturday by mr welden who saw him on friday night he said he could not tell whether he should  for wynell had expected to dine with him at weldens to talk over some private business about house property  wynell the authority for godfreys being master of a dangerous secret did expect to meet godfrey at dinner and knowing the fears to which godfrey often confessed might himself have originated by his fussy inquiries the rumour that sir edmund was missing  the wild excitement of the town might add murdered by papists and the rumour might really get into a letter from london of saturday night reaching tixall by monday morning  north says  it was in every ones mouth where is godfrey  he has not been at his house all this day they say he is murdered by the papists  that such a pheemee might arise is very conceivable  in all probability the report which bishop burnet and dr lloyd heard of the discovery of godfreys body before it was discovered was another rumour based on a lucky conjecture  it is said that the report of the fall of khartoum was current in cairo on the day of the unhappy event  rumour is correct once in a myriad times and in october 1678 london was humming with rumours  this report might get into a letter to tixall and if so dugdales early knowledge is accounted for if knowledge he had which i have shown to be disputable  letter to miles prance march 1681  lestrange brief history iii pp 195201 lords mss p 48 pollock p 93 and note 2 lestrange brief history iii pp 188 190 195 examen p 201 anglicised version of the authors original greek text  dugdales talk was thought at the time to clinch the demonstration that the jesuits were concerned in godfreys murder lestrange says and he brings in his witnesses to prove that the london rumour existed and could reach the country by post  in fact chetwyn on the evidence of sanbidge suggested this improvement of his original romance to dugdale and sanbidge contradicted chetwyn he knew nothing of the matter  such is the value of the only testimony against the jesuits which deserves consideration  we do not propose to unriddle this mystery but to show that the most recent and industrious endeavour to solve the problem is unsuccessful  we cannot deny that godfrey may have been murdered to conceal catholic secrets of which thanks to his inexplicable familiarity with coleman he may have had many  but we have tried to prove that we do not know him to have had any such catholic secrets or much beyond oatess fables and we have probably succeeded in showing that against the jesuits as sir edmunds destroyers there is no evidence at all  had modern men of science unaffected by political and religious bias given evidence equivalent to that of the two surgeons one might conceive that godfrey was probably slain as macaulay thought by hotheaded catholics  but i confess to a leaning in favour of the picture of godfrey sketched by lestrange of the man confessing to hereditary melancholy fretted and alarmed by the tracasseries and perils of his own position alarming his friends and endangering himself by his gloomy hints settling on the last night of his life friday october 11 with morbid anxiety some details of a parish charity founded by himself uncertain as to whether he can dine with welden at about one next day seen at that very hour near his own house yet dining nowhere said to have roamed before that hour to paddington woods and back again seen vaguely perhaps wandering near primrose hill in the afternoon and found dead five days later in the bushcovered ditch near primrose hill his own sword through his breast and back his body in the attitude of one who had died a roman death  between us and that conclusionsuicide caused by fearnothing stands but the surgical evidence and the grounds of that evidence are disputed  surgical evidence however is a fact that winna ding and i do not rely on the theory of suicide  but if godfrey was murdered by catholics it seems odd that nobody has suggested as the probable scene the savoy which lay next on the right to somerset yard  the savoy so well described by scott in peveril of the peak and by macaulay was by this time a rambling ruinous labyrinth of lanes and dilapidated dwellings tenanted by adventurers and skulking catholics  it was an alsatia says macaulay more dangerous than the bog of allen or the passes of the grampians  a courageous magistrate might be lured into the savoy to stop a fight or on any similar pretence and once within a rambling old dwelling of the hospital would be in far greater peril than in the queens guarded residence  catholic adventurers might here destroy godfrey either for his alleged zeal or to seize his papers or because he so great a friend of catholics as he was might know too much  the body could much more easily be removed perhaps by water from the savoy than from the guarded gates of somerset house  oates knew the savoy and said falsely that he had met coleman there  if murder was done the savoy was as good a place for the deed as the forest of bondy  state trials vii 28

at sommerset house himself at the very time he swore the murder was committed     his having been there at that time himself made it impossible that a man should be assaulted in the court murderd and hurryd into the backstairs when there was a centry at every door a foot company on the guard and yet nobody see or knew anything of it  now evidence was brought that at 5 pm  on saturday october 12 the queen decided to be not at home  but bedloe placed the murder as early as 2 pm sometimes and between two oclock and five oclock the king may as the duke of york says have been at somerset house  reresby in his diary for november 21 1678 says that the king told him on that day that he was satisfied bedloe had given false evidence as to godfreys murder the duke of york probably repeats the kings grounds for this opinion  charles also knew that the room selected by bedloe as the scene of the deed was impossible  life of james ii i pp 527 528  note ii  prance and the white house club  the

a member mr prince a silversmith in holborn mr prance was a silversmith in covent garden  on december 21 prance said that he had not seen rawson for a year he was asked about rawson  the members of the club met at the white house during the sitting of the coroners inquest there on friday october 18 prance according to the author of a letter to miles prance was present  he may have been a member he may have known the useful ditch where godfreys corpse was found but this does not rise beyond the value of conjecture  lords mss pp 46 47 51  note iii  the jesuit murderers  there is difficulty in identifying as jesuits the jesuits accused by bedloe  the chief is father le herry called le ferry by mr pollock and mr foley  he also appears as le faire lee phaire le fere but usually le fevre in the documents  there really was a priest styled le fevre  a man named mark preston was accused of being a priest and a jesuit  when arrested he declared that he was a married layman with a family  he had been married in mr langhornes rooms in the temple by le fevre a priest in 1667 or at least about eleven years before 1678  i cannot find that le fevre was known as a jesuit to the english members of the society  he is not in oatess list of conspirators  he does not occur in foleys records vol v a very painstaking work  nor would he be omitted because accused of a crime rather he would be reckoned as more or less of a martyr like the other fathers implicated by the informers  the author of florus anglo bavaricus names pharius le phaire valschius walsh and atkinsus as denounced by bedloe but clearly knows nothing about them  atkinsus is mr pepyss clerk samuel atkins who had an alibi  valschius is walsh certainly a priest but not to be found in foleys records as a jesuit  brit mus addit ms 11055 245 lords journals xiii 331 332 lords mss p 99 liege 1685 p 137  that le fevre was the queens confessor i find no proof  but she had a priest named ferrera who might be confused with le faire he was accused of calling a waterman to help to take two persons down the river on november 6 1678  he was summoned before the lords but we do not know that he came  ferrera may have been the queens confessor he was one of the queens priests  in 1670 she had twentyeight priests as chaplains twelve were portuguese capuchins six were benedictines two dominicans and the rest seculars  mrs prance admitted that she knew mr le phaire and that he went for a priest  of le fevre jesuit and queens confessor i know no more  lords mss p 49 maziere brady episcopal succession in england p 124 1876 lords mss p 52  it appears that mr pollocks authority for styling le fevre the queens confessor is a slip of information appended to the coventry notes in the longleat mss on bedloes deposition of november 7 i do not know the authority of the writer of the slip  it is admitted that the authority of a slip pinned on to a letter of randolphs is not sufficient to prove john knox to have been one of the riccio conspirators  the same slip appears to style charles walsh a jesuit of the household of lord bellasis  this walsh is unknown to foley  pollock pp 155 157 note 2 in each case  as to father pritchard a jesuit bedloe in the british museum ms accuses penthard a layman  he develops into pridgeot a jesuit later he is father pritchard sj  there was such a jesuit and according to the jesuit annual letter of 1680 he passed sixteen years in the south wales mission and never once went to london  in 1680 he died in concealment  it is clear that if le fevre was the queens confessor the sentries at somerset house could prove whether he was there on the day of godfreys murder  no such evidence was adduced  but if le fevre was not the queens confessor he would scarcely have facilities for smuggling a dead body out of a private door   longleat ms pollock p 386 foley v 875877    iv  the false jeanne darc    who that ever saw jeanne darc could mistake her for another woman no portrait of the maid was painted from the life but we know the light perfect figure the black hair cut short like a soldiers and we can imagine the face of her who says young laval writing to his mother after his first meeting with the deliverer of france seemed a thing all divine  yet even two of her own brothers certainly recognised another girl as the maid five years after her death by fire  it is equally certain that eight years after the martyrdom of jeanne an impostor dwelt for several days in orleans and was there publicly regarded as the heroine who raised the siege in 1429  her family accepted the impostor for sixteen years  these facts rest on undoubted evidence  to unravel the threads of the story is a task very difficult  my table is strewn with pamphlets papers genealogies essays the authors taking opposite sides as to the question was jeanne darc burned at rouen on may 30 1431  unluckily even the most exact historians yea even m quicherat the editor of the five volumes of documents and notices about the maid 18411849 make slips in dates where dates are all important  it would add confusion if we dwelt on these errors or on the bias of the various disputants  not a word was said at the trial of rehabilitation in 14521456 about the supposed survival of the maid  but there are indications of the inevitable popular belief that she was not burned  long after the fall of khartoum rumours of the escape of charles gordon were current even in our own day people are loth to believe that their hero has perished  like arthur he will come again and from arthur to james iv of scotland from james iv to the duke of monmouth or the son of louis xvi the populace believes and hopes that its darling has not perished  we destroyed the mahdis body to nullify such a belief or to prevent worship at his tomb  in the same way at rouen when the maid was dead as the english feared that she might be said to have escaped they bade the executioner rake back the fire somewhat that the bystanders might see her dead  an account of a similar precaution the fire drawn back after the maids robes were burned away is given in brutal detail by the contemporary diarist who was not present the bourgeois de paris  quicherat iii p 191  these lines are not in ms 5970  m save in jehanne des armoises pucelle dorleans p 6 nancy 1893 interpolates in italics words of his own into his translation of this text which improve the force of his argument quicherat iv p 471  in spite of all this the populace as reflected in several chronicles was uncertain that jeanne had died  a manuscript in the british museum says  at last they burned her or another woman like her on which point many persons are and have been of different opinions  save p 7 citing bibliotheque de lecole des chartes ii second series  this hopeful rumour of the maids escape was certain to arise populus vult decipi  now we reach a point at which we may well doubt how to array the evidence  but probably the best plan is first to give the testimony of undoubted public documents from the treasury accounts of the town of orleans  in that loyal city the day of the maids death had been duly celebrated by religious services the orleanese had indulged in no illusions  none the less on august 9 1436 the good town pays its pursuivant fleurdelys because he had brought letters to the town from jehanne la pucelle  on august 21 money is paid to jehan du lys brother of jehanne la pucelle because he has visited the king charles vii is returning to his sister the maid and is in want of cash as the kings order given to him was not fully honoured  on october 18 another pursuivant is paid for a mission occupying six weeks  he has visited the maid at arlon in luxembourg and carried letters from her to the king at loches on the loire  earlier in august a messenger brought letters from the maid and went on to guillaume belier bailiff of troyes in whose house the real maid had lodged at chinon in the dawn of her mission march 1429  thus the impostor was dealing by letters with some of the people who knew the maid best and was freely accepted by her brother jehan  quicherat v pp 326327  for three years the accountbooks of orleans are silent about this strange pucelle  orleans has not seen her but has had jeannes brothers word for her reappearance and the word probably of the pursuivants sent to her  jeannes annual funeral services are therefore discontinued  mention of her in the accounts again appears on july 18 1439 money is now paid to jaquet leprestre for ten pints and a chopine of wine given to dame jehanne des armoises  on the 29th 30th and on august 1 when she left the town entries of payments for quantities of wine and food for jehanne des armoises occur and she is given 210 livres after deliberation with the town council for the good that she did to the said town during the siege of 1429  the only jehanne who served orleans in the siege was jehanne darc here then she is as jehanne des armoises in orleans for several days in 1439 feasted and presented with money by command of the town council  again she returns and receives propine on september 4  the leprestre who is paid for the wine was he who furnished wine to the real maid in 1429  quicherat v pp 331332  it is undeniable that the people of orleans must have seen the impostor in 1439 and they ceased to celebrate service on the day of the true maids death  really it seems as if better evidence could not be that jeanne des armoises nee jeanne darc was alive in 1439  all orleans knew the maid and yet the town council recognised the impostor  she is again heard of on september 27 1439 when the town of tours pays a messenger for carrying to orleans letters which jeanne wrote to the king and also letters from the bailli of touraine to the king concerning jeanne  the real jeanne could not write but the impostor too may have employed a secretary  quicherat v p 332  in june 1441 charles vii pardoned for an escape from prison one de siquemville who two years ago or thereabouts 1439 was sent by the late gilles de raiz marechal de france to take over the leadership of a commando at mans which had hitherto been under une appelee jehanne qui se disoit pucelle  the phrase one styled jehanne who called herself pucelle does not indicate fervent belief on the part of the king  apparently this jeanne went to orleans and tours after quitting her command at mans in 1439  if ever she saw gilles de raiz the notorious monster of cruelty in 1439 she saw a man who had fought in the campaigns of the true maid under her sacred banner argent a dove on an azure field  quicherat v p 333 she never used the arms given to her and her family by charles vii  here public documents about the impostor fall silent  it is not known what she was doing between august 9 1436 and september 1439 at the earlier date she had written to the town of orleans at the later she was writing to the king from tours  here an error must be avoided  according to the author of the chronicle of the constable of alvaro de luna the impostor was in 1436 sending a letter and ambassadors to the king of spain asking him to succour la rochelle  the ambassadors found the king at valladolid and the constable treated the letter as if it were a relic with great reverence  madrid 1784 p 131  the impostor flies high  but the whole story is false  m quicherat held at first that the date and place may be erroneously stated but did not doubt that the false pucelle did send her ambassadors and letter to the king of spain  we never hear that the true maid did anything of the sort  but quicherat changed his mind on the subject  the author of the chronicle of alvaro de luna merely cites a coronica de la poncella  that coronica says quicherat later is a tissue of fables a romance in the spanish taste and in this nonsense occurs the story of the embassy to the spanish king  that story does not apply to the false pucelle and is not true a point of which students of quicherats great work need to be warned his correction may escape notice  revue des questions historiques april 1 1881 pp 553566 article by the comte de puymaigre  we thus discard a strong trump in the hand of believers that the impostor was the real maid had a pucelle actually sent ambassadors to spain in 1436 their case would be stronger than it is  next why is the false pucelle styled jeanne des armoises in the town accounts of orleans in 1439  this leads us to the proofs of the marriage of the false pucelle in 1436 with a monsieur robert des armoises a gentleman of the metz country  the evidence is in a confused state  in the reign of louis xiv lived a pere vignier a savant who is said to have been a fraudulent antiquary  whether this be true or not his brother after the death of pere vignier wrote a letter to the duc de grammont which was published in the mercure galant of november 1683  the writer says that his brother pere vignier found at metz an ancient chronicle of the town in manuscript and had a copy made by a notary royal  the extract is perfectly genuine whatever the reputation of the discoverer may be  this portion of the chronicle of the doyen of saintthibaud de metz exists in two forms of which the latter whoever wrote it is intended to correct the former  in the earlier shape the author says that on may 20 1436 the pucelle jeanne came to metz and was met by her brothers pierre a knight and jehan an esquire  pierre had in fact fought beside his sister when both he and she were captured at compiegne in may 1430  jehan as we have already seen was in attendance on the false maid in august 1436  according to the metz chronicle these two brothers of the maid on may 20 1436 recognised the impostor for their sister and the accountbooks of orleans leave no doubt that jehan at least actually did accept her as such in august 1436 four months after they met in may  now this lasting recognition by one at least of the brothers is a fact very hard to explain  m anatole france offers a theory of the easiest  the brothers went to lorraine in may 1436 to see the pretender  did they hurry to expose the fraud or did they not think it credible on the other hand that with gods permission the saint had risen again nothing could seem impossible after all that they had seen    they acted in good faith  a woman said to them i am jeanne your sister  they believed because they wished to believe  and so forth about the credulity of the age  the age was not promiscuously credulous  in a resurrection of jeanne after death the age did not believe  the brothers had never seen anything of the kind nor had the town council of orleans  they had nothing to gain by their belief the brothers had everything to gain  one might say that they feigned belief in the hope that there was money in it but one cannot say that about the people of orleans who had to spend money  the case is simply a puzzle  anatole france la fausse pucelle revue de famille feb 15 1891 i cite from the quotation by m p lanery darc in deux lettres beauvais 1894 a brochure which i owe to the kindness of the author  after displaying feats of horsemanship in male attire and being accepted by many gentlemen and receiving gifts of horses and jewels the impostor went to arlon in luxembourg where she was welcomed by the lady of the duchy elizabeth de gorlitz madame de luxembourg  and at arlon she was in october 1436 as the town accounts of orleans have proved  thence says the metz chronicle the comte de warnonbourg took her to cologne and gave her a cuirass  thence she returned to arlon in luxembourg and there married the knight robert des hermoises or armoises and they dwelt in their own house at metz as long as they would  thus jeanne became madame des hermoises or ermaises or in the town accounts of orleans in 1439 des armoises  so says the metz chronicle in one form but in another manuscript version it denounces this pucelle as an impostor who especially deceived tous les plus grands  her brothers we read the real maids brothers brought her to the neighbourhood of metz  she dwelt with madame de luxembourg and married robert des armoize the pere vigniers brother in 1683 published the first but not the second of these two accounts in the mercure galant for november  quicherat v pp 321324 cf iv 321  in or about 1439 nider a witchhunting priest in his formicarium speaks of a false jeanne at cologne protected by ulrich of wirtemberg the metz chronicle has comte de warnonbourg who took the woman to cologne  the woman says nider was a noisy lass who came eating drinking and doing conjuring feats the inquisition failed to catch her thanks to ulrichs protection  she married a knight and presently became the concubine of a priest in metz  this reads like a piece of confused gossip  quicherat v pp 324325  vigniers brother goes on to say 1683 in the mercure galant that his learned brother found the wedding contract of jeanne la pucelle and robert des armoises in the charter chest of the m des armoises of his own day the time of louis xiv  the brother of vignier had himself met the son of this des armoises who corroborated the fact  but the original copy of this ancient manuscript vanished with all the papers of pere vignier at his death  two months later in the spring of 1684 vienne de plancy wrote to the mercure galant saying that the late illustrious brother of the duc de grammont was fully persuaded and argued very well in favour of his opinion that the actual pucelle did not die at rouen but married robert des armoises  he quoted a genuine petition of pierre du lys the brother of the real maid to the duc dorleans of 1443  pierre herein says he has warred in the company of jeanne la pucelle his sister jusqua son absentement and so on till this hour exposing his body and goods in the kings service  this argued m de grammont implied that jeanne was not dead pierre does not say feue ma soeur my late sister and his words may even mean that he is still with her  avec laquelle jusques a son absentement et depuis

 the tract was published in 100 copies only  though no copy of the marriage contract of jeanne and des armoises exists quicherat prints a deed of november 7 1436 in which robert des armoises and his wife la pucelle de france acknowledge themselves to be married and sell a piece of land  the paper was first cited by dom calmet among the documents in his histoire de lorraine it is rather under suspicion  there seems no good reason however to doubt the authenticity of the fact that a woman calling herself jeanne pucelle de france did in 1436 marry robert des armoises a man of ancient and noble family  hence in the town accounts of tours and orleans after october 1436 up to september 1439 the impostor appears as mme jehanne des armoises  in august 1436 she was probably not yet married as the orleans accounts then call her jehanne la pucelle when they send  their pursuivants to her men who doubtless had known the true maid in 14291430  these men did not undeceive the citizens who at least till september 1439 accepted the impostor there is hardly a more extraordinary fact in history  for the rest we know that in 14361439 the impostor was dealing with the king by letters and that she held a command under one of his marshals who had known the true maid well in 14291430  it appears possible that emboldened by her amazing successes the false pucelle sought an interview with charles vii  the authority to be sure is late  the king had a chamberlain de boisy who survived till 1480 when he met pierre sala one of the gentlemen of the chamber of charles viii  de boisy having served charles vii knew and told sala the nature of the secret that was between that king and the true maid  that such a secret existed is certain alain chartier the poet may have been present in march 1429 when the maid spoke words to charles vii which filled him with a spiritual rapture  so alain wrote to a foreign prince in july 1429 m quicherat avers that alain was present  i cannot find this in his letter  any amount of evidence for the sign given to the king by his own statement is found throughout the two trials that of rouen and that of rehabilitation  dunois the famous bastard of orleans told the story to basin bishop of lisieux and at rouen the french examiners of the maid vainly tried to extort from her the secret in 1480 boisy who had been used to sleep in the bed of charles vii according to the odd custom of the time told the secret to sala  the maid in 1429 revealed to charles the purpose of a secret prayer which he had made alone in his oratory imploring light on the question of his legitimacy  m quicherat no bigot thinks that the authenticity of the revelation is beyond the reach of doubt  quicherat apercus nouveaux p 62 proces v p 133 for the complete

a secret between the true maid and charles vii  the king of course could not afford to let it be known that he had secretly doubted whether he were legitimate  boisy alone at some later date was admitted to his confidence  boisy went on to tell sala that ten years later whether after 1429 or after 1431 the date of the maids death is uncertain a pretended pucelle very like the first was brought to the king he was in a garden and bade one of his gentlemen personate him the impostor was not deceived for she knew that charles having hurt his foot then wore a soft boot  she passed the gentleman and walked straight to the king whereat he was astonished and knew not what to say but gently saluting her exclaimed pucelle my dear you are right welcome back in the name of god who knows the secret that is between you and me  the false pucelle then knelt confessed her sin and cried for mercy  for her treachery some were sorely punished as in such a case was fitting  quicherat v p 281  there is doubt as to whether boisys tale does not refer to jeanne la feronne a visionary  varlet de vireville charles vii iii p 425 note 1  if any deserved punishment the maids brothers did but they rather flourished and prospered as time went on than otherwise  it appears then that in 14391441 the king exposed the false pucelle or another person jeanne la feronne  a great foe of the true maid the diarist known as the bourgeois de paris in his journal for august 1440 tells us that just then many believed that jeanne had not been burned at rouen  the gens darmes brought to paris a woman who had been received with great honour at orleans clearly jeanne des armoises  the university and parlement had her seized and exhibited to the public at the palais  her life was exposed she confessed that she was no maid but a mother and the wife of a knight des armoises  after this follows an unintelligible story of how she had gone on pilgrimage to rome and fought in the italian wars  apparently she now joined a regiment at paris et puis sen alla but all is very vaguely recorded  quicherat v pp 334 335 cf lefevrepontalis les sources allemands 113115 fontemoing paris 1903   the most extraordinary circumstance remains to be told  apparently the brothers and cousins of the true maid continued to entertain and accept the impostor  we have already seen that in 1443 pierre du lys in his petition to the duc dorleans writes as if he did not believe in the death of his sister but that may be a mere ambiguity of language we cannot repose on the passage  in 1476 a legal process and inquest was held as to the descendants of the brother of the mother of jeanne darc named voulton or vouthon  among other witnesses was henry de voulton called perinet a carpenter aged fiftytwo  he was grandson of the brother of the mother of jeanne darc his grandmaternal aunt this witness declared that he had often seen the two brothers du lys jehan and pierre with their sister la pucelle come to the village of sermaise and feast with his father  they always accepted him the witness as their cousin in all places where he has been conversed eaten and drunk in their company  now perinet is clearly speaking of his associations with jeanne and her brothers after he himself was a man grown  born in 1424 he was only five years old when the maid left domremy for ever  he cannot mean that as a child of five he was always in various places drinking with the maid and her brothers  indeed he says taking a distinction that in his early childhoodson jeune aagehe visited the family of darc with his father at domremy and saw the maid qui pour lors estoit jeune fille  de bouteiller et de braux nouvelles recherches sur la famille de jeanne darc paris 1879 pp 8 9  moreover the next witness the cure of sermaise aged fiftythree says that twentyfour years ago in 1452 a young woman dressed as a man calling herself jeanne la pucelle used to come to sermaise and that as he heard she was the near kinswoman of all the voultons and he saw her make great and joyous cheer with them while she was at sermaise  clearly it was about this time in or before 1452 that perinet himself was conversant with jehan and pierre du lys and with their sister calling herself la pucelle  op cit p 11  again jehan le montigueue aged about seventy deposed that in 1449 a woman calling herself jeanne la pucelle came to sermaise and feasted with the voultons as also did but he does not say at the same time the maids brother jehan du lys  jehan du lys could at least if he did not accept her have warned his cousins the voultons against their pretended kinswoman the false pucelle  but for some three years at least she came a welcome guest to sermaise matched herself against the cure at tennis and told him that he might now say that he had played against la pucelle de france  this news gave him the greatest pleasure  op cit pp 45 mm de bouteiller and de graux do not observe the remarkable nature of this evidence as regards the brothers of the maid see their preface p xxx  jehan guillaume aged seventysix had seen both the selfstyled pucelle and the real maids brothers at the house of the voultons he did not know whether she was the true maid or not  it is certain practically that this pucelle so merry at sermaise with the brothers and cousins of the maid was the jeanne des armoises of 14361439  the du lys family could not successively adopt two impostors as their sister  again the woman of circ 14491452 is not a younger sister of jeanne who in 1429 had no sister living though one catherine whom she dearly loved was dead  we have now had glimpses of the impostor from 1436 to 1440 when she seems to have been publicly exposed though the statement of the bourgeois de paris is certainly that of a prejudiced writer and again we have found the impostor accepted by the paternal and maternal kin of the maid about 14491452  in 1452 the preliminary steps towards the rehabilitation of the true maid began ending triumphantly in 1456  probably the families of voulton and du lys now after the trial began in 1452 found their jolly tennisplaying sister and cousin inconvenient  she reappears not at sermaise in 1457  in that year king rene father of margaret wife of our henry vi gives a remission to jeanne de sermaises  m lecoy de la march in his roi rene 1875 made this discovery and took jeanne de sermaises for our old friend jeanne des ermaises or des armoises  she was accused of having long called herself jeanne la pucelle and deceived many persons who had seen jeanne at the siege of orleans  she has lain in prison but is let out in february 1457 on a five years ticket of leave so to speak provided she bear herself honestly in dress and in other matters as a woman should do  probably though at present the wife of jean douillet this jeanne still wore male costume hence the reference to bearing herself honestly in dress  she acknowledges nothing merely says that the charge of imposture lui a ete impose and that she has not been actainte daucun autre vilain cas  at this date jeanne cruised about anjou and the town of saumur  and here at the age of forty five if she was of the same age as the true maid we lose sight for ever of this extraordinary woman  of course if she was the genuine maid the career of la pucelle de france ends most ignobly  the idea was nuts as the elizabethans said to a good anticlerical frenchman m lesigne who in 1889 published la fin dune legende  there would be no chance of canonising a pucelle who was twice married and lived a life of frolic  lecoy de la marche le roi rene ii 281283 1875  a more serious and discreet scholar m gaston save in 1893 made an effort to prove that jeanne was not burned at rouen  he supposed that the duchess of bedford let jeanne out of prison and bribed the two priests massieu and ladvenu who accompanied the maid to the scaffold to pretend that they had been with her not with a substituted victim  this victim went with hidden face to the scaffold le visage embronche says percival de cagny a retainer of jeannes beau duc dalencon  the townspeople were kept apart by 800 english soldiers  the madame de luxembourg who entertained the impostor at arlon 1436 was perhaps the same as she who entertained the real jeanne at beaurevoir in 1430 unluckily that lady died in november 1430  jehanne des armoises pucelle dorleans nancy 1893 quicherat iv 36 quicherat ii 14 19  however the madame de luxembourg who entertained the impostor was aunt by marriage of the duke of burgundy the true maids enemy and she had means of being absolutely well informed so the case remains very strange  strange too it is that in the records of payment of pension to the true maids mother from the town of orleans she is mere de la pucelle till 1452 when she becomes mere de feue la pucelle mother of the late pucelle  that is to say the family and the town of orleans recognised the impostor till in 1452 the trial of rehabilitation began  so i have inferred as regards the family from the record of the inquest of 1476 which though it suited the argument of m save was unknown to him  his brochure distressed the faithful  the abbe dr jangen editor of le pretre wrote anxiously to m p lanery darc who replied in a tract already cited 1894  but m lanery darc did not demolish the sounder parts of the argument of m save and he knew nothing of the inquest of 1476 or said nothing  then arose m lefevre pontalis  admitting the merits of m saves other works he noted many errors in this tract  for example the fire at rouen was raked as we saw more or less admodum clear of the dead body of the martyr  but would it be easy in the circumstances to recognise a charred corpse  the two mesdames de luxembourg were distinguished apart as by quicherat  the vignier documents as to robert des armoises were said to be impostures  quicherat however throws no doubt on the deed of sale by jehanne and her husband des armoises in november 1436  many errors in dates were exposed  the difficulty about the impostors reception in orleans was recognised and it is of course the difficulty  m lefevre de pontalis however urges that her brothers are not said to have been with her and there is not a trace of their persistence in their error after the first months of the imposture  but we have traces nay proofs in the inquest of 1476  the inference of m save from the fact that the pucelle is never styled the late pucelle in the orleans accounts till 1452 is merely declared inadmissible  the fact on the other hand is highly significant  in 1452 the impostor was recognised by the family but in that year began the trial of rehabilitation and we hear no more of her among the du lys and the voultons  m lefevre pontalis merely mentions the inquest of 1476 saying that the impostor of sermaise 14491452 may perhaps have been another impostor not jeanne des armoises  the family of the maid was not capable surely of accepting two impostors one down the other come on  this is utterly incredible  le moyen age june 1895  in brief the family of jeanne in 143614491452 were revelling with jeanne des armoises accepting her some as sister some as cousin  in 1439 the town council of orleans not only gave many presents of wine and meat to the same woman recognising her as their saviour in the siege of 1429 but also gave her 210 livres now on february 7 1430 the town of orleans had refused to give 100 crowns at jeannes request to heliote daughter of her scottish painter heuves polnoir  they said that they could not afford the money  they were not the people to give 210 livres to a selfstyled pucelle without examining her personally  moreover the impostor supped in august 1439 with jehan luillier who in june 1429 had supplied the true maid with cloth a present from charles dorleans  he was in orleans during the siege of 1429 and gave evidence as to the actions of the maid at the trial in 1456  this man clearly did not detect or expose the impostor she was again welcomed at orleans six weeks after he supped with her  these facts must not be overlooked and they have never been explained  so there we leave the most surprising and baffling of historical mysteries  it is of course an obvious conjecture that in 1436 jehan and pierre du lys may have pretended to recognise the impostor in hopes of honour and rewards such as they had already received through their connection with the maid  but if the impostor was unmasked in 1440 there was no more to be got in that way  while the nature of the arts of the false pucelle is inscrutable the evidence as to the heroic death of the true maid is copious and deeply moving  there is absolutely no room for doubt that she won the martyrs crown at rouen  quicherat v 155 quicherat v pp 112113331 iii p 23 by 1452 pierre du lys had un grand hotel opposite the ile des boeufs at orleans given to him for two lives by charles dorleans in 1443  he was also building a town house in orleans and the chevalier pierre was no snob for he brought from sermaise his carpenter kinsman perinet de voulton to superintend the erection nouvelles recherches pp 19 20    v  junius and lord lytteltons ghost    sir said dr johnson it is the most extraordinary thing that has happened in my day  the most extraordinary thing that had happened in dr johnsons day was the warning to the noble peer generally spoken of as the wicked lord lyttelton  the doctor went on thus  i heard it with my own ears from his uncle lord westcote  i am so glad to have every evidence of the spiritual world that i am willing to believe it  dr adams replied you have evidence enoughgood evidence which needs no support  dr johnson growled out i like to have more  thus the doctor was willing to believe what it suited him to believe even though he had the tale at third or fourth hand for lord westcote was not with the wicked lord lyttelton at the time of his death on november 27 1779  dr johnsons observations were made on june 12 1784  to lord westcotes narrative we shall return  as a study in russian scandal and the growth and development of stories this anecdote of lord lyttelton deserves attention  so first we must glance at the previous history of the hero  thomas lord lyttelton was born says mr coulton in the quarterly review no 179 p 111 on january 30 1744  he was educated at eton where dr barnard thought his boyish promise even superior to that of charles james fox  his sketches of scenery in scotland reminded mrs montagu of the vigour of salvator rosa combined with the grace of claude lorraine  at the age of nineteen already affianced to miss warburton he went on the grand tour and excelled the ordinary model of young debauchery abroad  mr james boswell found a circe at siena lyttelton found circes everywhere  he returned to england in 1765 and that learned lady mrs carter the translator of epictetus admired his talents and elegant manners as much as she detested his vices  in 1768 he entered the house of commons and in his maiden speech implored the assembly to believe that america was more important than mr wilkes and liberty unseated for bribery in january 1769 he vanished from the public view more or less for a season at least he is rarely mentioned in memoirs and coulton thinks that young lyttelton was now engagedin what does the reader suppose  in writing the letters of junius  the writer was not croker but mr coulton a kentish gentleman says lockhart february 7 1851 to his daughter charlotte if lyttelton went to italy on being ejected from parliament as mr rigg says he did in the dictionary of national biography coultons theory will be hard to justify  he was clever enough his rank was like that assumed as his own by junius his eloquence as he proved later in the house of lords was vituperative enough he shared some of juniuss hatreds while he proclaimed like junius that the country was going to the dogs just as junius was ending his letters the prodigal thomas lyttelton returned to his fathers house and chatham wrote to congratulate the parent february 15 1772  on may 12 1772 junius published his last letter in the public advertiser and on june 26 mr lyttelton married a widow a mrs peach  he soon left his wife and was abroad with a barmaid when his father died in 1773  in january 1774 he took his seat in the lords  though fox thought him a bad man his first speech was in favour of securing to authors a perpetual copyright in their own works  he repeated his arguments some months later so authors at least have reason for judging him charitably  mr carlyle would have admired lyttelton  his politics at one juncture were the dictatorship for lord chatham  how does this agree with the sentiments of junius  in 176769 junius had exhausted on chatham his considerable treasury of insult  he is a lunatic brandishing a crutch so black a villain an abandoned profligate and he exhibits the upstart insolence of a dictator this goes not well with lytteltons sentiments in 1774  true but by that date iii 305 junius himself had discovered that if this country can be saved it must be saved by lord chathams spirit by lord chathams abilities  lyttelton and junius are assuredly both of them ruffianly scandalloving inconsistent and patrician in the manner of catiline  so far the likeness is close  about america lyttelton wavered  on the whole he recognised the need of fighting and his main idea was that as fight we must we should organise our forces well and fight with our heads as well as with our hands  he disdained the policy of the ostrich  the americans were in active rebellion it could not be blinked  he praised chatham while he opposed him  he was fighting for his own hand  ministers felt the advantage of his aid they knew his unscrupulous versatility and in november 1775 bought lyttelton with a lucrative sinecurethe post of chief justice of eyre beyond the trent  coulton calls the place honourable we take another view lyttelton was bought and sold but no one deemed lyttelton a person of scrupulous conscience  the public prospects darkened folly was heaped on folly blunder on blunder defeat on defeat  on april 24 1779 horace walpole says that lord lyttelton has again turned against the court on obtaining the seals  november 25 1779 saw lyttelton go boldly into opposition  he reviewed the whole state of the empire  he poured out a torrent of invective  as to his sinecure he said perhaps he might not keep it long  the noble lords smile at what i say  is this a slip or misprint for on not obtaining the seals  they need not have smiled  he spoke on thursday november 25 on saturday november 27 the place in eyre was vacant and lord lyttelton was a dead man  the reader will keep in mind these dates  on thursday november 25 1779 the first day of the session lyttelton overflows in a volcanic speech against the court  he announces that his place may soon be vacant  at midnight on november 27 he is dead  on all this and on the story of the ghostly warning to lord lyttelton delivered in the night of wednesday november 24 coulton builds a political romance  in his view lyttelton expelled from parliament lavished his genius and exuded his spleen in the letters of junius  taking his seat in the lords he fights for his own hand is bought and muzzled wrenches off his muzzle blazes into a fierce attack on the wrongs which he is weary of witnessing the hypocrisy which he is tired of sharing makes his will sets his house in order plays one last practical joke by inventing the story of the ghostly warning surrounds himself with dissolute company and at midnight on november 27 deliberately fulfils his own prediction and dies by his own hand  it is a tale creditable to coultons fancy  a patrician of genius a wit a profligate in fatigue and despair closes his career with a fierce harangue a sacrilegious jest a debauch and a draught of poison leaving to dr johnson a proof of the spiritual world and to mankind the double mystery of junius and of the ghost  as to the identity of junius remembering the warning of lord beaconsfield if you wish to be a bore take up the letters of junius we shall drop that enigma but as to the alleged suicide of lord lyttelton we think we can make that seem extremely improbable  let us return to the course of events as stated by coulton and by contemporaries  the warning of death in three days says coulton occurred place not given on the night of november 24 1779  he observes  it is certain that on the morning after that very day november 25 lord lyttelton had related not to one person alone but to several and all of them people of credit the particulars of a strange vision which he said had appeared to him the preceding night  on thursday the 25th as we saw he spoke in the lords on friday the 26th he went down to his house at epsom pitt place where his party says coulton consisted of mr later lord fortescue captain later admiral wolsley mrs flood and the misses amphlett  now the town had no kind of doubt concerning the nature of lord lytteltons relations with two if not three of the misses amphlett  his character was nearly as bad where women were concerned as that of colonel charteris  but walpole writing to mann on november 28 the day after lord lytteltons death says lord lyttelton is dead suddenly  suddenly in this country is always at first construed to mean by a pistol    the story given out is that he looked ill and had said he should not live three days that however he had gone to his house at epsom    with a caravan of nymphs and on saturday night had retired before supper to take rhubarb returned supped heartily went into the next room again and died in an instant  nothing here of a dream or ghost  we only hear of a prophecy by lyttelton of his death  writing to mason on monday november 29 walpole avers that lord lyttelton was attended only by four virgins whom he had picked up in the strand  here horace though writing from berkeley square within two days of the fatal 27th is wrong  lord lyttelton had the misses amphlett captain wolsley mr fortescue and mrs flood with him  according to walpole he felt unwell on saturday night the 27th went to bed rung his bell in ten minutes and in one minute after the arrival of his servant expired  he had said on thursday that he should die in three days had dreamt so and felt that it would be so  on saturday he said if i outlive today i shall go on but enough of him  walpole speaks of a dream but he soon has other if not better information  writing to mason on december 11 he says that ghost stories from the north will now be welcome  lord lytteltons vision has revived the taste though it seems a little odd that an apparition should despair of getting access to his lordships bed in the shape of a young woman without being forced to use the disguise of a robinredbreast  what was an apprehension or prophecy has become a dream and the dream has become an apparition of a robinredbreast and a young woman  if this excite suspicion let us hasten to add that we have undesigned evidence to lord lytteltons belief that he had beheld an apparitionevidence a day earlier than the day of his death  mrs piozzi then mrs thrale in her diary of sunday november 28 writes  yesterday a lady from wales dropped in and said that she had been at drury lane on friday night  how i asked were you entertained  very strangely indeed  not with the play though but the discourse of a captain ascough who averred that a friend of his lord lyttelton has seen a spirit who has warned him that he will die in three days  i have thought of nothing else since  next day november 29 mrs piozzi heard of lord lytteltons death  notes and queries  series v vol ii p 508  december 261874  here is proof absolute that the story with apparition if not with robin was current the day before lord lytteltons decease  of what did lord lyttelton die  according to one of the papers says coulton vaguely the cause of death was disease of the heart  a brief convulsion is distinctly mentioned whence coulton concludes that the disease was not cardiac  on december 7 mason writes to walpole from york suppose lord lyttelton had recovered the breaking of his blood vessel  was a broken bloodvessel the cause of death or have we here as is probable a mere inference of masons  coultons account is meant to lead up to his theory of suicide lord lyttelton mentioned his apprehension of death somewhat ostentatiously we think  according to coulton at 10 pm  on saturday lord lyttelton looking at his watch said  should i live two hours longer i shall jockey the ghost  coulton thinks that it would have been more natural for him to await the fatal hour of midnight in gay company than to go to bed before twelve he finishes the tale thus  lord lyttelton was taking rhubarb in his bedroom he sent his valet for a spoon and the man returning found him on the point of dissolution  his family maintained a guarded and perhaps judicious silence on the subject yet lord westcote spoke of it to dr johnson and wrote an account of it and so did lord lytteltons widow while wraxall as we shall see says that the dowager lady lyttelton painted a picture of the warning in 1780  harping on suicide coulton quotes scotts statement in letters on demonology  of late it has been said and published that the unfortunate nobleman had determined to take poison  sir walter gives no authority and coulton admits that he knows of none gloomy but commonplace reflections in the socalled letters of lyttelton do not even raise a presumption in favour of suicide which in these very letters lyttelton says that he cannot defend by argument  that lyttelton made his will a few weeks before his death providing for his fair victims may be accounted for as we shall see by the threatening state of his health without any notion of selfdestruction  walpole in his three letters only speaks of a pistol as the common construction of sudden death and that remark occurs before he has heard any details  he rises from a mere statement of lord lytteltons that he is to die in three days to a dream containing that assurance and thence to apparitions of a young woman and a robinredbreast  the appearance of that bird by the way is in the folklore of surrey an omen of death  walpole was in a position to know all current gossip and so was mrs piozzi  coultons argument requires him to postulate the authenticity of many at least of these letters which were given to the world by the author of doctor syntax  we now turn to a narrative nearly contemporary that written out by lord westcote on february 13 1780  lord westcote examined the eldest miss amphlett captain later admiral charles wolsley mrs flood lord lytteltons valet faulkner and stuckey the servant in whose arms so to speak lord lyttelton died  stuckey was questioned note this in the presence of captain wolsley and of mr fortescue  the late lord lyttelton permitted the westcote narrative to be published in notes and queries november 21 1874  the story which so much pleased dr johnson runs thus  on thursday november 25 mrs flood and the three misses amphlett were residing at lord lytteltons house in hill street berkeley square  who is this mrs flood  frederick flood 17411824 married lady julia annesley in 1782  the wife of the more famous flood suits the case no better  his wife was lady f m flood she was a beresford  the dictionary of national biography is responsible for these facts  at all events on november 25 at breakfast in hill street lord lyttelton told the young ladies and their chaperon that he had had an extraordinary dream  he seemed to be in a room which a bird flew into the bird changed into a woman in white who told him he should die in three days  he did not much regard it because he could in some measure account for it for that a few days before he had been with mrs dawson when a robinredbreast flew into her room  on the morning of saturday he told the same ladies that he was very well and believed he should bilk the ghost  the dream has become an apparition  on that daysaturdayhe with the ladies fortescue and wolsley went to pitt place he went to bed after eleven ordered rolls for breakfast and in bed died without a groan as his servant was disengaging him from his waistcoat  during dinner he had a rising in his throat a slight sickness a thing which had often happened to him before  his physician dr fothergill vaguely attributed his death to the rupture of some vessel in his side where he had felt a pain in summer  from this version we may glean that lord lyttelton was not himself very certain whether his vision occurred when he was awake or asleep  he is made to speak of a dream and even to account for it in a probable way but later he talks of bilking the ghost the editor of notes and queries now tries to annihilate this contemporary document by thirdhand evidence seventy years after date  in 1851 or 1852 the late dowager lady lyttelton sarah daughter of the second earl spencer discussed the story with mr fortescue a son of the mr fortescue who was at pitt place and succeeded to the family title six years later in 1785  the elder mr fortescue in brief is said to have averred that he had heard nothing of the dream or prediction till some days after he therefore was inclined to disbelieve in it  we have demonstrated however that if mr fortescue had heard nothing yet the tale was all over the town before lord lyttelton died  nay more we have contemporary proof that mr fortescue had heard of the affair lyttelton died at midnight on the saturday november 27  in her diary for the following tuesday november 30 lady mary coke says that she has just heard the story of the dream from lady bute who had it from mr ross who had it from mr fortescue  mr fortescue then must have told the tale as early as the monday after the fatal saturday night  yet in old age he seems to have persuaded himself that the tale came later to his knowledge  some irrelevant late and fourthhand versions will be found in notes and queries but they merely illustrate the badness of such testimony  see the letters and journals of lady mary coke iii 85 noteshe speaks of a dream  one trifle of contemporary evidence may be added  mrs delany on december 9 1779 wrote an account of the affair to her niecehere a bird turns into a woman  in pursuit of evidence it is a long way from 1780 to 1816  in november of that year t j wrote from pitt place epsom in the gentlemans magazine but his letter is dated january 6  t j has bought pitt place and gives a copy of a document in writing left in the house where lyttelton died as an heirloom which may be depended on  this document begins lord lytteltons dream and death see admiral wolsleys account  but where is admiral wolsleys account  is it in the archives of sir charles wolseley of wolseley  or is this the pitt place document admiral wolsleys account  the anonymous author says that he was one of the party at pitt place on november 271779 with lord fortescue lady flood and the two misses amphlett consequently this account is written after 1785 when mr fortescue succeeded to his title  lord lyttelton not long returned from ireland had been suffering from suffocating fits in the last month  and this not the purpose of suicide was probably his reason for executing his will  while in his house in hill street berkeley square he dreamt three days before his death he saw a bird fluttering and afterwards a woman appeared in white apparel and said prepare to meet your death in three days  he was alarmed and called his servant  on the third day while at breakfast with the abovenamed persons he said i have jockeyed the ghost as this is the third day  coulton places this incident at 10 pm on saturday and makes his lordship say in two hours i shall jockey the ghost  the whole party set out for pitt place which contradicts coultons statement that they set out on friday but agrees with lord westcotes  they had not long arrived when he was seized with a usual fit  soon recovered  dined at five  to bed at eleven  then we hear how he rebuked his servant for stirring his rhubarb with a toothpick a plausible touch sent him for a spoon and was in a fit on the mans return  the pillow being high his chin bore hard on his neck  instead of relieving him the man ran for help  on his return found him dead  this undated and unsigned document by a person who professes to have been present is not perhaps very accurate in dates  the phrase dreamt is to be taken as the commonsense way of stating that lord lyttelton had a vision of some sort  his lordship who spoke of jockeying the ghost may have believed that he was awake at the time not dreaming but no person of selfrespect in these unpsychical days could admit more than a dream  perhaps this remark also applies to walpoles he dreamed  the species of the bird is left in the vague  moving further from the event to 1828 we find a book styled past feelings renovated a reply to dr hibberts philosophy of apparitions  the anonymous author is struck with the total inadequacy of dr hibberts theory  among his stories he quotes wraxalls memoirs  in 1783 wraxall dined at pitt place and visited the bedroom where the casement window at which lord lyttelton asserted the dove appeared to flutter was pointed out to me  now the pitt place document puts the vision in hill street berkeley square  so does lord westcote  even a bird cannot be in two places at once and the pitt place anonymous does seem to know what he is talking about  of course lord lyttelton may have been at pitt place on november 24 and had his dream there  he may have run up to hill street on the 25th and delivered his speech and may have returned to pitt place on the friday or saturday  but we have no evidence for this view and the pitt place document places the vision in hill street  wraxall adds that he has frequently seen a painting of bird ghost and lord lyttelton which was executed by that noblemans stepmother in 1780  it was done after the description given to her by the valet de chambre who attended him to whom his master related all the circumstances  it was a robin in 1779 coulton says friday the anonymous says saturday with lord westcote  our author of 1828 next produces the narrative by lord lytteltons widow mrs peach who was so soon deserted  in 1828 she is now alive and resident in the southwest part of warwickshire according to lady lyttelton who of course was not present lord lyttelton had gone to bed whether in hill street or pitt place we are not told  his candle was extinguished when he heard a noise resembling the fluttering of a bird at his chamber window  looking in the direction of the sound he saw the figure of an unhappy female whom he had seduced and deserted and who when deserted had put a violent end to her own existence standing in the aperture of the window from which the fluttering sound had proceeded  the form approached the foot of the bed  the room was preternaturally light the objects in the chamber were distinctly visible  the figure pointed to a clock and announced that lord lyttelton would expire at that very hour twelve oclock in the third day after the visitation  we greatly prefer as a good oldfashioned ghost story this version of lady lytteltons  there is no real bird only a fluttering sound as in the case of the cock lane ghost and many other examples  the room is preternaturally light as in greek and norse belief it should have been and as it is in the best modern ghost stories  moreover we have the raison detre of the ghost she had been a victim of the chief justice in eyre  the touch about the clock is in good taste  we did not know all that before  but alas our author of 1828 after quoting the pitt place anonymous proceeds to tell citing no named authority that the ghost was that of mrs amphlett mother of the two misses amphlett and of a third sister in no way less distinguished than these by his lordship  now a ghost cannot be the ghost of two different people  moreover mrs amphlett lived it is said for years after however mrs amphlett has the preference if she died of grief at the precise time when the female vision appeared to his lordship which makes it odd that her daughters should then have been revelling at pitt place under the chaperonage of mrs flood  we are also informed on no authority that lord lyttelton acknowledged the ghost to have been that of the injured mother of the three misses amphlett  let not the weary reader imagine that the catena of evidence ends here  his lordships own ghost did a separate stroke of business though only in the commonplace character of a deathbed wraith or veridical hallucination  lord lyttelton had a friend we learn from past feelings renovated 1828 a friend named miles peter andrews  one night after mr andrews had left pitt place and gone to dartford where he owned powdermills his bedcurtains were pulled open and lord lyttelton appeared before him in his robe de chambre and nightcap  mr andrews reproached him for coming to dartford mills in such a guise at such a time of night and turning to the other side of the bed rang the bell when lord lyttelton had disappeared  the house and garden were searched in vain and about four in the afternoon a friend arrived at dartford with tidings of his lordships death  here the reader with true common sense remarks that this second ghost lord lytteltons own does not appear in evidence till 1828 fifty years after date and then in an anonymous book on no authority  we have permitted to the reader this opportunity of exercising his acuteness while laying a little trap for him  it is not in 1828 that mr andrewss story first appears  we first find it in december 1779that is in the month following the alleged event  mr andrewss experience and the vision of lord lyttelton are both printed in the scots magazine december 1779 p 650 the account is headed a dream and yet the author avers that lord lyttelton was wide awake  this illustrates beautifully the fact on which we insist that dream is eighteenthcentury english for ghost vision hallucination or what you will  lord lyttelton says the contemporary scots magazine started up from a midnight sleep on perceiving a bird fluttering near the bedcurtains which vanished suddenly when a female spirit in white raiment presented herself and prophesied lord lytteltons death in three days  his death is attributed to convulsions while undressing  the dream of mr andrews according to the scots magazine of december 1779 occurred at dartford in kent on the night of november 27  it represented lord lyttelton drawing his bed curtains and saying it is all over or some such words  the magazine appeared at the end of december  this mr andrews had been a drysalter  he made a large fortune owned the powdermills at dartford sat in parliament wrote plays which had some success and was thought a good fellow in raffish society  indeed the society was not always raffish  in notes and queries december 26 1874 h s says that his mother daughter of sir george prescott often met mr andrews at their house theobalds park herts  he was extremely agreeable and if pressed would tell his little anecdote of november 27 1779  this proof that the andrews tale is contemporary has led us away from the description of the final scene given in past feelings renovated by the person who brought the news to mr andrews  his version includes a trick played with the watches and clocks  all were set on half an hour the valet secretly made the change in lord lytteltons own timepiece  his lordship thus went to bed as he thought at 1130 really at eleven oclock as in the pitt place document  at about twelve oclock midnight the valet rushed in among the guests who were discussing the odd circumstances and said that his master was at the point of death  lord lyttelton had kept looking at his watch and at a quarter past twelve by his chronometer and his valets he remarked this mysterious lady is not a true prophetess i find  the real hour was then a quarter to twelve  at about halfpast twelve by his watch twelve by the real time he asked for his physic  the valet went into the dressing room to prepare it to fetch a spoon by other versions when he heard his master breathing very hard  i ran to him and found him in the agonies of death  there is something rather plausible in this narrative corresponding as it does with the pitt place document in which the valet finding his master in a fit leaves him and seeks assistance instead of lowering his head that he might breathe more easily  like the other this tale makes suicide a most improbable explanation of lord lytteltons death  the affair of the watches is dramatic but not improbable in itself  a correspondent of the gentlemans magazine in 1815 only cites a london paper as his authority  the writer of past feelings renovated 1828 adds that mr andrews could never again be induced to sleep at pitt place but when visiting there always lay at the spread eagle in epsom  let us now tabulate our results  at pitt place epsom or hill street berkeley square on november 24 lord lyttelton dreamed of or saw a young woman and a robin a bird which became a woman a dove and a woman mrs amphlett without a dove or robin some one else unknown  in one variant a clock and a preternatural light are thrown in with a sermon which it were superfluous to quote  in another we have the derangement of clocks and watches  lord lytteltons stepmother believed in the dove  lady lyttelton did without a dove but admitted a fluttering sound  for causes of death we haveheart disease a newspaper breaking of a bloodvessel mason suicide coulton and a suffocating fit pitt place document  the balance is in favour of a suffocating fit and is against suicide  on the whole if we follow the pitt place anonymous writing some time after the event for he calls mr fortescue lord fortescue we may conclude that lord lyttelton had been ill for some time  the making of his will suggests a natural apprehension on his part rather than a purpose of suicide  there was a lively impression of coming death on his mind but how it was madewhether by a dream an hallucination or what notthere is no good evidence to show  there is every reason to believe on the pitt place evidence combined with the making of his will that lord lyttelton had really for some time suffered from alarming attacks of breathlessness due to what cause physicians may conjecture  any one of these fits probably might cause death if the obvious precaution of freeing the head and throat from encumbrances were neglected and the pitt place document asserts that the frightened valet did neglect it  again that persons under the strong conviction of approaching death will actually die is proved by many examples  even dr hibbert says that no reasonable doubt can be placed on the authenticity of the narrative of miss lees death as it was drawn up by the bishop of gloucester dr william nicholson from the recital of the young ladys father sir charles lee  every one knows the tale  in a preternatural light in a midnight chamber miss lee saw a woman who proclaimed herself miss lees dead mother and that by twelve oclock of the day she should be with her so miss lee died in her chair next day on the stroke of noon and dr hibbert rather heartlessly calls this a fortunate circumstance  the rev mr fison in kamilaroi and kurnai gives from his own experience similar tales of death following alleged ghostly warnings among fijians and australian blacks  lord lytteltons uneasiness and apprehension are conspicuous in all versions his dreams had long been troubled his health had caused him anxiety the warning whatever it may have been clinched the matter and he died a perfectly natural death  mr coulton omitting walpoles statement that he looked ill and never alluding to the pitt place description of his very alarming symptoms but clinging fondly to his theory of junius perorates thus  not dante or milton or shakespeare himself could have struck forth a finer conception than junius in the pride of rank wealth and dignities raised to the council table of the sovereign he had so foully slanderedyet sick at heart and deeply stained with every profligacyterminating his career by deliberate self murder with every accompaniment of audacious charlatanry that could conceal the crime  it is magnificent it is worthy of dante or shakespeare himself but the conception is mr coultons  we do not think that we have provided what dr johnson liked evidence for the spiritual world  nor have we any evidence explanatory of the precise nature of lord lytteltons hallucination the problem of the authorship of the junius letters is a malstrom into which we decline to be drawn  but it is fair to observe that all the discrepancies in the story of the warning are not more numerous nor more at variance with each other than remote hearsay reports of any ordinary occurrence are apt to be  and we think it is plain that if lord lyttelton was junius mr coulton had no right to allege that junius went and hanged himself or in any other way was guilty of selfmurder    vi  the mystery of amy robsart    1  historical confusions as to events before amys death  let him who would weep over the tribulations of the historical inquirer attend to the tale of the mystery of amy robsart  the student must dismiss from his memory all that he recollects of scotts kenilworth  sir walters chivalrous motto was no scandal about queen elizabeth tis blazoned on his titlepage  to avoid scandal he calmly cast his narrative at a date some fifteen years after amy robsarts death brought amy alive and represented queen elizabeth as ignorant of her very existence  he might had he chosen have proved to his readers that as regards amy robsart and her death elizabeth was in a position almost as equivocal as was mary stuart in regard to the murder of darnley  before the murder of darnley we do not hear one word to suggest that mary was in love with bothwell  for many months before the death of amy lady robert dudley we hear constant reports that elizabeth has a love affair with lord robert and that amy is to be divorced or murdered  when darnley is killed a mock investigation acquits bothwell and mary loads him with honours and rewards  when amy dies mysteriously a coroners inquest deep in the country is held and no records of its proceedings can be found  its verdict is unknown  after a brief tiff elizabeth restores lord robert to favour  after darnleys murder marys ambassador in france implores her to investigate the matter with all diligence  after amys death elizabeths ambassador in france implores her to investigate the matter with all diligence  neither lady listens to her loyal servant indeed mary could not have pursued the inquiry however innocent she might have been  elizabeth could  in three months after darnleys murder mary married bothwell  in two months after amys death cecil told apparently the spanish ambassador that elizabeth had married lord robert dudley  but this point we shall see is dubious  there the parallel ceases for in all probability lord robert was not art and part in amys death and whatever elizabeth may have done in private she certainly did not publicly espouse lord robert a scot as patriotic as but less chivalrous than sir walter might however have given us a romance of cumnor place in which mary would have been avenged on her sister and her foe  he abstained but wove a tale so full of conscious anachronisms that we must dismiss it from our minds  amy robsart was the only daughter of sir john robsart and his wife elizabeth nee scot and widow of roger appleyard a man of good old norfolk family  this roger appleyard dying on june 8 1528 left a son and heir john aged less than two years  his widow elizabeth had the life interest in his four manors and as we saw she married sir john robsart and by him became the mother of amy who had also a brother on the paternal side arthur robsart whether legitimately born or not  both these brothers play a part in the sequel of the mystery  lord robert dudley son of john duke of northumberland and grandson of the dudley who with empson was so unpopular under henry vii was about seventeen or eighteen when he married amy robsartherself perhaps a year olderon june 4 1550 at that time his father was earl of warwick the wedding is chronicled in the diary of the child king edward vi  mr walter rye in the murder of amy robsart norwich and london 1885 makes arthur a bastard  mr pettigrew in an inquiry into the particulars connected with the death of amy robsart london 1859 represents arthur as legitimate mr rye dates the marriage in 1550  rye pp 5 36 cf edward vis diary clarendon society  mr froude cites the date june 4 1549 from burnets collectanea froude vi p 422 note 2 1898 being misled by old style edward vi notes the close of 1549 on march 24  amy as the daughter of a rich knight was at least if we regard her brother arthur as a bastard a considerable heiress  robert dudley was a younger son  probably the match was a family arrangement but mr froude says it was a love match  his reason for this assertion seems to rest on a misunderstanding  in 156667 six years after amys death cecil drew up a list of the merits and demerits of dudley by that time earl of leicester and of the archduke charles as possible husbands of elizabeth  among other points is noted by cecil likelihood to love his wife  as to the archduke cecil takes a line through his father who hath been blessed with multitude of children  as to leicester cecil writes nuptiae carnales a laetitia incipiunt et in luctu terminantur weddings of passion begin in joy and end in grief  this is not a reference as mr froude thought to the marriage of amy and dudley it is merely a general maxim applicable to a marriage between elizabeth and leicester  the queen according to accounts from all quarters had a physical passion or caprice for leicester  the marriage if it occurred would be nuptiae carnales and as such in cecils view likely to end badly while the queen and the archduke the alternative suitor had never seen each other and could not be carnally affectionate  froude ut supra note 3  we do not know in short whether dudley and amy were in love with each other or not  their marriage cecil says was childless  concerning the married life of dudley and amy very little is known when he was a prisoner in the tower under mary tudor amy was allowed to visit him  she lost her father sir john in 1553  two undated letters of amys exist  one shows that she was trusted by her husband in the management of his affairs 155657 and that both he and she were anxious to act honourably by some poor persons to whom money was due  the other is to a womans tailor and though merely concerned with gowns and collars is written in a style of courteous friendliness  both letters in orthography and sentiment do credit to amys education and character  there is certainly nothing vague or morbid or indicative of an unbalanced mind in these poor epistles  pettigrew 14 note 1 jackson nineteenth century march 1882 a longleat ms  when elizabeth came to the throne 1558 she at once made dudley master of the horse a privy councillor and a knight of the garter his office necessarily caused him to be in constant attendance on the royal person and the knighthood of the garter proves that he stood in the highest degree of favour  for whatever reason whether from distaste for court life or because of the confessed jealousy with which the queen regarded the wives of her favouritesof all men indeedamy did not come to court  about 155859 she lived mainly at the country house of the hydes of detchworth not far from abingdon  dudley seems to have paid several visits to the hydes his connections this is proved by entries in his household books of sums of money for cardplaying there  it is also certain that amy at that date down to the end of 1559 travelled about freely to london and many other places that she had twelve horses at her service and that as late as march 1560 when resident with dudleys comptroller forster at cumnor place she was buying a velvet hat and shoes  in brief though she can have seen but little of her husband she was obviously at liberty lived till 1560 among honourable people her connections and in things material wanted for nothing  yet amy cannot but have been miserable by 1560  the extraordinary favour in which elizabeth held her lord caused the lewdest stories to spread among all classes from the circle of the court to the tattle of country folk in essex and devonshire  jackson ut supra for details see canon jacksons amy robsart nineteenth century vol xi  canon jackson used documents in the possession of the marquis of bath at longleat cal dom eliz p 157 august 13 1560 also hatfield calendar  news of this kind is certain to reach the persons concerned  our chief authority for the gossip about elizabeth and dudley is to be found in the despatches of the spanish ambassadors to their master philip of spain  the fortunes of western europe perhaps of the church herself hung on elizabeths marriage and on the succession to the english throne  the ambassadors whatever their other failings were undoubtedly loyal to philip and to the church and they were not men to be deceived by the gossip of every gobemouche  the command of money gave them good intelligence they were fair judges of evidence and what they told philip was what they regarded as well worthy of his attention  they certainly were not deceiving philip  the evidence of the spanish ambassadors as men concerned to find out the truth and to tell it is therefore of the highest importance  they are not writing mere amusing chroniques scandaleuses of the court to which they are accredited as ambassadors have often done and what they hear is sometimes so bad that they decline to put it on paper  they are serious and wary men of the world  unhappily their valuable despatches now in the castilian village of simancas reach english inquirers in the most mangled and garbled condition  major martin hume editor of the spanish calendar 1892 tells us in the introduction to the first volume of this official publication how the land lies  not to speak of the partial english translation 1865 of gonzaless partial summary of the despatches madrid 1832 we have the fruits of the labours of mr froude  he visited simancas consulted the original documents and had a large number of copies and extracts made these extracts and transcripts mr froude deposited in the british museum  these transcripts compared with the portions translated in mr froudes great book enable us to understand the causes of certain confusions in amy robsarts mystery  mr froude practically aimed at giving the gist as he conceived it of the original papers of the period which he rendered with freedom and in his captivating styleforeign to the perplexed prolixity of the actual writers  but in this process points of importance might be omitted and in certain cases words from letters of other dates appear to have been inserted by mr froude to clear up the situation  the result is not always satisfactory  next from 1886 onwards the spanish government published five volumes of the correspondence of philip with his ambassadors at the english court  these papers major hume was to condense and edit for our official publication the spanish state papers in the series of the master of the rolls  but major hume found the papers in the spanish official publication in a deplorably unedited state copyists and compositors seem to have had a free hand  major hume therefore compared the printed spanish texts where he could with mr froudes transcripts of the same documents in the museum and the most important letter in this dark affair in our spanish calendar follows incorrectly mr froudes transcript not the original document which is not printed in documentos ineditos thus major humes translation differs from mr froudes translation which again differs from mr gairdners translation of the original text as published by the baron kervyn de lettenhove  documentos ineditos para la historia de espana  ginesta madrid 1886 spanish calendar vol i p iv  mr gairdner says major hume in preparing his first volume he informs me took transcripts from simancas of all the direct english correspondence but for letters between england and flanders used mr froudes transcripts gairdner english historical review january 1898 note 1 relations politiques des paysbas et de lanqleterre sous le regne de philippe ii vol ii pp 529533 brussels 1883  the amateur of truth being now fully apprised of the hazards which add variety to the links of history turns to the spanish calendar for the reports of the ambassadors  he reaches april 18 1559 when de feria says  lord robert has come so much into favour that he does whatever he likes with affairs and it is even said that her majesty visits him in his chamber day and night  people talk of this so freely that they go so far as to say that his wife has a malady in one of her breasts and the queen is only waiting for her to die to marry lord robert  de feria therefore suggests that philip might come to terms with lord robert  again on april 29 1559 de feria writes according to the calendar  sometimes she elizabeth appears to want to marry him archduke ferdinand and speaks like a woman who will only accept a great prince and then they say she is in love with lord robert and never lets him leave her  de feria has reason to believe that she will never bear children  sp cal i pp 57 58 63 doc ineditos 87 171 180  mr froude combines these two passages in one quotation putting the second part of april 29 first thus  they tell me that she is enamoured of my lord robert dudley and will never let him leave her side  he offers me his services in behalf of the arch duke but i doubt whether it will be well to use them  he is in such favour that people say she visits him in his chamber day and night  nay it is even reported that his wife has a cancer on her breast and that the queen waits only till she die to marry him  froude vi p 199  de feria to philip april 28 and april 29 ms simancas cf documentos ineditos pp 87 171 180 ut supra  the sentence printed in capitals cannot be found by me in either of de ferias letters quoted by mr froude but the sense of it occurs in a letter written at another date  mr froude has placed in his quotation first a sentence of the letter of april 29 then a sentence not in either letter as far as the calendar and printed spanish documents show then sentences from the letter of april 18 he goes on to remark that the marriage of amy and dudley was a love match of a doubtful kind about which we have as has been shown no information whatever  such are the pitfalls which strew the path of inquiry  one thing is plain a year and a half before her death amy was regarded as a person who would be better dead and elizabeth was said to love dudley on whom she showered honours and gifts  de feria in the summer of 1559 was succeeded as ambassador by de quadra bishop of aquila  dudley and his sister lady sidney mother of sir philip sidney now seemed to favour spanish projects but november 13 de quadra writes  i heard from a certain person who is accustomed to give veracious news that lord robert has sent to poison his wife  certainly all the queen has done with us and with the swede and will do with the rest in the matter of her marriage is only keeping lord roberts enemies and the country engaged with words until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated  the enemies of dudley included the duke of norfolk and most of the nation  there was talk of a plot to destroy both dudley and the queen  the duke and the rest of them cannot put up with lord roberts being king  further and later on january 16 1560 amy being now probably at cumnor de quadra writes to de feria that baron preyner a german diplomatist will tell him what he knows of the poison for the wife of milort robert dudley an important story and necessary to be known  thus between november 1559 and january 1560 the talk is that amy shall be poisoned and this tale runs round the courts of europe  sp cal i pp 112114 relations politiques lettenhove ii p 187  mr froude gives what the calendar does not a letter of de quadra to de feria and the bishop of arras january 15 1560  in lord robert it is easy to recognise the king that is to be    there is not a man who does not cry out on him and her with indignation she will marry none but the favoured robert  on march 7 1560 de quadra tells de feria  not a man in this country but cries out that this fellow dudley is ruining the country with his vanity  is ruining the country and the queen is in the original spanish  froude vi p 311 relations politiques ii 87 183 184 sp cal i p 133  major hume translates the text of mr froudes transcript in the british museum  it is a mere fragment in 1883 the whole despatch was printed by baron kervyn de lettenhove  on march 28 calendar on march 27 froude de quadra wrote to philipcalendari have understood lord robert told somebody who has not kept silence that if he live another year he will be in a very different position from now  he is laying in a good stock of arms and is assuming every day a more masterful part in affairs they say that he thinks of divorcing his wife  so the calendar mr froude condenses his spanish author thus  lord robert says that if he lives a year he will be in another position from that which he at present holds  every day he presumes more and more and it is now said that he means to divorce his wife  from the evidence of the spanish ambassadors it is clear that an insurance office would only have accepted amy robsarts life however excellent her health at a very high premium  her situation was much like that of darnley in the winter of 156667 when every one in scotland who had the smallest judgment knew that he could not long continue that his doom was dight  sp cal i p 141 froude vi p 340  meanwhile through the winter spring and early summer of 1560 diplomatists and politicians were more concerned about the war of the congregation against mary of guise in scotland with the english alliance with the scottish protestant rebels with the siege of leith and with cecils negotiations resulting in the treaty of edinburgh than even with elizabeths marriage and her dalliance with dudley  all this time amy was living at cumnor place about three miles from oxford  precisely at what date she took up her abode there is not certain probably about the time when de quadra heard that lord robert had sent to poison his wife the november of 1559  others say in march 1560  the house was rented from a dr owen by anthony forster  this gentleman was of an old and good family well known since the time of edward i his wife also ann williams daughter of reginald williams of burghfield berks was a lady of excellent social position  forster himself had estates in several counties and obtained many grants of land after amys death  he died in 1572 leaving a very equitable distribution of his properties cumnor he bought from dr owen soon after the death of amy  in his bequests he did not forget the master fellows and scholars of balliol  there is nothing suspicious about forster who was treasurer or comptroller of leicesters household expenses  in writing leicester signs himself your loving master  at cumnor place also lived mrs owen wife of dr owen the owner of the house and physician to the queen  there was too a mrs oddingsell of respectable family one of the hydes of denchworth that any or all of these persons should be concerned in abetting or shielding a murder seems in the highest degree improbable  cumnor place was in no respect like kirk o field as regards the character of its inhabitants  it was however a lonely house and on the day of amys death her own servants apparently by her own desire were absent  and amy like darnley was found dead on a sunday night no man to this day knowing the actual cause of death in either case  pettigrew pp 1922  here it may be well to consider the version of the tragedy as printed twentyfour years after the event by the deadly enemies of lord robert now earl of leicester  this is the version which many years later aided by local tradition was used in ashmoles account in his history and antiquities of berkshire while sir walter employed ashmoles account as the basis of his romance  we find the printed copy of the book usually known as leicesters commonwealth dated 1584 but probably it had been earlier circulated in manuscript copies of which several exist  it purports to be a letter written by a ma of cambridge to a friend in london containing some talk passed of late about leicester  doubtless it does represent the talk against leicester that had been passing at home and abroad ever since 1560  such talk after twenty years could not be accurate  the point of the writer is that leicester is lucky in the deaths of inconvenient people  thus when he was in full hope to marry the queen he did but send his wife aside to the house of his servant forster of cumnor by oxford where shortly after she had the chance to fall from a pair of stairs and so to break her neck but yet without hurting of her hood that stood upon her head  except for the hood of which we know nothing all this is correct  in the next sentence we read  but sir richard verney who by commandment remained with her that day alone with one man only and had sent away perforce all her servants from her to a market two miles off he i say with his man can tell how she died  the man was privily killed in prison where he lay for another offence because he offered to publish the fact and verney about the same time died in london after raving about devils to a gentleman of worship of mine acquaintance  the wife also of bald buttler kinsman to my lord gave out the whole fact a little before her death  pettigrew pp 9 10  verney and the man are never mentioned in contemporary papers two mrs buttelars were mourners at amys funeral  verney is obscure  canon jackson argues that he was of the warwickshire verneys mr rye holds that he was of the bucks and herts verneys connections of the dudleys  but finding a richard verney made sheriff of warwick and leicester in 1562 mr rye absurdly says the former county being that in which the murder was committed he was placed in the position to suppress any unpleasant rumours amy died of course in berkshire not in warwickshire  a richard verney not the warwickshire sir richard according to mr rye on july 30 1572 became marshal of the marshalsea when john appleyard amys halfbrother was turned out  this verney died before november 15 1575  rye p 55  of appleyard we shall hear plenty  leicester had favoured him he was leicesters brotherinlaw and he turned against his patron on the matter of amys death  probably the richard verney who died in 1575 was the verney aimed at in leicesters commonwealth he was a kind of retainer of dudley otherwise he would not have been selected by the author of the libel  but we know nothing to prove that he was at cumnor on september 8 1560  the most remarkable point in the libel avers that leicesters first idea was to poison amy  this had been asserted by de quadra as early as november 1559  the libel avers that the conspirators seeing the good lady sad and heavy asked dr bayly of oxford for a potion which they would fetch from oxford upon his prescription meaning to have added also somewhat of their own for her comfort  bayly was a fellow of new college in 1558 was one of the proctors in 1561 was queens professor of physic and was a highly reputable man  he died in 1592  thus bayly if he chose could have contradicted the printed libel of 1584 which avers that he refused to prescribe for amy misdoubting as he after reported lest if they poisoned her under the name of his potion he might after have been hanged for a cover of their sin  pettigrew p 17 citing woods ath ox i p 586 bliss  nothing was more natural and innocent than that bayly should be asked to prescribe if amy was ill  nothing could be more audacious than to print this tale about him while he lived to contradict it but it seems far from improbable that bayly did for the reasons given refuse to prescribe for amy seeing as the libel says the small need which the good lady had of physic  for this very refusal by bayly would account for the information given by cecil to de quadra on the day of amys death  and it is not easy to explain the source of cecils information in any other way  we now reach the crucial point at which historical blunders and confusions have been most maddeningly prevalent  mr pettigrew writing in 1859 had no knowledge of cecils corroboration of the story of the libelamy in no need of physic and the intention to poison her  mr froude however published in his history a somewhat erroneous version of de quadras letter about cecils revelations and mr rye 1885 accused dudley on the basis of mr froudes version  froude vi pp 417421  mr froude then presents a letter from de quadra of september 11 1560 to the duchess of parma governing the netherlands from brussels this being the nearest point from which he could receive instructions  the despatches were then forwarded to philip  he dates de quadras letter at the top london september 1l  the real date is at the foot of the last page windsor september 11 omitting the first portion of the letter except the first sentence which says that fresh and important events have occurred since the writers last letter mr froude makes de quadra write  on the third of this month september 1560 the queen spoke to me about her marriage with the arch duke  she said she had made up her mind to marry and that the arch duke was to be the man  she has just now told me drily that she does not intend to marry and that it cannot be  when we ask is just now  mr froude goes on  after my conversation with the queen i met the secretary cecil whom i knew to be in disgrace  lord robert i was aware was endeavouring to deprive him of his place  briefly cecil said to de quadra that he thought of retiring that ruin was coming on the queen through her intimacy with lord robert  the lord robert had made himself master of the business of the state and of the person of the queen to the extreme injury of the realm with the intention of marrying her and she herself was shutting herself up in the palace to the peril of her health and life  cecil begged de quadra to remonstrate with the queen  after speaking of her finances cecil went on in mr froudes version  last of all he said they were thinking of destroying lord roberts wife  they had given out that she was ill but she was not ill at all she was very well and was taking care not to be poisoned      the capitals are mine  this is the very state of things reported in leicesters commonwealth  cecil may easily have known the circumstances if as stated in that libel bayly had been consulted had found amy in no need of physic and had refused to prescribe  bayly would blab and cecil had spies everywhere to carry the report  the extent and precision of his secret service are well known  cecil added some pious remarks  god would not permit the crime  mr froude goes on the day after this conversation the queen on her return from hunting told me that lord roberts wife was dead or nearly so and begged me to say nothing about it  after some political speculations the letter in froude ends since this was written the death of lord roberts wife has been given out publicly  the queen said in italian que si ha rotto il collo that she has broken her neck  it appears that she fell down a staircase  mr froude after disposing of the ideas that de quadra lied or that cecil spoke in mere practice or diplomatic trickery remarks certain it is that on september 8 at the time or within a day of the time when cecil told the spanish ambassador that there was a plot to kill her anne dudley anne or amy was found dead at the foot of a staircase  this must be true for the queen told de quadra privately on the day after cecil unbosomed himself  the fatal news we know reached windsor on september 9 we do not know at what hour  the queen told de quadra probably on september 9  if the news arrived late and dudleys first letter on the subject is in the evening of september 9 elizabeth may have told de quadra on the morning of september 10  the inferences were drawn by myself and others that elizabeth had told de quadra on september 3 the third of this month as mr froude by a slip of the pen translates a tres del passado that she would marry the arch duke that cecil spoke to de quadra on the same day and that the day after this conversation september 4 the queen told de quadra that amy was dead or nearly so  the presumption would be that the queen spoke of amys death four days before it occurred and a very awkward position in that case would be the queens  guilty foreknowledge would be attributed to her this is like the real situation if dr ernst bekker is right  dr bekker knowing from the portion of de quadras letter omitted by mr froude that he reached the court at windsor on september 6 1560 supposes that he had interviews with elizabeth and cecil on that day and that elizabeth prematurely announced to him amys death next day on september 7  but mr gairdner has proved that this scheme of dates is highly improbable  elizabeth and leicester giesener studien auf dem gebiet der geschichte v p48  giesen 1890  in the english historical review mr gairdner examining the question used mr froudes transcripts in the british museum and made some slight corrections in his translation but omitted to note the crucial error of the third of this month  for the third of last month  this was in 1886  mr gairdners arguments as to dates were unconvincing in this his first article  but in 1892 the letter of de quadra was retranslated from mr froudes transcript in the spanish calendar i pp 174176  the translation was again erroneous the queen had promised me an answer about the spanish marriage by the third instant september 3 but now she coolly tells me she cannot make up her mind and will not marry  this is all unlike mr froudes on the third of this month the queen spoke to me about her marriage with the arch duke  she said that she had made up her mind to marry and that the arch duke was to be the man there is in fact in mr froudes copy of the original spanish not a word about the arch duke nor is there in baron lettenhoves text the remark has crept in from an earlier letter of de quadra of august 4 1560  but neither is there anything about promising an answer by the third instant as in the calendar and there is nothing at all about the third instant or as in mr froude the third of this month  no 2 april 1886 pp 235259 spanish calendar i pp 171174  the queens character has thus suffered and the whole controversy has been embroiled  in 1883 three years before the appearance of mr gairdners article of 1886 nine years before the calendar appeared the correct version of de quadras letter of september 11 1560 had been published by baron kervyn de lettenhove in his relations politiques des paysbas et de langleterre sous le regne de philippe ii vol ii pp 529 533  in 1897 mr gairdners attention was called to the state of affairs by the article already cited of dr ernst bekker  mr gairdner then translated the belgian printed copy of de quadras letter with comments  english historical review january 1898 pp 8390  matters now became clear  mr froudes transcript and translation had omitted all the first long paragraph of the letter which proved that de quadra went to windsor to the court on september 6  next the passage about the third of this month really runs i showed her much dissatisfaction about her marriage in on which on the third of last month august she had told me she was already resolved and that she assuredly meant to marry  now she has coolly told me that she cannot make up her mind and that she does not intend to marry  mr  gairdners translation 1898  so the blot on the queens scutcheon as to her foreknowledge and too previous announcement of amys death disappears  but how did mr gairdner in 1886 using mr froudes transcript of the original spanish fail to see that it contained no arch duke and no third of the month mr froudes transcript of the original spanish but not his translation thereof was correct  as to verney appleyard and foster see pages commencing here it may be well to consider cecil in april 1566 names foster and appleyard but not verney among the particular friends whom leicester if he marries the queen will study to enhanss to welth to offices and lands  bartlett cumnor place p 73 london 1850   2  amys death and what followed   so far the case against dudley or servants of dudley has looked very black  there are the scandals too dark for ambassadors to write but mouthed aloud among the common people about dudley and the queen  there is de quadras talk of a purpose to poison amy in novemberjanuary 15591560  there is the explicit statement of cecil as to the intended poisoning probably derived from dr bayly and as to dudleys possession of the queens person the result of his own observation  there is the coincidence of amys violent death with cecils words to de quadra september 8 or 9 1560  but here the case takes a new turn  documents appear letters from and to dudley at the time of the event which are totally inconsistent with guilt on his part  these documents in the pepys mss at cambridge are copies of letters between dudley and thomas blount a gentleman of good family whom he addresses as cousin blount long after in may 1567 was examined on the affair before the privy council and mr froude very plausibly suggests that blount produced the copies in the course of the inquiry  but why copies  we can only say that the originals may also have been shown and the copies made for the convenience of the members of the council  it is really incredible that the letters were forged after date to prove dudleys innocence  in the usual blundering way mr pettigrew dates one letter of dudleys september 27  if that date were right it would suggest that two coroners inquests were held one after amys burial on september 22 but mr gairdner says that the real date of the letter is september 12  so the date is given by bartlett in his history of cumnor place and by adlard 1870 following bartlett and craik 1848  english historical review no 2 p 243 note  the first letter from dudley at windsor this 9th day of september in the evening proves that blount early on september 9 the day after amys death went from leicester at windsor towards berkshire  he had not long gone when bowes a retainer of leicester of forster or of amy brought to dudley the fatal news by him i do understand that my wife is dead and as he saith by a fall from a pair of stairs  little other understanding can i have from him  throughout the correspondence leicester does not utter one word of sorrow for amy as had the letters been written for exhibition he would almost certainly have done  the fear of his own danger and disgrace alone inspires him and he takes every measure to secure a full free and minute examination  have no respect to any living person  a coroners jury is to be called the body is to be examined appleyard and others of amys kin have already been sent for to go to cumnor  from cumnor blount replied on september 11  he only knew that my lady is dead and as it seemeth with a fall but yet how or which way i cannot learn  not even at cumnor could blount discover the manner of the accident  on the night of the ninth he had lain at abingdon the landlord of the inn could tell him no more than dudley already knew  amys servants had been at the fair at abingdon she herself was said to have insisted on their going thither very early in the day among them bowes went as he told blount who met him on the road as he rode to see dudley  he said that amy was very angry with any who stayed and with mrs oddingsell who refused to go  pinto probably amys maid who doth love her dearly confirmed bowes  she believed the death to be a very accident  she had heard amy divers times pray to god to deliver her from desperation but entirely disbelieved in suicide which no one would attempt perhaps by falling down two flights of stairs  before blount arrived at cumnor on september 10 the coroners jury had been chosen sensible men but some of them hostile to forster by september 12 not 27 dudley had retired from court and was at kew but had received blounts letter  he bade blount tell the jury to inquire faithfully and find an honest verdict  on the thirteenth blount again wrote from cumnor meaning to join dudley next day  i i have almost nothing that can make me so much as to think that any man can be the doer of it   the circumstances and the many things which i can learn doth persuade me that only misfortune hath done it and nothing else  there is another letter by dudley from windsor without date  he has had a reassuring letter from smythe foreman of the jury  he wishes them to examine as long as they lawfully may and that a fresh jury should try the case again  he wishes sir richard blount to help  appleyard and arthur robsart have been present  he means to have no more dealings with the jury his only dealings seem to have been his repeated requests that they would be diligent and honest  i am right glad they be all strangers to me  pettigrew pp 2832  these letters are wholly inconsistent with guilt in the faintest degree on the side of dudley  but people were not satisfied there is a letter to cecil of september 17 from lever a minister at coventry saying that the country was full of mutterings and dangerous suspicions and that there must be earnest searching and trying of the truth  burghley papers haynes 362  suspicion was inevitable but what could a jury do more than according to blount the jury had done  yet there is dense obscurity as to the finding of the jury  we have seen that appleyard amys halfbrother was at cumnor during the inquest yet in 1567 he did not know or pretended not to know what the verdict had been  leicesters commonwealth says she was found murdered as all men said by the crowners inquest as if the verdict was not published but was a mere matter of rumouras all men said  appleyards behaviour need not detain us long as he was such a shuffling knave that his statements on either side were just what he found expedient in varying circumstances  dudley after amys death obtained for him various profitable billets in 1564 he was made keeper of the marshalsea had a commission under the great seal to seize concealed prizes at sea without legal proceedings had the portership of berwick and the sheriffship of norfolk and suffolk while leicester stood guarantor of a debt of his for 400 pounds  these facts he admitted before the privy council in 1567  but leicester might naturally do what he could for his dead wifes brother  we cannot argue that the jobs done for appleyard were hushmoney enormous as these jobs were  yet in this light appleyard chose to consider them  he seems to have thought that leicester did not treat him well enough and wanted to get rid of him in ireland or france and he began about 156667 to blab of what he could say an he would  he let fall words of anger and said that for dudleys sake he had covered the murder of his sister  rye pp 6062 hatfield mss calendar i 345352 may 1567  mr froude has here misconceived the situation as mr gairdner shows  mr froudes words are being examined by cecil he admitted the investigation at cumnor had after all been inadequately conducted  in fact appleyard admitted that he had said this and much more in private talk among his associates  before the council he subsequently withdrew what he admitted having said in private talk  it does not signify what he said or what he withdrew but mr froude unluckily did not observe a document which proved that appleyard finally ate his words and he concludes that although dudley was innocent of a direct association with the crime the unhappy lady was sacrificed to his ambition  dudley himself   used private means notwithstanding his affectation of sincerity to prevent the search from being pressed inconveniently farthat is if appleyard spoke the truth  but appleyard denied that he had spoken the truth a fact overlooked by mr froude  froude vi p 430 ibid vi pp 430 431  the truth stood thus  in 156667 there was or had been some idea that leicester might after all marry the queen  appleyard told thomas blount that he was being offered large sums by great persons to reopen the cumnor affair  blount was examined by the council and gave to leicester a written account of what he told them  one huggon appleyards brother had informed leicester that courtiers were practising on appleyard to search the manner of his sisters death  leicester sent blount to examine appleyard as to who the courtiers were  appleyard was evasive but at last told blount a long tale of mysterious attempts to seduce him into stirring up the old story  he promised to meet leicester but did not  his brother huggon named norfolk sussex and others as the practisers  later by leicesters command blount brought appleyard to him at greenwich  what speeches passed blount did not know but leicester was very angry and bade appleyard begone with great words of defiance  it is clear that with or without grounds appleyard was trying to blackmail leicester  before the council may 1567 appleyard confessed that he had said to people that he had often moved the earl to let him pursue the murderers of amy showing certain circumstances which led him to think surely that she was murdered  he had said that leicester on the other hand cited the verdict of the jury but he himself declared that the jury in fact had not as yet given up their verdict  after these confessions appleyard lay in the fleet prison destitute and scarce able to buy a meal  on may 30 1567 he wrote an abject letter to the council  he had been offered every opportunity of accusing those whom he suspected and he asked for a copy of the verdict presented by the jury whereby i may see what the jury have found after which he would take counsels advice he got a copy of the verdict  would that we had the copy and naturally as he was starving professed himself amply satisfied by proofs testified under the oaths of fifteen persons that amys death was accidental  i have not money left to find me two meals in such a posture appleyard would of course say anything to get himself out of prison  two days later he confessed that for three years he had been in fact trying to blackmail leicester on several counts amys murder and two political charges  see the full reports gairdner english historical review april 1886 249259 and hatfield calendar for the date may 1567  the man was a rogue however we take him and the sole tangible fact is that a report of the evidence given at the inquest did exist and that the verdict may have been accidental death  we do not know but that an open verdict was given  appleyard professes to have been convinced by the evidence not by the verdict  when leicesters apology appeared 158485 sir philip sidney leicesters nephew wrote a reply  it was easy for him to answer the libellers she was found murdered as all men suppose by the crowners inquestby producing the actual verdict of the jury  he did not he merely vapoured and challenged the libeller to the duel  appleyards statement among his intimates that no verdict had yet been given seems to point to an open verdict  sidneys reply is given in adlards amye robsart and the earl of leicester  london 1870  the subject is alluded to by elizabeth herself who puts the final touch of darkness on the mystery  just as archbishop beaton marys ambassador in paris vainly adjured her to pursue the inquiry into darnleys murder being urged by the talk in france so throgmorton elizabeths ambassador to the french court was heartbroken by what he heard  clearly no satisfactory verdict ever reached him  he finally sent jones his secretary with a verbal message to elizabeth  jones boldly put the question of the cumnor affair  she said that the matter had been tried in the country and found to the contrary of that was reported  what was reported  clearly that leicester and retainers of his had been the murderers of amy  for the queen went on lord robert was in the court and none of his at the attempt at his wifes house  so verney was not there  so jones wrote to throgmorton on november 30 1560  we shall return to throgmorton  hardwicke papers i 165  if jones correctly reported elizabeths words there had been an attempt at cumnor place of which we hear nothing from any other source  how black is the obscurity through which blount at cumnor two days after amys death could discernnothing  a fall yet how or which way i cannot learn  by september 17 nine days after the death lever at coventry an easy days ride from cumnor knew nothing as we saw of a verdict or at least of a satisfactory verdict  it is true that the earl of huntingdon at leicester only heard of amys death on september 17 nine days after date  given an attempt amy might perhaps break her neck down a spiral staircase when running away in terror  a cord stretched across the top step would have done all that was needed  nineteenth century vol ii p 431  huntingdon to leicester longleat mss  i repose on canon jacksons date of the manuscript letter  we next find confusion worse confounded by our previous deliverer from error baron kervyn lettenhove  what happened at court immediately after amys death  the baron says  a fragment of a despatch of de la quadra of the same period reports dudley to have said that his marriage had been celebrated in presence of his brother and of two of the queens ladies  for this according to the baron mr froude cites a letter of the bishop of aquila de quadra of september 11  mr froude does nothing of the sort  he does cite an abstract of de quadras letters ms simancas without any date at all  the design of cecil and of those heretics to convey the kingdom to the earl of huntingdon is most certain for at last cecil has yielded to lord robert who he says has married the queen in presence of his brother and two ladies of her bedchamber  so mr gairdner translates from mr froudes transcript and he gives the date november 20 which mr froude does not give  major hume translates who they say was married  o history  according to baron kervyn de lettenhove dudley says he has married the queen according to mr gairdner cecil says so according to major hume they say so  relations politiques des paysbas etc xlii note 4 span cal i p 178 the spanish of this perplexing sentence is given by froude vi p 433 note 1  cecil se ha rendido a milord roberto el qual dice que se hay casado con la reyna     the point is of crucial importance to mrs gallup and the believers in the cipher wherein bacon maintains that he is the legal son of a wedding between dudley and the queen  was there such a marriage or even betrothal  froude cautiously says that this was averted seemingly on lord roberts authority the baron says that lord robert makes the assertion mr gairdner says that cecil is the authority and major hume declares that it is a mere onditwho they say  it is heartbreaking  for mr gairdner english historical review no 2 p 246  to deepen the darkness and distress the official printed spanish documentos ineditos do not give this abstract of november 20 at all major hume translates it in full from mr froudes transcript  again mr froude inserts his undated quotation really of november 20 before he comes to tell of amy robsarts funeral september 22 1560 and the baron as we saw implies that mr froude dates it september 11 the day on which the queen publicly announced amys death  we now have an undated letter endorsed by cecil sept 1560 wherein dudley not at court and in tribulation implores cecils advice and aid  i am sorry so sudden a chance should breed me so great a change  he may have written from kew where elizabeth had given him a house and where he was on september 12 not 27  on october 13 froude or 14 documentos ineditos 88 p 310 or 15 spanish calendar i p 176for dates are strange thingsde quadra wrote a letter of which there is only an abstract at simancas  this abstract we quote  the contents of the letter of bishop quadra to his majesty written on the 15th though headed the 14th of october and received on the 16th of november 1560  it relates the way in which the wife of lord robert came to her death the respect reverencia paid him immediately by the members of the council and others and the dissimulation of the queen  that he had heard that they were engaged in an affair of great importance for the confirmation of their heresies and wished to make the earl of huntingdon king should the queen die without children and that cecil had told him that the heritage was his as a descendant of the house of york     that cecil had told him that the queen was resolved not to marry lord robert as he had learned from herself it seemed that the arch duke might be proposed  in midoctober then elizabeth was apparently disinclined to wed the so recently widowed lord robert though shortly after amys death the privy council began to court dudley as future king  mr froude writesstill before he comes to september 22the bishop of aquila reported that there were anxious meetings of the council the courtiers paid a partial homage to dudley  this appears to be a refraction from the abstract of the letter of october 13 or 14  he relates the manner in which the wife of lord robert came to her death the respect reverencia paid to him immediately by members of the council and others  froude vi p 432  next we come in mr froude to amys funeral september 22 and to elizabeths resolve not to marry leicester october 13 14 15 and to throgmortons interference in octobernovember throgmortons wails over the queens danger and dishonour were addressed to cecil and the marquis of northampton from poissy on october 10 when he also condoled with dudley on the death of his wife  thanks him for his present of a nag  on the same date october 10 harry killigrew from london wrote to answer throgmortons inquiries about amys death  certainly throgmorton had heard of amys death before october 10  he might have heard by september 16  what he heard comforted him not  by october 10 he should have had news of a satisfactory verdict  but killigrew merely said she brake her neck    only by the hand of god to my knowledge  on october 17 killigrew writes to throgmorton rumours    have been very rife but the queen says she will make them false     leaves to his judgment what he will not write has therefore sent by jones and summers verbally what account he wished him to make of my lord r dudley  for cal eliz 1560 pp 347349 ibid 1560 p 350  then october 28 throgmorton tells cecil plainly that till he knows what cecil thinks he sees no reason to advise the queen in the matter of marrying dudley  begs him to signify plainly what has been done and implores him in the bowels of christ    to hinder that matter  he writes with tears and sighs andhe declines to return cecils letters on the subject  they be as safe in my hands as in your own and more safe in mine than in any messengers  for cal eliz 1560 p 376  on october 29 throgmorton sets forth his troubles to chamberlain chamberlain as a wise man can conceive how much it imports the queens honour and her realm to have the same reports as to amys death ceased  he is withal brought to be weary of his life  for cal eliz 1560 p 376  on november 7 throgmorton writes to the marquis of northampton and to lord pembroke about the bruits lately risen from england   set so full with great horror and never disproved despite throgmortons prayers for satisfaction  finally throgmorton as we saw had the boldness to send his secretary jones direct to elizabeth  all the comfort he got from her was her statement that neither dudley nor his retainers were at the attempt at cumnor place  francis i died in france people had something fresh to talk about and the cumnor scandal dropped out of notice  throgmorton however persevered till in january 1561 cecil plainly told him to cease to meddle  throgmorton endorsed the letter a warning not to be too busy about the matters between the queen and lord robert  for cal eliz 1560 p 498  it is not necessary perhaps to pursue further the attempts of dudley to marry the queen  on january 22 he sent to de quadra his brotherinlaw sir henry father of sir philip sidney offering to help to restore the church if philip ii would back the marriage sidney professed to believe after full inquiry that amy died by accident  but he admitted that no one believed it that the preachers harped on it in a manner prejudicial to the honour and service of the queen which had caused her to move for the remedy of the disorders of this kingdom in religion and so on  de quadra and the preachers had no belief in amys death by accident  nobody had except dudleys relations  a year after amys death on september 13 1561 de quadra wrote  the earl of arundel and others are drawing up copies of the testimony given in the inquiry respecting the death of lord roberts wife  robert is now doing his best to repair matters as to a quarrel with arundel it seems as it appears that more is being discovered in that matter than he wished  people were not so easily satisfied with the evidence as was the imprisoned and starving appleyard  documentos ineditos 88 p 314 span cal i p 179 froude vi p 453  the translations vary  i give my own  the spanish has misprints span cal i p 213 documentos ineditos 88 p 367  so the mystery stands  the letters of blount and dudley september 912 1560 entirely clear dudleys character and can only be got rid of on the wild theory that they were composed later to that very end  but the precise nature of the cumnor jurys verdict is unknown and elizabeths words about the attempt at her house prove that something concealed from us did occur  it might be a mere halfsportive attempt by rustics to enter a house known to be at the moment untenanted by the servants and may have caused to amy an alarm so that rushing downstairs in terror she fell and broke her neck  the coincidence of her death with the words of cecil would thus be purely fortuitous and coincidences as extraordinary have occurred  or a partisan of dudleys finding poison difficult or impossible may have in his zeal murdered amy under the disguise of an accident  the theory of suicide would be plausible if it were conceivable that a person would commit suicide by throwing herself downstairs  we can have no certainty but at least we show how elizabeth came to be erroneously accused of reporting amys death before it occurred  for a wild italian legend of amys murder written in 1577 see the hatfield calendar ii 165170    vii  the voices of jeanne darc    some of our old english historians write of jeanne darc the pucelle as the puzel  the author of the first part of henry vi whether he was shakespeare or not has a pun on the word            pucelle or puzzel dolphin or dogfish  the word puzzel carrying an unsavoury sense  act i scene 4  a puzzle in the usual meaning of the word the maid was to the dramatist  i shall not enter into the dispute as to whether shakespeare was the author or part author of this perplexed drama but certainly the role of the pucelle is either by two different hands or the one author was in two minds about the heroine  now she appears as la ribaulde of glasdales taunt which made her weep as the bold strumpet of talbots insult in the play  the author adopts or even exaggerates the falsehoods of angloburgundian legend  the personal purity of jeanne was not denied by her judges on the other hand the dramatist makes his bold strumpet a paladin of courage and a perfect patriot reconciling burgundy to the national cause by a moving speech on the great pity that was in france  how could a ribaulde a leaguerlass a witch a sacrificer of blood to devils display the valour the absolute selfsacrifice the eloquent and tender love of native land attributed to the pucelle of the play  are there two authors and is shakespeare one of them with his understanding of the human heart  or is there one puzzled author producing an impossible and contradictory character  the dramatist has a curious knowledge of minute points in jeannes career  he knows and mocks at the sword with five crosses which she found apparently by clairvoyance at fierbois but his history is distorted and dislocated almost beyond recognition  jeanne proclaims herself to the dauphin as the daughter of a shepherd and as a pure maid  later she disclaims both her father and her maidenhood  she avers that she was first inspired by a vision of the virgin which she never did in fact and she is haunted by fiends who represent her st michael st catherine and st margaret  after the relief of orleans the dauphin exclaims           no longer on saint denis will we cry           but joan la pucelle shall be frances saint  a prophecy which may yet be accomplished  already accomplished is dalencons promise           well set thy statue in some holy place  to the duke of burgundy the pucelle of the play speaks as the maid might have spoken           look on thy country look on fertile france           and see the cities and the towns defaced           by wasting ruin of the cruel foe           as looks the mother on her lowly babe           when death doth close his tender dying eyes           see see the pining malady of france           behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds           which thou thyself hast given her woful breast           o turn thy edged sword another way           strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help           one drop of blood drawn from thy countrys bosom           should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore           return thee therefore with a flood of tears           and wash away thy countrys stained spots  patriotism could find no better words and how can the dramatist represent the speaker as a strumpet inspired by fiends  to her fiends when they desert her the pucelle of the play cries           cannot my body nor blood sacrifice           entreat you to your wonted furtherance           then take my soul my body soul and all           before that england give the french the foil  she is willing to give body and soul for france and this in the eyes of the dramatist appears to be her crime  for a french girl to bear a french heart is to stamp her as the tool of devils  it is an odd theology and not in the spirit of shakespeare  indeed the pucelle while disowning her father and her maidenhood again speaks to the english as jeanne might have spoken           i never had to do with wicked spirits           but you that are polluted with your lusts           stained with the guiltless blood of innocents           corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices           because you want the grace that others have           you judge it straight a thing impossible           to compass wonders but by help of devils           no misconceivd  joan of arc hath been           a virgin from her tender infancy           chaste and immaculate in very thought           whose maiden blood thus rigorously effusd           will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven  the vengeance was not long delayed  the french and my countrymen writes patrick abercromby drove the english from province to province and from town to town of france while on england fell the wars of the roses  but how can the dramatist make the dealer with fiends speak as the maid in effect did speak at her trial he adds the most ribald of insults the pucelle exclaiming           it was alencon that enjoyed my love  the author of the play thus speaks with two voices  in one jeanne acts and talks as she might have done had she been given to oratory in the other she is the termagant of angloburgundian legend or myth  much of this perplexity still haunts the histories of the maid  her courage purity patriotism and clearsighted military and political commonsense the marvellous wisdom of her replies to her judgesas of her own st catherine before the fifty philosophers of her legendare universally acknowledged  this girl of seventeen in fact alone of the french folk understood the political and military situation  to restore the confidence of france it was necessary that the dauphin should penetrate the english lines to rheims and there be crowned  she broke the lines she led him to rheims and crowned him  england was besieging his last hold in the north and centre orleans on a military policy of pure bluff the city was at no time really invested  the besieging force as english official documents prove was utterly inadequate to its task except so far as prestige and confidence gave power  jeanne simply destroyed and reversed the prestige and after a brilliant campaign on the loire opened the way to rheims  the next step was to take paris and paris she certainly would have taken but the long delays of politicians enabled beaufort to secure peace with scotland under james i and to throw into paris the english troops collected for a crusade against the hussites  the maid unsupported if not actually betrayed failed and was wounded before paris and prestige returned for a while to the english party  she won minor victories was taken at compiegne may 1430 and a year later crowned her career by martyrdom  but she had turned the tide and within the six years of her prophecy paris returned to the national cause  the english lost in losing paris a greater gage than orleans  the scottish immobility was secured in mayjune 1429 the months of the maids loire campaign  exchequer rolls iv ciii 466  bain calendar iv 212 foedera x 42817041717  so much is universally acknowledged but how did the maid accomplish her marvels  brave as she certainly was wise as she certainly was beautiful as she is said to have been she would neither have risked her unparalleled adventure nor been followed but for her strange visions and voices  she left her village and began her mission as she said in contradiction to the strong commonsense of her normal character  she resisted for long the advice that came to her in the apparent shape of audible external voices and external visions of saint and angel  by a statement of actual facts which she could not possibly have learned in any normal way she overcame it is said the resistance of the governor of vaucouleurs and obtained an escort to convey her to the king at chinon  she conquered the doubts of the dauphin by a similar display of supernormal knowledge  she satisfied at poictiers the divines of the national party after a prolonged examination of which the record the book of poictiers has disappeared  in these ways she inspired the confidence which in the real feebleness of the invading army was all that was needed to ensure the relief of orleans while as dunois attested she shook the confidence which was the strength of england  about these facts the historical evidence is as good as for any other events of the war  refer to paragraph commencing the journal du siege dorleans infra  the essence then of the marvels wrought by jeanne darc lay in what she called her voices the mysterious monitions to her audible and associated with visions of the heavenly speakers brave pure wise and probably beautiful as she was the king of france would not have trusted a peasant lass and men disheartened by frequent disaster would not have followed her but for her voices  the science or theology of the age had three possible ways of explaining these experiences  1  the maid actually was inspired by michael margaret and catherine  from them she learned secrets of the future of words unspoken save in the kings private prayer and of events distant in space like the defeat of the french and scots at rouvray which she announced on the day of the occurrence to baudricourt hundreds of leagues away at vaucouleurs  2  the monitions came from fiends  this was the view of the prosecutors in general at her trial and of the author of henry vi part i  3  one of her judges beaupere was a man of some courage and consistency  he maintained at the trial of rouen and at the trial of rehabilitation 14521456 that the voices were mere illusions of a girl who fasted much  in her fasts she would construe natural sounds as of church bells or perhaps of the wind among woods into audible words as red indian seers do to this day  this third solution must and does neglect or explain by chance occurrence or deny the coincidences between facts not normally knowable and the monitions of the voices accepted as genuine though inexplicable by m quicherat the great palaeographer and historian of jeanne  he by no means held a brief for the church father ayroles continually quarrels with quicherat as a freethinker  he certainly was a free thinker in the sense that he was the first historian who did not accept the theory of direct inspiration by saints still less by fiends and yet took liberty to admit that the maid possessed knowledge not normally acquired other freethinking sympathisers with the heroine have shuffled have skated adroitly past and round the facts as father ayroles amusingly demonstrates in his many passages of arms with michelet simeon luce henri martin fabre and his other opponents  m quicherat merely says that if we are not to accept the marvels as genuine we must abandon the whole of the rest of the evidence as to jeanne darc and there he leaves the matter  quicherats five volumes of documents the proces is now accessible as far as records of the two trials go in the english version edited by mr douglas murray  can we not carry the question further  has the psychological research of the last halfcentury added nothing to our means of dealing with the problem  negatively at least something is gained  science no longer avers with m lelut in his book on the daemon of socrates that every one who has experience of hallucinations of impressions of the senses not produced by objective causes is mad  it is admitted that sane and healthy persons may have hallucinations of lights of voices of visual appearances  the researches of mr galton of m richet of brierre du boismont of mr gurney and an army of other psychologists have secured this position  maniacs have hallucinations especially of voices but all who have hallucinations are not maniacs  jeanne darc so subject to airy tongues was beyond all doubt a girl of extraordinary physical strength and endurance of the highest natural lucidity and common sense and of health which neither wounds nor fatigue nor cruel treatment could seriously impair  wounded again and again she continued to animate the troops by her voice and was in arms undaunted next day  her leap of sixty feet from the battlements of beaurevoir stunned but did not long incapacitate her  hunger bonds and the protracted weariness of months of crossexamination produced an illness but left her intellect as keen her courage as unabated her humour as vivacious her memory as minutely accurate as ever  there never was a more sane and healthy human being  we never hear that in the moments of her strange experiences she was entranced or even dissociated from the actual occurrences of the hour  she heard her voices though not distinctly in the uproar of the brawling court which tried her at rouen she saw her visions in the imminent deadly breach when she rallied her men to victory  in this alertness she is a contrast to a modern seeress subject like her to monitions of an hallucinatory kind but subject during intervals of somnambulisme  to her case which has been carefully humorously and sceptically studied we shall return  meantime let us take voices and visions on the lowest most prevalent and least startling level  a large proportion of people including the writer are familiar with the momentary visions beheld with shut eyes between waking and sleeping illusions hypnagogiques  the waking self is alert enough to contemplate these processions of figures and faces these landscapes too which in my own case it is incapable of purposefully calling up  thus in a form of experience which is almost as common as ordinary dreaming we see that the semisomnolent self possesses a faculty not always given to the waking self  compared with my own waking self for instance my halfasleep self is almost a personality of genius  he can create visions that the waking self can remember but cannot originate and cannot trace to any memory of waking impressions  these apparently trivial things thus point to the existence of almost wholly submerged potentialities in a mind so everyday commonplace and so to speak superficial as mine  this fact suggests that people who own such minds the vast majority of mankind ought not to make themselves the measure of the potentialities of minds of a rarer class say that of jeanne darc the secret of natures like hers cannot be discovered so long as scientific men incapable even of ordinary visualising as mr galton found make themselves the canon or measure of human nature  let us for the sake of argument suppose that some sane persons are capable of hallucinatory impressions akin to but less transient than illusions hypnagogiques when as far as they or others can perceive they are wide awake  of such sane persons goethe and herschel were examples  in this way we can most easily envisage or make thinkable by ourselves the nature of the experiences of jeanne darc and other seers  in the other state of semisomnolence while still alert enough to watch and reason on the phenomena we occasionally though less commonly hear what may be called inner voices  that is to say we do not suppose that any one from without is speaking to us but we hear as it were a voice within us making some remark usually disjointed enough and not suggested by any traceable train of thought of which we are conscious at the time  this experience partly enables us to understand the cases of sane persons who when to all appearance wide awake occasionally hear voices which appear to be objective and caused by actual vibrations of the atmosphere i am acquainted with at least four persons all of them healthy and normal enough who have had such experiences  in all four cases the apparent voice though the listeners have no superstitious belief on the subject has communicated intelligence which proved to be correct  but in only one instance i think was the information thus communicated beyond the reach of conjecture based perhaps on some observation unconsciously made or so little attended to when made that it could not be recalled by the ordinary memory  we are to suppose then that in such cases the person concerned being to all appearance fully awake his or her mind has presented a thought not as a thought but in the shape of words that seemed to be externally audible  one hearer in fact at the moment wondered that the apparent speaker indicated by the voice and words should be shouting so loud in an hotel  the apparent speaker was actually not in the hotel but at a considerable distance well out of earshot and though in a nervous crisis was not shouting at all  we know that between sleeping and waking our minds can present to us a thought in the apparent form of articulate words internally audible  the hearers when fully awake of words that seem to be externally audible probably do but carry the semivigilant experience to a higher degree as do the beholders of visual hallucinations when wide awake  in this way at least we can most nearly attain to understanding their experiences  to a relatively small proportion of people in wakeful existence experiences occur with distinctness which to a large proportion of persons occur but indistinctly            on the margin grey            twixt the souls night and day  let us put it then that jeanne darcs was an advanced case of the mental and bodily constitution exemplified by the relatively small proportion of people the sane seers of visual hallucinations and hearers of unreal voices  her thoughtslet us say the thoughts of the deepest region of her beingpresented themselves in visual forms taking the shapes of favourite saintsfamiliar to her in works of sacred artattended by an hallucinatory brightness of light a photism and apparently uttering words of advice which was in conflict with jeannes great natural shrewdness and strong sense of duty to her parents  she must go into france and for two or three years she pleaded her ignorance and incompetence  she declined to go  she could resist her voices  in prison at beaurevoir they forbade her to leap from the tower  but her natural impatience and hopefulness prevailed and she leaped  i would rather trust my soul to god than my body to the english this she confessed to as sinful though not she hoped of the nature of deadly sin  her inmost and her superficial nature were in conflict  it is now desirable to give as briefly as possible jeannes own account of the nature of her experiences as recorded in the book of her trial at rouen with other secondhand accounts offered on oath at her trial of rehabilitation by witnesses to whom she had spoken on the subject  she was always reticent on the theme  the period when jeanne supposed herself to see her first visions was physiologically critical  she was either between thirteen and fourteen or between twelve and thirteen  m simeon luce in his jeanne darc a domremy held that she was of the more advanced age and his date 1425 fitted in with some public events which in his opinion were probably the occasions of the experiences pere ayroles prefers the earlier period 1424 when the aforesaid public events had not yet occurred  after examining the evidence on both sides i am disposed to think or rather i am certain that pere ayroles is in the right  in either case jeanne was at a critical age when as i understand female children are occasionally subject to illusions  speaking then as a non scientific student i submit that on the side of ordinary causes for the visions and voices we have  1  the period in jeannes life when they began  2  her habits of fasting and prayer  3  her intense patriotic enthusiasm which may for all that we know have been her mood before the voices announced to her the mission  let us then examine the evidence as to the origin and nature of the alleged phenomena  i shall begin with the letter of the senechal de berry perceval de boulainvilliers to the duke of milan  the date is june 21st 1429 six weeks after the relief of orleans  after a few such tales as that the cocks crowed when jeanne was born and that her flock was lucky he dates her first vision peractis aetatis suae duodecim annis after she was twelve  briefly the tale is that in a rustic race for flowers one of the other children cried joanna video te volantem juxta terrain joan i see you flying near the ground  this is the one solitary hint of levitation so common in hagiology and witchcraft which occurs in the career of the maid this kind of story is so persistent that i knew it must have been told in connection with the irvingite movement in scotland  and it was  there is perhaps just one trace that flying was believed to be an accomplishment of jeannes  when frere richard came to her at troyes he made she says the sign of the cross  she answered approchez hardiment je ne menvouleray pas  now the contemporary st colette was not infrequently levitated  proces v 115 proces i 100  to return to the voices  after her race jeanne was quasi rapta et a sensibus alienata dissociated then juxta eam affuit juvenis quidam a youth stood by her who bade her go home for her mother needed her  thinking that it was her brother or a neighbour apparently she only heard the voice and did not see the speaker she hurried home and found that she had not been sent for  next as she was on the point of returning to her friends a very bright cloud appeared to her and out of the cloud came a voice bidding her take up her mission  she was merely puzzled but the experiences were often renewed  this letter being contemporary represents current belief based either on jeannes own statements before the clergy at poictiers april 1429 or on the gossip of domremy  it should be observed that till jeanne told her own tale at rouen 1431 we hear not one word about saints or angels  she merely spoke of my voices my counsel my master  if she was more explicit at poictiers her confessions did not find their way into surviving letters and journals not even into the journal of the hostile bourgeois de paris  we may glance at examples  the journal du siege dorleans is in parts a late document in parts evidently copied from a journal kept in presence of the actual events  the journal in february 1429 vaguely says that about this time our lord used to appear to a maid as she was guarding her flock or cousant et filant  a st victor ms has courant et saillant running and jumping which curiously agrees with boulainvilliers  the journal after telling of the battle of the herrings february 12th 1429 in which the scots and french were cut up in an attack on an english convoy declares that jeanne knew of it by grace divine and that her vue a distance induced baudricourt to send her to the dauphin  this was attested by baudricourts letters  quicherat in proces iv 95 proces iv 125 proces iv 125  all this may have been written as late as 1468 but a vague reference to an apparition of our lord rather suggests contemporary hearsay before jeanne came to orleans  jeanne never claimed any such visions of our lord  the story of the clairvoyance as to the battle of the herrings is also given in the chronique de la pucelle  m quicherat thinks that the passage is amplified from the journal du siege  on the other hand m vallet de viriville attributes with assurance the chronique de la pucelle to cousinot de montreuil who was the dauphins secretary at poictiers when the maid was examined there in april 1429  if cousinot was the author he certainly did not write his chronicle till long after date  however he avers that the story of clairvoyance was current in the spring of 1429  the dates exactly harmonise that is to say between the day of the battle february 12th and the setting forth of the maid from vaucouleurs there is just time for the bad news from rouvray to arrive confirming her statement and for a day or two of preparation  but perhaps after the arrival of the bad news baudricourt may have sent jeanne to the king in a kind of despair things could not be worse  if she could do no good she could do no harm  proces iv 206 histoire de charles vii ii 62  the documents whether contemporary or written later by contemporaries contain none of the references to visions of st margaret st catherine and st michael which we find in jeannes own replies at rouen  for this omission it is not easy to account even if we suppose that except when giving evidence on oath the maid was extremely reticent  that she was reticent we shall prove from evidence of daulon and dunois  turning to the maids own evidence in court 1431 we must remember that she was most averse to speaking at all that she often asked leave to wait for advice and permission from her voices before replying that on one point she constantly declared that if compelled to speak she would not speak the truth  this point was the kings secret  there is absolutely contemporary evidence from alain chartier that before she was accepted she told charles something which filled him with surprise joy and belief  the secret was connected with charless doubts of his own legitimacy and jeanne at her trial was driven to obscure the truth in a mist of allegory as indeed she confessed jeannes extreme reluctance to adopt even this loyal and laudable evasion is the measure of her truthfulness in general  still she did say some words which as they stand it is difficult to believe to explain or to account for  from any other prisoner so unjustly menaced with a doom so dreadful from mary stuart for example at fotheringay we do not expect the whole truth and nothing but the truth  the maid is a witness of another kind and where we cannot understand her we must say like herself passez outre  proces v 131 letter of july 1429  see supra the false pucelle  when she was about thirteen this is her own account she had a voice from god to aid her in governing herself  and the first time she was in great fear  and it came that voice about noonday in summer in her fathers garden where other girls of old france hear the birds sing marry maidens marry and jeanne had not fasted on the day before  she heard the voice from the right side towards the church and seldom heard it without seeing a bright light  the light was not in front but at the side whence the voice came  if she were in a wood as distinguished from the noise of the crowded and tumultuous court she could well hear the voices coming to her  asked what sign for her souls health the voice gave she said it bade her behave well and go to church and used to tell her to go into france on her mission  i do not know why the advice about going to church is generally said to have been given first  jeanne kept objecting that she was a poor girl who could not ride or lead in war  she resisted the voice with all her energy  she asserted that she knew the dauphin on their first meeting by aid of her voices  she declared that the dauphin himself multas habuit revelationes et apparitiones pulchras  in its literal sense there is no evidence for this but rather the reverse  she may mean revelations through herself or may refer to some circumstance unknown  those of my party saw and knew that voice she said but later would only accept them as witnesses if they were allowed to come and see her  the reading is nec not et as in quicherat proces i 52 compare i 216 proces i 56 proces i 57  this is the most puzzling point in jeannes confession  she had no motive for telling an untruth unless she hoped that these remarks would establish the objectivity of her visions  of course one of her strange experiences may have occurred in the presence of charles and his court and she may have believed that they shared in it the point is one which french writers appear to avoid as a rule  she said that she heard the voice daily in prison and stood in sore need of it  the voice bade her remain at st denis after the repulse from paris in september 1429 but she was not allowed to remain  on the next day the third of the trial she told beaupere that she was fasting since yesterday afternoon  beaupere as we saw conceived that her experiences were mere subjective hallucinations caused by fasting by the sound of churchbells and so on  as to the noise of bells coleridge writes that their music fell on his ears most like articulate sounds of things to come  beauperes sober commonsense did not avail to help the maid but at the rehabilitation 1456 he still maintained his old opinion yesterday she had heard the voices in the morning at vespers and at the late ringing for ave maria and she heard them much more frequently than she mentioned  yesterday she had been asleep when the voice aroused her  she sat up and clasped her hands and the voice bade her answer boldly  other words she half heard before she was quite awake but failed to understand  proces i 62  she denied that the voices ever contradicted themselves  on this occasion as not having received leave from her voices she refused to say anything as to her visions  at the next meeting she admitted having heard the voices in court but in court she could not distinguish the words owing to the tumult  she had now however leave to speak more fully  the voices were those of st catherine and st margaret  later she was asked if st margaret spoke english  apparently the querist thought that the english margaret wife of malcolm of scotland was intended  they were crowned with fair crowns as she had said at poictiers two years before  she now appealed to the record of her examination there but it was not in court nor was it used in the trial of rehabilitation  it has never been recovered  a witness who had examined her at poictiers threw no light twenty years later on the saints and voices  seven years ago that is when she was twelve she first saw the saints  on the attire of the saints she had not leave to speak  they were preceded by st michael with the angels of heaven  i saw them as clearly as i see you and i used to weep when they departed and would fain that they should have taken me with them  as to the famous sword at fierbois she averred that she had been in the church there on her way to chinon that the voices later bade her use a sword which was hidden under earthshe thinks behind but possibly in front of the altarat fierbois  a man unknown to her was sent from tours to fetch the sword which after search was found and she wore it  asked whether she had prophesied her wound by an arrow at orleans and her recovery she said yes  this prediction is singular in that it was recorded before the event  the record was copied into the registre of brabant from a letter written on april 22nd 1429 by a flemish diplomatist de rotselaer then at lyons  de rotselaer had the prophecy from an officer of the court of the dauphin  the prediction was thus noted on april 22nd the event the arrowwound in the shoulder occurred on may 7th  on the fifth day of the trial jeanne announced that before seven years were gone the english shall lose a dearer gage than orleans this i know by revelation and am wroth that it is to be so long deferred  mr myers observes that the prediction of a great victory over the english within seven years was not fulfilled in any exact way  the words of the maid are angli demittent majus vadium quam fecerunt coram aurelianis and as prophecies go their loss of paris 1436 corresponds very well to the maids announcement  she went on indeed to say that the english will have greater loss than ever they had through a great french victory but this reads like a gloss on her original prediction she knew it as well as that we were there  you shall not have the exact year but well i wish it might be before the st john however she had already expressed her sorrow that this was not to be  asked on march 1st whether her liberation was promised she said ask me in three months and i will tell you  in three months exactly her stainless soul was free  proces iv 425 proces i 84  on the appearance garb and so on of her saints she declined to answer questions  she had once disobeyed her voices when they forbade her to leap from the tower of beaurevoir  she leaped but they forgave her and told her that compiegne where she was captured on may 23rd 1430 would be relieved before martinmas  it was relieved on october 26th after a siege of five months  on march 10th an effort was made to prove that her voices had lied to her and that she had lied about her voices  the enemy maintained that on may 23rd 1430 she announced a promised victory to the people of compiegne vowing that st margaret and st catherine had revealed it to her  two hostile priests of compiegne were at rouen and may have carried this tale which is reported by two burgundian chroniclers but not by monstrelet who was with the besieging army  in court she said neust autre commandement de yssir  she had no command from her voices to make her fatal sally  she was not asked whether she had pretended to have received such an order  she told the touching story of how at melun in april 1430 the voices had warned her that she would be taken prisoner before midsummer how she had prayed for death or for tidings as to the day and hour  but no tidings were given to her and her old belief often expressed that she should last but one year or little more was confirmed  the duc dalencon had heard her say this several times for the prophecy at melun we have only her own word  i have examined the evidence in macmillans magazine for may 1894 and to myself it seems inadequate  she was now led into the allegory intended to veil the kings secret the allegory about the angel herself and the crown the coronation at rheims  this allegory was fatal but does not bear on her real belief about her experiences  she averred returning to genuine confessions that her voices often came spontaneously if they did not she summoned them by a simple prayer to god  she had seen the angelic figures moving invisible save to her among men the voices had promised her the release of charles dorleans but time had failed her  this was as near a confession of failure as she ever made till the day of her burning if she really made one then  but here as always she had predicted that she would do this or that if she were sans empeschement  she had no revelation bidding her attack paris when she did and after the day at melun she submitted to the advice of the other captains  as to her release she was only bidden to bear all cheerfully be not vexed with thy martyrdom thence shalt thou come at last into the kingdom of paradise  as to her abjuration and alleged doubts see labjuration du cimetiere saintouen by abbe ph h dunard poussielgue paris 1901  to us this is explicit enough but the poor child explained to her judges that by martire she understood the pains of prison and she referred it to her lord whether there were more to bear  in this passage the original french exists as well as the latin translation  the french is better  ne te chaille de ton martire tu ten vendras enfin en royaulme de paradis  non cures de martyrio tuo  tu venies finaliter in regnum paradisi  the word hinc is omitted in the bad latin  unluckily we have only a fragment of the original french as taken down in court  the latin version by courcelles one of the prosecutors is in places inaccurate in others is actually garbled to the disadvantage of the maid  this passage with some others may perhaps be regarded as indicating that the contents of the communications received by jeanne were not always intelligible to her  that her saints could be and were touched physically by her she admitted  here i am inclined to think that she had touched with her ring as the custom was a relic of st catherine at fierbois such relics brought from the monastery of sinai lay at fierbois and we know that women loved to rub their rings on the ring of jeanne in spite of her laughing remonstrances  but apart from this conjecture she regarded her saints as tangible by her  she had embraced both st margaret and st catherine  proces i 185 proces i 186  for the rest jeanne recanted her socalled recantation averring that she was unaware of the contents or full significance of the document which certainly is not the very brief writing to which she set her mark  her voices recalled her to her duty for them she went to the stake and if there was a moment of wavering on the day of her doom her belief in the objective reality of the phenomena remained firm and she recovered her faith in the agony of her death  of external evidence as to her accounts of these experiences the best is probably that of daulon the maitre dhotel of the maid and her companion through her career  he and she were reposing in the same room at orleans her hostess being in the chamber may 1429 and daulon had just fallen asleep when the maid awoke him with a cry  her voices bade her go against the english but in what direction she knew not  in fact the french leaders had begun without her knowledge an attack on st loup whither she galloped and took the fort  it is of course conceivable that the din of onset which presently became audible had vaguely reached the senses of the sleeping maid  her page confirms daulons testimony  proces iii 212  daulon states that when the maid had any martial adventure in prospect she told him that her counsel had given her this or that advice  he questioned her as to the nature of this counsel  she said she had three councillors of whom one was always with her a second went and came to her and the third was he with whom the others deliberated  daulon was not worthy to see this counsel from the moment when he heard this daulon asked no more questions dunois also gave some evidence as to the counsel  at loches when jeanne was urging the journey to rheims harcourt asked her before the king what the nature modus of the council was how it communicated with her  she replied that when she was met with incredulity she went apart and prayed to god  then she heard a voice say fille de va va va je serai a ton aide va  and when she heard that voice she was right glad and would fain be ever in that state  as she spoke thus ipsa miro modo exsultabat levando suos oculos ad coelum  she seemed wondrous glad raising her eyes to heaven  finally that jeanne maintained her belief to the moment of her death we learn from the priest martin ladvenu who was with her to the last  there is no sign anywhere that at the moment of an experience the maids aspect seemed that of one dissociated or uncanny or abnormal in the eyes of those who were in her company  proces iii 12 proces iii 170  these depositions were given twenty years later 145256 and of course allowance must be made for weakness of memory and desire to glorify the maid  but there is really nothing of a suspicious character about them  in fact the growth of legend was very slight and is mainly confined to the events of the martyrdom the white dove the name of christ blazoned in flame and so forth  it should also have been mentioned that at the taking of st pierre de moustier november 1429 jeanne when deserted by her forces declared to daulon that she was not alone but surrounded by fifty thousand of her own  the men therefore rallied and stormed the place  this is the sum of the external evidence as to the phenomena  for german fables see lefevrepontalis les sources allemandes paris 1903  they are scanty and in some cases are distortions of real events  as to the contents of the communications to jeanne they were certainly sane judicious and heroic  m quicherat apercus nouveaux p 61 distinguishes three classes of abnormally conveyed knowledge all on unimpeachable evidence  1 thoughtreading as in the case of the kings secret she repeated to him the words of a prayer which he had made mentally in his oratory  2 clairvoyance as exhibited in the affair of the sword of fierbois  3 prescience as in the prophecy of her arrowwound at orleans according to her confessor pasquerel she repeated the prophecy and indicated the spot in which she would be wounded under the right shoulder on the night of may 6  but this is later evidence given in the trial of rehabilitation  neither pasquerel nor any other of the maids party was heard at the trial of 1431  to these we might add the view from vaucouleurs a hundred leagues away of the defeat at rouvray the prophecy that she would last but a year or little more the prophecy at melun of her capture the prophecy of the relief of compiegne and the strange affair of the bon conduit at the battle of pathay  for several of these predictions we have only the maids word but to be plain we can scarcely have more unimpeachable testimony  proces iv 371 372  here the authority is monstrelet a burgundian  here the compiler leaves his task  the inferences may be drawn by experts  the old theory of imposture the voltairean theory of a poor idiot the vague charge of hysteria are untenable  the honesty and the genius of jeanne are no longer denied  if hysteria be named it is plain that we must argue that because hysteria is accompanied by visionary symptoms all visions are proofs of hysteria  michelet holds by hallucinations which were unconsciously externalised by the mind of jeanne  that mind must have been a very peculiar intellect and the modus is precisely the difficulty henri martin believes in some kind of manifestation revealed to the individual mind by the absolute  perhaps this word is here equivalent to the subliminal self of mr myers  many catholics as yet unauthorised i conceive by the church accept the theory of jeanne herself her saints were true saints from paradise  on the other hand it is manifest that visions of a bright light and auditions of voices are common enough phenomena in madness and in the experiences of very uninspired sane men and women  from the sensations of these people jeannes phenomena are only differentiated by their number by their persistence through seven years of an almost abnormally healthy life by their importance orderliness and veracity as well as by their heroic character  mr myers has justly compared the case of jeanne with that of socrates  a much humbler parallel curiously close in one respect may be cited from m janets article les actes inconscients dans le somnambulisme revue philosophique march 1888  the case is that of madame b a peasant woman near cherbourg  she has her common workaday personality called for convenience leonie  there is also her hypnotic personality leontine  now leontine that is madame b in a somnambulistic state was one day hysterical and troublesome  suddenly she exclaimed in terror that she heard a voice on the left crying enough be quiet you are a nuisance  she hunted in vain for the speaker who of course was inaudible to m janet though he was present  this sagacious speaker a faculty of madame bs own nature is brought out by repeated passes and when this moral and sensible phase of her character is thus evoked madame b is leonore  madame b now sometimes assumes an expression of beatitude smiling and looking upwards  as dunois said of jeanne when she was recalling her visions miro modo exsultabat levando suos oculos ad coelum this ecstasy madame b as leonie dimly remembers averring that she has been dazzled by a light on the left side  here apparently we have the best aspect of poor madame b revealing itself in a mixture of hysterics and hypnotism and associating itself with an audible sagacious voice and a dazzling light on the left both hallucinatory  the coincidence not observed by m janet with jeannes earliest experience is most curious  audivit vocem a dextero latere    claritas est ab eodem latere in quo vox auditur sed ibi communiter est magna claritas  she heard a voice from the right  there is usually a bright light on the same side as the voice  like madame b jeanne was at first alarmed by these sensations  the parallel so far is perfectly complete except that leonore merely talks common sense while jeannes voices gave information not normally acquired  but in jeannes case i have found no hint of temporary unconsciousness or dissociation when strung up to the most intense mental eagerness in court she still heard her voices though because of the tumult of the assembly she heard them indistinctly  thus her experiences are not associated with insanity partial unconsciousness or any physical disturbance as in some tales of second sight while the sagacity of the communications and their veracity distinguish them from the hallucinations of mad people  as far as the affair of rouvray the prophecy of the instant death of an insolent soldier at chinon evidence of pasquerel her confessor and such things go we have of course many alleged parallels in the predictions of mr peden and other seers of the covenant  but mr pedens political predictions are still unfulfilled whereas concerning the dear gage which the english should lose in france within seven years jeanne may be called successful  on the whole if we explain jeannes experiences as the expressions of her higher self as leonore is madame bs higher self we are compelled to ask what is the nature of that self  another parallel on a low level to what may be called the mechanism of jeannes voices and visions is found in professor flournoys patient helene smith  miss smith a hardworking shopwoman in geneva had as a child been dull but dreamy  at about twelve years of age she began to see and hear a visionary being named leopold who in life had been cagliostro  his appearance was probably suggested by an illustration in the joseph balsamo of alexandre dumas  the saints of jeanne in the same way may have been suggested by works of sacred art in statues and church windows  to miss smith leopold played the part of jeannes saints he appeared and warned her not to take such or such a street when walking not to try to lift a parcel which seemed light but was very heavy and in other ways displayed knowledge not present to her ordinary workaday self  see flournoy des indes a la planete mars  alcan paris 1900  there was no real leopold and jeannes st catherine cannot be shown to have ever been a real historical personage  these figures in fact are more or less akin to the invisible playmates familiar to many children  they are not objective personalities but part of the mechanism of a certain class of mind  the mind may be that of a person devoid of genius like miss smith or of a genius like goethe shelley or jeanne darc or socrates with his daemon and its warnings  in the case of jeanne darc as of socrates the mind communicated knowledge not in the conscious everyday intelligence of the athenian or of la pucelle  this information in jeannes case was presented in the shape of hallucinations of eye and ear  it was sane wise noble veracious and concerned not with trifles but with great affairs  we are not encouraged to suppose that saints or angels made themselves audible and visible  but by the mechanism of such appearances to the senses that which was divine in the maidin all of

cloche    praps he was my fatherthough on this subjict i cant speak suttinly for my ma wrapped up my buth in a mistry  i may be illygitmit i may have been changed at nuss  in these strange words does mr thackerays jeames de la pluche anticipate the historical mystery of james de la cloche  his buth is wrapped up in a mistry his ma is a theme of doubtful speculation his father to all appearance was charles ii  we know not whether james de la clocherejecting the gaudy lure of three crownslived and died a saintly jesuit or whether on the other hand he married beneath him was thrown into gaol was sentenced to a public whipping was pardoned and released and died at the age of twentythree full of swaggering and impenitent impudence  was there but one james de la cloche a scion of the noblest of european royal lines  did he after professions of a holy vocation suddenly assume the most secular of characters jilting poverty and obedience for an earthly bride  or was the person who appears to have acted in this unworthy manner a mere impostor who had stolen jamess money and jewels and royal name  if so what became of the genuine and saintly james de la cloche  he is never heard of any more whether because he assumed an ecclesiastical alias or because he was effectually silenced by the person who took his character name money and parentage  there are two factions in the dispute about de la cloche  the former including the late lord acton and father boero believe that james adhered to his sacred vocation while the second james was a rank impostor  the other party holds that the frivolous and secular james was merely the original james who suddenly abandoned his vocation and burst on the world as a gay cavalier and claimant of the rank of prince of wales or at least of the revenues and perquisites of that position  the first act in the drama was discovered by father boero who printed the documents as to james de la cloche in his history of the conversion to the catholic church of charles ii king of england in the sixth and seventh volumes fifth series of la civilta cattolica rome 1863  the essays can be procured in a separate brochure  father boero says not a word about the second and secular james calling himself giacopo stuardo  but the learned father had communicated the papers about de la cloche to lord acton who wrote an article on the subject the secret history of charles ii in the home and foreign review july 1862  lord acton now added the story of the second james or of the second avatar of the first james from state papers in our record office the documents as to de la cloche are among the mss of the society of jesus at rome  the purpose of father boero was not to elucidate a romance in royal life but to prove that charles ii had for many years been sincerely inclined to the catholic creed though thwarted by his often expressed disinclination to go on his travels again  in point of fact the religion of charles ii might probably be stated in a celebrated figure of pascals  let it be granted that reason can discover nothing as to the existence of any ground for religion let it be granted that we cannot know whether there is a god or not yet either there is or there is not  it is even betting heads or tails croix ou pile  this being so it is wiser to bet that there is a god  it is safer  if you lose you are just where you were except for the pleasures which you desert  if you win you win everything  what you stake is finite a little pleasure if you win you win infinite bliss  so far charles was prepared theoretically to go but he would not abandon his diversions  a god there is but hes a good fellow and twill all be well  god would never punish a man he told burnet for taking a little irregular pleasure  further charles saw that if bet he must the safest religion to back was that of catholicism  thereby he couldit was even bettingactually ensure his salvation  but if he put on his money publicly if he professed catholicism he certainly lost his kingdoms  consequently he tried to be a cryptocatholic but he was not permitted to practise one creed and profess another  that the pope would not stand  so it was on his deathbed that he made his desperate plunge and went it must be said bravely on the darkling voyage  not to dwell on charless earlier dalliances with rome in november 1665 his kinsman ludovick stewart sieur daubigny of the scoto french lennox stewarts was made a cardinal and then died  charles had now no man whom he could implicitly trust in his efforts to become formally but secretly a catholic  and now james de la cloche comes on the scene  father boero publishes from the jesuit archives a strange paper purporting to be written and signed by the kings hand and sealed with his private seal that diamond seal whereof the impression brought such joy to the soul of the disgraced archbishop sharp  father boero attests the authenticity of seal and handwriting  in this paper charles acknowledges his paternity of james stuart who by our command has hitherto lived in france and other countries under a feigned name  he has come to london and is to bear the name of de la cloche du bourg de jarsey  de la cloche is not to produce this document written in his own language french till after the kings death  it is important to note that james de la cloche seems to have spoken no language except french  the paper is dated whitehall september 27 1665 when as lord acton observes the court during the plague was not at whitehall  civ catt series v vol vi 710  home and foreign review vol i 156  lord acton conjectured that the name de la cloche was taken from that of a protestant minister in jersey circ 1646  this is the more probable as charles later invented a false history of his son who was to be described as the son of a rich preacher deceased the surname de la cloche had really been that of a preacher in jersey and survives in jersey  after 1665 james de la cloche was pursuing his studies in holland being at this time a protestant  conceivably he had been brought up in a french huguenot family like that of the de rohan  on february 7 1667 charles wrote a new document  in this he grants to de la cloche 500 pounds a year while he lives in london and adheres to the religion of his father and the anglican service book  but in that very year july 29 1667 de la cloche went to hamburg and was there received into the catholic church forfeiting his pension  christina of sweden was then residing in hamburg  de la cloche apprised her of his real positiona son of the king of englandand must have shown her in proof charless two letters of 1665 and 1667 if soand how else could he prove his birthhe broke faith with charles but apparently he did not mean to use charless letters as proof of his origin when applying as he did for admission to the novitiate of the jesuits at rome  he obtained from christina a statement in latin that charles had acknowledged him privately to her as his son  this note of christinas de la cloche was to show to his director at rome  it does not appear that charles had ever told christina a word about the matter  these pious monarchs were far from being veracious however christinas document would save the young man much trouble on the point of his illegitimacy when on april 11 1668 he entered st andrea al quirinale as a jesuit novice  he came in poverty  his wardrobe was of the scantiest  he had two shirts a chamois leather chest protector three collars and three pairs of sleeves  he described himself as jacques de la cloche of jersey british subject and falsely or ignorantly stated his age as twentyfour  really he was twentytwo  why he told christina his secret why he let her say that charles had told her we do not know  it may be that the general of the jesuits oliva did not yet know who de la cloche really was  meanwhile his religious vocation led him to forfeit 500 pounds yearly and expectations and to disobey his father and king  civ catt ut supra 712 713 and notes  the good king took all very easily  on august 3 1668 he wrote a longa et verbosa epistola from whitehall to the general of the jesuits  his face was now set towards the secret treaty of dover and conversion  the conversion of his son therefore seemed truly providential  charles had discussed it with his own mother and his wife  to oliva he wrote in french explaining that his latin was poor and that if he wrote english an interpreter would be needed but that no englishman was to put his nose into this affair  he had long prayed god to give him a safe and secret chance of conversion but he could not use without exciting suspicion the priests then in england  on the other hand his son would do  the young cavalier then at rome named de la cloche de jersey  this lad was the pledge of an early love for a young lady of a family among the most distinguished in our kingdoms  he was a child of the kings earliest youth that is during his residence in jersey marchjune 1646 when charles was sixteen  in a few years the king hoped to recognise him publicly  with him alone could charles practise secretly the mysteries of the church  to such edifying ends had god turned an offence against his laws an amourette  de la cloche of course was as yet not a priest and could not administer sacraments an idea which occurred to charles himself  the queen of sweden charles added was prudent but being a woman she probably could not keep a secret  charles wants his son to come home and asks the jesuit to put off christina with any lie he pleases if she asks questions  in short he regards the general of the jesuits as a person ready to tell any convenient falsehood and lets this opinion appear with perfect naivete  he will ask the pope to hurry de la cloche into priests orders or if that is not easy he will have the thing done in paris by means of louis xiv or his own sister henrietta madame  or the queen and queen mother can have it done in london as they have bishops at their will  the king has no desire to interrupt his sons vocation as a jesuit  in london the young man must avoid jesuit society and other occasions of suspicion  he ends with a promise of subscriptions to jesuit objects  civ catt series v vii 269274  by the same courier the king wrote to our most honoured son the prince stuart dwelling with the rp jesuits under the name of signor de la cloche  james may be easy about money  he must be careful of his health which is delicate and not voyage at an unhealthy season  the queens are anxious to see him  he should avoid asceticism  he may yet be recognised and take precedence of his younger and less nobly born brother the duke of monmouth  the king expresses his affection for a son of excellent character and distinguished by the solidity of his studies and acquirements  if toleration is gained de la cloche has some chance of the english throne supposing charles and the duke of york to die without issue male  parliament will be unable to oppose this arrangement unless catholics are excluded from the succession  this has a crazy sound  the crown would have been in no lack of legitimate heirs failing offspring male of the king and the duke of york  if de la cloche however persists in his vocation so be it  the king may get for him a cardinals hat  the king assures his son of his affection not only as the child of his extreme youth but for the virtues of his character  de la cloche must travel as a simple gentleman  ut supra 275 278  on august 29 charles again wrote to oliva  he had heard that the queen of sweden was going to rome  de la cloche must not meet her she might let out the secret  he must come home at once  if charles is known to be a catholic there will be tumults and he will lose his life  another letter undated asks that the novice contrary to rule may travel alone with no jesuit chaperon and by sea direct from genoa  consulting physicians the king has learned that sea sickness is never fatal rather salutary  his travelling name should be henri de rohan as if he were of that calvinistic house friends of the king  the story must be circulated that de la cloche is the son of a rich preacher deceased and that he has gone to visit his mother who is likely to be converted  he must leave his religious costume with the jesuits at genoa and pick it up there on his return  he must not land at the port of london but at some other harbour and thence drive to town  ut supra 283287  on october 14 doliva from leghorn wrote to charles that the french gentleman was on the seas  on november 18 charles wrote to doliva that his son was returning to rome as his secret ambassador and by the kings orders was to come back to london bearing answers to questions which he will put verbally  in france he leaves a jesuit whom he is to pick up as he again makes for england  father florent dumas in a rather florid essay on the saintly son of charles ii supposes that after all he had a jesuit chaperon during his expedition to england jesuit etudes de rel hist et lit paris 18641865  the questions to which de la cloche is to bring answers doubtless concerned the wish of charles to be a catholic secretly and other arrangements which he is known to have suggested on another occasion  after this letter of november 18 1668 we never hear a word about james de la cloche  no later letters from the king to doliva are found the name of james de la cloche does not occur again in the records of the society of jesus  ut supra 418420  father boero argues that james would return to london under a third name unknown  but it would be risky for one who had appeared in england under one name in 1665 and under another rohan in 1668 to turn up under a third in 1669  to take aliases often three or four was however the custom of the english jesuits and de la cloche may have chosen his fourth  thus we could not trace him in records unless charles wrote again to doliva about his son  no such letter exists  in his letter of november 18 charles promises in a year a subscription to the jesuit building fundthis at his sons request  i know not if the money was ever paid  he also asks oliva to give james 800 doppie for expenses to be repaid in six months  james did not leave the society of jesus argues father boero for had he left he would have carried away the papers in which charles acknowledges him and promises a pension of 500 pounds yearly  but that document would be useless to james whether he remained a jesuit or not for the condition of the pension 1667 was that he should be a protestant of the anglican sect and live in london however charless letter of 1668 was in another tune and james certainly left that with the jesuits in rome at least they possess it now  but suppose that james fled secretly from the jesuits then he probably had no chance of recovering his papers  he was not likely to run away however for charles says he did not like london or the secular life and he appears to have returned to rome at the end of 1668 with every intention of fulfilling his mission and pursuing his vocation  his return mission to england over he probably would finish his jesuit training at a college in france or flanders say st omers where titus oates for a while abode  no james de la cloche is known there or elsewhere but he might easily adopt a new alias and charles would have no need to write to oliva about him  it may be that james was the priest at st omers whom in 167o charles had arranged to send but did not send to clement ix  he may also be the priest secretly brought from abroad to charles during the popish plot 16781681  mignet neg rel succ despagne iii 232 welwood memoirs 146  these are suggestions of lord acton who thinks that de la cloche may also have been the author of two papers in french on religion left by charles in his own hand at his death  these are conjectures  if we accept them de la cloche was a truly self denying young semiprince preferring an austere life to the delights and honours which attended his younger brother the duke of monmouth  but just when de la cloche should have been returning from rome to london at the end of 1668 or beginning of 1669 a person calling himself james stuart son of charles ii by an amour at jersey in 1646 with a lady mary henrietta stuart appeared in some magnificence at naples  this james stuart either was or affected to be james de la cloche  whoever he was the kings carefully guarded secret was out was public property  home and foreign review i 165  our information as to this james stuart or giacopo stuardo son of the king of englandthe cavalier who appears exactly when the jesuit novice james de la cloche son of the king of england vanishesis derived from two sources  first there are roman newsletters forwarded to england by kent the english agent at rome with his own despatches in english  it does not appear to me that kent had as a rule any intimate purveyor of intelligence at naples  he seems in his own letters to williamson merely to follow and comment on the italian newsletters which he forwards and the gossip of the nation that is the english in rome  the newsletters of course might be under the censorship of rome and naples  such is one of our sources  see the valets master for other references to williamson state papers italian 1669 bundle 10 record office  lord acton in 1862 and other writers have relied solely on this first set of testimonies  but the late mr maziere brady has apparently ignored or been unacquainted with these materials and he cites a printed book not quoted by lord acton  this work is the third volume of the lettere of vincenzo armanni of gubbio who wrote much about the conversion of england and had himself been in that country  the work quoted was printed privately by giuseppe piccini at macerata in 1674 and so far i have been unable to see an example  the british museum library has no copy and the lettere are unknown to brunet  we have thus to take a secondhand version of armannis account  he says that his informant was one of two confessors employed successively by prince james stuart at naples in januaryaugust 1669  now kent sent to england an english translation of the italian will of james stuart  a will is also given of course in italian by vincenzo armanni a copy of this is in the record office  maziere brady angloroman papers pp 93121 gardner paisley 1890  it appears from this will that james stuart for reasons of his own actually did enjoy the services of two successive confessors at naples in 1669  the earlier of these two was armannis informant his account of james stuart differs from that of kent and the italian newsletters which we repeat alone are cited by lord acton 1862 while mr brady 1890 citing armanni knows nothing of the newsletters and kent and conceives himself to be the first writer in english on the subject  turning to our first source the newsletters of rome and the letters of kent the dates in each case prove that kent with variations follows the newsletters  the gazzetta of march 23 1669 is the source of kents despatch of march 30  on the gazzette of april 6 13 and 20 he makes no comment but his letter of june 16 varies more or less from the newsletter of june 11  his despatch of september 7 corresponds to the newsletter of the same date but is much more copious  taking these authorities in order of date we find the newsletter of rome march 23 1669 averring that an unknown english gentleman has been for some months at naples that is since january at least and has fallen in love with the daughter of a poor innkeeper or host locandiere  he is a catholic and has married the girl  the newly made fatherinlaw has been spending freely the money given to him by the bridegroom  armanni as summarised by mr brady states the matter of the money thus  the prince was anxious to make it appear that his intended fatherinlaw was not altogether a pauper and accordingly he gave a sum of money to signor francesco corona to serve as a dowry for teresa  signor corona could not deny himself the pleasure of exhibiting this money before his friends and he indiscreetly boasted before his neighbours concerning his rich son inlaw  from armannis version derived from the confessor of james stuart it appears that nothing was said as to jamess royal birth till after his arrest when he informed the viceroy of naples in self defence  to return to the newsletter of march 23 it represents that the viceroy heard of the unwonted expenditure of money by corona and seized the english soninlaw on suspicion  in his possession the viceroy found about 200 doppie many jewels and some papers in which he was addressed as altezza highness  the word doppie is used by charles in boeros italian translation for the 800 coins which he asks oliva to give to de la cloche for travelling expenses were james stuarts 200 doppie the remains of the 800  lord acton exaggerates when he writes vaguely that stuart possessed heaps of pistoles  two hundred doppie about 150 or 160 pounds are not heaps  to return to the newsletter the idea being current that the young man was a natural son of the king of england he was provisionally confined in the castle of st elmo  on april 6 he is reported to be shut up in the castle of gaeta  on the 20th we hear that fifty scudi monthly have been assigned to the prisoner for his support  the viceroy has written to england to ask what is to be done with him  on june 11 it is reported that after being removed to the vicaria a prison for vulgar malefactors the captive has been released  he is not the son of the king of england  kents letter of march 30 follows the newsletter of march 23  he adds that the unknown englishman seems to have vaunted to bee the king of englands sonne borne at gersey a fact never expressly stated about de la cloche  it is not clear that james stuart vaunted his birth before his arrest made it necessary for him to give an account of himself  kent also says that the unknown sent for the english consul mr browne to assist his delivery out of the castle  but it seems he could not speake a word of english nor give any account of the birth he pretended to  on kents showing he had no documentary proofs of his royal birth  french was de la cloches language if this unknown was he and if kent is right he had not with him the two documents and the letter of charles ii and the certificate of the queen of sweden  this is all the light i can picke out of the nation or others of his extravagant story which whether will end in prince or cheate i shall endeavour to inform you hereafter  kents next letter june 16 follows with variations the newsletter of june 11  kent to j williamson  june 16 1669  the gentleman who would have beene his matys bastard at naples vpon the receipt of his maties letters to that vice king was immediately taken out of the castle of gaetta brought to naples and cast into the grand prison called the vicaria where being thrust amongst the most vile and infamous rascalls the vice king intended to have caused him to bee whipt about the citty but meanes was made by his wifes kindred who was likewise taken with this pretended prince to the vicequeene who in compassion to her and her kindred prevailed with don pedro to deliver him from that shame and from gaol it seems and soe ends the story of this fourb who speaks noe languadge but ffrench  the newsletter says nothing of the intended whipping or of the intercession of the family of the wife of the unknown  these points may be the additions of gossips  in any case the unknown with his wife after a stay of no long time in the vicaria is set at liberty  his release might be explained on the ground that charles disavowed and cast him off which he might safely do if the man was really de la cloche but had none of the papers proving his birth the papers which are still in the jesuit archives  or he may have had the papers and they may have been taken from him and restored to the jesuit general  so far the betting as to whether de la cloche and the naples pretender were the same man or not is at evens  each hypothesis is beset by difficulties  it is highly improbable that the unworldly and enthusiastic jesuit novice threw up at its very crisis a mission which might lead his king his father and the british empire back into the one fold  de la cloche forfeiting his chances of an earthly crown was on the point of gaining a heavenly one  it seems to the last degree unlikely that he would lose this and leave the jesuits to whom he had devoted himself and the quiet life of study and religion for the worldly life which he disliked and for that life on a humble capital of a few hundred pounds and some jewels presents perhaps from the two queens his grandmother and stepmother  de la cloche knew that charles if the novice clung to religion had promised to procure for him if he desired it a cardinals hat while if with charless approval he left religion he might be a prince perhaps a king  he had thus every imaginable motive for behaving with decorumin religion or out of it  yet if he is the naples pretender he suddenly left the jesuits without charless knowledge and approval but by a freakish escapade like the start of charles himself as a lad when he ran away from argyll and the covenanters  and he did this before he ever saw teresa corona  he reminds one of the huguenot pastor in london whom an acquaintance met on the turf  i not preacher now i gay dog explained the holy man  all this is undeniably of a high improbability  but on the other side de la cloche was freakish and unsettled  he had but lately 1667 asked for and accepted a pension to be paid while he remained an anglican then he was suddenly received into the roman church and started off probably on foot with his tiny swag of three shirts and three collars to walk to rome and become a jesuit  he may have deserted the jesuits as suddenly and recklessly as he had joined them  it is not impossible  he may have received the 800 pounds for travelling expenses from oliva not much of it was left by march 1669only about 150 pounds  on the theory that the man at naples was an impostor it is odd that he should only have spoken french that he was charged with no swindles that he made a very poor marriage in place of aiming at a rich union that he had somehow learned de la cloches secret and that possessing a fatal secret invaluable to a swindler and blackmailer he was merely disgraced and set free  louis xiv would at least have held him a masked captive for the rest of his life  but he was liberated and after a brief excursion returned to naples where he died maintaining that he was a prince  thus on either view prince or cheat we are met by things almost impossible  we now take up the naples mans adventure as narrated by kent  he writes  kent to jo williamson  rome  august 31 1669  that certaine fellow or what hee was who pretended to bee his maties naturall sonn at naples is dead and haueing made his will they write mee from thence wee shall with the next poast know the truth of his quality   september 7 1669  that certaine person at naples who in his lyfe tyme would needes bee his maties naturall sonne is dead in the same confidence and princely humour for haueing left his lady teresa corona an ordinary person 7 months gone with child hee made his testament and hath left his most xtian matie whom he called cousin executor of it  hee had been absent from naples some tyme pretending to haue made a journey into france to visit his mother dona maria stuarta of his matie royall family which neernes and greatnes of blood was the cause saies hee that his matie would never acknowledge him for his sonn his mother dona maria stuarta was it seemes dead before hee came into france  in his will hee desires the present king of england carlo 2nd to allow his prince hans in kelder eighty thousand ducketts which is his mothers estate he leaues likewise to his child and mother teresa 291 thousand ducketts which hee calls legacies  hee was buried in the church of st franco di paolo out of the porta capuana for hee dyed of this religion  he left 400 pounds for a lapide to have his name and quality engrauen vpon it for hee called himself don jacopo stuarto and this is the end of that princely cheate or whatever hee was  the newsletter of september 7 merely mentions the death and the will  on this occasion kent had private intelligence from a correspondent in naples  copies of the will in english and in italian were forwarded to england where both copies remain  this will lord acton remarked is fatal to the case for the prince  if not fatal it is a great obstacle to the cause of the naples man  he claims as his mother donna maria stewart of the family of the barons of san marzo  if marzo means march the earl of march was a title in the lennox family  the only mary stewart in that family known to douglass peerage was younger than james de la cloche and died the wife of the earl of arran in 1667 at the age of eighteen  she may have had some outlying cousin mary but nothing is known of such a possible mother of de la cloche  again the testator begs charles ii to give his unborn child the ordinary principality either of wales or monmouth or other province customary to be given to the natural sons of the crown to the value of 100000 scudi  could de la cloche be so ignorant as to suppose that a royal bastard might be created prince of wales  he certainly knew from charless letter that his younger brother was already duke of monmouth  his legacies are of princely munificence buthe is to be buried at the expense of his fatherinlaw  by way of security for his legacies the testator assigns and gives his lands called the marquisate of juvignis worth 300000 scudi  mr brady writes  juvignis is probably a mistake for aubigny the dukedom which belonged to the dukes of richmond and lennox by the older creation  but a dukedom is not a marquisate nor could de la cloche hold aubigny of which the last holder was ludovick stewart who died a cardinal in november 1665  the lands then reverted to the french crown  moreover there are two places called juvigny or juvignis in northeastern france orne and manche  conceivably one or other of these belonged to the house of rohan and james stuarts posthumous son one of whose names is roano claimed a title from juvigny or juvignis among other absurd pretensions henri de rohan was only the travelling name of de la cloche in 1668 though it is conceivable that he was brought up by the de rohan family friendly to charles ii  the whole will is incompatible with all that de la cloche must have known  being in italian it cannot have been intelligible to him and may conceivably be the work of an ignorant neapolitan attorney while de la cloche as a dying man may have signed without understanding much of what he signed  the folly of the corona family may thus it is a mere suggestion be responsible for this absurd testament  armanni however represents the man as sane and very devout till his death  a posthumous child a son was born and lived a scrambling life now recognised abroad now in prison and poverty till we lose him about 1750  a f steuart engl hist review july 1903 the neapolitan stuarts  maziere brady ut supra  among his sham titles are dux roani and de roano clearly referring as mr steuart notices to de la cloches travelling name of henri de rohan  the neapolitan pretender therefore knew the secret of that incognito and so of de la cloches mission to england in 1668  that possessing this secret he was set free is a most unaccountable circumstance  charles had written to oliva that his life hung on absolute secrecy yet the owner of the secret is left at liberty  our first sources leave us in these perplexities  they are not disentangled by the lettere of vincenzo armanni 1674  i have been unable as has been said to see this book  in the summary by mr brady we read that 16681669 prince james stuart with a french knight of the order of st john of jerusalem came to naples for his health  this must have been in december 1668 or january 1669 by march 1669 the pretender had been for some months in naples  the frenchman went by way of malta to england recommending prince james to a confessor at naples who was a parish priest this priest was armannis informant  he advised the prince to lodge with corona and here james proposed to teresa  she at first held aloof and the priest discountenanced the affair  the prince ceased to be devout but later chose another confessor  both priests knew in confession the secret of his birth  the prince says so in his will and leaves them great legacies  so far armannis version is corroborated  mr  brady goes on citing armanni  at last he chose another spiritual director to whom he revealed not only his passion for teresa corona but also the secret of his birth showing to him the letters written by the queen of sweden and the father general of the jesuits  was the latter document olivas note from leghorn of october 14 1668  that did not contain a word about de la cloches birth  he is merely styled the french gentleman  again the letter of the queen of sweden is now in the jesuit archives how could it be in the possession of the pretender at naples  was it taken from him in prison and returned to oliva  the new confessor approved of the wedding which was certainly celebrated on february 19 1669  old corona now began to show his money  his new soninlaw was suspected of being a false coiner and was arrested by the viceroy  the certificates and papers attesting the parentage of james stuart were then produced    how could this bethey were in the hands of the jesuits at rome had de la cloche brought them to naples the corona family would have clung to them but they are in the gesu at rome to this day the rest is much as we know it save what is important that the prince from prison wrote to the general of the jesuits beseeching him to interpose his good offices with the viceroy and to obtain permission for him to go to england via leghorn as in 1688 and marseilles  armanni knew nothing or says nothing of de la cloches having been in the jesuit novitiate  his informant the priest must have known that but under seal of confession so he would not tell armanni he did tell him that james stuart wrote to the jesuit general asking his help in procuring leave to go to england  the general knew de la cloches hand and would not be taken in by the impostors  this point is in favour of the identity of james stuart with de la cloche  the viceroy had however already written to london and waited for a reply  immediately on arrival of the answer from london the prince was set at liberty and left naples it may be supposed he went to england  after a few months he returned to naples with an assignment of 50000 scudi and died of fever  nothing is said by armanni of the imprisonment among the low scum of the vicaria  nothing of the intended whipping nothing of the visit by james stuart to france  the 50000 scudi have a mythical ring why should james if he had 50000 scudi be buried at the expense of his fatherinlaw who also has to pay 50 ducats to the notary for drawing the will of this prince or cheate  probably the parish priest and exconfessor of the prince was misinformed on some points  the corona family would make out the best case they could for their royal kinsman  was the man of naples prince or cheate  was he de la cloche or as lord acton suggests a servant who had robbed de la cloche of money and papers  every hypothesis we shall recapitulate them which we can try as a key fails to fit the lock  say that de la cloche had confided his secret to a friend among the jesuit novices say that this young man either robbed de la cloche or having money and jewels of his own fled from the s andrea training college and when arrested assumed the name and pretended to the rank of de la cloche  this is not inconceivable but it is odd that he had no language but french and that possessing secrets of capital importance he was released from prison and allowed to depart where he would and return to naples when he chose  say that a french servant of de la cloche robbed and perhaps even murdered him  in that case he certainly would not have been released from prison  the man at naples was regarded as a gentleman but that is not so important in an age when the low scoundrel bedloe could pass in spain and elsewhere for an english peer  but again if the naples man is a swindler as already remarked he behaves unlike one  a swindler would have tried to entrap a woman of property into a marriagehe might have seduced but would not have married the penniless teresa corona giving what money he had to her father  when arrested the man had not in money more than 160 pounds  his maintenance while in prison was paid for by the viceroy  no detaining charges from other victims appear to have been lodged against him  his will ordains that the document shall be destroyed by his confessor if the secret of his birth therein contained is divulged before his death  the secret perhaps was only knownbefore his arrestto his confessors it came out when he was arrested by the viceroy as a coiner of false money  like de la cloche he was pious though not much turns on that  if armannis information is correct if when taken the man wrote to the general of the jesuitswho knew de la cloches handwritingwe can scarcely escape the inference that he was de la cloche  on the other hand is the monstrous will  unworldly as de la cloche may have been he can hardly have fancied that wales was the appanage of a bastard of the crown and he certainly knew that the province of monmouth already gave a title to his younger brother the duke born in 1649  yet the testator claims wales or monmouth for his unborn child  again de la cloche may not have known who his mother was  but not only can no mary or mary henrietta of the lennox family be found except the impossible lady mary who was younger than de la cloche but we observe no trace of the presence of any daubigny or even of any stewart male or female at the court of the prince of wales in jersey in 1646  see hoskins charles ii in the channel islands bentley london 1854  the names of the suite are given by dr hoskins from the journal ms of chevalier a jersey man and from the osborne papers  no stewart or stuart occurs but in a crowd of some 3000 refugees there may have been a young lady of the name  lady fanshaw who was in jersey is silent  the will is absurd throughout but whether it is all of the dying pretenders composition whether it may not be a thing concocted by an agent of the corona family is another question  it is a mere conjecture suggested by more than one inquirer as by mr steuart that the words signora d maria stuardo della famiglia delli baroni di s marzo refer to the lennox family which would naturally be spoken of as lennox or as daubigny  about the marquisate of juvigny which cannot mean the dukedom of daubigny we have said enough  in short the whole will is absurd and it is all but inconceivable that the real de la cloche could have been so ignorant as to compose it  so the matter stands one of two hypotheses must be correctthe naples man was de la cloche or he was notyet either hypothesis is almost impossible  i was at first inclined to suppose that the de la cloche papers in the gesuthe letters of charles ii and the note of the queen of swedenwere forgeries part of an impostors apparatus seized at naples and sent to oliva for inspection  but the letters handwriting and royal seal apartshow too much knowledge of charless secret policy to have been feigned  we are not told that the certificates of de la cloches birth were taken from james stuart in prison and even if he possessed them as armanni says he did he may have stolen them and they may have been restored by the viceroy of naples as we said to the jesuits  as to whether charles ii paid his promised subscription to the jesuit building fund father boero says  we possess a royal letter proving that it was abundant boero istoria etc p 56 note 1 but he does not print the letter and mr brady speaks now of extant documents proving the donation and now of a traditional belief that charles was a benefactor of the jesuit college  it may be added that on december 27 1668 charles wrote to his sister henrietta duchess of orleans  i assure you that nobody does nor shall know anything of it here of his intended conversion and secret dealings with france but my selfe and that one person more till it be fitte to be publique    that one person more is not elsewhere referred to in charless known letters to his sister unless he be he that came last and delivered me your letter of the 9th december he has given me a full account of what he was charged with and i am very well pleased with what he tells me whitehall december 14 1668  this mysterious person the one sharer of the kings secret may be de la cloche if he could have left england by november 18 visited rome and returned to paris by december 9  if so de la cloche may have fulfilled his mission  did he return to italy and appear in naples in january or february 1669  see madame by julia cartwright pp 274 275 london 1894    ix  the truth about fishers ghost    everybody has heard about fishers ghost  it is one of the stock yarns of the world and reappears now and again in magazines books like the night side of nature newspapers and general conversation  as usually told the story runs thus  one fisher an australian settler of unknown date dwelling not far from sydney disappeared  his overseer like himself an exconvict gave out that fisher had returned to england leaving him as plenipotentiary one evening a neighbour one farley returning from market saw fisher sitting on the fence of his paddock walked up to speak to him and marked him leave the fence and retreat into the field where he was lost to sight  the neighbour reported fishers return and as fisher could nowhere be found made a deposition before magistrates  a native tracker was taken to the fence where the pseudo fisher sat discovered white mans blood on it detected white mans fat on the scum of a pool hard by and finally found white mans body buried in a brake  the overseer was tried condemned and hanged after confession  such is the yarn  occasionally the ghost of fisher is said to have been viewed several times on the fence  now if the yarn were true it would be no proof of a ghost  the person sitting on the fence might be mistaken for fisher by a confusion of identity or might be a mere subjective hallucination of a sort recognised even by official science as not uncommon  on the other hand that such an illusion should perch exactly on the rail where white mans blood was later found would be a very remarkable coincidence  finally the story of the appearance might be explained as an excuse for laying information against the overseer already suspected on other grounds  but while this motive might act among a celtic population naturally credulous of ghosts and honourably averse to assisting the law as in glenclunie in 1749 it is not a probable motive in an english crown colony as sydney then was  nor did the seer inform against anybody  the tale is told in teggs monthly magazine sydney march 1836 in household words for 1853 in mr john langs book botany bay about 1840 where the yarn is much dressed up and in mr montgomery martins history of the british colonies vol iv 1835  nowhere is a date given but mr martin says that the events occurred while he was in the colony  his most intimate surviving friend has often heard him tell the tale and discuss it with a legal official who is said to have been present at the trial of the overseer  other living witnesses have heard the story from a gentleman who attended the trial  mr martins narrative given as a lowest date the occurrences were before 1835  moreover the yarn of the ghost was in circulation before that year and was accepted by a serious writer on a serious subject  but we have still no date for the murder  so the friend informs me in a letter of november 1896  that date shall now be given  frederick fisher was murdered by george worrall his overseer at campbelltown on june 16 or 17 1826  after that date as fisher was missing worrall told various tales to account for his absence  the trial of worrall is reported in the sydney gazette of february 5 1827  not one word is printed about fishers ghost but the reader will observe that there is a lacuna in the evidence exactly where the ghost if ghost there were should have come in  the search for fishers body starts it will be seen from a spot on fishers paddockfence and the witness gives no reason why that spot was inspected or rather no account of how or by whom sprinkled blood was detected on the rail  nobody saw the murder committed  chiefjustice forbes said in summing up on february 2 1827 that the evidence was purely circumstantial we are therefore so far left wholly in the dark as to why the police began their investigations at a rail in a fence  at the trial mr d cooper deposed to having been owed 80 pounds  by fisher  after fishers disappearance cooper frequently spoke to worrall about this debt which worrall offered to pay if cooper would give up to him certain papers titledeeds of fishers in his possession  worrall even wrote from banbury curran certifying cooper of fishers departure from the colony which he said he was authorised to announce  cooper replied that he would wait for his 80 pounds if fisher were still in the country  worrall exhibited uneasiness but promised to show a written commission to act for fisher  this document he never produced but was most anxious to get back fishers papers and to pay the 80 pounds  this arrangement was refused by cooper  james coddington deposed that on july 8 1826 when fisher had been missing for three weeks worrall tried to sell him a colt which coddington believed to be fishers  worrall averred that fisher had left the country  a few days later worrall showed coddington fishers receipt for the price paid to him by worrall for the horse witness from having seen fisher write had considerable doubt as to the genuineness of the receipt  james hamilton swore that in august 1826 he bluntly told worrall that foul play was suspected he turned pale and endeavoured to force a smile  he merely said that fisher was on salt water but could not or would not name his ship  a receipt to worrall from fisher was sworn to by lewis solomon as a forgery  samuel hopkins who lived under fishers roof last saw fisher on june 17 1826 june 16 may be meant in the evening  some other people including one lawrence were in the house they left shortly after fisher went out that evening and later remarked on the strangeness of his not returning  nathaniel cole gave evidence to the same effect  fisher in short strolled out on june 17 16 1826 and was seen no more in the body  robert burke of campbelltown constable deposed to having apprehended worrall  we may now give in full the evidence as to the search for fishers body on october 20 1826  here let us first remark that fishers body was not easily found  a reward for its discovery was offered by government on september 27 1826 when fisher had been dead for three months and this may have stimulated all that was immortal of fisher to perch on his own paddockrail and so draw attention to the position of his body but on this point we have no information and we proceed to real evidence  from this it appears that though a reward was offered on september 27 the local magistrates to whom the ghostseer went in the yarn did not bid their constable make special researches till october 20 apparently after the seer told his tale  george leonard a constable at campbelltown stated that by order of the bench of the magistrates he commenced a search for the body of the deceased on the 20th of october last  witness went to a place where some blood was said to have been discovered and saw traces of it on several rails of a fence at the corner of the deceaseds paddock adjoining the fence of mr bradbury and about fifty rods from prisoners house  witness proceeded to search with an iron rod over the ground when two black natives came up and joined in the search till they came to a creek where one of them saw something on the water  a man named gilbert a black native went into the water and scumming some of the top with a leaf which he afterwards tasted called out that there was the fat of a white man of which he was clearly an amateur  they then proceeded to another creek about forty or fifty yards farther up still led by the natives when one of them struck the rod into some marshy ground and called out that there was something there  a spade was immediately found and the place dug when the first thing that presented itself was the left hand of a man lying on his side which witness from a long acquaintance with him immediately declared to be the hand of frederick fisher  the body was decayed a little particularly the underjaw  witness immediately informed mr william howe and the rev mr reddall and obtained a warrant to apprehend the parties who were supposed to be concerned in the murder the coroner was sent for and the body being taken out of the earth the next morning several fractures were found in the head  an inquest was held and a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown was returned  witness particularly examined the fence  there appeared to have been a fire made under the lower rail as if to burn out the mark  the blood seemed as if it were sprinkled over the rails     the declaration of the prisoner worrall was put in and read it stated that on the evening of the 17th of june a man named lawrence got some money from the deceased and together with four others went to a neighbouring publichouse to drink  that after some time they returned and the prisoner being then outside the house and not seen by the others he saw two of them enter whilst the other two one of whom was lawrence remained at the door  the prisoner then went down to the bottom of the yard and after a little time heard a scuffle and saw lawrence and the others drag something along the yard which they struck several times  the prisoner then came forward and called out to know who it was  one of them replied it is a dog  the prisoner coming up said it is fisher and you have prevented him from crying out any more  they said they had murdered him in order to possess themselves of what money he had and bound the prisoner by a solemn pledge not to reveal it  for the prisoner nathaniel boom deposed  he knew deceased and intended to institute a prosecution against him for forgery when he disappeared  chiefjustice summed up  observed it was a case entirely of circumstances  the jury were first to consider if identity of body with fisher was satisfactorily established  if not  no case  if so  they would then consider testimony as affecting prisoner impossible though wholly circumstantial for evidence to be stronger  he offered no opinion but left case to jury  the jury returned a verdict of guilty  sentence of death passed            february 6 1827  sydney gazette  george worrall convicted on friday last of murder of f fisher yesterday suffered the last penalty of the law  till about 5 oclock on the morning of his execution he persisted in asserting his innocence when he was induced to confess to a gentleman who had sat up with him during the night that he alone had perpetrated the murder but positively affirmed it was not his intention at the time to do so  we need not follow worralls attempts to explain away the crime as an accident  he admitted that he had intended to hang lawrence and cole  it is a curious case  why was nobody interrogated about the discovery on the rail of blood three months old if not four months  what was the apparent date of the fire under the rail  how did the ghoststory get into circulation and reach mr montgomery martin 1835  to suggest a solution of these problems we have a precisely analogous case in england  on october 25 1828 one william edden a marketgardener did not come home at night  his wife rushed into the neighbouring village announcing that she had seen her husbands ghost that he had a hammer or some such instrument in his hand that she knew he had been hammered to death on the road by a man whose name she gave one tyler  her husband was found on the road between aylesbury and thame killed by blows of a blunt instrument and the wife in vain repeatedly invited the man joseph tyler to come and see the corpse  probably she believed that it would bleed in his presence in accordance with the old superstition  all this the poor woman stated on oath at an inquiry before the magistrates reported in the buckinghamshire county paper of august 29 1829  here is her evidence given at aylesbury petty sessions august 22 before lord nugent sir j d king r brown esq and others  after my husbands corpse was brought home i sent to tyler for some reasons i had to come and see the corpse  i sent for him five or six times  i had some particular reason for sending for him which i never did divulge     i will tell my reasons if you gentlemen ask me in the face of tyler even if my life should be in danger for it  when i was ironing a shirt on the saturday night my husband was murdered something came over mesomething rushed over meand i thought my husband came by me  i looked up and i thought i heard the voice of my husband come from near my mahogany table as i turned from my ironing  i ran out and said oh dear god my husband is murdered and his ribs are broken  i told this to several of my neighbours  mrs chester was the first to whom i told it  i mentioned it also at the saracens head  sir j d kinghave you any objection to say why you thought your husband had been murdered  no  i thought i saw my husbands apparition and the man that had done it and that man was tyler and that was the reason i sent for him     when my neighbours asked me what was the matter when i ran out i told them that i had seen my husbands apparition    when i mentioned it to mrs chester i said  my husband is murdered and his ribs are broken i have seen him by the mahogany table  i did not tell her who did it     i was always frightened since my husband had been stopped on the road  the deceased edden had once before been waylaid but was then too powerful for his assailants  in consequence of what i saw i went in search of my husband until i was taken so ill i could go no further  lord nugentwhat made you think your husbands ribs were broken  he held up his hand like this holds up her arm and i saw a hammer or something like a hammer and it came into my mind that his ribs were broken  sewell stated that the murder was accomplished by means of a hammer  the examination was continued on august 31 and september 13 and finally both prisoners were discharged for want of sufficient evidence  sewell declared that he had only been a lookeron and his accusations against tyler were so full of prevarications that they were not held sufficient to incriminate him  the inquiry was again resumed on february 11 1830 and sewell tyler and a man named gardner were committed for trial  the trial see buckingham gazette march 13 1830 took place before mr baron vaughan and a grand jury at the buckingham lent assizes march 5 1830 but in the report of mrs eddens evidence no mention is made of the vision  sewell and tyler were found guilty and were executed protesting their innocence on march 8 1830  miss browne writing to us mr gurney from farnham castle in january 1884 gives an account of the vision which substantially accords with that here recorded adding  the wife persisted in her account of the vision consequently the accused was taken up and with some circumstantial evidence in addition to the womans story committed for trial by two magistratesmy father colonel robert browne and the rev charles ackfield  the murderer was convicted at the assizes and hanged at aylesbury  it may be added that colonel browne was remarkably free from superstition and was a thorough disbeliever in ghost stories  from phantasms of the living gurney and myers vol ii p 586  now in the report of the trial at assizes in 1830 there is not one word about the ghost though he is conspicuous in the hearing at petty sessions  the parallel to fishers case is thus complete and the reason for omitting the ghost in a trial is obvious  the murderers of sergeant davies of guises slain in the autumn of 1749 in glenclunie were acquitted by an edinburgh jury in 1753 in face of overpowering evidence of their guilt partly because two highland witnesses deposed to having seen the ghost of the sergeant partly because the jury were jacobites  the prisoners counsel as one of them told sir walter scott knew that their clients were guilty  a witness had seen them in the act  but the advocate lockhart a jacobite made such fun out of the ghost that an edinburgh jury disbelieving in the spectre and not loving the house of hanover very logically disregarded also the crushing evidence for a crime which was actually described in court by an eyewitness  thus to secure a view of the original form of the yarn of fishers ghost what we need is what we are not likely to getnamely a copy of the depositions made before the bench of magistrates at campbelltown in october 1826  for my own part i think it highly probable that the story of fishers ghost was told before the magistrates as in the buckinghamshire case and was suppressed in the trial at sydney  worralls condemnation is said to have excited popular discontent as condemnations on purely circumstantial evidence usually do  that dissatisfaction would be increased if a ghost were publicly implicated in the matter just as in the case of daviess murder in 1749  we see how discreetly the wraith or ghost was kept out of the buckinghamshire case at the trial and we see why in worralls affair no questions were asked as to the discovery of sprinkled blood not proved by analysis to be human on the rail where fishers ghost was said to perch  i had concluded my inquiry here when i received a letter in which mr rusden kindly referred me to his history of australia vol ii pp 44 45  mr rusden there gives a summary of the story in agreement with that taken from the sydney newspaper  he has corrected current rumours by comparison with the words of a trustworthy informant a medical man who lived long in the neighbourhood and attended farley the man who saw fishers ghost on his deathbed  he often conversed with farley on the subject of the vision which scared him     these facts are compiled from the notes of chiefjustice forbes who presided at the trial with the exception of the references to the apparition which although it led to the discovery of fishers body could not be alluded to in a court of justice or be adduced as evidence  there is no justice for ghosts  thanks to the kindness of the countess of jersey and the obliging researches of the chief justice of new south wales i have received a transcript of the judges notes  they are correctly analysed by mr rusden  an australian correspondent adds another example  long after fishers case this gentleman was himself present at a trial in maitland new south wales  a servantgirl had dreamed that a missing man told her who had killed him and where his body was concealed  she being terrified wanted to leave the house but her mistress made her impart the story to the chief constable a man known to my informant who also knew and names the judge who tried the case  the constable excavated at the spot pointed out in the dream unearthed the body and arrested the criminal who was found guilty confessed and was hanged  not a word was allowed to be said in court about the dream  all the chief constable was permitted to say was that from information received he went to hayess farm and so forth  here then are two parallels to fishers ghost and very hard on psychical science it is that ghostly evidence should be deliberately burked through the prejudices of lawyers  mr suttar in his australian stories retold bathurst 1887 remarks that the ghost is not a late mythical accretion in fishers story  i have the authority of a gentleman who was intimately connected with the gentleman who had the charge of the police when the murder was done that farleys story did suggest the search for the body in the creek  but mr suttar thinks that farley invented the tale as an excuse for laying information  that might apply as has been said to highland witnesses in 1753 but hardly to an englishman in australia  besides if farley knew the facts and had the ghost to cover the guilt of peaching why did he not peach  he only pointed to a fence and but for the ingenious black sherlock holmes the body would never have been found  what farley did was not what a man would do who knowing the facts of the crime and lured by a reward of 20 pounds wished to play the informer under cover of a ghoststory  the case for the ghost then stands thus in my opinion  despite the silence preserved at the trial farleys ghoststory was really told before the discovery of fishers body and led to the finding of the body  despite mr suttars theory of information laid under shelter of a ghoststory farley really had experienced an hallucination  mr rusden who knew his doctor speaks of his fright and according to the version of 1836 he was terrified into an illness  now the hallucination indicated the exact spot where fisher was stricken down and left traces of his blood which no evidence shows to have been previously noticed  was it then a fortuitous coincidence that farley should be casually hallucinated exactly at the one spotthe rail in the fencewhere fisher had been knocked on the head  that is the question and the state of the odds may be reckoned by the mathematician  as to the australian servantgirls dream about the place where another murdered body lay and the dreams which led to the discovery of the red barn and assynt murders and may 1903 to the finding of the corpse of a drowned girl at shanklin all these may be mere guesses by the sleeping self which is very clever at discovering lost objects    x  the mystery of lord bateman    ever and again in the literary and antiquarian papers there flickers up debate as to the mystery of lord bateman  this problem in no way concerns the existing baronial house of bateman which in burke records no predecessor before a knight and lord mayor of 1717  our bateman comes of lordlier and more ancient lineage  the question really concerns the loving ballad of lord bateman illustrated by george cruikshank london  charles tilt fleet street  and mustapha syried constantinople  mdcccxxxix  the tiny little volume in green cloth with a design of lord batemans marriage ceremony stamped in gold opens with a warning to the public concerning the loving ballad of lord bateman  the warning is signed george cruikshank who however adds in a postscript  the above is not my writing  the ballad follows and then comes a set of notes mainly critical  the author of the warning remarks  in some collection of old english ballads there is an ancient ditty which i am told bears some remote and distant resemblance to the following epic poem  again the text of the ballad here styled the famous history of lord bateman with illustrations by thackeray plain the original designs were coloured occurs in the thirteenth volume of the biographical edition of thackerays works pp lvilxi  the problems debated are  who wrote the loving ballad of lord bateman and who wrote the notes  the disputants have not shown much acquaintance with ballad lore in general  first let us consider mr thackerays text of the ballad  it is closely affiliated to the text of the loving ballad of lord bateman whereof the earliest edition with cruikshanks illustrations was published in 1839  the edition here used is that of david bryce and son glasgow no date  there are undated cheap broadside copies not illustrated in the british museum  mr blanchard jerrold in his life of cruikshank tells us that the artist sang this old english ballad at a dinner where dickens and thackeray were present  mr thackeray remarked  i should like to print that ballad with illustrations but cruikshank warned him off as he intended to do the thing himself  dickens furnished the learned notes  this account of what occurred was given by mr walter hamilton but mr sala furnished another version  the authorship of the ballad mr sala justly observed is involved in mystery  cruikshank picked it up from the recitation of a minstrel outside a pothouse  in mr salas opinion mr thackeray revised and settled the words and made them fit for publication nor did he confine himself to the mere critical work he added in mr salas opinion that admired passage about the young brides mother who never before was heard to speak so free also contributing the proud young porter jeames  now in fact both the interpellation of the brides mamma and the person and characteristics of the proud young porter are of unknown antiquity and are not due to mr thackeraya scholar too conscientious to decorate  an ancient text  bishop percy did such things and scott is not beyond suspicion but mr thackeray like joseph ritson preferred the authentic voice of tradition  thus in the text of the biographical edition he does not imitate the cockney twang phonetically rendered in the version of cruikshank  the second verse for example runs thus  cruikshank            he sailed east he sailed vest                until he came to famed turkey           vere he vos taken and put to prisin                until his life was quite weary  thackeray            he sailed east and he sailed west                until he came to proud turkey           where he was taken and put to prison                until his life was almost weary  there are discrepancies in the arrangement of the verses and a most important various reading  cruikshank            now sevin long years is gone and past                and fourteen days vell known to me           she packed up all her gay clouthing                and swore lord bateman she would go see  to this verse in cruikshanks book a note not by cruikshank is added            now sevin long years is gone and past                and fourteen days well known to me  in this may be recognised though in a minor degree the same gifted hand that portrayed the mussulman the pirate the father and the bigot in two words this turk  the time is gone the historian knows it and that is enough for the reader  this is the dignity of history very strikingly exemplified  that note to cruikshanks text is like all the delightful notes if style is evidence not by dickens but by thackeray  yet in his own text with an exemplary fidelity he reads  and fourteen days well known to thee  to whom  we are left in ignorance and conjecture though tempting is unsafe  the reading of cruikshank vell known to methat is to the poetis confirmed by the hitherto unprinted lord bedmin  this version collected by miss wyatt edgell in 1899 as recited by a blind old woman in a workhouse who had learned it in her youth now lies before the present writer  he owes this invaluable document to the kindness of miss wyatt edgell and lady rosalind northcote  invaluable it is because it proves that lord bateman or bedmin is really a volkslied a popular and current version of the ancient ballad famed turkey becomes torquay in this text probably by a misapprehension on the part of the collector or reciter  the speech of the brides mother is here omitted though it occurs in older texts but on the whole the blind old womans memory has proved itself excellent  in one place she gives thackerays reading in preference to that of cruikshank thus  cruikshank            ven he vent down on his bended knee  thackeray            down on his bended knees fell he  old woman            down on his bended knee fell he  we have now ascertained the following facts  cruikshank and thackeray used a text with merely verbal differences which was popular among the least educated classes early in last century again thackeray contributed the notes and critical apparatus to cruikshanks version  for this the internal evidence of style is overpowering  no other man wrote in the manner and with the peculiar humour of mr titmarsh  in the humble opinion of the present writer these notes ought to be appended to mr thackerays version of lord bateman  finally mr sala was wrong in supposing that mr thackeray took liberties with the text received from oral tradition  what was the origin of that text  professor child in the second part of his english and scottish popular ballads lays before us the learning about lord bateman lord bedmin young bicham young brechin young bekie young beichan and susie pie the heroine sophia in thackeray lord beichan young bondwell and markgraf backenweil for by all these names is lord bateman known  the student must carefully note that thackerays list of broadsides cited is not by mr w m thackeray  pt ii p 454 et seq and in various other places  as the reader may not remember the incidents in the thackeray cruikshank and old woman version which represents an ancient ballad now not so much popularised as vulgarised a summary may be given  lord bateman went wandering  his character at this time and his expedition would seem to have borne a striking resemblance to those of lord byron     some foreign country he wished to see and that was the extent of his desire any foreign country would answer his purposeall foreign countries were alike to him note apud cruikshank  arriving in turkey or torquay he was taken and fastened to a tree by his captor  he was furtively released by the daughter of this turk  the poet has here by that bold license which only genius can venture upon surmounted the extreme difficulty of introducing any particular turk by assuming a foregone conclusion in the readers mind and adverting in a casual careless way to a turk hitherto unknown as to an old acquaintance     this turk he had is a masterstroke a truly shakespearian touchnote  the lady in her fathers cellar castle old womans text consoles the captive with the very best wine secretly stored for his private enjoyment by the cruel and hypocritical mussulman  she confesses the state of her heart and inquires as to lord batemans real property which is half northumberland  to what period in the complicated mediaeval history of the earldom of northumberland the affair belongs is uncertain  the pair vow to be celibate for seven years and lord bateman escapes  at the end of the period sophia sets out for northumberland urged perhaps by some telepathic admonition  for on arriving at lord batemans palace alnwick castle she summons the proud porter announces herself and finds that her lover has just celebrated a marriage with another lady  in spite of the remonstrances of the brides mamma lord bateman restores that young lady to her family observing            she is neither the better nor the worse for me  so thackeray and old woman  cruikshank prudishly reads            o youll see what ill do for you and she  lord bateman then prepared another marriage having plenty of superfluous wealth to bestow upon the churchnote  all the rest was bliss  the reader may ask  how did sophia know anything about the obscure christian captive  why did she leave home exactly in time for his marriage  how came lord bateman to be so fickle  the annotator replies  his lordship had doubtless been impelled by despair of ever recovering his lost sophia and a natural anxiety not to die without leaving an heir to his estate  finally how was the difficulty of sophias religion overcome  to all these questions the cockney version gives no replies but the older forms of the ballad offer sufficient though varying answers as we shall see  meanwhile one thing is plain from this analysis of the pothouse version of an old ballad namely that the story is constructed out of fragments from the great universal store of popular romance  the central ideas are two  first the situation of a young man in the hands of a cruel captor often a god a giant a witch a fiend but herea turk  the youth is loved and released commonly through magic spells by the daughter of the gaoler god giant witch turk or what not  in greece jason is the lord bateman medea is the sophia of the tale which was known to homer and hesiod and was fully narrated by pindar  the other young person the second bride however comes in differently in the greek  in faroff samoa a god is the captor  the gaoler is a magician in red indian versions  turners samoa p 102 for a list though an imperfect one of the captors daughter story see the authors custom and myth pp 86102  as a rule in these tales from finland to japan from samoa to madagascar greece and india the girl accompanies her lover in his flight delaying the pursuer by her magic  in lord bateman another formula almost as widely diffused is preferred  the old true love comes back just after her lovers wedding  he returns to her  now as a rule in popular tales the lovers fickleness is explained by a spell or by a breach of a taboo  the old true love has great difficulty in getting access to him and in waking him from a sleep drugged or magical            the bloody shirt i wrang for thee           the hill o glass i clamb for thee           and wilt thou no waken and speak to me  he wakens at last and all is well  in a romaic ballad the deserted girl meeting her love on his weddingday merely reminds him of old kindness  he answers            now he that will may scatter nuts                and he may wed that will           but she that was my old true love                shall be my true love still  this incident the strange often magically caused oblivion of the lover whose love returns to him like sophia at or after his marriage is found in popular tales of scotland norway iceland germany italy greece and the gaelic western islands  it does not occur in lord bateman where mr thackeray suggests probable reasons for lord batemans fickleness  but the worldwide incidents are found in older versions of lord bateman from which they have been expelled by the english genius for the commonplace  thus if we ask how did sophia at first know of batemans existence  the lovely and delicate daughter of the turk doubtless was unaware that in the crowded dungeons of her sire one captive of wealth noble birth and personal fascination was languishing the annotator explains  she hears from an aged and garrulous attendant her only female adviser for her mother died while she was yet an infant of the sorrows and sufferings of the christian captive  in ancient versions of the ballad another explanation occurs  she overhears a song which he sings about his unlucky condition  this account is in young bekie scottish  mark the name bekie where france is the scene and the kings daughter is the lady  the same formula of the song sung by the prisoner is usual  not uncommon too is a token carried by sophia when she pursues her lost adorer to insure her recognition  it is half of her broken ring  once more why does sophia leave home to find bateman in the very nick of time  thackerays version does not tell us but scottish versions do  she longed fu sair her love to see  elsewhere a supernatural being the billy blin or a fairy clad in green gives her warning  the fickleness of the hero is caused sometimes by constraint another noble has his marriage as his feudal superior and makes him marry but only in form            there is a marriage in yonder hall                has lasted thirty days and three           the bridegroom winna bed the bride                for the sake o one thats owre the sea  in this scottish version by the way occurs            up spoke the young brides mother                who never was heard to speak so free  wrongly attributed to mr thackerays own pen  the incident of the magical oblivion which comes over the bridegroom occurs in scandinavian versions of lord bateman from manuscripts of the sixteenth century  finally the religious difficulty in several scottish versions is got over by the conversion and baptism of sophia who had professed the creed of islam  that all these problems in lord bateman are left unsolved is then the result of decay  the modern vulgar english version of the pothouse minstrel known as the tripe skewer according to the author of the introduction to cruikshanks version has forgotten has been heedless of and has dropped the ancient universal elements of folk tale and folksong  child ii 459461  these graces it is true are not too conspicuous even in the oldest and best versions of lord bateman  choosing at random however we find a scots version open thus            in the lands where lord beichan was born                among the stately steps o stane           he wore the goud at his left shoulder                but to the holy land hes gane  that is not in the tone of the ditty sung by the tripe skewer again in his prison            he made na his moan to a stock                he made na it to a stone           but it was to the queen of heaven                that he made his moan  the lines are from a version of the north of scotland and on the face of it are older than the extirpation of the catholic faith in the loyal north  the reference to holy land preserves a touch of the crusading age  in short poor as they may be the scottish versions are those of a people not yet wholly vulgarised not yet lost to romance  the singers have half remembered and half forgot the legend of gilbert becket bekie beichan the father of st thomas of canterbury  gilbert in the legend went to holy land was cast into a saracens prison and won his daughters heart  he escaped but the lady followed him like sophia and like sophia found and wedded him gilberts servant richard playing the part of the proud young porter  yet as professor child justly observes the ballad is not derived from the legend though the legend as to gilbert becket exists in a manuscript of about 1300  the bateman motive is older than gilbert becket and has been attached to later versions of the adventures of that hero  gilbert becket about 1300 was credited with a floating popular tale of the bateman sort and out of his legend thus altered the existing ballads drew their bekie and beichan from the name of becket  the process is  first the popular tale of the return of the old true love that tale is found in greece scandinavia denmark iceland faroe spain germany and so forth  next about 1300 gilbert becket is made the hero of the tale  next our surviving ballads retain a trace or two of the becket form but they are not derived from the becket form  the fancy of the folk first evolved the situations in the story then lent them to written literature beckets legend 1300 and thirdly received the story back from written legend with a slight comparatively modern colouring  in the dispute as to the origin of our ballads one school as mr t f henderson and professor courthope regard them as debris of old literary romances illremembered work of professional minstrels that there are ballads of this kind in england such as the arthurian ballads i do not deny  but in my opinion many ballads and popular tales are in origin older than the mediaeval romances as a rule  as a rule the romances are based on earlier popular data just as the odyssey is an artistic whole made up out of popular tales  the folk may receive back a literary form of its own ballad or story but more frequently the popular ballad comes down in oral tradition side by side with its educated child the literary romance on the same theme  cf the queens marie  mr henderson has answered that the people is unpoetical  the degraded populace of the slums may be unpoetical like the minstrel named tripe skewer and may deprave the ballads of its undegraded ancestry into such modern english forms as lord bateman  but i think of the people which in barbours day had its choirs of peasant girls chanting rural snatches on bruces victories or in still earlier france of rolands overthrow  if their songs are attributed to professional minstrels i turn to the greece of 1830 to the finland of today to the outermost hebrides of today to the arapahoes of northern america to the australian blacks among all of whom the people are their own poets and make their own dirges lullabies chants of victory and laments for defeat  these peoples are not unpoetical  in fact when i say that the people has been its own poet i do not mean the people which goes to music halls and reads halfpenny newspapers  to the true folk we owe the legend of lord bateman in its ancient germs and to the folks degraded modern estate crowded as men are in noisome streets and crushed by labour we owe the cockney depravation the lord bateman of cruikshank and thackeray  even that i presume being old is now forgotten except by the ancient blind woman in the workhouse  to the workhouse has come the native popular culturethe last lingering shadow of old romance  that is the moral of the ballad of lord bateman  in an article by mr kitton in literature june 24 1899 p 699 this learned dickensite says  the authorship of this version cruikshanks of an ancient ballad and of the accompanying notes has given rise to much controversy and whether dickens or thackeray was responsible for them is still a matter of conjecture although what little evidence there is seems to favour thackeray  for the ballad neither thackeray nor dickens is responsible  the old womans text settles that question  the ballad is a degraded volkslied  as to the notes internal evidence for once is explicit the notes are thackerays  any one who doubts has only to compare thackerays notes to his prize poem on timbuctoo  the banter in the notes is academic banter that of a university man who is mocking the notes of learned editors  this humour is not the humour of dickens who however may very well have written the introduction to cruikshanks version  that morceau is in quite a different taste and style  i ought in fairness to add the following note from mr j b keene which may be thought to overthrow belief in thackerays authorship of the notes  dear siryour paper in the cornhill for this month on the mystery of lord bateman interested me greatly but i must beg to differ from you as to the authorship of the notes and for this reason  i have before me a copy of the first edition of the loving ballad which was bought by my father soon after it was issued  at that timesomewhere about 1840there was a frequent visitor at our house named burnett who had married a sister of charles dickens and who gave us the story of its production  he said as you state that cruikshank had got the words from a pot house singer but the locality he named was whitechapel where he was looking out for characters  he added that cruikshank sung or hummed the tune to him and he gave it the musical notation which follows the preface  he also said that charles dickens wrote the notes  his personal connection with the work and his relation to dickens are i think fair evidence on the question  i am dear sir      yours truly           j b keene  kingsmead house 1 hartham road      camden road n feb 131900  mr keenes evidence may perhaps settle the question  but if dickens wrote the introduction that might be confused in mr burnetts memory with the notes from internal evidence the work of thackeray  if not then in the notes we find a new aspect of the inexhaustible humour of dickens  it is certain at all events that neither dickens nor thackeray was the author of the loving ballad  psthe preface to the ballad says battle bridge    xi  the queens marie              little did my mother think                that day she cradled me           what land i was to travel in                or what death i should die  writing to mrs dunlop on january 25 1790 burns quoted these lines in an old scottish ballad which notwithstanding its rude simplicity speaks feelingly to the heart  mr carlyle is said when young to have written them on a pane of glass in a window with a diamond adding characteristically oh foolish thee  in 1802 in the first edition of the border minstrelsy scott cited only three stanzas from the same ballad not including burnss verse but giving            yestreen the queen had four maries                the night shell hae but three           there was marie seaton and marie beaton                and marie carmichael and me  in later editions sir walter offered a madeup copy of the ballad most of it from a version collected by charles kirkpatrick sharpe  it now appeared that mary hamilton was the heroine that she was one of queen maries four maries and that she was hanged for murdering a child whom she bore to darnley  thus the character of mary hamilton was totally lost and darnley certainly had not sufficient for two  darnley to be sure told his father that i never offended the queen my wife in meddling with any woman in thought let be in deed and whether darnley spoke truth or not there was among the queens maries no mary hamilton to meddle with just as there was no mary carmichael  the maries were attendant on the queen as children ever since she left scotland for france  they were mary livingstone mentioned as lady livinston in one version of the ballad who married john sempill called the dancer who says laing acquired the lands of beltree in renfrewshire  child vol iii p 389 laings knox ii 415 note 3  when queen mary was a captive in england she was at odds with the sempill pair about some jewels of hers in their custody  he was not a satisfactory character he died before november 1581  mary fleming early in 1587 married the famous william maitland of lethington being no more fit for her than i to be a page says kirkcaldy of grange  her life was wretched enough through the stormy career and sad death of her lord  mary beaton with whom randolph the english ambassador used to flirt married in 1566 ogilvy of boyne the first love of lady jane gordon the bride of bothwell  mary seaton remained a maiden and busked the queens hair during her english captivity  we last hear of her from james maitland of lethington in 1613 living at rheims very old decrepid and poor  there is no room in the four for mary hamilton and no mention of her appears in the records of the court  how then did mary hamilton find her way into the old ballad about darnley and the queen  to explain this puzzle some modern writers have denied that the ballad of the queens marie is really old they attribute it to the eighteenth century  the antiquary who launched this opinion was scotts not very loyal friend charles kirkpatrick sharpe according to him a certain miss hambledon no christian name is given being maid of honour to the empress catherine of russia had three children by an amour and murdered all three  peter the great caused her to be not hanged but decapitated  sharpe took his facts from a german almanac and says  the russian tragedy must be the original  the late professor child from more authentic documents dates miss hambledons or hamiltons execution on march 14 1719  at that time or nearly then charles wogan was in russia on a mission from the chevalier de st george james iii and through him the news might reach scotland  mr courthope in his history of english poetry followed sharpe and professor child and says  it is very remarkable that one of the very latest of the scottish popular ballads should be one of the very best  the occurrence would not only be remarkable but as far as possibility goes in literature would be impossible for several reasons  one is that neither literary men nor mere garreteers and makers of street ballads appear about 17191730 to have been capable of recapturing the simplicity and charm of the old ballad style at its best or anything near its best  there is no mistaking the literary touch in such ballads as allan ramsay handled or in the imitation named hardyknute  in allans tea table miscellany 1724  it was the first poem i ever learned the last i shall ever forget said scott and misled by boyish affection he deemed it just old enough a noble imitation but the imitation can deceive nobody and while literary imitators as far as their efforts have reached us were impotent to deceive the popular muse of 17141730 was not attempting deception ballads of the eighteenth century were sarcastic as in those on sheriffmuir and in skirvings amusing ballad on preston pans or were mere doggerel or were brief songs to old tunes  they survive in print whether in flying broadsides or in books but popular as is the queens marie in all its many variants child gives no less than eighteen we do not know a single printed example before scotts madeup copy in the border minstrelsy  the latest ballad really in the old popular manner known to me is that of rob roy namely of robin oig and james more sons of rob roy and about their abduction of an heiress in 1752  this is a genuine popular poem but in style and tone and versification it is wholly unlike the queens marie  i scarcely hope that any one can produce after 1680 a single popular piece which could be mistaken for a ballad of or near queen marys time  lockhart i 114 x 138  the known person least unlike mr courthopes late maker was musselmoud charlie leslie an old aberdeenshire minstrel the very last probably of the race says scott  charlie died in 1782  he sang and sold printed ballads  why cannot you sing other songs than those rebellious ones asked a hanoverian provost of aberdeen  oh ay butthey winna buy them said charlie where do you buy them  why faur i get them cheapest  he carried his ballads in a large harden bag hung over his shoulder charlie had tholed prison for prince charles and had seen provost morison drink the princes health in wine and proclaim him regent at the cross of aberdeen  if charlie who lived to be a hundred and two composed the song musselmoud charlie  this sang charlie made hissel then this maker could never have produced the queens marie nor could any maker like him  his ballads were printed as any successful ballad of 1719 would probably have been in broadsides  against mr child and mr courthope then we argue that after 1600 a marked decadence of the old ballad style set in that the old style as far as is known died soon after bothwell brig 1679 in the execrable ballads of both sides such as philiphaugh and that it soon was not only dead as a form in practical use but was entirely superseded by new kinds of popular poetry of which many examples survive and are familiar to every student  how or why then should a poet aiming at popularity about 17191730 compose the queens marie in an obsolete manner the old ballads were still sung indeed but we ask for proof that new ballads were still composed in the ancient fashion  see for example mr macquoids jacobite songs and ballads pp 424 510 with a picture of charlie  secondly why and how tempted would a popular poet of 1719 transfer a modern tragedy of russia to the year 1563 or thereabouts  his public would naturally desire a ballad gazette of the mournful new tale concerning a lass of scottish extraction betrayed tortured beheaded at the faroff court of a muscovite tyrant  the facts palpitated with actuality and since homers day men desire as homer says the new songs on the new events what was gained by going back to queen mary  would a popular musselmoud charlie even know by 1719 the names of the queens maries  mr courthope admits that he may have been helped by some ballad one of those spoken of as we shall see by knox  if that ballad told the existing marian story what did the maker add  if it did not what did he borrow  no more than the names could he borrow and no more than the name hamilton from the russian tragedy could he add  one other thing he might be said to add the verses in which mary asks the jolly sailors not to           let on to my father and mother                but that im coming hame  this passage according to mr courthope was suggested partly by the fact of a scotswoman being executed in russia  c k sharpe also says  if marie hamilton was executed in scotland it is not likely why not that her relations resided beyond seas  they may have been in france like many another hamilton  mr child says  the appeal to the sailors shows that mary hamilton dies in a foreign landnot that of her ancestors  yet the ballad makes her die in or near the canongate  moreover the family of the mary hamilton of 1719 had been settled in russia for generations and were reckoned of the russian noblesse  the verses therefore on either theory are probably out of place and are perhaps an interpolation suggested to some reciter they only occur in some of the many versions by a passage in the twa brithers  child i 439  we now reach the most important argument for the antiquity of the queens marie  mr courthope has theoretically introduced as existing in or after 1719 makers who could imitate to deception the old ballad style  now maidment remarks that this ballad was popular in galloway selkirkshire lanarkshire and aberdeen and the very striking discrepancies go far to remove every suspicion of fabrication  chambers uses 1829 against sharpe the same argument of universal diffusion in scotland  neither mr child nor mr courthope draws the obvious inferences from the extraordinary discrepancies in the eighteen variants  such essential discrepancies surely speak of a long period of oral recitation by men or women accustomed to interpolate alter and add in the true old ballad manner  did such rhapsodists exist after 1719  old charlie for one did not sing or sell the old ballads  again if the ballad as it probably would be in 1719 was printed or even if it was not could the variations have been evolved between 1719 and 1802  these variations are numerous striking and fundamental  in many variants even the name of the heroine does not tally with that of the russian maid of honour  that most important and telling coincidence wholly disappears  in a version of motherwells from dumbartonshire the heroine is mary myle  in a version known to scott minstrelsy 1810 iii 89 note the name is mary miles mr child also finds mary mild mary moil and lady maisry  this maisry is daughter of the duke of york  now the duke of york whom alone the scottish people knew was james stuart later james ii once more the heroine is daughter of the duke of argyll therefore a campbell  or she is without patronymic and is daughter of a lord or knight of the north or south or east and one of her sisters is a barbers wife and her father lives in englandmotherwell she at least might invoke ye mariners mariners mariners  as in scotts first fragment not to carry her story  now we ask whether after the ringing tragedy of miss hamilton in russia in the year of grace 1719 contemporaries who heard the woeful tale could between 1719 and 1820 call the heroine1 hamilton 2 mild moil myle miles 3 make her a daughter of the duke of york or of the duke of argyll or of lords and of knights from all quarters of the compass and sisterinlaw to an english barber also one of the queens servingmaids  we at least cannot accept those numerous and glittering contradictions as corruptions which could be made soon after the russian events when the true old ballad style was dead  we now produce more startling variations  the lover is not only the king the prince darnley the highest stuart o a but he is also that old offender sweet willie or he is warrenston warriston  mary is certainly not hanged the russian woman was beheaded away from her home she dies in edinburgh near the tolbooth the netherbow the canongate and            o what will my three brothers say                when they come hame frae sea           when they see three locks o my yellow hair                hinging under a gallows tree  it is impossible here to give all the variations  mary pulls or does not pull or her lover pulls the leaf of the abbey or savin or other tree the queen is auld or not auld she kicks in marys door and bursts the bolts or does nothing so athletic and inconsistent with her advanced age  the heroine does or does not appeal vainly to her father  her dress is of all varieties  she does or does not go to the tolbooth and other places  she is or is not allured to edinburgh a wedding for to see  her infanticide is variously described or its details are omitted and the dead body of the child is found in various places or not found at all  though drowned in the sea it is between the bolster and the wall or under the blankets  she expects or does not expect to be avenged by her kin  the king is now angry now clementinviting mary to dinner  mary is hanged or buchans ms is not hanged but is ransomed by warrenston probably johnston of warriston  these are a few specimens of variations in point of fact  in language the variations are practically countless  how could they arise if the ballad is later than 1719  we now condescend to appeal to statistics  we have examined the number of variants published by mr child in his first six volumes on ballads which have or may have an historical basis  of course the older and more popular the ballads the more variants do we expect to discovertime and taste producing frequent changes well of otterburn mr child has five versions of the hunting of the cheviot he has two with minor modifications indicated by letters from the lower case  of gude wallace he has eight  of johnnie armstrong he has three  of kinmont willie he has one of the bonnie earl o moray he has two  of johnnie cock he has thirteen  of sir patrick spens he has eighteen  and of the queens marie counting burnss solitary verse and other brief fragments mr child has eighteen versions or variants  thus a ballad made ex hypothesi sharpiana in or after 1719 has been as much altered in oral tradition as the most popular and perhaps the oldest historical ballad of all sir patrick spens and much more than any other of the confessedly ancient semi historical popular poems  the historical event which may have suggested sir patrick spens is plausibly says mr child fixed in 1281  it is the marriage of margaret of scotland to eric king of norway  others suggest so late a date as the wooing of anne of denmark by james vi  nothing is known  no wonder then that in time an orally preserved ballad grows rich in variants  but that a ballad of 1719 should in eighty modern nonballadising years become as rich in extant variants and far more discrepant in their details as sir patrick spens is a circumstance for which we invite explanation  will men say the later the ballad the more it is altered in oral tradition  if so let them by all means produce examples  we should on this theory have about a dozen battles of philiphaugh and at least fifteen bothwell brigs a poem by the way much in the old manner prosaically applied and so recent that in art at least it was produced after the death of the duke of monmouth slain it avers by the machinations of claverhouse  of course we are not asking for exact proportions since many variants of ballads may be lost but merely for proof that the later a ballad is the more variants of it occur  but this contention is probably impossible and the numerous variations in the queens marie are really a proof of long existence in oral tradition and contradict the theory espoused by mr child who later saw the difficulty involved in his hypothesis  this argument though statistical is we think conclusive and the other considerations which we have produced in favour of the antiquity of the queens marie add their cumulative weight  we have been in brief invited to suppose that about 1719 a scot wrote a ballad on an event in contemporary russian court life that contrary to use and wont he threw the story back a century and a half that he was a master of an old style in the practice of his age utterly obsolete and not successfully imitated that his poem became universally popular and underwent in eighty years even more vicissitudes than most other ballads encounter in three or five centuries  meanwhile it is certain that there had been real ancient ballads contemporary with the marian eventsballads on the very maries two or three of whom appear in the socalled poem of 1719 while exactly the same sort of scandal as the ballad records had actually occurred at queen marys court in a lower social rank  the theory of mr child is opposed to our whole knowledge of ballad literature of its age decadence about 16201700 and decease in the old kind as a popular art  to agree with mr child we must not only accept one great ballad poet born at least fifty years too late we must not only admit that such a poet would throw back his facts for a century and a half but we must also conceive that the balladising humour with its ancient methods was even more vivacious in scotland for many years after 1719 than as far as we know it had ever been before yet there is no other trace known to us of the existence of the old balladising humour and of the old art in all that period  we have no such ballad about the english captain shot by the writers pretty wife none about the bewitched son of lord torphichen none about the old chevalier or lochiel or prince charlie  we have merely shenstones jemmy dawson and the glasgow bellmans rhymed history of prince charles  in fact jemmy dawson is a fair instantia contradictoria as far as a ballad by a man of letters is to the point  such a ballad that age could indeed produce  it is not very like the queens marie  no we cannot take refuge in townleys ghost and his address to the butcher cumberland            imbrued in bliss imbathed in case                though now thou seemst to lie           my injured form shall gall thy peace                and make thee wish to die  that is a ballad of the eighteenth century and it is not in the manner of the queens marie  these considerations now so obvious to a student of the art of old popular poetry if he thinks of the matter could not occur to charles kirkpatrick sharpe  he was a great collector of ballads but not versed in or interested in their aestheticin the history and evolution of balladmaking  mr child on the other hand was the grimm or kohler of popular english and scottish poetry  our objections to his theory could scarcely have been collected in such numbers without the aid of his own assortment of eighteen versions or fragments with more lectiones variae  but he has not allowed for the possible the constantly occurring chance of coincidence between fancy and fact nor perhaps has he reflected on the changed condition of ballad poetry in the eighteenth century on the popular love of a new song about a new event and on the entire lack of evidence as far as i am aware for the existence of balladpoets in the old manner during the reign of george i  the balladreading public of 1719 would have revelled in a fresh ballad of a scottish lass recently betrayed tortured and slain far away by a russian tyrant  a fresh ballad on queen marys court done in the early obsolete manner would on the other hand have had comparatively little charm for the balladbuying lieges in 1719  the balladpoet had thus in 1719 no temptation to be archaistic like mr rossetti and to sing of old times  he had on the contrary every inducement to indite a rare new ballad on the last tragic scandal with its poignant details as of peter kissing the dead girls head  the hypothesis of mr child could only be demonstrated incorrect by proving that there was no russian scandal at all or by producing a printed or manuscript copy of the queens marie older than 1719 we can do neither of these things we can only give the reader his choice of two improbabilitiesa that an historical event in 171819 chanced to coincide with the topic of an old ballad b that contrary to all we know of the evolution of ballads and the state of taste a new popular poem on a fresh theme was composed in a style long disused was offered most successfully to the public of 1719 and in not much more than half a century was more subjected to alterations and interpolations than ballads which for two or three hundred years had run the gauntlet of oral tradition  a learned scots antiquary writes to me  the real ballad manner hardly came down to 1600  it was killed by the francis roos version of the psalms after which the scottish folk of the lowlands cast everything into that mould  i think however that bothwell brig is a true survival of the ancient style and there are other examples as in the case of the ballad on lady warristons husband murder  as for our own explanation of the resemblance between the affair of miss hamilton in 1719 and the ballad story of mary hamilton alias mild myle moil campbell miles or stuart or anonymous or lady maisry we simply with scott regard it as a very curious coincidence  on the other theory on mr childs it is also a curious coincidence that a waitingwoman of mary stuart was hanged not beheaded for childmurder and that there were written simultaneously ballads on the queens maries  much odder coincidences than either have often and indisputably occurred and it is not for want of instances but for lack of space that we do not give examples  turning now to a genuine historic scandal of queen marys reign we find that it might have given rise to the many varying forms of the ballad of the queens marie  there is practically no such ballad that is among the many variants we cannot say which comes nearest to the original lay of the frail maid and her doom  all the variants are full of historical impossibilities due to the lapses of memory and the wandering fancy of reciters altering and interpolating through more than two centuries an original of which nothing can now be known  the fancy if not of the first ballad poet who dealt with a real tragic event at least of his successors in many corners of scotland raised the actors and sufferers in a sad story elevating a french waitingmaid to the rank of a queens marie and her lover a french apothecary to the place of a queens consort or at lowest of a scottish laird  at the time of the general assembly which met on christmas day 1563 a french waitingmaid of mary stuart ane frenche woman that servit in the queenis chalmer fell into sin with the queenis awin hipoticary  the father and mother slew the child and were dampned to be hangit upoun the publict streit of edinburgh  no official report exists  the records of the court of justiciary at this time are defective says maidment and he conjectures that the accused may have been hanged without trial redhand  now the queens apothecary must have left traces in the royal accountbooks no writer on the subject has mentioned them  i myself have had the records of privy council and the ms treasurers accounts examined with their statement of the expenses of the royal household  the rev john anderson was kind enough to undertake this task though with less leisure than he could have desired  there is unluckily a gap of some months in 1563  in june 1560 mr anderson finds mention of a medicinar apoticarre apotigar but no name is given and the queen was then in france  one nicholas wardlaw of the royal household was engaged in 1562 to a miss seton of parbroath but it needed a special royal messenger to bring the swain to the altar  ane appotigar of 1562 is mentioned but not named and we hear of robert henderson chirurgeon who supplied powders and odours to embalm huntley  there is no trace of the hanging of any appotigar or of any one of the queens women the maidans spoken of collectively  so far the search for the apothecary has been a failure  more can be learned from randolphs letter to cecil december 31 1563 here copied from the ms in the public record office  the austerity of marys court under mr knox is amusingly revealed  for newes yt maye please your honour to knowe that the lord treasurer of scotlande for gettinge of a woman with chylde muste vpon sondaye nexte do open penance before the whole congregation and mr knox mayke the sermonde  thys my lord of murraye wylled me to wryte vnto you for a note of our greate severitie in punyshynge of offenders  the frenche potticarie and the woman he gotte with chylde were bothe hanged thys present fridaye  thys hathe made myche sorrowe in our courte  maynie evle fortunes we have had by our frenche fowlkes and yet i feare we love them over well  after recording the condemnation of the waitingwoman and her lover knox tells a false story about shame hastening the marriage of mary livingstone  dr robertson in his inventories of queen mary refutes this slander which he deems as baseless as the fables against knoxs own continence  knox adds  what bruit the maries and the rest of the danseris of the courte had the ballads of that age did witness quhilk we for modesteis sake omit unlucky omission unfortunate modestei  from randolphs letters it is known that knox at this date was thundering against danseris  here then is a tale of the queens french waiting woman hanged for murder and here is proof that there actually were ballads about the queens maries  these ladies as we know from keith were from the first in the queens childhood mary livingstone mary seatoun mary beatoun and mary fleming  we have then a childmurder by a woman of the queen we have ballads about her maries and as scott says the tale has suffered great alterations as handed down by tradition the french waiting woman being changed into mary hamilton and the queens apothecary into henry darnley who as mr child shows was not even in scotland in 1563  but gross perversion of contemporary facts does not prove a ballad to be late or apocryphal  mr child even says that accuracy in a ballad would be very suspicious  thus for example we know from contemporary evidence that the murder of the bonny earl murray in 1592 by huntley was at once made the topic of ballads  of these aytoun and mr child print two widely different in details  in the first huntley has married murrays sister in the second murray is the lover of the queen of james vi both statements are picturesque but the former is certainly and the latter is probably untrue  again king james and brown in the percy ms is accepted as a genuine contemporary ballad of the youth of gentle king jamie  james is herein made to say to his nobles           my grandfather you have slaine           and my own mother you hanged on a tree  even if we read father against the manuscript this is absurd james v was not slaine neither darnley nor mary was hanged on a tree  ballads are always inaccurate they do not report events so much as throw into verse the popular impression of events the magnified distorted dramatic rumours  that a balladwriter should promote a queens tirewoman into a queens marie and substitute darnley where he is the lover which is not always for the queens apothecary is a license quite in keeping with precedent  mr child obviously would admit this  in producing a marie who never existed the maker shows the same delicacy as voltaire when he brings into candide a pope who never was born  finally a fragment of a variant of the ballad among the abbotsford mss does mention an apothecary as the lover of the heroine and so far is true to historical fact whether the author was well informed or merely in the multitude of variations deviated by chance into truth  there can on the whole be no reasonable doubt that the ballad is on an event in scotland of 1563 not of 1719 in russia and mr child came to hold that this opinion was at least the more probable  child vol iv p 509 ibid vol v pp 298 299    xii  the shakespearebacon imbroglio    the hypothesis that the works of shakespeare were written by bacon has now been before the world for more than forty years  it has been supported in hundreds of books and pamphlets but as a rule it has been totally neglected by scholars  perhaps their indifference may seem wise for such an opinion may appear to need no confutation  there are foolisher fellows than the baconians says a sagethose who argue against them  on the other hand ignorance has often cherished beliefs which science has been obliged reluctantly to admit  the existence of meteorites and the phenomena of hypnotism were familiar to the ancient world and to modern peasants while philosophy disdained to investigate them  in fact it is never really prudent to overlook a widely spread opinion  if we gain nothing else by examining its grounds at least we learn something about the psychology of its advocates  in this case we can estimate the learning the logic and the general intellect of people who form themselves into baconian societies to prove that the poems and plays of shakespeare were written by bacon thus a light is thrown on the nature and origin of popular delusions  1 bacon and shakespeare by william henry smith 1857 2 the authorship of shakespeare by nathaniel holmes 1875 3 the great cryptogram by ignatius donnelly 1888 4 the promus of formularies and elegancies of francis bacon by mrs henry pott 1883 5 william shakespeare by georg brandes 1898 6 shakespeare by sidney lee in the dictionary of national biography 1897 7 shakespeare dethroned in pearsons magazine december 1897 8 the hidden lives of shakespeare and bacon by w g thorpe fsa 1897 9 the mystery of william shakespeare by judge webb 1902  the baconian creed of course is scouted equally by special students of bacon special students of shakespeare and by almost all persons who devote themselves to sound literature  it is equally rejected by mr spedding the chief authority on bacon by mr h h furness the learned and witty american editor of the variorum shakespeare by dr brandes the danish biographer and critic by mr swinburne with his rare knowledge of elizabethan and indeed of all literature and by mr sidney lee shakespeares latest biographer  therefore the first point which strikes us in the baconian hypothesis is that its devotees are nobly careless of authority  we do not dream of converting them but it may be amusing to examine the kind of logic and the sort of erudition which go to support an hypothesis not freely welcomed even in germany  the mother of the baconian theory though others had touched a guess at it was undeniably miss delia bacon born at tallmadge ohio in 1811  miss bacon used to lecture on roman history illustrating her theme by recitations from macaulays lays  her very heart was lacerated says mr donnelly and her womanly pride wounded by a creature in the shape of a mana reverend  alexander macwhorter  this celtic divine was twentyfive miss bacon was thirtyfive there arose a misunderstanding but miss bacon had developed her baconian theory before she knew mr macwhorter  she became a monomaniac on the subject writes mr wyman and after the publication and nonsuccess of her book she lost her reason wholly and entirely  but great wits jump and just as mr darwin and mr wallace simultaneously evolved the idea of natural selection so unconscious of miss delia mr william henry smith developed the baconian verity  from the days of mr william henry smith in 1856 the great baconian argument has been that shakespeare could not conceivably have had the vast learning classical scientific legal medical and so forth of the author of the plays  bacon on the other hand and nobody else had this learning and had though he concealed them the poetic powers of the unknown author  therefore prima facie bacon wrote the works of shakespeare  mr smith as we said had been partly anticipated here by the unlucky miss delia bacon to whose vast and wandering book mr hawthorne wrote a preface  mr hawthorne accused mr smith of plagiarism from miss delia bacon mr smith replied that when he wrote his first essay 1856 he had never even heard the ladys name  mr hawthorne expressed his regret and withdrew his imputation  mr smith is the second founder of baconomania  like his followers down to mr ignatius donnelly and mr bucke and general butler and mr atkinson who writes in the spiritualist and mrs gallup and judge webb mr smith rested first on shakespeares lack of education and on the wide learning of the author of the poems and plays  now ben jonson who knew both shakespeare and bacon averred that the former had small latin and less greek doubtless with truth  it was necessary therefore to prove that the author of the plays had plenty of latin and greek here mr john churton collins suggests that ben meant no more than that shakespeare was not in the strict sense a scholar  yet he might read latin mr collins thinks with ease and pleasure and might pick out the sense of greek books by the aid of latin translations  to this view we return later  meanwhile we shall compare the assertions of the laborious mr holmes the american author of the authorship of shakespeare third edition 1875 and of the ingenious mr donnelly the american author of the great cryptogram  both alas derive in part from the ignorance of pope  pope had said  shakespeare follows the greek authors and particularly dares phrygius  mr smith cites this nonsense so do mr donnelly and mr holmes  now the socalled dares phrygius is not a greek author  no greek version of his early mediaeval romance de bello trojano exists the matter of the book found its way into chaucer boccaccio lydgate guido de colonna and other authors accessible to one who had no greek at all while no greek version of dares was accessible to anybody  some recent authors english and american have gone on with the credulity of the less than half educated taking a greek dares for granted on the authority of pope whose greek was small  they have clearly never looked at a copy of dares never known that the story attributed to dares was familiar in english and french to everybody  mr holmes quotes pope mr donnelly quotes mr holmes for this greek dares phrygius  probably shakespeare had latin enough to read the pseudodares but probably he did not take the trouble  see brandes william shakespeare ii 198202  this example alone proves that men who are not scholars venture to pronounce on shakespeares scholarship and that men who take absurd statements at second hand dare to constitute themselves judges of a question of evidence and of erudition  the worthy mr donnelly then quotes mr holmes for shakespeares knowledge of the greek drama  turning to mr holmes who takes his motto if you please from parmenides we find that the author of richard ii  borrowed from a greek play by euripides called hellene as did the author of the sonnets  there is we need not say no greek play of the name of hellene  as mr holmes may conceivably mean the helena of euripides we compare sonnet cxxi with helena line 270  the parallel the imitation of euripides appears to be            by their dark thoughts my deeds must not be shown  with            prooton men ouk ons adikoz eimi duskleez  which means i have lost my reputation though i have done no harm shakespeare then could not complain of calumny without borrowing from hellene a name which only exists in the fancy of mr nathaniel holmes  this critic assigns richard ii act ii scene 1 to hellene 512514  we can find no resemblance whatever between the three greek lines cited from the helena and the scene in shakespeare  mr holmes appears to have reposed on malone and malone may have remarked on fugitive resemblances such as inevitably occur by coincidence of thought  thus the similarity of the situations of hamlet and of orestes in the eumenides is given by similarity of legend danish and greek  authors of genius greek or english must come across analogous ideas in treating analogous topics  it does not follow that the poet of hamlet was able to read aeschylus least of all that he could read him in greek  anglicised version of the authors original greek text  the comedy of errors is based on the menaechmi of plautus  it does not follow that the author of the comedy of errors could read the menaechmi or the amphitryon though shakespeare had probably latin enough for the purpose  the comedy of errors was acted in december 1594  a translation of the latin play bears date 1595 but this may be an example of the common practice of postdating a book by a month or two and shakespeare may have seen the english translation in the work itself in proof or in manuscript  in those days mss often circulated long before they were published like shakespeares own sugared sonnets  however it is highly probable that shakespeare was equal to reading the latin of plautus  in twelfth night occurs  like the egyptian thief at point of death kill what i love  mr donnelly writes  this is an allusion to a story from heliodoruss aethiopica  i do not know of any english translation of it in the time of shakespeare  the allusion is we conceive to herodotus ii 121 the story of rhampsinitus translated by b r and published in 1584  in macbeth we find            all our yesterdays have lighted fools           the way to dusty death  out out brief candle  this is traced says mr donnelly to catullus  he quotes            soles occidere et redire possunt           nobis cum semel occidit brevis lux           nox est perpetuo una dormienda  where is the parallel  it is got by translating catullus thus            the lights of heaven go out and return           when once our brief candle goes out           one night is to be perpetually slept  but soles are not lights and brevis lux is not brief candle if they were the passages have no resemblance  to be or not to be is taken almost verbatim from plato  mr donnelly says that mr follett says that the messrs langhorne say so  but where is the passage in plato  such are the proofs by which men ignorant of the classics prove that the author of the poems attributed to shakespeare was a classical scholar  in fact he probably had a practicable knowledge of latin such as a person of his ability might pick up at school and increase by casual study  points to which we return  for the rest classical lore had filtered into contemporary literature and translations such as norths plutarch  as to modern languages mr donnelly decides that shakespeare knew danish because he must have read saxo grammaticus in the original tonguewhich of course is not danish  saxo was done out of the latin into french  thus shakespeare is not exactly proved to have been a danish scholar  there is no difficulty in supposing that a clayver man living among wits could pick up french and italian sufficient for his uses  but extremely stupid people are naturally amazed by even such commonplace acquirements  when the step is made from cleverness to genius then the dull disbelieve or cry out of a miracle  now as miracles do not happen a man of shakespeares education could not have written the plays attributed to him by his critics companions friends and acquaintances  shakespeare ex hypothesi was a rude unlettered fellow  such a man the baconians assume would naturally be chosen by bacon as his mask and put forward as the author of bacons pieces  bacon would select a notorious ignoramus as a plausible author of pieces which by the theory are rich in knowledge of the classics and nobody would be surprised  nobody would say  shakespeare is as ignorant as a butchers boy and cannot possibly be the person who translated hamlets soliloquy out of plato hamlet at large out of the danish who imitated the hellene of euripides and borrowed troilus and cressida from the greek of dares phrygiuswhich happens not to exist  ignorance can go no further than in these arguments  such are the logic and learning of american amateurs who sometimes do not even know the names of the books they talk about or the languages in which they are written  such learning and such logic are passed off by the less than half educated on the absolutely untaught who decline to listen to scholars  we cannot of course furnish a complete summary of all that the baconians have said in their myriad pages  all those pages almost really flow from the little volume of mr smith  we are obliged to take the points which the baconians regard as their strong cards we have dealt with the point of classical scholarship and shown that the american partisans of bacon are not scholars and have no locus standi  we shall take next in order the contention that bacon was a poet that his works contain parallel passages to shakespeare which can only be the result of common authorship that bacons notes called promus are notes for shakespeares plays that in style bacon and shakespeare are identical  then we shall glance at bacons motives for writing plays by stealth and blushing to find it fame  we shall expose the frank folly of averring that he chose as his mask a man who some assert could not even write and we shall conclude by citing once more the irrefragable personal testimony to the genius and character of shakespeare  to render the baconian theory plausible it is necessary to show that bacon had not only the learning needed for the authorship of shakespeare but that he gives some proof of shakespeares poetic qualities that he had reasons for writing plays and reasons for concealing his pen and for omitting to make any claim to his own literary triumphs after shakespeare was dead  now as to scholarship the knowledge shown in the plays is not that of a scholar does not exceed that of a man of genius equipped with what to ben jonson seemed small latin and less greek and with abundance of translations and books like euphues packed with classical lore to help him  with the futile attempts to prove scholarship we have dealt  the legal and medical lore is in no way beyond the general information which genius inevitably amasses from reading conversation reflection and experience  a writer of today mr kipling is fond of showing how easily a man of his rare ability picks up the terminology of many recondite trades and professions  again evidence taken on oath proves that jeanne darc a girl of seventeen developed great military skill especially in artillery and tactics that she displayed political clairvoyance and that she held her own and more among the subtlest and most hostile theologians  on the ordinary hypothesis that shakespeare was a man of genius there is then nothing impossible in his knowledge while his wildly daring anachronisms could have presented no temptation to a wellregulated scientific intellect like that of bacon  the baconian hypothesis rests on the incredulity with which dulness regards genius  we see the phenomenon every day when stupid people talk about people of ordinary cleverness and wonder with a foolish face of praise  as dr brandes remarks when the archbishop of canterbury praises henry v and his universal accomplishments he says            which is a wonder how his grace should glean it           since his addiction was to courses vain           his companies unletterd rude and shallow           his hours filld up with riots banquets sports           and never noted in him any study           any retirement any sequestration           from open haunts and popularity  yet as the archbishop remarks with doubtful orthodoxy miracles are ceased  shakespeare in these lines describes as only he could describe it the worlds wonder which he himself was  or if bacon wrote the lines then bacon unlike his advocates was prepared to recognise the possible existence of such a thing as genius  incredulity on this head could only arise in an age and in peoples where mediocrity is almost universal  it is a democratic form of disbelief  for the hypothesis as we said it is necessary to show that bacon possessed poetic genius  the proof cannot possibly be found in his prose works  in the prose of mr ruskin there are abundant examples of what many respectable minds regard as poetic qualities  but if the question arose was mr ruskin the author of tennysons poems the answer could be settled for once by internal evidence  we have only to look at mr ruskins published verses  these prove that a great writer of poetical prose may be at the opposite pole from a poet  in the same way we ask what are bacons acknowledged compositions in verse  mr holmes is their admirer  in 1599 bacon wrote in a letter though i profess not to be a poet i prepared a sonnet to queen elizabeth  he prepared a sonnet  prepared is good  he also translated some of the psalms into verse a field in which success is not to be won  mr holmes notes in psalm xc a shakespearean parallel  we spend our years as a tale that is told  bacon renders            as a tale told which sometimes men attend           and sometimes not our life steals to an end  in king john iii 4 we read            life is as tedious as a twicetold tale           vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man  now if we must detect a connection bacon might have read king john in the folio for he versified the psalms in 1625  but it is unnecessary to suppose a reminiscence  again in psalm civ bacon has            the greater navies look like walking woods  they looked like nothing of the sort but bacon may have remembered birnam wood either from boece or holinshed or from the play itself  one thing is certain  shakespeare did not write bacons psalms or compare navies to walking woods  mr holmes adds many of the sonnets of shakespeare show the strongest internal evidence that they were addressed by bacon to the queen as no doubt they were  that is bacon wrote sonnets to queen elizabeth and permitted them to pass from hand to hand among shakespeares private friends as shakespeares 1598  that was an odd way of paying court to queen elizabeth  chalmers had already conjectured that shakespeare not bacon in the sonnets was addressing the virgin queen whom he recommended to marry and leave offspring rather late in life  shakespeares apparent allusions to his profession                      i have gone here and there           and made myself a motley to the view  and            the public means which public manners breeds  refer no doubt to bacons versatile political behaviour  it has hitherto been supposed that sonnet lvii was addressed to shakespeares friend a man not to any woman  but mr holmes shows that the queen is intended  is it not obvious            i my sovereign watch the clock for you  bacon clearly had an assignation with her majestyso here is scandal about queen elizabeth  mr holmes pleasingly remarks that twickenham is within sight of her majestys palace of white hall she gave bacon the reversion of twickenham park doubtless that from the windows of white hall she might watch her swain  and bacon wrote a masque for the queen he skilfully varied his style in this piece from that which he used under the name of shakespeare with a number of other gentlemen some named some unnamed bacon once at an uncertain date interested himself in a masque at grays inn while he and his friends partly devised dumb shows and additional speeches in 1588  nothing follows as to bacons power of composing shakespeares plays  a fragmentary masque which may or may not be by bacon is put forward as the germ of what bacon wrote about elizabeth in the midsummer nights dream  an indian wanderer from the west indies near the fountain of the amazon is brought to elizabeth to be cured of blindness  now the fairy in the midsummer nights dream says capitalised by mr holmes            i do wander everywhere  here then are two wanderersand there is a river in monmouth and a river in macedon  puck also is that merry wanderer of the night  then a bouncing amazon is mentioned in the midsummer nights dream and the fountain of the great river of the amazons is alluded to in the fragment of the masque  cupid too occurs in the play and in the masque the wanderer is blind now cupid is blind sometimes but hardly when a certain aim he took  the indian in the masque presents elizabeth with his gift and property to be ever young and the herb in the play has a virtuous property  for such exquisite reasons as these the masque and the midsummer nights dream are by one hand and the masque is by bacon  for some unknown cause the play is full of poetry which is entirely absent from the masque  mr holmes was a judge sat on the bench of american themisand these are his notions of proof and evidence the parallel passages which he selects are on a level with the other parallels between bacon and shakespeare  one thing is certain  the writer of the masque shows no signs of being a poet and a poet bacon explicitly did not profess to be  one piece of verse attributed to bacon a loose paraphrase of a greek epigram has won its way into the golden treasury  apart from that solitary composition the verses which bacon prepared were within the powers of almost any educated elizabethan  they are on a level with the rhymes of mr ruskin  it was only when he wrote as shakespeare that bacon wrote as a poet  we have spoken somewhat harshly of mr holmes as a classical scholar and as a judge of what in literary matters makes evidence  we hasten to add that he could be convinced of error  he had regarded a sentence of bacons as a veiled confession that bacon wrote richard ii which though it grew from me went after about in others names  mr spedding averred that mr holmess opinion rested on a grammatical misinterpretation and mr holmes accepted the correction  but nothing less than a miracle could shake mr holmess belief in the common authorship of the masque possibly bacons and the midsummer nights dreamso he told mr spedding  to ourselves nothing short of a miracle or the visitation of god in the shape of idiocy could bring the conviction that the person who wrote the masque could have written the play the reader may compare the whole passage in mr holmess work pp 228238  we have already set forth some of those bases of his belief which only a miracle could shake  the weak wind that scarcely bids the aspen shiver might blow them all away  vast space is allotted by baconians to parallel passages in bacon and shakespeare  we have given a few in the case of the masque and the midsummer nights dream  the others are of equal weight they are on a level with punchs proofs that alexander smith was a plagiarist  thus smith            no character that servant woman asked  pope writes            most women have no character at all  it is tedious to copy out the puerilities of such parallelisms thus bacon            if we simply looked to the fabric of the world  shakespeare            and like the baseless fabric of a vision  bacon            the intellectual light in the top and consummation of thy workmanship  shakespeare            like eyasses that cry out on the top of the question  myriads of pages of such matter would carry no proof  probably the hugest collection of such parallels is that preserved by mrs pott in bacons promus a book of 628 pages  mrs potts sole object in publishing was to confirm the growing belief in bacons authorship of the plays  having acquired the opinion she laboured to strengthen herself and others in the faith  the socalled promus is a manuscript set of notes quotations formulae and proverbs  as mr spedding says there are forms of compliment application excuse repartee etc  the collection is from books which were then in every scholars hands  the proverbs may all or nearly all be found in the common collections  mrs pott remarks that in promus are several hundreds of notes of which no trace has been discovered in the acknowledged writings of bacon or of any other contemporary writer but shakespeare  she adds that the theory of close intercourse between the two men is contrary to all evidence  she then infers that bacon alone wrote all the plays and sonnets which are attributed to shakespeare  so bacon entrusted his plays and the dread secret of his authorship to a boorish cabotin with whom he had no close intercourse  this is ladys logic a contradiction in terms  the theory that bacon wrote the plays and sonnets inevitably implies the closest intercourse between him and shakespeare  they must have been in constant connection  but as mrs pott truly says this is contrary to all evidence  perhaps the best way to deal with mrs pott is to cite the author of her preface dr abbott  he is not convinced but he is much struck by a very exquisite argument of the ladys  bacon in promus is writing down formularies and elegancies modes of salutation  he begins with good morrow  this original remark mrs pott reckons occurs in the plays nearly a hundred times  in the list of upwards of six thousand words in appendix e good morrow has been noted thirtyone times     good morrow may have become familiar merely by means of romeo and juliet  dr abbott is so struck by this valuable statement that he writes  there remains the question why did bacon think it worth while to write down in a notebook the phrase good morrow if it was at that time in common use  bacon wrote down good morrow just because it was in common use all the formulae were in common use probably golden sleepe was a regular wish like good rest  bacon is making a list of commonplaces about beginning the day about getting out of bed about sleep  some are in english some in various other languages he is not as in mrs potts ingenious theory making notes of novelties to be introduced through his plays  he is cataloguing the commonplace  it is mrs potts astonishing contention as we have seen that bacon probably introduced the phrase good morrow  mr bucke following her in a magazine article says  these forms of salutation were not in use in england before bacons time and it was his entry of them in the promus and use of them in the plays that makes them current coin day by day with us in the nineteenth century  this is ignorant nonsense  good morrow and good night were as familiar before bacon or shakespeare wrote as good morning and good night are today  this we can demonstrate  the very first elizabethan handbook of phrases which we consult shows that good morrow was the stock phrase in regular use in 1583  the book is the french littelton a most easie perfect and absolute way to learne the frenche tongue  set forth by claudius holyband imprinted at london by thomas vautrollier dwelling in the blacke friers 1583 there is an edition of 1566  on page 10 we read           of scholars and schoole  god give you good morrow sir  good morrow gossip  good morrow my she gossip  god give you a good morrow and a good year  thus the familiar salutation was not introduced by bacon it was on the other hand the very first formula which a writer of an english french phrasebook translated into french ten years before bacon made his notes  presently he comes to good evening good night good rest and so on  this fact annihilates mrs potts contention that bacon introduced good morrow through the plays falsely attributed to shakespeare there follows in promus a string of proverbs salutations and quotations about sleep and waking  among these occur golden sleepe no 1207 and no 1215 uprouse  you are up  now friar laurence says to romeo            but where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain           doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign           therefore thy earliness doth me assure           thou art uproused by some distemperature  dr abbott writes  mrs potts belief is that the play is indebted for these expressions to the promus mine is that the promus is borrowed from the play  and why should either owe anything to the other  the phrase uprouse or uprose is familiar in chaucer from one of his bestknown lines  golden is a natural poetic adjective of excellence from homer to tennyson  yet in dr abbotts opinion two of these entries constitute a coincidence amounting almost to a demonstration that either shakespeare or bacon borrowed from the other  and this because each writer one in making notes of commonplaces on sleep the other in a speech about sleep uses the regular expression uprouse and the poetical commonplace golden sleep for good rest  there was no originality in the matter  we have chosen dr abbotts selected examples of mrs potts triumphs  here is another of her parallels  bacon gives the formula i pray god your early rising does you no hurt shakespeare writes                      go you cotquean go           get you to bed faith youll be sick tomorrow           for this nights watching  here bacon notes a morning salutation i hope you are none the worse for early rising while shakespeare tells somebody not to sit up late  therefore and for similar reasons bacon is shakespeare  we are not surprised to find mr bucke adopting mrs potts theory of the novelty of good morrow  he writes in the christmas number of an illustrated sixpenny magazine and his article a really masterly compendium of the whole baconian delirium addresses its natural public  but we are amazed to find dr abbott looking not too unkindly on such imbecilities and marching at least in the direction of coventry with such a regiment  he is on one point a convert to mrs pott and that point is the business of good morrow uprouse and golden sleepe  it need hardly be added that the intrepid mr donnelly is also a firm adherent of mrs pott  some idea he says may be formed of the marvellous industry of this remarkable lady when i state that to prove that we are indebted to bacon for having enriched the english language through the plays with these beautiful courtesies of speech good morrow good day etc she carefully examined six thousand works anterior to or contemporary with bacon  dr abbott thought it judicious to hedge about these six thousand works and await the allknowing dictionary of dr murray and the clarendon press  we have deemed it simpler to go to the first elizabethan phrasebook on our shelves and that tiny volume in its very first phrase shatters the maresnest of mrs pott mr donnelly and mr bucke  but why being a great poet should bacon conceal the fact and choose as a mask a man whom on the hypothesis of his ignorance every one that knew him must have detected as an impostor  now one great author did choose to conceal his identity though he never shifted the burden of the waverley novels on to terry the actor bacon may conceivably have had scotts pleasure in secrecy but bacon selected a mask much more impossible on the theory than terry would have been for scott  again sir walter scott took pains to make his identity certain by an arrangement with constable and by preserving his manuscripts and he finally confessed  bacon never confessed and no documentary traces of his authorship survive  scott writing anonymously quoted his own poems in the novels an obvious blind  bacon less crafty never as far as we are aware mentions shakespeare  it is arguable of course that to write plays might seem dangerous to bacons professional and social position  the reasons which might make a lawyer keep his dramatic works a secret could not apply to lucrece  a lawyer of good birth if he wrote plays at all would certainly not vamp up old stock pieces  that was the work of a johannes factotum of a shakescene as greene says of a man who occupied the same position in his theatrical company as nicholas nickleby did in that of mr crummles  nicholas had to bring in the vulgar pony the phenomenon the buckets and so forth  so in early years the author of the plays bacon by the theory had to work over old pieces  all this is the work of the hack of a playing company it is not work to which a man in bacons position could stoop  why should he  what had he to gain by patching and vamping certainly not money if the wealth of shakespeare is a dark mystery to the baconian theorists  we are asked to believe that bacon for the sake of some five or six pounds toiled at refashioning old plays and handed the fair manuscripts to shakespeare who passed them off among the actors who knew him intimately as his own they detected no incongruity between the player who was their johannes factotum and the plays which he gave in to the manager they seemed to be just the kind of work which shakespeare would be likely to write  be likely to write but the father of the rest mr smith believed that shakespeare could not write at all  we live in the ages of faith of faith in fudge  mr smith was certain and mr bucke is inclined to suspect that when bacon wanted a mask he chose as a plausible author of the plays a man who could not write  mr smith was certain and mr bucke must deem it possible that shakespeares enemy greene that his friends jonson burbage heming and the other actors and that his critics and admirers francis meres and others accepted as author of the pieces which they played in or applauded a man who could write no more than his name  such was the tool whom bacon found eligible and so easily gulled was the literary world of eliza and our james and bacon took all this trouble for what reason  to gain five or six pounds or as much of that sum as shakespeare would let him keep  had bacon been possessed by the ambition to write plays he would always have written original dramas he would not have assumed the part of nicholas nickleby  there is no human nature in this nonsense  an ambitious lawyer passes his nights in retouching stock pieces from which he can reap neither fame nor profit  he gives his work to a secondrate illiterate actor who adopts it as his own  bacon is so enamoured of this method that he publishes venus and adonis and lucrece under the name of his actor friend  finally he commits to the actors care all his sonnets to the queen to gloriana and for years these manuscript poems are handed about by shakespeare as his own among the actors hack scribblers and gay young nobles of his acquaintance  they chaff shakespeare about his affection for his sovereign great glorianas praises are stained with sack in taverns and perfumed with the indian weed  and bacon careful toiler after court favour thinks it all wery capital in the words of mr weller pere  moreover nobody who hears shakespeare talk and sees him smile has any doubt that he is the author of the plays and amorous fancies of bacon  it is needless to dwell on the pother made about the missing manuscripts of shakespeare  the original manuscripts of course bacon would take care to destroy says mr holmes if determined that the secret should die with him  if he was so determined for what earthly reason did he pass his valuable time in vamping up old plays and writing new ones  there was no money in it and there was no reason  but if he was not determined that the secret should die with him why did not he like scott preserve the manuscripts the manuscripts are where marlowes and where molieres are by virtue of a like neglect  where are the mss of any of the great elizabethans  we really cannot waste time over mr donnellys theory of a great cryptogram inserted by bacon as proof of his claim in the multitudinous errors of the folio  mr bucke too has his anagram the deathless discovery of dr platt of lakewood new jersey  by manipulating the scraps of latin in loves labours lost he extracts hi ludi tuiti sibi fr bacono nati  these plays entrusted to themselves proceeded from fr bacon  it is magnificent but it is not latin  had bacon sent in such latin at school he would never have survived to write the novum organon and his sonnets to queen elizabeth  in that stern age they would have killed himwith wopping  that bacon should be a vamper and a playwright for no appreciable profit that having produced his deathless works he should make no sign has in fact staggered even the great credulity of baconians  he must they think have made a sign in cipher  out of the mass of the plays anagrams and cryptograms can be fashioned a plaisir and the world has heard too much of mrs gallup while the hunt for hints in contemporary frontispieces led to mistaking the porcupine of sidneys crest for a hanged hog bacon  the theory of the baconian authorship of shakespeares plays and poems has its most notable and recent british advocate in his honour judge webb sometime fellow of trinity college dublin regius professor of laws and public orator in the university of dublin judge webb as a scholar and a man used to weighing evidence puts the case at its strongest  his work the mystery of william shakespeare 1902 rests much on the old argument about the supposed ignorance of shakespeare and the supposed learning of the author of the plays  judge webb like his predecessors does not take into account the wide diffusion of a kind of classical and pseudoscientific knowledge among all elizabethan writers and bases theories on manifest misconceptions of shakespearean and other texts  his book however has affected the opinions of some readers who do not verify his references and examine the mass of elizabethan literature for themselves  judge webb in his proem refers to mr holmes and mr donnelly as distinguished writers who have received but scant consideration from the accredited organs of opinion on this side of the atlantic their theories have not been more favourably considered by shakespearean scholars on the other side of the atlantic and how much consideration they deserve we have tried to show  the irish judge opens his case by noting an essential distinction between shakspere the actor and shakespeare the playwright  the name referring to the man who was both actor and author is spelled both shakspeare and shakespeare in the returne from parnassus 1602  the school of critics which divides the substance of shakespeare on the strength of the spelling of a proper name in the casual times of great elizabeth need not detain the inquirer  the returne from parnassus pp  5657138  oxford 1886  as to shakespeares education judge webb admits that there was a grammar school in the place  as its registers of pupils have not survived we cannot prove that shakespeare went to the school  mr collins shows that the headmaster was a fellow of corpus christi college oxford and describes the nature of the education mainly in latin as according to the standard of the period it ought to have been  there is no doubt that if shakespeare attended the school the age of entry was eight minded his book and had a good sprag memory he might have learned latin  mr collins commends the latin of two stratford contemporaries and friends of shakespeare sturley and quiney who probably were educated at the grammar school  judge webb disparages their lore and on the evidence of the epistles says that sturley and quiney were not men of education  if judge webb had compared the original letters of distinguished elizabethan officials and diplomatistssay sir william drury the commandant of berwickhe would have found that sturley and quiney were at least on the ordinary level of education in the upper classes  but the whole method of the baconians rests on neglecting such comparisons  fortnightly review april 1903  in a letter of sturleys eximiae is spelled eximie without the digraph a thing then most usual and no disproof of sturleys latinity  the shakspearean hypothesis is that shakespeare was rather a cleverer man than quiney and sturley and consequently that if he went to school he probably learned more by a great deal than they did  there was no reason why he should not acquire latin enough to astonish modern reviewers who have often none at all  webb p 14 phillippss outlines of the life of shakespeare i p 150 ii p 57  judge webb then discusses the learning of shakespeare and easily shows that he was full of mythological lore  so was all elizabethan literature  every english scribbler then knew what most men have forgotten now  nobody was forced to go to the original authorities say plato herodotus and plutarchfor what was accessible in translations or had long before been copiously decanted into english prose and poetry  shakespeare could get rhodope not from pliny but from b rs lively translation 1584 of the first two books of herodotus  even launcelot gobbo talks of scylla and charybdis says judge webb  who did not  had the gobbos not known about scylla and charybdis shakespeare would not have lent them the knowledge  the mythological legends were in the air familiar to all the elizabethan world  these allusions are certainly no proof of trained scholarship or scientific education  in five years of contact with the stage with wits with writers for the stage with older plays with patrons of the stage with templars and so on a man of talent could easily pick up the general informationnow caviare to the generalwhich a genius like shakespeare inevitably absorbed  we naturally come to greenes allusion to shakescene 1592 concerning which a schoolboy said in an examination we are tired to death with hearing about it  greene conspicuously insults shakescene both as a writer and an actor  judge webb says  as mr phillipps justly observes it one of greenes allusions merely conveys that shakspere was one who acted in the plays of which greene and his three friends were the authors ii 269  it is necessary to verify the judges reference  mr phillipps writes  taking greenes words in their contextual and natural sense he first alludes to shakespeare as an actor one beautified with our feathers that is one who acts in their plays then to the poet as a writer just commencing to try his hand at blank verse and finally to him as not only engaged in both those capacities but in any other in which he might be useful to the company  mr phillipps adds that greenes quotation of the line tygers heart wrapt in a players hide is a decisive proof of shakespeares authorship of the line  webb p 57 phillipps ii p 269  judge webb has manifestly succeeded in not appreciating mr phillippss plain english  he says with obvious truth that greene attacks shakespeare both as actor and poet but judge webb puts the matter thus  the language of greene    as mr phillipps justly observes merely conveys that shakspere was one who acted in the plays of which greene and his three friends were authors  the language of greene in one part of his tirade an upstart crow beautified in our feathers probably refers to shakespeare as an actor only but greene goes on to insult him as a writer  judge webb will not recognise him as a writer and omits that part of mr phillippss opinion  there followed chettles wellknown apology 1592 as editor of greenes sally to shakespeare  chettle speaks of his excellence in the quality he professes and of his facetious grace in writing that approves his art this on the authority of the report of divers of worship  this proves of course that shakespeare was a writer as well as an actor and judge webb can only murmur that we are left to guess  who divers of worship were and what motive they had for praising his facetious grace in writing  the obvious motive was approval of the work for work there was and as to who the divers were nobody knows  the evidence that in the opinion of greene chettle and divers of worship shakespeare was a writer as well as an actor is absolutely irrefragable  had shakespeare been the ignorant lout of the baconian theorists these men would not have credited him for example with his first signed and printed piece venus and adonis  it appeared early in 1593 and greene and chettle wrote in 1592  divers of worship according to the custom of the time may have seen venus and adonis in manuscript  it was printed by richard field a stratfordonavon man as was natural a stratford onavon man being the author  it was dedicated in stately but not servile courtesy to the earl of southampton by william shakespeare  phillipps i p 101  judge webb asks  was it a pseudonym or was it the real name of the author of the poem  well shakespeare signs shakspere in two deeds in which the draftsman throughout calls him shakespeare obviously taking no difference  people were not particular shakespeare let them spell his name as best pleased them  phillipps ii pp 34 36  judge webb argues that southampton took no notice of the dedication  how can he know  ben jonson dedicated to lady wroth and many others  does judge webb know what notice they took  he says that on various occasions southampton did not recognise the existence of the player  how can he know  i have dedicated books to dozens of people  probably they took notice but no record thereof exists  the use of arguments of this kind demonstrates the feebleness of the case  that southampton however did take notice may be safely inferred from the fact that shakespeare in 1594 dedicated to him the rape of lucrece  had the earl been an ungrateful patron had he taken no notice shakespeare had latin enough to act on the motto invenies alium si te hic fastidit alexin  he speaks of the warrant i have of your honourable disposition which makes the poem assured of acceptance  this could never have been written had the dedication of venus and adonis been disdained  the client never acknowledged his obligation to the patron says judge webb  the dedication of lucrece is acknowledgment enough  the judge ought to think so for he speaks with needless vigour of the protestations warm and gushing as a geyser of the rape  there is nothing warm and nothing gushing in the dedication of lucrece granting the style of the age but if it were as the judge says here indeed would be the clients acknowledgment which the judge says was never made  to argue against such logic seems needless and even cruel but judicial contentions appear to deserve a reply  webb p 67  we now come to the evidence of the rev francis meres in palladis tamia 1598  meres makes shakespeare among the english the rival in comedy and tragedy of plautus and seneca among the latines  he names twelve plays of which loves labours won is unknown  the soul of ovid lives in his venus and adonis his lucrece and his sugred sonnets among his private friends meres also mentions sidney spenser daniel drayton and so forth a long string of english poetic names ending with samuel page sometime fellow of ccc in oxford churchyard bretton  phillipps ii pp 149150  undeniably meres in 1598 recognises shakespeare as both playwright and poet  so judge webb can only reply  but who this mellifluous and honeytongued shakespeare was he does not say and he does not pretend to know  he does not pretend to know who any of the poets wasexcept samuel page and he was a fellow of corpus  he speaks of shakespeare just as he does of marlowe kid chapman and the others whom he mentions  he does not pretend to know who they were  every reader knew who they all were  if i write of mr swinburne or mr pinero of mr browning or of mr henry jones i do not say who they were i do not pretend to know  there was no shakespeare in the literary world of london but the one shakespeare burbages deserving man  webb p 71  the next difficulty is that shakespeares company by request of the essex conspirators who paid 2 pounds acted richard ii just before their foolish attempt february 7 1601  if coke says the judge had the faintest idea that the player shakespeare was the author of richard ii he would not have hesitated a moment to lay him by the heels  why the fact of shakespeares authorship had been announced in print by meres in 1598  coke knew if he cared to know  judge webb goes on  and that the player shakespeare was not regarded as the author by the queen is proved by the fact that with his company he performed before the court at richmond on the evening before the execution of the earl  webb pp 72 73  nothing of the kind is proved  the guilt if any lay not in writing the dramaby 1601 olde and outwornebut in acting it on the eve of an intended revolution  this error elizabeth overlooked and with it the innocent authorship of the piece now olde and outworne  it is not even certain in mr phillippss opinion that the olde and outworne play was that of shakespeare  it is perfectly certain that as elizabeth overlooked the fault of the players she would not attack the author of a play written years before essexs plot with no political intentions  phillipps ii pp 359362  we now come to evidence of which judge webb says very little that of the two plays acted at st johns college cambridge in 1600 1601 known as the returne from parnassus  these pieces prove that shakespeare the poet was identified with shakespeare the player  they also prove that shakespeares scholarship and art were held very cheaply by the university wits who as always were disdainful of nonuniversity men  his popularity is undisputed but his admirer in the piece gullio is a vapouring ignoramus who pretends to have been at the university of padua but knows no more latin than many modern critics  gullio rants thus  pardon faire lady though sickethoughted gullio makes amaine unto thee and like a bouldfaced sutor gins to woo thee  this of course is from venus and adonis  ingenioso says aside  we shall have nothinge but pure shakespeare and shreds of poetry that he hath gathered at the theaters  gullio next mouths a reminiscence of romeo and juliet and ingenioso whispers marke romeo and juliet o monstrous theft however aloud he says sweete mr shakspeare the spelling varies  gullio continues to praise sweete mr shakspeare above spenser and chaucer  let mee heare mr shakspears veyne  judge webb does not cite these passages which identify shakspeare or shakespeare with the poet of venus and adonis and romeo and juliet  in the second returne burbage and kemp the noted morrice dancer and clown of shakespeares company are introduced  few of the university men pen plays well says kemp they smack too much of that writer ovid and that writer metamorphosis and talke too much of proserpina and jupiter  why heres our fellow shakespeare fellow is used in the sense of companion puts them all downe ay and ben jonson too  o that ben jonson is a pestilent fellow he brought up horace giving the poets a pill but our fellow shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him bewray his credit at burbages request one of the university men then recites two lines of richard iii by the poet of his company  ben according to judge webb bewrayed his credit in the poetaster 16011602 where pantalabus was meant for shakspere if so pantalabus is described as one who pens high lofty and in a new stalking strain and if shakespeare is the poet ape of jonsons epigram why then jonson regards him as a writer not merely as an actor  no amount of evil that angry ben could utter about the plays while shakespeare lived and perhaps was for a time at odds with him can obliterate the praises which the same ben wrote in his milder mood  the charge against poet ape is a charge of plagiarism such as unpopular authors usually make against those who are popular  judge webb has to suppose that jonson when he storms raves against some works at that time somehow associated with shakespeare and that when he praises he praises the divine masterpieces of bacon  but we know what plays really were attributed to shakespeare then as now while no other works of a contemptible character attributed to shakespeare are to be heard of anywhere  judge webb does not pretend to know what the things were to which the angry jonson referred  if he really aimed his stupid epigram at shakespeare he obviously alluded to the works which were then and now are recognised as shakespeares but in his wrath he denounced them  potter is jealous of potter poet of poetit is an old saying of the greek  there was perhaps some bitterness between jonson and shakespeare about 1601 ben made an angry epigram perhaps against shakespeare and thought it good enough to appear in his collected epigrams in 1616 the year of shakespeares death  by that time the application to shakespeare if to him the epigram applied might in bens opinion perhaps be forgotten by readers  in any case ben according to drummond of hawthornden was one who preferred his jest to his friend  webb pp 114116 webb pp 116119  judge webbs hypothesis is that ben in shakespeares lifetime especially in 16001601 spoke evil of his works though he allowed that they might endure to aftertimes                                aftertimes           may judge it to be his as well as ours  but these works wholly unknown were not on the judges theory the works which after shakespeares death ben praised as his in verse and more critically praised in prose  the works that is which the world has always regarded as shakespeares  these were bacons and ben knew it on judge webbs theory  here judge webb has of course to deal with bens explicit declarations in the first folio that the works which he praises are by shakespeare the portrait says ben            was for gentle shakespeare cut  judge webb then assures us to escape this quandary that in the sonnets the gentle shakespeare himself informs us that shakespeare was not his real name but the noted weed in which he kept invention  the author of the sonnets does nothing of the kind judge webb has merely misconstrued his text  the passage which he so quaintly misinterprets occurs in sonnet lxxvi        why is my verse so barren of new pride          so far from variation or quick change       why with the time do i not glance aside          to newfound methods and to compounds strange       why write i still all one ever the same          and keep invention in a noted weed       that every word does almost tell my name          showing their birth and whence they do proceed       oh know sweet love i always write of you          and you and love are still my argument       so all my best is dressing old words new          spending again what is already spent              for as the sun is daily new and old              so is my love still telling what is told  webb pp 125156235264  judge webb is fond of his discovery  the lines capitalised are thus explained by the judge  here the author certainly intimates that shakespeare is not his real name and that he was fearful lest his real name should be discovered the author says nothing about shakespeare not being his real name nor about his fear lest his real name should be discovered  he even quibbles on his own christian name will as mr phillipps and everyone else have noted  what he means is  why am i so monotonous that every word almost tells my name  to keep invention in a noted weed means of course to present his genius always in the same wellknown attire  there is nothing about disguise of a name or of anything else in the sonnet  webb pp 64156  but judge webb assures us that shakespeare himself informs us in the sonnets that shakespeare was not his real name but the noted weed in which he kept invention  as this is most undeniably not the case it cannot aid his effort to make out that in the folio by the name of shakespeare ben jonson means another person  in the folio verses to the memory of my beloved mr william shakespeare and what he has left us judge webb finds many mysterious problems                                soul of the age           the applause delight the wonder of our stage                     my shakespeare rise  by a pun ben speaks of shakespeare as                                shaking a lance           as brandisht at the eyes of ignorance  the pun does not fit the name ofbacon  the apostrophe to sweet swan of avon hardly applies to bacon either he was not a swan of avon  it were a sight says ben to see the swan in our waters yet appear and judge webb actually argues that shakespeare was dead and could not appear so somebody else must be meant  no poet that ever lived would be mad enough to talk of a swan as yet appearing and resuming its flights upon the river some seven or eight years after it was dead  the judge is like the scottish gentleman who when lamb invited to meet burnss sons said he wished it were their father solemnly replied that this could not be for burns was dead  wordsworth in a sonnet like glengarry at sheriffmuir sighed for one hour of dundee  the poet and the chief must have been mad in judge webbs opinion for dundee had fallen long ago in the arms of victory  a theory which not only rests on such arguments as judge webbs but takes it for granted that bacon might be addressed as sweet swan of avon is conspicuously impossible  webb p 134  another of the judges arguments reposes on a misconception which has been exposed again and again  in his memorial verses ben gives to shakespeare the palm for poetry  to bacon for eloquence in the discoveries  both may stand the comparison with insolent greece or haughty rome  shakespeare is not mentioned with bacon in the scriptorum catalogus of the discoveries  but no more is any dramatic author or any poet as a poet  hooker essex egerton sandys sir nicholas bacon are chosen not spenser marlowe or shakespeare  all this does not go far to prove that when ben praised the wonder of our stage sweet swan of avon he meant bacon not shakespeare  when judge webb argued that in matters of science falsely so called bacon and shakespeare were identical professor tyrrell of trinity college dublin was shaken and said so in the pilot professor dowden then proved in the national review that both shakespeare and bacon used the widely spread pseudoscientific ideas of their time as is conspicuously the case and mr tyrrell confessed that he was sorry he had spoken  when i read professor dowdens article i would gladly have recalled my own but it was too late  mr tyrrell adds with an honourable naivete i am not versed in the literature of the shakespearean era and i assumed that the baconians who put forward the parallelisms had satisfied themselves that the coincidences were peculiar to the writings of the philosopher and the poet  professor dowden has proved that this is not so     professor dowden has indeed proved in copious and minute detail what was already obvious to every student who knew even such ordinary elizabethan books as lylys euphues and phil hollands pliny and the speculations of such earlier writers as paracelsus  bacon and shakespeare like other elizabethans accepted the popular science of their period and decorated their pages with queer ideas about beasts and stones and plants which were mere folklore  a sensible friend of my own was staggered if not converted by the parallelisms adduced in judge webbs chapter of bacon as a man of science  i told him that the parallelisms were elizabethan commonplaces and were not peculiar to bacon and shakespeare  professor dowden out of the fulness of his reading corroborated this obiter dictum and his article in the national review vol xxxix 1902 absolutely disposes of the judges argument  mr tyrrell went on  the evidence of ben jonson alone seems decisive of the question the other the judge for one persuades himself how i cannot understand that it may be explained away  pilot august 30 1902 p 220  we have
