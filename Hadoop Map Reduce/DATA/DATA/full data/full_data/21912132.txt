listening to the lark which had risen fluttering from their feet a moment or so ago and was circling now above their heads mannering with a quiet smile pointed upwards  there my friend he exclaimed you can listen now to arguments more eloquent than any which i could ever frame that little creature is singing the true uncorrupted song of life he sings of the sunshine the buoyant air the pure and simple joy of existence is beating in his little heart the things which lie behind the hills will never sadden him his kingdom is here and he is content  borrowdeans smile was a little cynical he was essentially of that order of men who are dwellers in cities and even the sting of the salt breeze blowing across the marshesmarshes riven everywhere with long arms of the seacould bring no colour to his pale cheeks  your little birda lark i think you called it he remarked may be a very eloquent prophet for the whole kingdom of his species but the song of life for a bird and that for a man are surely different things  not so very different after all mannering answered still watching the bird the longer one lives the more clearly one recognizes the absolute universality of life  borrowdean shrugged his shoulders with a little gesture of impatience he had left london at a moment when he could ill be spared and had not travelled to this outoftheway corner of the kingdom to exchange purposeless platitudes with a man whose present attitude towards life at any rate he heartily despised he seated himself upon a halfbroken rail and lit a cigarette  mannering he said i did not come here to simper cheap philosophies with you like a couple of schoolgirls i have a real live errand i want to speak to you of great things  mannering moved a little uneasily he had a very shrewd idea as to the nature of that errand  of great things he repeated slowly are you in earnest borrowdean  why not  because mannering continued i have left the world of great things as you and i used to regard them very far behind i am glad to see you here of course but i cannot think of any serious subject which it would be useful or profitable for us to discuss you understand me borrowdean i am sure  borrowdean closely eyed this man who once had been his friend  the old sore still rankles then mannering he said has time done nothing to heal it  mannering laughed easily  how can you think me such a child he exclaimed if rochester himself were to come to see me he would be as welcome as you are in fact he continued more seriously if you could only realize my friend how peaceful and happy life here may be amongst the quiet places you would believe me at once when i assure you that i can feel nothing but gratitude towards those people and those circumstances which impelled me to seek it  what should you think then borrowdean asked watching his friend through halfclosed eyes of those who sought to drag you from it  mannerings laugh was as free and natural as the wind itself he had bared his head and had turned directly seawards  hatred my dear borrowdean he declared if i thought that they had a single chance of success as it isindifference  borrowdeans eyebrows were raised he held his cigarette between his fingers and looked at it for several moments  yet i am here he said slowly for no other purpose  mannering turned and faced his friend  all i can say is that i am sorry to hear it he declared i know the sort of man you are borrowdean and i know very well that if you have come down here with something to say to me you will say it therefore go on let us have it over  borrowdean stood up his tone acquired a new earnestness he became at once more of a man the cynical curve of his lips had vanished  we are on the eve of great opportunities mannering he said six months ago the result of the next general election seemed assured we appeared to be as far off any chance of office as a political party could be today the whole thing is changed we are on the eve of a general reconstruction it is our one great chance of this generation i come to you as a patriot rochester asks you to forget  mannering held up his hand  stop one moment borrowdean he said i want you to understand this once and for all i have no grievance against rochester the old wound if it ever amounted to that is healed if rochester were here at this moment i would take his hand cheerfully but  ah there is a but then borrowdean interrupted  there is a but mannering assented you may find it hard to understand but here is the truth i have lost all taste for public life the whole thing is rotten borrowdean rotten from beginning to end i have had enough of it to last me all my days party policy must come before principle a mans individuality his whole character is assailed and suborned on every side there is but one life one measure of days that you or i know anything of it doesnt last very long the months and years have a knack of slipping away emptily enough unless we are always standing to attention therefore i think that it becomes our duty to consider very carefully almost religiously how best to use them come here for a moment borrowdean i want to show you something  the two men stood side by side upon the grassy bank mannering broadshouldered and vigorous his clean hardcut features tanned with wind and sun his eyes bright and vigorous with health leslie borrowdean once his greatest friend a man of almost similar physique but with the bent frame and listless pallor of a dweller in the crowded places of life without enthusiasm his tired eyes followed the sweep of mannerings arm  you see those yellow sandhills beyond the marshes there behind them is the sea do you catch that breath of wind take off your hat man and get it into your lungs it comes from the north sea salt and fresh and sweet i think that it is the purest thing on earth you can walk here for miles and miles in the open and the wind is like gods own music borrowdean i am going to say things to you which one says but once or twice in his life i came to this country a soured man cynical a pessimist a materialist by training and environment today i speak of a god with bowed head for i believe that somewhere behind all these beautiful things their prototype must exist dont think ive turned ranter ive never spoken like this to any one else before and i dont suppose i ever shall again here is nature man the greatest force on earth the mother the mistress beneficent wonderful you are a creature of cities stay with me here for a day or two and the joy of all these things will steal into your blood you too will know what peace is  borrowdean as though unconsciously straightened himself if no colour came to his cheeks the light of battle was at least in his eyes this man was speaking heresies the words sprang to his lips  peace he exclaimed scornfully peace is for the dead the last reward perhaps of a breaking heart the life effective militant is the only possible existence for men pull yourself together mannering for heavens sake yours is the faineant spirit of the decadent masquerading in the garb of a sham primitivism were you born into the world do you think to loiter through life an idle worshipper at the altar of beauty who are you to dare to skulk in the quiet places whilst the battle of life is fought by others  another lark had risen almost from their feet and circling its way upwards was breaking into song and below the full spring tide was filling the pools and creeks with the softly flowing glimmering seawater the fishing boats high and dry an hour ago were passing now seaward along the silvery way all these things mannering was watching with rapt eyes even whilst he listened to his companion  dear friend he said the world can get on very well without me and i have no need of the world the battle that you speak ofwell i have been in the fray as you know the memory of it is still a nightmare to me  borrowdean had the appearance of a man who sought to put a restraint upon his words he was silent for a moment and then he spoke very deliberately  mannering he said do not think me wholly unsympathetic there is a side of me which sympathises deeply with every word which you have said and there is another which forces me to remind you again and again that we men were never born to linger in the lotos lands of the world you do not stand for yourself alone you exist as a unit of humanity think of your responsibilities you have found for yourself a beautiful corner of the world that is all very well for you but how about the rest how about the millions who are chained to the cities that they may earn their living pittance whose wives and children fill the churchyards the echoes of whose weary neverceasing cry must reach you even here they are the people the sufferers fellowlinks with you in the chain of humanity you may stand aloof as you will but you can never cut yourself wholly away from the great family of your fellows you may hide from your responsibilities but the burden of them will lie heavy upon your conscience the poison will penetrate sometimes into your most jealously guarded paradise we are of the peoples party you and i mannering and i tell you that the tocsin has sounded we need you  a shadow had fallen upon mannerings face borrowdean was in earnest and his appeal was scarcely one to be treated lightly nevertheless mannering showed no sign of faltering though his tone was certainly graver  leslie he said you speak like a prophet but believe me my mind is made up i have taken root here such work as i can do from my study is as it always has been at your service but i myself have finished with actual political life dont press me too hard i must seem churlish and ungrateful but if i listened to you for hours the result would be the same i have finished with actual political life  borrowdean shrugged his shoulders despairingly such a man was hard to deal with  mannering he protested you must not you really must not send me away like this you speak of your written work dont think that i underestimate it because i have not alluded to it before i myself honestly believe that it was those wonderful articles of yours in the nineteenth century which brought back to a reasonable frame of mind thousands who were half led away by the glamour of this new campaign you kindled the torch my friend and you must bear it to victory you bring me to my last resource if you will not serve under rochester come backand rochester will serve under you when the time comes  mannering shook his head slowly  i wish i could convince you he said once and for all that my refusal springs from no such reasons as you seem to imagine i would sooner sit here with a volume of pater or meredith and this west wind blowing in my face than i would hear myself acclaimed prime minister of england let us abandon this discussion once and for all borrowdean we have arrived at a culdesac and i have spoken my last word  borrowdean threw his halffinished cigarette into the everwidening creek below it was characteristic of the man that his face showed no sign of disappointment only for several moments he kept silence  come mannering said at last let us make our way back to the house if you are resolved to get back to town tonight we ought to be thinking about luncheon  thank you borrowdean said i must return  they started to walk inland but they had taken only a few steps when they both as though by a common impulse stopped an unfamiliar sound had broken in upon the deep silence of this quiet land borrowdean who was a few paces ahead pointed to the bend in the road below and turned towards his companion with a little gesture of cynical amusement  behold he exclaimed the invasion of modernity even your timeforgotten paradise mannering has its civilizations then what an anachronism  with a cloud of dust behind and with the sun flashing upon its polished metal parts a motor car swung into sight and came rushing towards them borrowdean always a keen observer of trifles noticed the change in mannerings face  it is a neighbour of mine he remarked she is on her way to the golf links  golf links borrowdean exclaimed  mannering nodded  behind the sandhills there he remarked  there was a grinding of brakes the car came to a standstill below a woman who sat alone in the back seat raised her veil and looked upwards  am i late she asked clara has gone onthey told me  she had addressed mannering but her eyes seemed suddenly drawn to borrowdean as though dazzled by the sun she dropped her veil borrowdean was standing as though turned to stone perfectly rigid and motionless his face was like a still white mask  i am so sorry mannering said but i have had a most unexpected visit from an old friend may i introduce sir leslie borrowdeanmrs handsell  the lady in the car bent her head and borrowdean performed an automatic salute mannering continued  i am afraid that i must throw myself upon your mercy sir leslie insists upon returning this afternoon and i am taking him back for an early luncheon you will find clara and lindsay at the golf club may we have our foursome tomorrow  certainly i will not keep you for a moment i must hurry now or the tide will be over the road  she motioned the driver to proceed but borrowdean interposed  mannering he said i am afraid that the poison of your lotos land is beginning to work already may i stay until tomorrow and walk round with you whilst you play your foursome i should enjoy it immensely  mannering looked at his friend for a moment in amazement then he laughed heartily  by all means he answered our foursome stands then mrs handsell this way borrowdean  the two men turned once more seaward walking in single file along the top of the grassy bank the woman in the car inclined her head and motioned the driver to proceed     chapter ii  the woman with an alias   borrowdean seemed after all to take but little interest in the game he walked generally some distance away from the players on the top of the low bank of sandhills which fringed the sea he was one of those men whom solitude never wearies a weaver of carefully thoughtout schemes no single detail of which was ever left to chance or impulse such moments as these were valuable to him he bared his head to the breeze stopped to listen to the larks watched the seagulls float low over the lapping waters without paying the slightest attention to any one of them the instinctive cunning which never deserted him led him without any conscious effort to assume a pleasure in these things which as a matter of fact he found entirely meaningless it led him too to choose a retired spot for those periods of intensely close observation to which he every now and then subjected his host and the woman who was now his partner in the game what he saw entirely satisfied him yet the way was scarcely clear  they caught him up near one of the greens and he stood with his hands behind him and his eyeglass securely fixed gravely watching them approach and put for the hole to him the whole performance seemed absolutely idiotic but he showed no sign of anything save a mild and genial interest clara mannerings niece who was immensely impressed with him lingered behind  dont you really care for any games at all sir leslie she asked  he shook his head  i know that you think me a barbarian he remarked smiling  on the contrary she declared that is probably what you think us i suppose they are really a waste of time when one has other things to do only down here you see there is nothing else to do  he looked at her thoughtfully he had never yet in his life spoken half a dozen words with man woman or child without wondering whether they might not somehow or other contribute towards his scheme of life clara mannering was pretty and no doubt foolish she lived alone with her uncle and possibly had some influence over him it was certainly worth while  i do not know you nearly well enough miss mannering he said smiling to tell you what i really think but i can assure you that you dont seem a barbarian to me at all  she was suddenly grave it was her turn to play a stroke she examined the ball carefully selected a club from her bag and with a long easy swing sent it flying towards the hole  wonderful he murmured  she looked up at him and laughed  tell me what you are thinking she insisted  that if i played golf he answered i should like to be able to play like that  but you must have played games sometimes she insisted  when i was at eton he murmured  mannering looked back smiling  he was in the eton eleven clara and stroked his boat at college dont you believe all he tells you  i shall not believe another word she declared  i hope you dont mean it he protested or i must remain dumb  you want to go off and tramp along the ridges by yourself she declared confess  on the contrary he answered i should like to carry that bag for you and hand out theerimplements  she unslung it at once from her shoulder  you have rushed upon your fate she said now let me fasten it for you  is there any remuneration he inquired anxiously  you mercenary person stand still now i am going to play well what do you expect  i am not acquainted with the usual charges he answered but to judge from the weight of the clubs  give me them back then she cried  nothing he declared firmly would induce me to relinquish them i will leave the matter of remuneration entirely in your hands i am convinced that you have a generous disposition  the usual charge she remarked is tenpence and twopence for lunch  i will take it in kind he said  she laughed gaily  give me a mashie please  he peered into the bag  which of these clubs now he asked rejoices in that weird name  she helped herself and played her shot  i couldnt think she said firmly of paying the full price to a caddie who doesnt know what a mashie is  i will be thankful he murmured for whatever you may give meeven if it should be that carnation you are wearing  she shook her head  it is worth more than tenpence she said  perhaps by extra diligence he suggested i might deserve a little extra by the bye why does your partner mr lindsay isnt it walk by himself all the time  he probably thinks she answered demurely that i am too familiar with my caddie  you will understand he said earnestly that if my behaviour is not strictly correct it is entirely owing to ignorance i have no idea as to the exact position a caddie should take up  what a pity you are going away so soon she said i might have given you lessons  dont tempt me he begged i can assure you that without me the constitution of this country would collapse within a week  she looked at himproperly awed  what a wonderful person you are  i am glad he said meekly that you are beginning to appreciate me  as a caddie she remarked you are not i must confess wholly perfect for instance your attention should be entirely devoted to the person whose clubs you are carrying instead of which you talk to me and watch mrs handsell  he was almost taken aback for a pretty girl she was really not so much of a fool as he had thought her  i deny it in toto he declared  ah but i know you she answered you are a politician and you would deny anything dont you think her very handsome  borrowdean gravely considered the matter which was in itself a somewhat humorous thing slim and erect with a long graceful neck and a carriage of the head which somehow suggested the environment of a court mrs handsell was distinctly even from a distance a pleasant person to look upon he nodded approvingly  yes she is goodlooking he admitted is she a neighbour of yours  she has taken a house within a hundred yards of ours clara mannering answered we all think that she is delightful  is she a widow borrowdean asked  i imagine so she answered i have never heard her speak of her husband she has beautiful dresses and things i should think she must be very rich stand quite still please i must take great pains over this stroke  a wild shot from claras partner a few minutes later resulted in a scattering of the little party searching for the ball for the first time borrowdean found himself near mrs handsell  i must have a few words with you before i go back he said nonchalantly  say that you would like to try my motor car she answered what do you want here  i came to see mannering  poor mannering  it would be he remarked smoothly a mistake to quarrel  they separated and immediately afterwards the ball was found a little later on the round was finished clara attributed her success to the excellence of her caddie mrs handsell deplored a headache which had put her off her putting lindsay who was in a bad temper declined an invitation to lunch and rode off on his bicycle the rest of the little party gathered round the motor car and borrowdean asked preposterous questions about the gears and the speeds  if you are really interested mrs handsell said languidly i will take you home i have only room for one unfortunately with all these clubs and things  i should be delighted borrowdean answered but perhaps miss mannering  clara will look after me mannering interrupted smiling try to make an enthusiast of him mrs handsell he needs a hobby badly  they started off she leaned back in her seat and pulled her veil down  do not talk to me here she said we shall have a quarter of an hour before they can arrive  borrowdean assented silently he was glad of the respite for he wanted to think a few minutes swift rush through the air and the car pulled up before a queer oldfashioned dwelling house in the middle of the village a smart maidservant came hurrying out to assist her mistress borrowdean was ushered into a long low drawingroom with open windows leading out on to a trim lawn beyond was a walled garden bordering the churchyard  mrs handsell came back almost immediately borrowdean turning his head as she entered found himself studying her with a new curiosity yes she was a beautiful woman she had lost nothing her complexiona little tanned perhapswas as fresh and soft as a girls her smile as delightfully full of humour as ever not a speck of grey in her black hair not a shadow of embarrassment a wonderful woman  the one thing which we have no time to do is to stand and look at one another she declared however since you have tried to stare me out of countenance what do you find  i find you unchanged he answered gravely  naturally i have found a panacea for all the woes of life now what do you want down here  mannering  of course but you wont get him he declares that he has finished with politics and i never knew a man so thoroughly in earnest  borrowdean smiled  no man has ever finished with politics  a platitude she declared as for mannering well for the first few weeks i felt about him as i suppose you do now i know him better now and i have changed my mind he is unique absolutely unique do you think that i could have existed here for nearly two months without him  may i inquire borrowdean asked blandly how much longer you intend to exist here with him  she shrugged her shoulders  all my daysperhaps he and this place together are an anchorage look at me am i not a different woman i know you too well my dear leslie to attempt your conversion but i can assure you that i amvery nearly in earnest  you interest me amazingly he remarked smiling may i ask does mannering know you as mrs handsell only  of course  this he continued is not the garden of eden i may be the first but others will come who will surely recognize you  i must risk it she answered  borrowdean swung his eyeglass backwards and forwards all the time he was thinking intensely  how long have you been here he asked  very nearly two months she answered imagine it  quite long enough for your little idyll he said come you know what the end of it must be we need mannering help us  not i she answered coolly you must do without him for the present  you are our natural ally he protested we need your help now you know very well that with a slip of the tongue i could change the whole situation  somehow she said i do not think that you are likely to make that slip  why not he protested i begin to understand mannerings firmness now you are one of the ropes which hold him to this petty lifeto this philandering amongst the flowerpots you are one of the ropes i want to cut why not indeed i think that i could do it  do you want a bribe  i want mannering  so do i  he can belong to you none the less for belonging to us politically  possibly but i prefer him here as a recluse he is adorable i do not want him to go through the mill  you dont understand his importance to us borrowdean declared this is really no light affair rochester and mellors both believe in him there is no limit to what he might not ask  he has told me a dozen times she said that he never means to sit in parliament again  there is no reason why he should not change his mind borrowdean answered between us i think that we could induce him  perhaps she answered only i do not mean to try  i wish i could make you understand he said impatiently that i am in deadly earnest  you threaten  dont call it that  very well then she declared i will tell him the truth myself  that he answered is all that i should dare to ask he would come to us tomorrow  you used not to underrate me she murmured with a glance towards the mirror  there is no other man like mannering he said he abhors any form of deceit he would forgive a murderer but never a liar  my dear leslie she said as a friendand a relative  neither counts he interrupted i am a politician  she sat quite still looking away from him the peaceful noises from the village street found their way into the room a few cows were making their leisurely midday journey towards the pasturage a bakers cart came rattling round the corner the west wind was rustling in the elms bending the shrubs upon the lawn almost to the ground she watched them idly already a little shrivelled and tarnished with their endless struggle for life  i do not wish to be melodramatic she said slowly but you are forcing me into a corner you know that i am rich you know the people with whom i have influence i want to purchase lawrence mannerings immunity from your schemes can you name no price which i could pay you and i know one another fairly well you are an egoist pure and simple politics are nothing to you save a personal affair you play the game of life in the first person singular let me pay his quittance  borrowdean regarded her thoughtfully  you are a strange woman he said in a few months time when you are back in the thick of it all you will be as anxious to have him there as we are you will not be able to understand how you could ever have wished differently this is rank sentiment you know which you have been talking mannering here is a wasted power his life is an unnatural one  he is happy she objected  how do you know will he be as happy i wonder when you have gone when there is no longer a mrs handsell i think not you are one of the first to whom i should have looked for help in this matter you owe it to us we have a right to demand it for myself personally i have no life now outside the life political i am tired of being in opposition i want to hold office one mounts the ladder very slowly i see my way in a few months to going up two rungs at a time we want mannering we must have him dont force me to make that slip of the tongue  the sound of a gong came through the open window she rose to her feet  we are keeping them waiting for luncheon she remarked i will think over what you have said     chapter iii  wanteda politician   sir leslie carefully closed the iron gate behind him and looked around  but where he asked are the roses  clara laughed outright  you may be a great politician sir leslie she declared but you are no gardener roses dont bloom out of doors in maynot in these parts at any rate  i understand he assented humbly this is where the roses will be  she nodded  that wall you see she explained keeps off the north winds and the chestnut grove the east there is sun here all the day long you should come to blakely in two months time sir leslie everything is so different then  he sighed  you forget my dear child he murmured that you are speaking to a slave  a slave she repeated how absurd you are a cabinet minister are you not sir leslie  he shrugged his shoulders  i was once he answered until an ungrateful country grew weary of the monotony of perfect government and installed our opponents in our places just now we are in opposition  in opposition she repeated a little vaguely  meaning he explained that we get all the fun no responsibility and alas no pay  how fascinating she exclaimed do sit down here and tell me all about it but i forgot you are not used to sitting down out of doors perhaps you will catch cold  sir leslie smiled  i am inclined to run the risk he said gravely if you will share it seriously though these rustic seats are rather a delusion arent they from the point of view of comfort  there shall be cushions she declared for the next time you come  he sighed  ah the next time i dare not look forward to it so you are interested in politics miss mannering  well i believe i am she answered a little doubtfully to tell you the truth sir leslie i am shockingly ignorant you must live in london to be a politician mustnt you  it is necessary he assented to spend some part of your time there if you want to come into touch with the real thing  then i am very interested in politics she declared please go on  he shook his head  i would rather you talked to me about the roses you should ask your uncle to tell you all about politics he knows far more than i do  more than you but you have been a cabinet minister she exclaimed  so was your uncle once he answered so he could be again whenever he chose  she looked at him incredulously  you dont really mean that sir leslie  indeed i do he asserted there was never a man within my recollection or knowledge who in so short a time made for himself a position so brilliant as your uncle there is no man today whose written word carries so much weight with the people  she sighed a little doubtfully  then if that is so she said i cannot imagine why we live down here hundreds of miles away from everywhere why did he give it up why is he not in parliament now  it is to ask him that question miss mannering borrowdean said that i am here no wonder it seems surprising to you it is surprising to all of us  she looked at him eagerly  you mean then that youthat his party want him to go back she asked  assuredly  you have told him this  of course it was my mission  sir leslie you must tell me what he said  borrowdean sighed  my dear young lady he said it is rather a painful subject with me just now yet since you insist i will tell you something has come over your uncle which i do not understand his partyno it is his country that needs him he prefers to stay here and watch his roses blossom  it is wicked of him she declared energetically  it is inexplicable he agreed yet i have used every argument which can well be urged  oh you must think of others she begged if you knew how weary one gets of this placea man too like my uncle how can he be content the monotony here is enough to drive even a dull person like myself mad to choose such a life actually to choose it is insanity  borrowdean raised his head he had heard the click of the garden gate  they are coming he said i wish you would talk to your uncle like this  i only wish she answered passionately that i could make him feel as i do  they entered the garden mannering bareheaded following his guest borrowdean watched them closely as they approached the womans expression was purely negative there was nothing to be learned from the languid smile with which she recognized their presence upon mannering however the cloud seemed already to have fallen his eyebrows were set in a frown he had the appearance of a man in some manner perplexed he carried two telegrams which he handed over to borrowdean  a boy on a bicycle he remarked is waiting for answers two telegrams at once is a thing wholly unheard of here borrowdean you really ought not to have disturbed our postal service to such an extent  borrowdean smiled as he tore them open  i think he said that i can guess their contents yes i thought so can you send me to the station mannering  i canif it is necessary mannering answered must you really go  borrowdean nodded  i must be in the house tonight he said a little wearily rochester is going for them again  you didnt take a pair mannering asked  it isnt altogether that borrowdean answered though heaven knows we cant spare a single vote just now rochester wants me to speak we are a usedup lot and no mistake we want new blood mannering  i trust that the next election mannering said may supply you with it will you walk round to the stables with me i must order a cart for you  i shall be glad to borrowdean answered  they walked side by side through the chestnut grove borrowdean laid his hand upon his friends arm  mannering he said slowly am i to take it that you have spoken your last word i am to write my mission down a failure  a failure without doubt so far as regards its immediate object mannering assented for the rest it has been very pleasant to see you again and i only wish that you could spare us a few more days  borrowdean shook his head  we are better apart just now mannering he said for i tell you frankly that i do not understand your present attitude towards lifeyour entire absence of all sense of moral responsibility are you indeed willing to be written down in history as a philanderer in great things to loiter in your flower gardens whilst other men fight the battle of life for you and your fellows persist in your refusal to help us if you will mannering but before i go you shall at least hear the truth  mannering smiled  be precise my dear friend i shall hear your view of the truth  i do not accept the correction borrowdean answered quickly there are times when a man can make no mistake and this is one of them you shall hear the truth from me this afternoon and when your days here have been spun out to their limityour days of sybaritic idlenessyou shall hear it again only it will be too late you are fighting against nature mannering you were born to rule to be master over men you have that nameless gift of geniuspowerthe gift of swaying the minds and hearts of your fellow men once you accepted your destiny your feet were firmly planted upon the great ladder you could have climbedwhere you would  a curious quietness seemed to have crept over mannering when he answered his voice seemed to rise scarcely above a whisper  my friend he said it was not worth while  borrowdean was almost angry  not worth while he repeated contemptuously is it worth while then to play golf to linger in your flower gardens to become a dilettante student to dream away your days in the idleness of a purely enervating culture what is it that i heard you yourself say oncethat life apart from ones fellows must always lack robustness you have the instincts of the creator mannering you cannot stifle them some day the cry of the world to its own children will find its echo in your heart and it may be too late for sooner or later my friend the place of all men on earth is filled  for a moment that somewhat cynical restraint which seemed to divest of enthusiasm borrowdeans most earnest words and which militated somewhat against his reputation as a public speaker seemed to have fallen from him mannering recognizing it answered him gravely enough though with no less decision  if you are right borrowdean he said the suffering will be mine come your time is short now perhaps you had better make your adieux to my niece and mrs handsell  they all came out into the drive to see him start a curious change had come over the bright spring day a grey seafog had drifted inland the sunlight was obscured the larks were silent borrowdean shivered a little as he turned up his coatcollar  so nature has her little caprices evenin paradise he remarked  it will blow over in an hour mannering said a breath of wind and the whole thing is gone  borrowdeans farewells were of the briefest he made no further allusion to the object of his visit he departed as one who had been paying an afternoon call more or less agreeable clara waved her hand until he was out of sight then she turned somewhat abruptly round and entered the house mannering and mrs handsell remained for a few moments in the avenue looking along the road the sound of the horses feet could still be heard but the trap itself was long since invisible  the passing of your friend she remarked quietly is almost allegorical he has gone into the land of ghostsor are we the ghosts i wonder who loiter here  mannering answered her without a touch of levity he too was unusually serious  we have the better part he said yet borrowdean is one of those men who know very well how to play upon the heartstrings a human being is like a musical instrument to him he knows how to find out the harmonies or strike the discords  she turned away  i am superstitious she murmured with a little shiver i suppose that it is this ghostly mist and the silence which has come with it yet i wish that your friend had stayed away from blakely                                       upstairs from her window clara also was gazing along the road where borrowdean had disappeared and borrowdean himself was puzzling over a third telegram which mannering had carelessly passed on to him with his own and which although it was clearly addressed to mannering he had after a few minutes hesitation opened it had been handed in at the strand postoffice    i must see you this weekblanche  a few hours later on his arrival in london borrowdean repeated this message to mannering from the same postoffice and quietly tearing up the original went down to the house  i cannot tell he reported to his chief whether we have succeeded or not in a fortnight or less we shall know     chapter iv  the duchess asks a question   clara stepped through the high french window and with skirts a little raised crossed the lawn lindsay who was following her stopped to light a cigarette  were getting frightfully modern she remarked turning and waiting for him mrs handsell and i ought to have come out here and you and uncle ought to have stayed and yawned at one another over the dinnertable  you have an excellent preceptressin modernity he remarked may i  if you mean smoke of course you may she answered but you may not say or think horrid things about my best friend shes a dear wonderful woman and im sure uncle has not been like the same man since she came  im glad you appreciate that he answered do you honestly think hes any the better for it  i think hes immensely improved she answered he doesnt grub about by himself nearly so much and hes had his hair cut im sure he looks years younger  do you think that he seems quite as contented  contented she repeated scornfully thats just like you richard he hasnt any right to be contented no one has it is the one absolutely fatal state  he stretched himself out upon the seat and frowned  youre picking up some strange ideas clara he remarked  well if i am thats better than being contented to all eternity with the old ones she replied mrs handsell is doing us all no end of good she makes us think we all ought to think richard  what on earth for  you are really hopeless she murmured so bucolic  thanks he interrupted i seem to recognize the inspiration i hate that woman  my dear richard she exclaimed  well i do he persisted when she first came she was all right that fellow borrowdean seems to have done all the mischief  poor sir leslie she exclaimed demurely i thought him so delightful  obviously he replied i didnt i hate a fellow who doesnt do things himself and has a way of looking on which makes you feel a perfect idiot neither mr mannering nor mrs handsellnor youhave been the same since he was here  i gather she said softly that you do not find us improved  i do not he answered stolidly mrs handsell has begun to talk to you now about london of the theatres the dressmakers hurlingham ranelagh race meetings society and all that sort of rot she talks of them very cleverly she knows how to make the tinsel sparkle like real gold  she laughed softly  you are positively eloquent richard she declared do go on  then she goes for your uncle he continued without heeding her interruption she speaks of parliament of great causes of ambition until his eyes are on fire she describes new pleasures to you and you sit at her feet a mute worshipper i cant think why she ever came here shes absolutely the wrong sort of woman for a quiet country place like this i wish id never let her the place  you are a very foolish person she answered she came here simply because she was weary of cities and wanted to get as far away from them as possible only last night she said that she would be content never to breathe the air of a town again  lindsay tossed his cigarette away impatiently  oh i know exactly her way of saying that sort of thing he exclaimed a moment later she would be describing very cleverly and a little regretfully some wonderful sight or other only to be found in london  really she declared i am getting afraid of you you are more observant than i thought  there is one gift at least he answered which we country folk are supposed to possess we know truth when we see it but i am saying more than i have any right to i dont want to make you angry clara  she shook her head  you wont do that she said but i dont think you quite understand let me tell you something you know that i am an orphan dont you i do not remember my father at all and i can only just remember my mother i was brought up at a pleasant but very dreary boardingschool i had very few friends and no one came to see me except my uncle who was always very kind but always in a desperate hurry i stayed there until i was seventeen then my uncle came and fetched me and brought me straight here now that is exactly what my life has been what do you think of it  very dull indeed he answered frankly  she nodded  i have never been in london at all she continued i really only know what men and women are like from books or the one or two types i have met around here now do you think that that is enough to satisfy one of course it is very beautiful here i know and sometimes when the sun is shining and the birds singing and the sea comes up into the creeks well one almost feels content but the sun doesnt always shine richard and there are times when i am right down bored and i feel as though id love to draw my allowance from uncle pack my trunk and go up to london on my own  he laughed somehow all that she had said had sounded so natural that some part of his uneasiness was already passing away  yours he admitted is an extreme case i really dont know why your uncle has never taken you up for a month or so in the season  we have lived here for four years she said and he has never once suggested it he goes himself of course sometimes but i am quite sure that he doesnt enjoy it for days before he fidgets about and looks perfectly miserable and when he comes back he always goes off for a long walk by himself i am perfectly certain that for some reason or other he hates going yet he seems to have been everywhere to know every one to hear him talk with mrs handsell is like a new arabian nights to me  he nodded  your uncle was a very distinguished man he said i was only at college then but i remember what a fuss there was in all the papers when he resigned his seat  what did they say was the reason she asked eagerly  a slight disagreement with lord rochester and illhealth  absurd she exclaimed uncle is as strong as a horse  would you like him he asked to go back into political life  her eyes sparkled  of course i should  you may have your wish he said a little sadly i dont fancy he has been quite the same man since sir leslie borrowdean was here and mrs handsell never leaves him alone for a moment  she laughed  you talk as though they were conspirators she exclaimed  that is precisely what i believe them to be he answered grimly  richard  cant help it he declared i will tell you something that i have no right to tell you mrs handsell is not your friends real name  richard how exciting she exclaimed do tell me how you know  her solicitors told mine so when she took the farm  not her real name buti wonder they let it to her  oh her references were all right he answered my people saw to that i do not mean to insinuate for a moment that she had any improper reasons for calling herself mrs handsell or anything else she liked the explanations given were quite satisfactory but she has become very friendly with you and with your uncle and i think that she ought to have told you both about it  do you know her real name  no it is not my affair my solicitors knew and they were satisfied perhaps i ought not to have told you this but  hush she said they are coming out if you like you can take me down to the orchard wall and we will watch the tide come in  mannering came out alone and looked around the full moon was creeping into the sky the breath of wind which shook the leaves of the tall elm trees that shut in his little demesne from the village was soft and for the time of year wonderfully mild below through the orchard trees were faint visions of the marshland riven with creeks of silvery sea he turned back towards the room where redshaded lamps still stood upon the white tablecloth a curiously artificial daub of color after the splendour of the moonlit land  the night is perfect he exclaimed do you need a wrap or are you sufficiently acclimatized  she came out to him tall and slender in her black dinner gown the figure of a girl the pale passionate face of a woman to whom every moment of life had its own special and individual meaning her eyes were strangely bright there was a tenseness about her manner a restraint in her tone which seemed to speak of some emotional crisis she passed out into the quiet garden in itself so exquisitely in accordance with this sleeping land and even mannering was at once conscious of some alien note in these oldworld surroundings which had long ago soothed his ruffled nerves into the luxury of repose  a wrap she murmured how absurd come and let us sit under the cedar tree those young people seem to have wandered off and i want to talk to you  i am content to listen he answered it is a night for listeners this  i want to talk she continued and yetthe words seem difficult these wonderful days how quickly they seem to have passed  there are others to follow he answered smiling that is one of the joys of life here one can count on things  others for you she murmured you have pitched your tent i came here only as a wanderer  but scarcely a month ago he exclaimed you too  dont she interrupted a month ago it seemed to me possible that i might live here always i felt myself growing young again i believed that i had severed all the ties which bound me to the days which have gone before i was wrong it was the sort of folly which comes to one sometimes the sort of folly for which one pays  his face was almost white in the moonlight his deepset grey eyes were fixed upon her  you were contenta month ago he said you have been in london for two days and you have come back a changed woman why must you think of leaving this place why need you go at all  my friend she said softly i think that you know why it is very beautiful here and i have never been happier in all my life but one may not linger all ones days in the pleasant places one sleeps through the nights and is rested but the daysah they are different  i cannot reason with you he said you are too vague yetyou say that you have been contented here  i have been happy she murmured  then you must speak more plainly he insisted a note of passion throbbing in his hoarse tones i ask you againwhy do you talk of going back like a city slave whose days of holiday are over what is there in the world more beautiful than the gifts the gods shower on us here we have the sun and the sea and the wind by day and by nightthis it is the flower garden of life stay and pluck the roses with me  ah my friend she murmured if that were possible  she sank down into the seat under the cedar tree her hands were clasped nervously together her head was downcast  your words she continued her voice sinking almost to a whisper yet lacking nothing in distinctness are like wine they mount to the head they intoxicate they tempt and yet all the time one knows that it is not possible surely you yourselfin your heartmust know it  not i he answered fiercely the world would have claimed me if it could but i laughed at it our destinies are our own with our own fingers we mould and shape them  there is the little voice she said the little voice which rings even through our dreams lifeactual militant life i meanmay have its vulgarities its weariness and its disappointments but it is after all the only place for men and women the battle may be sordid and the prizes tinselyet it is only the cowards who linger without  then let you and me be cowards he answered we shall at least be happy  she shook her head a little sadly  i doubt it she answered happiness is a gift not a prize it comes seldom enough to those who seek it  he laughed scornfully  i am not a seeker he cried i possess it seems to me that all the beautiful things of life are here tonight listen do you hear the sea the full tide sweeping softly up into the land a long drawn out undernote of breathless harmonies the rustling of leaves there in the elm trees the faint night wind like the murmuring of angels lift your head was there anything ever sweeter than the perfume from that hedge of honeysuckle what can a man want more than these thingsand  go on  and the woman he loves there i have said it useless words enough you know very well that i love you i meant to have said nothing just yet but who could help iton such a night as this dont talk of going away berenice i want you here always  she held herself away from him her face was deathly white now her eyes questioned him fiercely  before i answer you you were in london last week  yes  why  i had business  in chelsea in merton street  he gave a little gasp  what do you know about that he asked almost roughly  you were seen there not for the first time the person whom you visitedi have heard about she is somewhat notorious is she not  he was very quiet pale to the lips a strange hunted expression had crept into his eyes  i want to know what took you there am i asking too much remember that you have asked me a good deal  has borrowdean anything to do with this he demanded  i have known sir leslie borrowdean for many years she answered and it is quite true that we have discussed certain mattersconcerning you  you have known sir leslie borrowdean for many years he repeated yet you met here as strangers  sir leslie divined my wishes she answered he knew that it was my wish to spend several months away from everybody and if possible unrecognized perhaps i had better make my confession at once my name is not mrs handsell i am the duchess of lenchester  mannering stood as though turned to stone the woman watched him eagerly she waited for him to speakin vain a sudden mist of tears blinded her she closed her eyes when she opened them mannering was gone     chapter v  the hesitation of mr mannering   the peculiar atmosphere of the room heavy with the newest perfume from the burlington arcade and the scent of exotic flowers at no time pleasing to him seemed more than usually oppressive to mannering as he fidgetted about waiting for the woman whom he had come to see he was conscious of a restless longing to open wide the windows take the flowers from their vases throw them into the street and poke out the fire the little room with all its associations its almost pathetic attempts at refinement its furniture which reeked of the tottenham court road was suddenly hateful to him he detested his presence there and its object he was already in a state of nervous displeasure when the door opened  the girl who entered seemed in a sense as ill in accord with such surroundings as himself she was plainly dressed in black her hair brushed back her complexion pale her eyes brilliant with a not altogether natural light she regarded him with a curious mixture of fear and welcome the latter however triumphed easily she came towards him with outstretched hand and a delightful smile  youso soon again she exclaimed were thereso many mistakes  mannerings face softened he was half ashamed of his irritation he answered her kindly  scarcely any hester he answered your typing is always excellent  her anxiety was only half allayed  there is nothing else wrong she demanded breathlessly  nothing whatever he assured her where is your mother  she sat down the light died out of her face  out she answered gone to brighton for the day what do you want with her  nothing he answered gravely i only wanted to know whether we were likely to be interrupted  she will not be in for some time the girl answered she is almost certain to stay down there and dine  he nodded  hester he asked do you know any onea man named borrowdean sir leslie borrowdean  she shook her head a little doubtfully  i have heard mother speak of him she said  he is a friend of hers then  she met him at a supper party at the savoy a few weeks ago she answered  and since  i believe so she talks about him a great deal why do you ask me this  i cannot tell you hester he said gravely by the bye do you think that she is likely to have mentioned my name to him  the girl flushed up to her eyebrows  ii dont know i am sorry she faltered you know what mother is if any one asked her questions she would be more than likely to answer them i do hope that she has not been making mischief  he left her anxiety unrelieved for some few moments he did not speak at all already he fancied that he could see the whole pitiful little incidentborrowdean diplomatic genial persistent the woman a fool fashioned to his own making himself the sacrifice yet the meaning of it all was dark to him  she moved over to his side her eyes and tone were full of appeal she sat close to him her long white fingers nervously interlocked  i am afraid of you more afraid than ever today she murmured you look stern and i dont understand why you have come  to see you hester he answered with a sudden impulse of kindness  ah no she interrupted choking back a little sob we both know so well that it is not that it is pity which brings you pity and nothing else you know very well what a difference it makes to me if i have your work to do and a letter sometimes and see you now and then i can bear everything but it is not easy it is never easy  of course it is not he assented hester have you thought over what i said to you last time i was here  she shook her head  what is the use of thinking she asked quietly i could not leave her  you mean that she would not let you go mannering asked  no it is not that the girl answered sometimes i think that she would be glad it is not that  he nodded gravely  i understand but  if you understand please do not say any more  but i must hester he persisted there is no one else to give you advice i know all that you can tell me and i say that this is no fitting home for you your mothers friends are not fit friends for you she has chosen her way in life and she will not brook any interference you can do no good by remaining with her on the contrary you are doing yourself a great deal of harm i am old enough to be your father child wise enough i hope to be your adviser you shall be my secretary and come and live at blakely  a faint flush stole into her anæmic one realized then that under different conditions she might have been pretty her face was no longer expressionless  you are so kind she said softly i shall always like to think of this and yetit is impossible  why  she hesitated  it is difficult to explain she said but my being here makes a difference i found it out once when i went away for a week some ofof mothers friends came to the house then whom she will not have when i am here if i were away altogetheroh i cant explain but i would not dare to go  mannering seemed to have much to sayand said nothing this queer palefaced girl with her earnest eyes and few simple words had silenced him she was rightright at least from her own point of view a certain sense of shame suddenly oppressed him he was acutely conscious of his only halfadmitted reason for this visit he had argued for himself it was his own passionate desire to free himself from associations that were little short of loathsome which had prompted this visit and then what he had dreaded most of all happened as they sat facing one another in the silent halfdarkened room mannering trying to bring himself into accord with halfadmitted but repugnant convictions she watching him hopelessly the tinkle of a hansom bell sounded outside the sudden stopping of a horse the rattle of a latchkey and she was in the room mannering rose to his feet with a little exclamation  the woman stood and looked in upon them she wore a pink cloth gown a flowergarlanded hat a white coaching veil beneath which her features were indistinguishable she brought with her a waft of strong perfume her figure was a living suggestion of the struggle between maturity and the corsetiére before she spoke she laughednot altogether pleasantly  you here again she exclaimed to mannering upon my word im not a ghost hester go and see about some tea and a brandy and soda billy foa brought me up on his motor and im half choked with dust  the girl rose obediently and quitted the room the woman untwisted her veil drew out the pins from her hat and threw both upon the sofa then she turned suddenly upon mannering  look here she said the last twice youve been here you seem to have carefully chosen times when i am out i dont understand it it cant be that you want to see that chit of a girl of mine why dont you come when i ask you why do you act as though i were something to be avoided  mannering rose to his feet  i came today without knowing where you were he answered but i will admit that i wished to see hester  what for  i have asked her to come and live at blakely with my niece and myself she is an excellent typist and i require a secretary  the woman looked at him angrily without her veil she displayed features not in themselves unattractive but a complexion somewhat impaired by the use of cosmetics the powder upon her cheeks was even then visible  what about me she asked sharply  mannering looked her steadily in the face  i do not think he said that such a life would suit you  she was an angry woman and she did not become angry gracefully  you mean that im not good enough for you and your friends in the country thats what you mean isnt it and i should like to know if im not whose fault it is tell me that will you  mannering flinched though almost imperceptibly  i meant simply what i said he said blakely would not suit you at all we have few friends there and our simple life would not attract you in the slightest with hester it is different she would have her work in which she takes some interest and i believe the change would be in every way good for her  well she shant come the woman said throwing herself into a chair and regarding him insolently im not going to live all aloneand be talked about dont stare at me like that lawrence im the childs mother am i not  it is because you are her mother he said quietly that i thought you might be glad to find a suitable home for her  whats good enough for me ought to be good enough for her she answered doggedly  mannering was silent for a moment this woman seemed to belong to a different world from that with whose denizens he was in any way familiar years of isolation and a certain epicureanism of taste from which necessity had never taken the fine edge had made him a little intolerant he could see nothing that was not absolutely repulsive in this woman whose fine eyes were seeking even now to attract his admiration she was making the best of herself she had chosen the darkest corner of the room and her pose was not ungraceful her skirts were skilfully raised to show just as much as possible of her long slender foot with the patent shoes and silver buckles she knew that her ankles were above reproach and her dress becoming a dozen men had paid her compliments during the day yet she knew that every admiring glance every whispered word which had come to her today or for many days past would count for nothing if only she could pierce for a single moment the unchanging coldness of the man who sat watching her now with the face of a sphynx a slow tide of passion welled up in her heart was not he a man and free and was not she a woman it was not much she asked from him no pledge no bondage his kindness only she told herself was all she craved she wanted him to look at her as other men looked at her who was he that he should set himself on a pedestal perhaps he had grown shy from the rust of his country life the slow drifting apart from the world of men and women perhapsshe rose swiftly to her feet and crossed the room     chapter vi  sacrifice   she leaned over him one hand on the back of his chair the other seeking in vain for his  lawrence she said you grow colder and more unkind every day what have i done to change you so i am a foolish woman i know but there are things which i cannot forget  he rose at once to his feet and stood apart from her  i thought he said i believed that we understood one another  she laughed softly  i am very sure that i do not understand you she said and as for youi do not believe that you have ever understood any woman there was a time lawrence  his impassivity was gone he threw out his hands  remember he said there is a promise between us dont break it dont dare to break it  she looked at him curiously a new idea concerning this man and his avoidance of her crept into her mind it was at least consoling to her vanity and it left her a chance she had roused him too at last and that was worth something  why not she asked moving a step towards him it was a foolish promise it has done neither of us any good it has spoilt a part of my life why should i keep silence and let it go on to the end do you know what it has made of me this promise  he shrank back  dont i have done all i could  all you could she repeated scornfully you drew a diagram of your duty and you have moved like a machine along the lines you talk like a pharisee lawrence come you knew me years ago do you find me changed tell me the truth  yes he admitted you are changed  she nodded  you admit that perhaps perhaps she continued more slowly there are things about me now of which you dont approve my friends are a little fast i go out alone i daresay people have said things there you see i am very frank i mean to be i mean you to know that whatever i am the fault is yours  you are as god or the devil made you he answered hardly you are what you would have become in any case  lawrence  already he hated the memory of his words true or not they were spoken to a woman who was cowering under them as under a lash he was at a disadvantage now if she had met him with anger they might have cried quits but he had seen her wince seen her sudden pallor and it was not a pleasant sight  forgive me he said i do not know quite what i am saying you have broken a compact which i had hoped might have lasted all our days let us be better friends if you will but let us keep that promise which we made to one another  it was so many years ago she said in a low tone i am afraid to think how many it makes me lonely lawrence to look ahead i am afraid of growing old  he looked at her steadily yes the signs were there she was a goodlooking woman today a handsome woman in some lights but she had reached the limit it was a matter of a few years at most and thenhe stood with his hands behind his back  it is a fear which we must all share he said quietly the only antidote is work  work she repeated scornfully that is the mans resource what about us what about me  it is no matter of sex he declared we all make our own choice we are what we make of ourselves  it is not true she answered bluntly not with us at any rate we are what our menkind make of us oh what cowards you all are  cowards  yes you do what mischief you choose and then soothe your conscience with platitudes you will take hold of pleasure with both hands but your shoulders are not broad enough for the pack of responsibility dont look at me as though i were a mile off lawrence as though this were simply an impersonal discussion i am speaking to youof you you avoid me whenever you can i dont often get a chance of speaking to you you shall listen now you live the life of a poet and a scholar they tell me you live in a beautiful home you take care that nothing ugly or disturbing shall come near you you are pleased with it arent you you think yourself better than other men well you are making a big mistake a man doesnt have to answer for his own life only he has to carry the burden of the lives his influence has wrecked and spoilt i know just what you think of me i am a middleaged woman clinging to my youth and pleasuresthe sort of pleasures for which you have a vast contempt there isnt an hour of my days of which you wouldnt disapprove im not your sort of woman at all and yet i was all right once lawrence and what i am now she paused what i am now  hester came in followed by a maid with the teatray she looked from one to the other a little anxiously the atmosphere of the room seemed charged with electricity mannerings face was grey her mother was nervously crumpling into a ball her tiny lace handkerchief mrs phillimore rose abruptly from her seat  have you got the brandy and soda hester she asked  im afraid i forgot it mother the girl answered maynt i make you some russian tea ive had the lemon sliced  the woman laughed a little unnaturally  what a dutiful daughter she exclaimed thats right i want looking after dont i ill have the tea hester but send it up to my room im going to lie down that wretched motoring has given me a headache and im dining out tonight goodbye mr mannering if i dont see you again  she nodded without glancing in his direction and left the room the maid arranged the teatray and departed hester showed no signs of being aware that anything unusual had happened she made a little desultory conversation mannering answered in monosyllables  when at last he put his cup down he rose to go  you are quite sure hester he said you have made up your mind  she too rose and came over to him  you know that i am right she answered quietly the life you offer me would be paradise but i dare not even think of it i may not do any good here perhaps i dont but i cant come away  you are a true daughter of your sex he said smiling the keynote of your life must be sacrifice  perhaps we are not so unwise after all she answered for i think that there are more happy women in the world than men  there are more i think who deserve to be dear he answered holding her hand for a moment goodbye  mannering walked in somewhat abstracted fashion to the corner of the street and signalled for a hansom with his foot upon the step he hesitated     chapter vii  the duchesss at home   the perfect man the duchess murmured as she stirred her tea does not exist i know a dozen perfect women dear dull creatures and plenty of men who know how to cover up the flaw but there is something in the composition of the male sex which keeps them always a little below the highest pinnacle  it is purely a matter of concealment her friend declared women are cleverer humbugs than men  borrowdean shrugged his shoulders  i know your perfect woman he remarked softly you search for her through the best years of your life and when you have found her you avoid her that he added handing his empty cup to a footman is why i am a bachelor  the duchess regarded him complacently  my dear sir leslie she said i am afraid you will have to find a better reason for your miserable state the perfect woman would certainly have nothing to do with you if you found her  on the contrary he declared confidently i am convinced that she would find me attractive  the duchess shook her head  your theory she declared is antiquated like and unlike do not attract we seek in others the qualities which we strive most zealously to develop in ourselves i know a case in point  good sir leslie remarked i like examples the logic of them appeals to me  the duchess half closed her eyes for a moment she was silent she seemed to be listening to something a long way off through the open windows of her softly shaded drawingrooms odourous with flowers came the rippling of water falling from a fountain in the conservatory the lazy hum of a mowing machine on the lawn the distant tinkling of a hansom bell in the square but these were not the sounds which for a moment had changed her face  i myself she murmured am an example  a woman who had risen to go sat down again  do go on duchess she exclaimed anything in the nature of a personal confession is so fascinating and you know you are such an enigma to all of us  am i she answered smiling then i am likely to remain so  a perfectly obvious person like myself the woman remarked is always fascinated by the unusual but if you are really not going to give yourself away duchess i am afraid i must move on one hates to leave your beautifully cool rooms shall i see you tonight i wonder at esholt house  perhaps  there were still many people in the room some fresh arrivals occupied his hostesss attention and borrowdean with a resigned shrug of the shoulders prepared to depart he had come hoping for an opportunity to be alone for a few minutes with the duchess and himself a skilful tactician in such small matters he could not but admire the way she had kept him at arms length and then the opportunity for a master stroke came a servant sought him out with a card a man of method he seldom left his rooms without instructions as to where he was to be found  the gentleman begged you to excuse his coming here sir the man whispered confidentially but he is returning to the country this evening and was anxious to see you he is quite ready to wait your convenience  borrowdean held the card in his hand scrutinizing it with impassive face was this a piece of unparalleled good fortune or simply a trick of the fates to tempt him on to catastrophe with that wonderful swiftness of thought which was part of his mental equipment he balanced the chancesand took his risk  i should be glad he said looking the servant in the face if you would show the gentleman up here as an ordinary visitor i should like to find you down stairs when i come out you understand  perfectly sir the man answered and withdrew  mannering had no idea whose house he was in the address borrowdeans servant had given him had been simply 81 grosvenor square nevertheless he was conscious of a little annoyance as he followed the servant up the broad stairs he would much have preferred waiting until borrowdean had concluded his call he remembered his grey travelling clothes and all his natural distaste for social amenities returned with unabated force as he neared the receptionrooms and heard the softly modulated rise and fall of feminine voices the swishing of silks and muslin the faint perfume of flowers and scents which seemed to fill the air at the last moment he would have withdrawn but his guide seemed deaf his words passed unheeded his name very softly but very distinctly had been announced he had no option but to pass into the room and play the cards which fate and his friend had dealt him  borrowdean rose to greet his friend mannering not knowing who his hostess might be and feeling absolutely no curiosity concerning her confined his attention wholly to the man whom he had come to seek  i did not wish to disturb you here borrowdean he said quickly but if your call is over could you come away for a few minutes i have a matter to discuss with you  borrowdean smiled slightly and laid his hand upon the others shoulder  by all means mannering he answered but since you have discovered our little secret dont you think that you had better speak to our hostess  mannering was puzzled but his eyes followed borrowdeans slight gesture berenice who at the sound of his voice had suddenly abandoned her conversation and risen to her feet was within a few feet of him a sudden light swept into mannerings face  you he exclaimed softly  her hands went out towards him borrowdean with an almost imperceptible movement checked his advance  so you see we are found out after all duchess he said turning to her you have known mrs handsell mannering let me present you now to her other self duchess you see that our recluse has come to his senses at last i must really introduce you formally mr manneringthe duchess of lenchester  berenice arrested in her forward movement watched mannerings face eagerly so carefully modulated had been borrowdeans voice that no word of his had reached beyond their own immediate circle it was as though a silent tableau were being played out between the three and mannering to whom repression had become a habit gave little indication of anything he might have felt borrowdeans fixed smile betokened nothing but an ordinary interest in the introduction of two friends and the duchesss back was turned towards her friends they both waited for mannering to speak  this he said slowly is a surprise i had no idea when i called to see borrowdean here of the pleasure which was in store for me  borrowdean dropped his eyeglass  are you serious my dear mannering he exclaimed do you mean to say that you came here  only to see you mannering interrupted that you should know perfectly well i am sorry to hurry you out but the few minutes conversation which i desired with you is of some importance and my train leaves in an hour i hope that you will pardon me he added looking steadily at berenice if i hurry away one of your guests  she laughed quite in her natural manner  i will forgive anything she said except that you should hurry away yourself so unceremoniously come and sit down near me i want to talk to you about blakeley  she swept her gown on one side disclosing a vacant place on the settee where she had been sitting for a second her eyes said more to him than her courteous but halfcareless words of invitation mannering made no movement forward  i am sorry he said but it is impossible for me to stay  she seemed to dismiss him and the whole subject with a careless little shrug of the shoulders which was all the farewell she vouchsafed to either of them a woman who had just entered seemed to absorb her whole attention the two men passed out  mannering spoke no word until they stood upon the pavement then he turned almost savagely upon his companion  this is a trick of yours i suppose he exclaimed damn you and your meddling borrowdean why cant you leave me and my affairs alone no i am not going your way let us separate here  borrowdean shook his head  you are unreasonable mannering he said i have done only what i believe you were on your way to ask me to do i have brought you and berenice together again it was for both your sakes if there has been any misunderstanding between you it would be better cleared up  mannering gripped his arm  let us go to your rooms borrowdean he said it is time we understood one another  willingly borrowdean said but your train  let my train go mannering answered there are some things i have to say to you  borrowdean called a hansom the two men drove off together     chapter viii  the mannering mystery   borrowdean was curter than usual even abrupt the calm geniality of his manner had departed he spoke in short terse sentences and he had the air of a man struggling to subdue a fit of perfectly reasonable and justifiable anger it was a carefully cultivated pose he even refrained from his customary cigarette  look here mannering he said there are times when a few plain words are worth an hours conversation will you have them from me  yes  this thing was started six months ago soon after those two byeelections in yorkshire even the most despondent of us then saw that the government could scarcely last its time we had a meeting and we attempted to form on paper a trial cabinet you know our weakness we have to try to form a national party out of a number of men who although they call themselves broadly liberals are as far apart as the very poles of thought it was as much as they could do to sit in the same room together from the opening of the meeting until its close there was but one subject upon which every one was unanimous that was the absolute necessity of getting you to come back to our aid  you flatter me mannering said with fine irony  you yourself borrowdean continued without heeding the interruption encouraged us from the first pronouncement of this wonderful new policy you sprang into the arena we were none of us ready you were it is true that your weapon was the pen but you reached a great public the country today considers you the champion of free trade  pass on mannering interrupted brusquely all this is wasted time  a smaller meeting borrowdean continued was held with a view of discussing the means whereby you could be persuaded to rejoin us at that meeting the duchess of lenchester was present  mannering who had been pacing the room stopped short he grasped the back of a chair and turning round faced borrowdean  well  you know what place the duchess has held in the councils of our party since the dukes death borrowdean continued she has the political instinct if she were a man she would be a leader all the great ladies are on the other side but the duchess is more than equal to them all she entertains magnificently and with tact she never makes a mistake she is part and parcel of the liberal party it was she who volunteered to make the first effort to bring you back  mannering turned his head apparently he was looking out of the window  her methods borrowdean continued did not commend themselves to us but beggars must not be choosers besides the duchess was in love with her own scheme such objections as we made were at once overruled  he paused but mannering said nothing he was still looking out of the window though his eyes saw nothing of the street below or the great club buildings opposite a scent of roses lost now and then in the salter fragrance of the night breeze sweeping over the marshes the magic of a wonderful whiteclad presence the low words the sense of a world apart a world of speechless beauty what empty dreams a palace built in a poets fancy upon a quicksand  the duchess borrowdean continued undertook to discover from you what prospects there were if any of your return to political life she took none of us into her confidence we none of us knew what means she meant to employ she disappeared she communicated with none of us we none of us had the least idea what had become of her time went on and we began to get a little uneasy we had a meeting and it was arranged that i should come down and see you i came i saw you i saw the duchess the situation very soon became clear to me instead of the duchess converting you you had very nearly converted the duchess  i can assure you mannering began  let me finish borrowdean pleaded i realized the situation at a glance your attitude i was not so much surprised at but the attitude of the duchess i must confess amazed me i came to the conclusion that i had found my way into a forgotten corner of the world where the lotos flowers still blossomed and the sooner i was out of it the better now i think that brings us mannering up to the present time  mannering turned from the window out of which he had been steadfastly gazing there was a strained look under his eyes and little trace of the tan upon his cheeks he had the air of a jaded and a weary man  that is all then he remarked i can still catch my train  borrowdean held out his hand  no he said it is not all this explanation i have made for your sake mannering and it has been a truthful and full one now it is my turn i have a few words to say to you on my own account  mannering paused there was a note of something unusual in borrowdeans voice a portent of things behind mannering involuntarily straightened himself something was awakened in him which had lain dormant for many yearsdormant since those old days of battle of swift attack of ambushed defence and the clamour of brilliant tongues some of the old light flashed in his eyes  say it thenquickly  we speak of great things borrowdean continued and the catching of a train is a trifle my wardrobe and house are at your service dont hurry me  mannering smiled  go on he said  the men who count in this world borrowdean declared calmly lighting a cigarette are either thinkers of great thoughts or doers of great deeds to the former belong the poets and the sentimentalists to the latter the statesmen and the soldiers  what have i done mannering murmured that i should be sent back to kindergarten platitudes such as this bore me let me catch my train  in a moment to all my arguments and appeals to all my entreaties to you to realize yourself to do your duty to us to history and to posterity you have replied in one manner only you have spoken from the mushroom pedestal of the sentimentalist not a single word that has fallen from your lips has rung true you have spoken as though your eyes were blind all the time to the letters of fire which truth has spelled out before you any further argument with you is useless because you are not honest you conceal your true position and you adopt a false defence therefore i relinquish my task you can go and grow your roses and think your poetry and call it life if you will but before you go i should like you to know that i at least am not deceived i do not believe in you mannering i ask you a question and i challenge you to answer it what is your true reason for making a scrapheap of your career  are you my friend mannering asked quietly that you wish to pry behind the curtain of my life if i have other reasons they concern myself alone  borrowdean shook his head he had scored but he took care to show no sign of triumph  the issue is too great he said to be tried by the ordinary rules which govern social life will you presume that i am your friend and let us consider the whole matter afresh together  i will not mannering answered but i will do this i will answer your question there is another reason which makes my reappearance in public life impossible not even your subtlety borrowdean could remove it i do not even wish it removed i mean to live my own life and not to be pitchforked back into politics to suit the convenience of a few adventurous officeseekers and the duchess of lenchester  mannering  but mannering had gone                                       borrowdean felt that this was a trying day after a battle with mannering he was face to face with an angry woman to whose presence an imperious little note had just summoned him berenice was dressed for a royal dinner party and she had only a few minutes to spare nevertheless she contrived to make them very unpleasant ones for borrowdean  the affair was entirely an accident he pleaded  it was nothing of the sort she answered bluntly i know you too well for that your bringing him here without warning was an unwarrantable interference with my affairs  borrowdean could hold his own with men but berenice in her own room a wonderful little paradise of soft colourings and luxury so perfectly chosen that it was rather felt than seen berenice in her marvellous gown with the necklace upon her bosom and the tiara flashing in her dark hair was an overwhelming opponent borrowdean was helpless he could not understand the attack itself he failed altogether to appreciate its tenour  forgive me he protested but i did not know that you had any plans all that you told us on your return from blakely was that you had failed so far as you were concerned the matter seemed to me to be over and with it i imagined your interest in mannering i brought him here  well  because i wished him to know who you were i wished him to understand the improbability of your ever again returning to blakely  you are telling the truth now at any rate she remarked curtly or what sounds like the truth why did you trouble in the matter at all where i have failed you are not likely to succeed  borrowdean smiled for the first time  i have still some hopes of doing so he admitted  the duchess glanced at the little louis seize timepiece and hesitated  you had better abandon them she said lawrence mannering may be wrong or he may be right but he believes in his choice he has no ambition you have no motive left to work upon  borrowdean shook his head  you are wrong duchess he remarked simply i never believed in mannerings sentimentality today with his own lips he has confessed to me that another an unbroached reason stands behind his refusal  and he never told me the duchess murmured involuntarily  duchess borrowdean answered with a faint cynical parting of the lips there are matters which a man does not mention to the woman in whose high opinion he aims at holding an exalted place  there was a knock at the door the duchesss maid entered carrying a long cloak of glimmering lace and satin  the duchess nodded  i come at once hortense she said in french sir leslie she added turning towards him you are making a great mistake and i advise you to be careful you are one of those who think ill of all men such men as lawrence mannering belong to a race of human beings of whom you know nothing i listened to you once and i was a fool you could as soon teach me to believe that you were a saint as that mannering had anything in his past or present life of which he was ashamed now hortense  borrowdean walked off still smiling how simple half the world was     chapter ix  the pumping of mrs phillimore   hester sprang to her feet eagerly as she heard the front door close and standing behind the curtain she watched the man who was already upon the pavement looking up and down the street for a hansom his erect distinguished figure was perfectly familiar to her it was sir leslie borrowdean again  she resumed her seat in front of the typewriter and touched the keys idly in a few moments what she had been expecting happened her mother entered the room  of her advent there were the usual notifications an immense rustling of silken skirts and an overwhelming odour of the latest bond street perfume she flung herself into a chair and regarded her daughter with a complacent smile  that delightful man has been to see me again she exclaimed i could scarcely believe it when mary brought me his card by the bye where is mary i want her to try to take that stain out of my pink silk skirt i shall have to wear it tonight  i will ring for her directly the girl answered so that was sir leslie borrowdean mother why did he come to see you again so soon  i havent the least idea mrs phillimore announced but i thought it was very sweet of him it seems all the more remarkable when one considers the sort of man he is hes very ambitious you know and devoted to politics  where did you meet him first hester asked  it was at the metropole at bexhill mrs phillimore answered we motored down there one day and lena roberts told me that she heard him inquiring who i was directly we came into the room he joined our party at luncheon billy knew him slightly so i made him go over and ask him  hester nodded and seemed to be absorbed in some trifling defect of one of the keys of her typewriter  does he still ask you many questions about mr mannering mother she asked quietly  about mr mannering mrs phillimore repeated with raised eyebrows why he scarcely ever mentions his name  she took up a small mirror from the table by her side and critically touched her hair  about mr mannering indeed she repeated why do you ask me such a question  the girl hesitated  do you really want to know mother she asked  of course  when mr mannering was here last hester said he asked me whether sir leslie borrowdean was a friend of yours i fancy that they are political acquaintances but i dont think that they are on very good terms  mrs phillimore laid down the mirror and yawned  well theres nothing very strange about that she declared lawrence isnt the sort to get on with many people especially since he went and buried himself in the country how pale you are looking child why dont you go and take a walk instead of hammering away at that old typewriter any one would think that you had to do it for a living  i prefer to earn my own living the girl answered and i am not in the least tired tell me are you going to see sir leslie borrowdean again mother  the woman on the couch smoothed her hair once more with a smile of gratification  sir leslie has asked me to join a small party of friends for dinner at the carlton this evening she announced why on earth are you looking at me like that child youre always grumbling that my friends are a fast lot and dont suit you you cant say anything against sir leslie  the girl had risen to her feet the trouble in her face was manifest  mother she said slowly i wish that you were not going i wish that you would have nothing whatever to do with sir leslie borrowdean  good heavensand why not the woman exclaimed suddenly sitting up  i believe that he only asked you because he has an idea that you can tell himsomething he wants to know about mr mannering the girl answered steadily i dont think that you ought to go  rubbish her mother answered crossly i dont believe that he has such an idea in his head as though he couldnt ask me for the sake of my company and if he does ask me questions im not obliged to answer them am i do you think that im to be turned inside out like a schoolgirl  sir leslie is very clever and he is very unscrupulous the girl answered i wish you werent going i believe that he wants to find out things  mrs phillimore frowned uneasily  im not a fool she said hes welcome to all he can get to know through me i dont know what you want to try to make me uncomfortable for hester im sure sir leslie has never betrayed the least curiosity about mr mannering and i dont believe that hes any such idea in his head upon my word i dont see why you should think it impossible that sir leslie should come here just for the sake of improving an acquaintance which he found pleasant thats what he gave me to understand and he put it very nicely too  i do not think that sir leslie is that sort of man mother  and i dont see how you know anything about it was the sharp response ring the bell please i want to speak to mary about my skirt  you mean to dine with him then mother she asked crossing the room towards the bell  of course ive accepted tonight and as often as he chooses to ask me now dont upset me please i want to look my best tonight and if i get angry my hair goes all out of curl  the girl went back to her typewriter she unfolded a sheet of copy and placed it on the stand before her  if you have made up your mind mother i suppose you will go she said stilli wish you wouldnt  mrs phillimore shrugged her shoulders  if i did what you wished all the time she remarked pettishly i might as well drown myself at once cant you understand hester she added with a sudden change of manner that i must do something to help me to forget you dont want to see me go mad do you  the girl turned half round in her chair she was fronting a mirror she caught a momentary impression of herselfpallid holloweyed weary she sighed  there are other ways of forgetting she murmured there is work  her mother laughed scornfully  you have chosen your way she said let me choose mine turn round hester  the girl obeyed her languidly her mother eyed her with an attention she seldom vouchsafed to anything her plain black frock was illfitting and worn she wore no ribbon or jewellery or adornment of any sort negatively her face was not illpleasing but her figure was angular and her complexion almost anæmic the woman on the couch represented other things she was tastefully though somewhat elaborately dressed she wore chains and trinkets about her neck rings upon her fingers and in her face had begun in earnest the tragic struggle between an actual forty and presumptive twenty she laughed again a little hardly  and you are my daughter she exclaimed you are one of the freaks of heredity im perfectly certain you dont belong to me and as for him  stop the girl cried  the woman nodded  quite right she said i didnt mean to mention him i wont again but we are different arent we i wonder why you stay with me i wonder you dont go and make a home for yourself somewhere i know that you hate all the things i do and care for and all my friends why dont you go away it would be more comfortable for both of us  i have no wish to go away the girl said softly and i dont think that we interfere with one another very much do we this is the first time i have ever made a remark about anyof your friends tonight i cannot help it sir leslie borrowdean is mr mannerings enemy i am sure of it that is why i do not like the idea of your going out with him it doesnt seem to be rightand i am afraid  afraid you little idiot  sir leslie borrowdean is a very clever man the girl said he is a very clever man and he has been a lawyer that sort of person knows how to ask questionstofind out things  rubbish the woman remarked sitting up on the couch why do you try to make me so uncomfortable hester sir leslie may be very clever but i am not exactly a fool myself  she spoke confidently but under the delicate coating of rouge her cheeks had whitened  besides she continued sir leslie has never even mentioned mr mannerings name in anything except the most casual way you dont understand everything hester of course lena and billy aswell and rothe and all of them are all right but they are just a littlewell you would call it fast and it does one good to be seen with a different set sometimes sir leslie borrowdean and his friends are altogether different of course  the girl bent over her work  no doubt mother she answered theres mary stamping on the floor i expect she has your bath ready  an hour or so later mrs phillimore departed in a hired brougham her hair had been carefully arranged by a local expert who had an establishment in the next street her pink silk gown had come through the ordeal of cleansing with remarkable success and the heels on her new evening shoes resembled more than anything else miniature stilts her face was wreathed in smiles and she possessed the good conscience and light heart of a woman who feels that she has made a successful toilette all the vague misgivings of a short while ago had vanished she gave her hair a final touch in the side window of the carriage as she drove off and quite forgot to wave her hand to hester who was standing at the window to see her go if any misgivings remained at all between the two they were not with her she settled herself back amongst the cushions with a little sigh of content sir leslie was a most charming person and evidently not at all insensible to her charms she was sure that she was going to have a delightful evening                                       borrowdean if he possessed no conscience was not altogether free from some kindred eccentricity he was reminded sharply enough of the fact about one oclock the next morning when the door of the little house on merton street was suddenly opened before he could touch the bell framed in a little slanting gleam of light hester still wearing her plain black gown stood and looked at him his careless words of explanation died away upon his lips the fire which flashed from her hollow eyes seemed to wither up the very sources of speech within him the half lights were kind to her he saw nothing of the hollow cheeks the weariness of her pose and manner had passed like magic away she stood there erect as a dart her head thrown back a curious mixture of scorn of loathing and of fear in her expression she looked at him steadily and he felt his cheeks burn he was ashamedashamed of himself ashamed of his errand  your mother he said struggling to look away from her isa little unwell the heat of the room  she swept down the steps and passed him before he could reach her side she was tugging at the handle of the carriage door  mother she cried through the window undo the door  but mrs phillimore made no answer when at last the door was opened she was discovered half asleep in a corner her hair was in some disorder and her cheeks no longer preserved that even colouring which is a result of the artistic use of the rougepot her head was thrown back and she was apparently asleep hester stifled a sob she took her mother by the arm and shook her  mrs phillimore sat up and smiled a sleepy smile she made a few incoherent remarks they helped her into the house and into an easychair where she promptly turned her face towards the cushions and resumed her slumber sir leslie moved towards the door then hesitated  miss phillimore he said i cannot tell you how sorry i am that this should have happened  she was on her knees before her mother she turned and rose slowly to her feet sir leslie never quite forgot her gesture as she motioned him towards the door it was one of the most uncomfortable moments of his life  i am afraid  she did not speak a word yet sir leslie obeyed what seemed to him more eloquent than words he turned and left the room and the house without any change in her tense expression she waited until she heard him go then she sank upon her knees on the hearthrug and hid her face in her hands     chapter x  the man with a motive   mannering sat alone in the shade of his cedar tree he had walked in his rosegarden amongst a wilderness of drooping blossoms for the season of roses was gone he had crossed the marshland seawards only to find a little crowd of holidaymakers in possession of the golf links and the green tufted stretch of sandy shore the day had been long almost irksome a fit of restlessness had driven him from his study he seemed to have lost all power of concentration for once his brain had failed him the shadowy companions who stood ever between him and solitude remained uninvoked his cigar had burnt out between his fingers he threw it impatiently away these were the days the hours he dreaded  clara came down the garden from the house and seeing him crossed the lawn and sat down beside him  why my dear uncle she exclaimed you look almost as dull as i feel let us be miserable together  with all my heart he answered whilst we are about it can we invent a cause  invent she repeated i do not think we need either of us look very far every one seems to have gone away whose presence made this place endurable uncle do you know when mrs handsell is coming back she promised to write and i have never heard a word  mannering turned his head a little rustling wind had stolen in from seaward above their heads flights of seagulls were floating out towards the creeks he watched them idly until they dropped down  i do not think that she will come back at all he said quietly i heard today that the place was to let again  and sir leslie borrowdean  i think you may take it for granted mannering remarked dryly that we shall see no more of him  the girl leaned back and sighed  uncle what is it that makes you such a hermit she asked  age perhaps and experience he answered lightly there are not many people in the world clara who are worth while  mrs handsell was worth while she murmured  mannering did not reply  and sir leslie borrowdean she continued was more than just worth while i think that he was delightful  very young ladies and very old ones mannering remarked grimly generally like borrowdean  and what about mrs handsell she asked with a spice of malice in her tone  mrs handsell mannering answered coolly was a very charming woman since both these people have passed out of our lives clara i scarcely see why we need discuss them  one must talk about something she answered at least i must talk and you must pretend to listen i positively cannot exist in the house by myself any longer  where is richard mannering asked  gone into norwich to dine at the barracks with some stupid men not that i mind his going she added hastily i wish hed stay away for a month of course hes a very good sort and all that but hes deadly monotonous uncle really as a matter of curiosity before i get to be an old woman i should like to see one other young man  plenty on the links just now  i know it i sat out near the ninth hole all this morning there are some cambridge boys who looked quite nice one of them was really delightful when i showed him where his ball was but i cant consider that an introduction can i heavens whos this  behind the trim maidservant already crossing the lawn and within a few yards of them came a strange almost tragical figure her plain black clothes and hat were powdered with dust there were deep lines under her eyes she swayed a little when she walked as though with fatigue she seemed to bring with her into the cool quiet garden with its country odours and general air of peace an alien note one almost heard the deep undercry from a faraway world of sufferingthe great evermoving wheels seemed to have caught her up and thrown her down in this most incongruous of places clara in her cool white dress her fresh complexion her general air of health and girlish vigour seemed as she rose to her feet a creature of another sex almost of another world the two girls exchanged for a moment wondering glances then mannering intervened  hester he exclaimed whyis there anything wrong  nothingvery serious she answered but i had to see you i thought that i had better come  he held out his hands  you have had a tiring journey he said you must come into the house and let them find you something to eat clara this is hester phillimore the daughter of an old friend of mine will you see about a room for her and lend her anything she requires  of course clara answered wont you come into the house with me she added pleasantly to the girl you must be horribly tired travelling this hot weather and this is such an outoftheway corner of the world  hester lingered for a moment glancing nervously at mannering  i must go back tonight she said i only came because i thought that it would be quicker than writing  tonight he exclaimed but my dear girl that is impossible there are no trains and you are tired out already go into the house with my niece and we will have a talk afterwards  he walked across the lawn with them talking pleasantly to hester as though her visit were in no sense of the word unpleasant or an extraordinary event but when he returned to his seat under the cedar tree his whole expression was changed the lines about his face had insensibly deepened he leaned a little forward looking with weary unseeing eyes into the tangled shrubbery had all men he wondered this secret chapter in their livesthe one sore place so impossible to forget the cupboard of shadows never wholly closed shadows which at any moment might steal out and encompass his darkening life he sat there motionless and his thoughts travelled backwards there were many things in his life which he had forgotten but never this every word that had been spoken every detail in that tragic little scene seemed to glide into his memory with a distinctness and amplitude which time had never for one second dimmed so it must be until the end he forgot the girl and her errand he forgot the carefully cultivated philosophy which for so many years had helped him towards forgetfulness so he sat until the sound of their voices upon the lawn recalled him to the present  i will leave you to have your talk with uncle clara said afterwards i will come back to you there he is sitting under the cedar tree  the girl came swiftly over to his side for a moment the compassion which he had always felt for her swept away the memory of his own sorrow her pallid colourless face had lost everything except expression if the weariness which seemed to have found a home in her eyes was just now absent it was because a worse thing was shining out of thema fear of which there were traces even in her hurried walk and tone he rose at once and held out his hands  come and sit down hester he said and dont look so frightened  she obeyed him at once  i am frightened she said because i feel that i ought not to have come here and yet i thought that you ought to know at once what has happened sir leslie borrowdean has been coming to see mother last night he took her out to dinner she came homelateshe was not quite herself this morning she was frightened and hysterical she saidthat she had been talking  to sir leslie borrowdean  yes  mannering showed no signs of dismay he took the girls thin white hand in his and held it almost affectionately  i am very glad to know this at once dear he said and you did what was right and kind when you came to see me but sir leslie borrowdean has no reason to make himself my enemy on the contrary just now he seems particularly anxious to cultivate my friendship  then why the girl asked has he gone out of his way toto  mannering stopped her  he had a motive of course borrowdean is one of those men who do nothing without a motive i believe that i can even guess what it is dont let this thing distress you too much hester i do not think that we have anything to worry about  but he knows  i could not imagine a man mannering answered better able to keep a secret  the girl sat silent for a moment  i suppose i have been an idiot she remarked  you have been nothing of the sort mannering asserted firmly you have done just what is kind and what will help me to save the situation i must confess that i should not like to have been taken by surprise you have saved me from that now let us put the whole subject away for a time how i wish that you could stay here for a few days  the girl smiled a little piteously  i ought not to have left her even for so long as this she said i must go back tomorrow morning by the first train  he nodded he felt that it was useless to combat her resolution  you and i he said gravely have both our burdens to carry only it seems a little unfair that providence should have made my back so much the broader listen hester  the full murmur of the sea growing louder and louder as the salt water flowed up into the creeks betokened the change of tide faint wreaths of mist were rising up from over the shadowy marshland above them were the stars he laid his hand upon her shoulder  dear child he said i think that you understand how it is that the burden after all is easier for me a man may forget his troubles here for all the while there is this eternal background of peaceful things  her hand stole into his  yes she murmured i understand dont let them ever bring you away     chapter xi  mannerings alternative   once again mannering found himself in the overscented overheated room which was perhaps of all places in the world the one he hated the most fresh from the windswept places of his country home he found the atmosphere intolerable after a few minutes waiting he threw open the windows and leaned out hester was walking in the square somewhere he had a shrewd idea that she had been sent out of the way with a restless impatience of her absence he awaited the interview which he dreaded  her mothers coming took him a little by surprise she seemed to have laid aside all her usual customs she entered the room quietly she greeted him almost nervously she was dressed without at any rate any obvious attempt to attract in a plain black gown and with none of the extravagances in which she sometimes delighted her usual boisterous confidence of manner seemed to have deserted her her face without its skilful touches of rouge looked thin and almost peaked  i am so glad that you came lawrence she said it was very good of you  she glanced towards the opened windows and he closed them at once  i am afraid he said that you have not been well  there was a touch of her old self in the hardness of her low laugh  it is remorse she declared i think that for once in my life i have permitted myself to think it is a great mistake one loses confidence when one realizes what a beast one is  he waited in silence it seemed to him the best thing she sat down a little wearily he remained standing a few feet away  i have given you away lawrence she said quietly  so he remarked i understand  hester has told you of course i am not blaming her she did quite right only i should have told you myself i wanted to be the first to assure you of this our secret is quite safe the manwith whom i made a fool of myselfhas given me his word of honour  sir leslie borrowdeansword of honour mannering remarked with slow scorn do you know the man i wonder  i know that he wishes to be your friend and not your enemy she said  he chooses his friends for what they are worth to him mannering answered it is all a matter of selfinterest he has some idea of making me the steppingstone to his advancement i have a place just now in his scheme of life but as for friendship borrowdean does not know the meaning of the word  you speak bitterly she remarked  i know the man he answered  will you tell me she asked what it is that he wants of you  he shrugged his shoulders  is this worth discussing between us he asked  yes  very well then you shall know he wants me to reenter political life to be the jackal to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him  to reenter political life and why dont you  mannering turned abruptly round and looked her in the face he had been gazing out of the window wondering how long it would be before hester returned  why dont i he repeated a little vaguely how can you ask me such a question as that  she was undisturbed again he marvelled at the change in her  is it so very extraordinary a question she said i have often wondered whether you meant to content yourself with your present life always it is scarcely worthy of you is it you were born to other things than to live the life of a country gentleman you dabble in literature they say and poke your stick into politics through the pages of the reviews why dont you take your coat off and play the game  mannering was silent for several moments he was however meditating his own reply less than studying his questioner her attitude was amazing to him she watched him all the time frowning  you are not usually so tonguetied she remarked irritably have you nothing to say to me  i am wondering he said quietly what has given birth to this sudden interest in my proceedings what does it matter to you how my days are spent or what manner of use i make of them  there was a time she began  a time irretrievably past he interrupted shortly  i am not so sure she declared doubtfully  what has borrowdean to do with this he asked her abruptly  borrowdean  surely some one has been putting notions into your head  why take that for granted she asked equably the pity of the whole thing is obvious enough isnt it sometimes i think that we were a pair of fools we played into the hands of fate we were brought face to face with a terrible situation instead of meeting it bravely we played the coward why dont you forget lawrence as i have done take up your work again set a seal uponthat memory  i have outgrown my ambitions he answered life was hot enough in my veins then desire grows cold with the years i am content  but i she answered am not  we each chose our life he reminded her  perhaps i am not satisfied with my choice you may be with yours  i am  she leaned over towards him  once she said you offered me what you calledatonement i refused it just then it seemed horrible now that feeling has passed away i am lonely lawrence and i am weary of the sort of life i have been living supposing i asked you to make me that offer again  mannering turned slowly towards her he was not a man who easily showed emotion but there were traces of it now in his face the hand which rested on the back of his chair shook there was in his eyes the look of a man who sees evil things  it is too late blanche he said you cannot be in earnest  why not she murmured dropping her eyes i am tired of my life what you owed me then you owe me now why should it be too late i am not an old woman yet nor are you an old man and i am weary of being alone  mannering walked to the window his hand went to his forehead it was damp and cold he was afraid if she were in earnest and she spoke like a woman who knew her mind she was always he remembered a creature of caprice if she were really in earnest  we have drifted too far apart blanche he said making an effort to face the situation years ago this might have been possible today it would be a dismal failure my ways are not yours the life i lead would bore you to death  there is no reason why you should not alter it she answered calmly in fact i should wish you to blakely all the year round would be an impossibility you could come and live in london  he looked at her fixedly  have you forgotten he asked  she covered her face with her hands for a moment if indeed she really felt any emotion it passed quickly away for when she looked up again there were no traces left  i have forgotten nothing she declared defiantly only the horror and fear of it all has passed away i dont see why i should suffer all my life in fact i dont mean to i dont want to be a miserable lonely old woman i want a home something different from this  mannering faced her gravely  blanche he said you are proposing something which would most surely ruin the rest of our lives what we might have been to one another if things had been different it is hard to say but this much is very certain we belong now to different worlds we have drifted apart with the years even the little we see of one another now is far from a pleasure to either of us what you are suggesting would be simply suicidal  she was silent he watched her anxiously as a rule her face was easy enough to read today it was impenetrable he could not tell what was passing behind that still almost stony look her silence forced him again into speech  you agree with me surely blanche you must agree with me  she raised her head  i am not sure that i do she answered but at least i understand you that is something you want to go on as you areapart from me that is true isnt it  yes  she nodded  at least you are candid you want your libertyunfettered what are you willing to pay for it  he looked at her incredulously  i do not quite understand he said  she laughed and the laugh belonged to her old self  indeed i thought that i was explicit enough brutally explicit even what have you to offer me in place of your name and yourself what sacrifice are you prepared to make  he looked at her furtively as though even then he doubted the significance of her words  you have already half my income he said slowly  she shrugged her shoulders  a thousand a year what can one do on that to live decently in town one needs much more  it is as much as i can offer he remarked stiffly  then you should earn money she declared its easy enough for men with brains go back into politics instead of idling your time away down in blakely i mean it ive no patience with men who have a right to a place in the world which they wont fill  surely he remonstrated i may be allowed to choose the manner of my life  if you can afford toyes she answered but i want one of two things the first seems to scare you to death even to think of the second is more moneya good deal more money  but he protested even if i did as you suggested and went back into politics it would be some time if ever before i should be any better off  i will wait until that time comes she answered provided that when it does you share with me  then mannering understood  upon my word he exclaimed you are an apt conspirator indeed all this time you have been fooling me i even fanciedbah how much is borrowdean giving you for this  nothing at all she answered coolly it is my own sincere desire for your welfare which has prompted all that i have said to you i am ambitious for you lawrence i should like to see you prime minister i am sure you could be if you tried you are letting your talents rust and i dont approve of it  the faint note of mockery in her tone was clearly apparent mannering found it hard to answer her calmly  come he said put it into plain words what does it mean what do you want  sir leslie tells me she said raising her eyes and looking him in the face that his party is prepared to find you a safe seat tomorrow i want you to give up your hermits life and accept it  and the alternative  you have it already before you your reception of it was not i must admit altogether flattering  i am allowed he said some short space of time for consideration  until tomorrow if you wish she answered i imagine you know pretty well what you mean to do  he picked up his hat and turned towards the door  yes he said i suppose i do     book ii     chapter i  borrowdean makes a bargain   borrowdean sank into the chair which berenice had indicated with a little sigh of relief  these allnight sittings he remarked get less of a joke as one advances in years you read the reports this morning  she nodded  and mannerings speech  every word of it  our little conspiracy he continued is bearing fruit honestly mannering is a surprise even to me after these years of rust i scarcely expected him to step back at once into all his former brilliancy his speech last night was wonderful  i heard it she said you are quite right it was wonderful  you were in the house he asked looking up quickly  i was there till midnight she answered  borrowdean was thoughtful for a moment  his speech he remarked sounded even better than it read  i thought so she admitted he has all the smaller tricks of the orator as well as the gift of eloquence one can always listen to him with pleasure  will you pardon me borrowdean asked if i make a remark which may sound a little impertinent you and mannering were great friends at blakely on my first visit there you will remember that you did not attempt to conceal that there was more than an ordinary intimacy between you yet today i notice that there are indications on both your parts of a desire to avoid one another as much as possible it seems to me a pity that you two should not be friends is there any small misunderstanding which a common friendsuch as i trust i may call myselfmight help to smooth away  berenice regarded him thoughtfully  it is strange she said that you should talk to me like this you who are certainly responsible for any estrangement there may be between mr mannering and myself please answer me this question why do you wish us to be friends  borrowdean shrugged his shoulders  you and he and myself with about a dozen others he answered form the backbone of a political party as time goes on we shall in all probability be drawn closer and closer together it seems to me best that our alliance should be as real a thing as possible  berenice smiled  rather a sentimental attitude for you sir leslie she remarked have you ever considered the fact that any coolness there may be between lawrence mannering and myself is entirely due to you  to me he exclaimed  exactly at blakely we were on terms of the most intimate friendship i had grown to like and respect him more than any man i had ever met i dont know exactly why i should take you so far into my confidence but i am inclined to do so our friendship seemed likely to develop intoother things  my dear duchess  dont interrupt me i have an idea that you were perfectly aware of it perhaps it did not suit your plans at any rate you made statements to me concerning him which as you very well knew were likely to alter my entire opinion of him i had an idea that there was some code of honour between men which kept them from discussing the private life of their friends with a woman you seem to have been troubled with no such scruples you told me things about lawrence mannering which made it absolutely necessary that i should hear them confirmed or denied from his own lips  you would rather have remained in ignorance then he asked  i would rather have remained in ignorance she repeated calmly dont flatter yourself sir leslie that a woman ever has any real gratitude in her heart for the person who out of friendship or some other motive destroys her ideals i should have married lawrence mannering if you had not spoken  borrowdean was silent in his heart he was thinking how nearly one of the most cherished schemes of his life had gone awry  i am afraid then he said that even at the risk of your further displeasure i have no regrets to offer you  i do not desire your regrets she answered scornfully you did what it suited you to do and i presume you are satisfied as for the rest i can assure you that the relations between mr mannering and myself are such that the balance of your political applecart is not likely to be disturbed now let us talk of something else i have said all that i have to say on this matter  sir leslie was not entirely satisfied with the result of his afternoon call he walked slowly from grosvenor square to a small house in sloane gardens in front of which a wellappointed victoria was waiting he looked around at the wellfilled windowboxes thick with geraniums and marguerites at the coachmans new livery at the evidences of luxury which met him the moment the door was opened and his lips parted in a faint unpleasant smile  poor mannering he murmured to himself what a millstone  mrs phillimore was at home she would certainly see sir leslie the trim parlourmaid thought with a smile she left him alone in a flowerscented drawingroom crowded with rococo furniture and many knickknacks where he waited more or less impatiently for nearly twenty minutes then mrs phillimore swept into the room elaborately gowned for her drive in the park dispersing perfumes in all directions and bestowing a dazzling smile upon him  i felt very much inclined not to see you at all she declared how dared you keep away from me all this time you havent been near me since i moved in here what do you think of my little house  charming he declared  every one likes it she remarked such a time i had choosing the furniture hester wouldnt help with a single thing you know that she has left me  i understood that she had gone to mr mannering as secretary he answered she has done typing for him for some time hasnt she  mrs phillimore nodded  worships him the little fool she remarked i must admit i detest clever men you are all so dull and such scheming brutes too  borrowdean smiled a certain roughandready humour about this woman always appealed to him he looked around  you seem to have done very nicely with that little offering he said  oh ready money goes a long way she declared carelessly  and when it is spent he asked five thousand pounds is not an inexhaustible sum  by the time it is spent she answered your party will be in and i suppose you will make lawrence something  borrowdean regarded the woman thoughtfully  has it ever occurred to you he asked that the time is likely to come when mannering might want his money for himself he might want to marry for instance  she laughed mirthlessly but without a shade of uneasiness  you dont know lawrence she declared scornfully hed never do that whilst i was alive  i am not so sure borrowdean answered calmly between ourselves i cannot see that your claim upon him amounts to very much  then youre a fool she declared brusquely  no im not borrowdean assured her blandly now i fancy that i could tell you something which would surprise you very much  has he been making love to any one she asked quickly  something of the sort he admitted mannering is quixotic of course and that hermit life of his down in norfolk has made him more so now he has come back again into the world it is just possible that he may see things differently i flatter myself that i am a man of common sense i know how the whole affair seems to me and i tell you frankly that i can see nothing from the point of view of honour to prevent mannering marrying any woman he chooses i think it very possible that he may readjust his whole point of view  the woman looked around her and outside where her victoria was waiting at last she had attained to an environment such as she had all her life desired the very idea that at any moment it might be swept away sent a cold shiver through her borrowdean had a trick of speaking convincingly and besides  who is the woman she asked  i had been wondering borrowdean said whether it would not be better to tell you so that you might be on your guard the woman is the duchess of lenchester  she stared at him  youre in earnest  absolutely  her face hardened whatever other feelings she may have had for mannering she had lived so long with the thought that he belonged to her at least as a wageearning animal a person whose province it was to make her ways smooth so far as his means permitted that the thought of losing him stirred in her a dull jealous anger  id stop it she declared id go and tell her everything  i am not sure borrowdean continued smoothly that that would be the best course supposing that you were to tell her the story just as you told it to me it is just possible that her point of view might be mine she might regard lawrence mannering as a quixotic person and endeavour to persuade him that your claim was scarcely so binding as he seems to imagine in any case i do not think that your story would prevent her marrying him  then all i can say is that she is a woman with a very queer sense of right and wrong mrs phillimore declared angrily  borrowdean smiled  a woman he said who is fond of a man is apt to have her judgment a little warped the duchess is a woman of fine perceptions and sound judgment but she is attracted by lawrence mannering she admires him he is the sort of person who appeals to her imagination these feelings might easily become if they have not already developed into something else and i tell you again that i do not believe your story would stop her from marrying him  she leaned a little towards him  what would she asked earnestly  he hesitated  well he said i think i could tell you that  she held up her hand  stop please she said i want to ask you something else are you lawrences enemy  i why of course not  then where do you come in she asked bluntly you couldnt persuade me that it is interest on my account which brings you here and makes you tell me these things you dont care a button for me  borrowdean took her hand and leaned forward in his chair she snatched it away  oh rot she exclaimed i may be a fool but im not quite fool enough for that im simply a useful person for the moment in some scheme of yours and i just want to know what that scheme is thats all im not the sort of woman youd waste a moment with except for some purpose of your own youve proved that you wormed my story out of me very cleverly but i havent quite forgotten it yet you know and to tell you the truth she continued youre not my sort either you and lawrence mannering are something of the same kidney after all though hes worth a dozen of you youve neither of you any time for play in the world and that sort of man doesnt appeal to me now where do you come in  borrowdean looked at her thoughtfully he had the air of a man a trifle piqued perhaps for the first time he realized that blanche phillimore was not altogether an unattractivelooking woman if she had desired to stir him from his indifference she could not have chosen any more effectual means  i am not going to argue with you he said quietly i have ambitions it is true and the world is not exactly a playground for me nevertheless i am not an ascetic like mannering the world the flesh and the devil are very much to me what they are to other men but in a sense you have cornered me and you shall have the truth i want to marry the duchess of lenchester myself  she nodded  thats right she said now we know where we are you want to marry the duchess and therefore you dont want her to have lawrence you think that i can stop it and as i dont want him married either you come to me that is reasonable now how can i prevent it  by a slight variation from your story he answered in fact words are not needed a suggestion only would be enough and circumstances he added glancing around are strongly in favour of that suggestion  you mean  he shrugged his shoulders  mannering is security for your lease he remarked you pay in his cheques to your bank every quarter he occupies just that position which in a general way is capable of one explanation only  well  let the duchess believe him or continue to believe him to be an ordinary maninstead of a fooland she will never marry him  and she will you  i hope so  she leaned back in her chair he could not altogether understand her silence surely she could have no scruples  it seems to me she said at last that i am to play your game for nothing i dont care so very much after all if he marries hed settle all he could on me in fact i should have just as much claim on him as i have now  i did not say that you should play it for nothing he answered i want us to understand each other because i have an idea that you may be seeing something of the duchess at any moment let us put it this way suppose i promise to give you a diamond necklace of the value of say five thousand pounds the day i marry the duchess  she rose and put pen and paper before him he shook his head  i cant put an arrangement of that sort on paper he protested you must rely upon my word of honour  she held out the pen to him  on paper or the whole thing is off absolutely she declared  you wont trust me  she looked at him  there isnt much honour about an arrangement of this sort is there she said it has to be on paper or not at all  a carriage stopped outside they heard the bell  that she remarked may be the duchess of lenchester  he caught up the pen and wrote a few hurried lines the smile with which he handed it to her was not altogether successful  after all you know he said there should be honour amongst thieves  no doubt there is she answered only thieves are a cut above us arent they  i dont believe borrowdean said to himself as he reached the pavement that that woman is such a fool as she seems     chapter ii  cherchez la femme   mannering hated dinner parties but this one had been a necessity nevertheless if he had known who his companion for the evening was fated to be he would most certainly have stayed away her first question showed him that she had no intention of ignoring memories which to him were charged with the most subtle pain  he looked down the table and back again into her face  you are quite right he said this is different we cannot compare we can judge only by effectthe effect upon ourselves  can you be analytical and yet remain within the orbit of my understanding she asked with a faint smile if so i should like to know exactly how you feel about it all  he passed a course with a somewhat weary gesture of refusal and leaned back in his chair  you are comprehensiveas usual he remarked just then i was wondering whether the perfume of these banks of hothouse flowersi dont know what they arewas as sweet as the odour of the salt from the creeks or my roses when the night wind touched them  you were wondering and what have you decided  ah i must not say in any case you would not agree with me wasnt it you who once scoffed at my idyll in the wilderness  i do not think that i believe in idylls nowadays she answered one risks so many disappointments when one believes in anything  he raised his eyebrows  you did not talk like this at blakely he remarked  i am nearly a year older she answered and a year wiser  you pain me he answered with a little sigh you are a person of intelligence and you talk of growing wiser with the years dont you know that the only supreme wisdom is the wisdom of the child our inherent ignorance is fed and nourished by experience  you are hiding yourself she remarked behind a fence of wordswords that mean less than nothing i dont suppose that even you would hesitate to admit that you have come into a larger world you may have to pay for it we all do but at any rate it is an atmosphere which breeds men  and changes women he murmured under his breath  she did not speak to him for several moments then the alteration in her tone and manner was almost marked  you mentioned blakely a few minutes ago she said i wonder whether you remember our discussion there upon precisely what has come to pass  perfectly  i remember that in those days she continued reflectively you were very firm indeed or was it my poor arguments that were at fault your vegetable and sentimental existence was a part of yourself ambition you had forgotten what it was duty you spouted individualism by the hour gratify my curiosity wont you tell me what made you change your mind  mannering was silent for a moment a close observer might have noticed a certain alteration in his face a touch of the coming weariness was already there  i have never changed my mind he answered quietly my inclinations today are what they have always been  she dropped her voice a little  you puzzle me she said softly do you mean that it was your sense of duty which was awakened  no i do not mean that he answered forgive mebut i cannot tell you what i do mean circumstances brought me here against my will  you talk like a slave she said lightly enough she too was brave she drank wine to keep the colour in her cheeks and she told herself that the pain at her heart was nothing nevertheless some words of borrowdeans were mocking her all the while  we are all slaves he answered the folly of it all is when we stop to think then we realize it  their conversation was like a strangled thing neither made any serious effort to reestablish it it was a great dinner party chiefly political and long drawn out afterwards came a reception and mannering was at once surrounded it was nearly midnight when by chance they came face to face again she touched him with her fan and leaned aside from the little group by whom she was surrounded  are you very much occupied mr mannering she asked lightly or could you spare me a moment  he stopped short whatever surprise he may have felt he concealed  i am entirely at your service duchess he answered mr harrison will excuse me i am sure he added turning to his companion  she rested her fingers upon his arm the house belonged to a relative of hers and she knew where to find a quiet spot when they were alone she did not hesitate for a moment  lawrence she said quietly will you imagine for a moment that we are back again at blakely  i would to god we were he answered impulsively that isif you wish it too  she did not answer at once the sudden abnegation of his reserve took her by surprise she had to readjust her words  at least she said there are many things about blakely which i regret all the time you know of course the chief one our own altered selves i know lawrence that i need to ask your forgiveness i came there under an assumed name and i will admit that my coming was part of a scheme between ronalds rochester and myself well i am ready to ask your forgiveness for that i dont think you ought to refuse it me it doesnt alter anything that happened it doesnt even affect it you must believe that  i believe it if you tell me so he answered  i do tell you she declared i can explain it all i am longing to have it all off my mind but first of all there is just one thing which i want to ask you  his face as he looked towards her gave her almost a shock very little was left of his healthy colouring already there were lines under his eyes and he was certainly thinner and there was something else which almost appalled her there was fear in his manner he sat like a man waiting for sentence a man foredoomed  i want to know she said what has brought youhere i want to know what manner of persuasion has prevailedwhen mine was so ineffectual dont think that i am not glad that you decided as you did i am gladvery you are in your rightful place and i am only too thankful to hear about you and readand watch butwe are jealous creatures we women you know and i want to know whose and what arguments prevailed when mine were so very insufficient  he answered her without hesitation but his tone was dull and spiritless  i cannot tell you  there was a short silence she gathered her skirts for a moment in her hand as though about to rise but apparently changed her mind she waited for some time and then she spoke again  perhaps you think that i ought not to ask  he looked at her hopelessly  no i dont think that you have a right to ask but it doesnt alter things does it i cant tell you  you asked me to marry you  it was at blakely we were so far out of the worldsuch a different world i think that i had forgotten all that i wished to forget everything seemed possible there  you mean that you would have married me and told me nothing of circumstances in your life so momentous that they have practically exercised in this matter of your return to politics a compelling influence over you  i am sure he said that i should not have told you  his unhappiness moved her she still lingered she drew a little breath and she went a good deal further than she had meant to go  it has been suggested to me she said that your reappearance was due to a womans influence is this true  a woman had something to do with it he admitted  who is she  her name he answered is blanche phillimore it was the person to whom you yourself alluded  the duchess maintained her selfcontrol she was quite pale however and her tone was growing ominously harder  is she a connection of yours  no  is there anything which you could tell me about her  no  yet at her bidding you have donewhat you refused me  i had no choice borrowdean saw to that he remarked bitterly  she rose to her feet she was pale and her lips were quivering but she was splendidly handsome  what sort of a man are you lawrence mannering she asked steadily you play at idealism you asked me to marry you yet all the time there was this background  it was madness he admitted but remember it was mrs handsell whom i asked to be my wife  what difference does that make she was a woman too i suppose to be honouredor insultedby your choice  there was no question of insult i think  she looked at him steadfastly perhaps for a moment her thoughts travelled back to those unforgotten days in the rosegardens at blakely to the man whose delicate but wholesome joy in the wind and the sun and the flowers the seastained marshes and the windy knolls where they had so often stood together she could not forget his life had seemed to her then so beautiful a thing the elementary purity of his thoughts and aspirations were unmistakable she told herself passionately that there must be a way out  lawrence she said we are man and woman not boy and girl you asked me to marry you once and i hesitated only because of one thing i do not wish to look into any hidden chambers of your life i wish to know nothing save of the present what claim has this woman blanche phillimore upon you  it is her secret he answered not mine alone  she lives in your housethrough her you are a poor manthrough her you are back again a worker in the world  yes  it must always be so  yes  and you have nothing more to say  if i dared he said raising his eyes to hers i would saytrust me i am not exactlyone of the beasts of the field  will you not trust me then i am not a foolish girl i am a woman you may destroy an ideal but there would be something left  i can tell you no more  then it is to be goodbye  if you say so  she turned slowly away he watched her disappear afterwards with a curious sense of unreality he remained quite still his eyes still fixed upon the portiere through which she had passed     chapter iii  one of the sufferers   mannering kept no carriage and he left downing street on foot the little house which he had taken furnished for the season was in the somewhat less pretentious neighborhood of portland crescent and as there were no hansoms within hail he started to walk home an attempt at a short cut landed him presently in a neighborhood which he failed to recognize he paused looking about him for some one from whom to inquire the way then he at once realized what he had already more than once suspected he was being followed  the footsteps ceased as he himself had halted it was a wet night and the street was illlit nevertheless mannering could distinguish the figure of a man standing in the shadows of the houses apparently to escape observation for a moment he hesitated his follower could scarcely be an ordinary hooligan for not more than fifty yards away were the lights of a great thoroughfare and even in this street quiet though it was there were people passing to and fro his curiosity prompted him to subterfuge he took a cigarette from his case and commenced in a leisurely manner the operation of striking a light instantly the figure of the man began to move cautiously towards him  mannerings eyes and hearing keenly developed by his country life apprised him of every step the man took he heard him pause whilst a couple of women passed on the other side of the way afterwards his approach became swifter and more stealthy barely in time to avoid he scarcely knew what mannering turned sharply round  what do you want with me he demanded  the man showed no signs of confusion mannering as he looked sternly into his face lost all fear of personal assault he was neatly but shabbily dressed pale and with a slight red moustache he had a somewhat broad forehead eyes with more than an ordinary lustre and in somewhat striking contradiction to the rest of his features a large sensitive mouth with a distinctly humorous curve even now its corners were receding into a smile which had in it however other elements than mirth alone  you are mr lawrence mannering  that is my name mannering answered but if you want to speak to me why dont you come up like a man instead of dogging my footsteps it looked as though you wanted to take me by surprise what is that you are hiding up your sleeve  the man held it out placed it even in mannerings hand  a life preserver steel as you see and with a beautiful spring deadly weapon isnt it sir even a halfhearted sort of blow might kill a man  mannering swung the weapon lightly in his hand it cut the air with a soft sickly swish  what were you doing following me on tiptoe with this in your hand he asked sternly  well the man answered as though forced to confess an unpleasant truth i am very much afraid that i was going to hit you with it  mannering looked up and down the street for a policeman  indeed he said and may i ask why you changed your mind  it was an inspiration the man answered easily to tell you the truth the clumsiness of the whole thing grated very much upon me personally i ran no risk dont think it was that my escape was very carefully provided for but one thinks quickly in moments of excitement and it seemed to me as i took those last few steps that i saw a better way  a better way mannering repeated puzzled i am afraid i dont quite understand you i presume that you meant to rob me you would not have found it worth while by the bye  the man laughed softly  my dear sir he exclaimed do i look like a robber rumour says that you are a poor man i should think it very likely that although i am not a rich one i am at least as well off as you  mannering looked out no more for the policeman he was getting interested  come he said i should like to understand what all this means you were going to tap me on the head with this particularly unpleasant weapon and your motive was not robbery i am not aware of ever having seen you before i am not aware of having an enemy in the world explain yourself  i should be charmed the man answered i do not wish to keep you standing here however will you allow me to walk with you towards your home you can retain possession of that little trifle if you like he added pointing to the weapon which was still in mannerings hand i can assure you that i have nothing else of the sort in my possession you can feel my pockets if you like  i will take your word mannering said i was on my way to portland crescent but i fancy that i have taken a wrong turn  we can get there this way the man answered excuse me one second  he paused and lit a cigarette then with his hands behind his back he stepped out by mannerings side  what was that you said just now he remarked that you were not aware of having an enemy in the world my dear sir there was never a more extraordinary delusion i should seriously doubt whether in the whole of the united kingdom there is a man who has more i know myself of a million or so who would welcome the news of your death tomorrow i know of a select few who have opened and will open their newspapers tomorrow and for the next few days in the hope of seeing your obituary notice  a light commenced to break in upon mannering he looked towards his companion incredulously  you mean political opponents he exclaimed is that what you are driving at all the time  the man laughed softly  my friend he saidexcuse me mr manneringyou remind me irresistibly of punchs cartoon last weekthe ostrich politician with his head in the sand you have thrust yours very deep down indeed when you talk of political opponents do you know what they call you in the north sir  no  the enemy of the people it isnt a pleasant title is it  it is a false one mannering declared with a little note of passion quivering in his tone  it is as true and certain as the judgment of god his companion answered with almost lightninglike rapidity  there was a moments silence they passed a lamppost and mannering turning his head scrutinized the others features closely  i should like to know who you are he said and what your name is  it is a reasonable curiosity the man answered my name is fardell richard fardell and i am a retired bookmaker  a bookmaker mannering repeated incredulously  precisely i should imagine from what i know of you mr mannering that my occupation or rather my late occupation is not one which would appeal to you favourably very likely not i dont see why it should myself but at any rate it taught me a lot about my fellow men i did my business in shillings and halfcrowns you see did it with the working classes the sort who used to go to a racemeeting for a jaunt and just have a bit on for the sake of the sport took their missus generally and made a holiday of it and if they lost theyd grin and come and chaff me and if they won theyd spend the money like lords i made money of course bought houses and made a lot more then business fell off i didnt seem to meet with that cheerful holidaymaking crew at any of the meetings up in the north and i got sick of it you see id made sort of friends with them they all knew dicky fardell and i knew hundreds of em by sight theyd come and mob me to stand em a drink when the wrong horse won and i can tell you i never refused they were always goodtempered real sports to the backbone and i tell you i was fond of em and then they left off coming i couldnt understand it at first the one or two who came talked of bad trade and when i asked after their pals they shook their heads they betted in shillings instead of halfcrowns and i didnt like the look of their faces when they lost i tell you it got so at last that i used to watch for the horse theyd put their bit on to win and feel kind o sick when it didnt you can imagine i couldnt stand that sort of thing long i chucked it and i went to look for my pals i wanted to find out what had become of them  mannering looked at him curiously  you found i hope he said drily that the british workman had discovered a better investment for his shillings and halfcrowns than the racecourse  mr richard fardell smiled pleasantly but tolerantly  its clear he said that you meaning no offence mr mannering know nothing about the british workman whatever else he may be hes a sportsman hell look after his wife and kids as well as the best of them but hell have his bit of sport so long as hes got a copper in his pocket when he didnt come i put my kit on one side and went to look for him i went mind you as his friend and knowing a bit about him and what i found has made a changed man of me  mannering nodded  i am afraid things are bad up in the north he said you mustnt think that we people who are responsible for the laws of the country ignore this mr fardell it is a very anxious time indeed with all of us still i presume you study the monthly trade returns some industries seem prosperous enough  im no politician fardell answered curtly figures dont interest me theyre just the drugs some of your party use to keep your conscience quiet things i see and know of are what i go by and what ive seen and what i know of are just about enough to tear the heart out of any man who cares a row of pins about his fellows now im going to talk plain english to you mr mannering i bought that little article you have in your pocket seriously meaning to knock you on the head with it and that may come yet  mannering looked at him in amazement  but my dear sir he said what is your grievance against me i have always considered myself a peoples politician  then the people may very well say save me from my friends fardell answered grimly mind i believe youre honest or youd be lying on your back now with a cracked skull but you are using a great influence on the wrong side youre standing between the people and the one reasonable scheme which has been brought forward which has a fair chance of changing their condition  then mannering began to understand  i oppose the scheme you speak of he answered simply because i dont believe in it every man has a right to his opinion i dont believe for a moment that it would improve the present condition of things  then what is your scheme fardell asked  my scheme mannering repeated i dont quite understand you  of course you dont fardell answered vigourously you can weave academic arguments you can make figures and statistics dance to any damned tune you please if i tried to argue with you youd squash me flat and whats it all come to my pals must starve for the gratification of your intellectual vanity you wont listen to tariff reform then what do you propose to light the forges and fill the mills nothing i say unless youve got a counter scheme of your own you ought to try ours  come mr fardell mannering said i can assure you that all i have said and written is the outcome of honest thought i  stop fardell exclaimed honest thought yes where in your study thats where you theorists do your mischief you cant make laws for the people in your study you cant tell the status of the workingman from the figures you read in your study youre like half the smug people in the world who discuss this question in the railway carriages and in their clubs ive heard em till id like to shove their selfopinionated arguments down their throats strip their clothes off their backs and send them down to live with my pals or starve with them any little idiot who buys a penny paper and whos doing pretty well for himself thinks he can lay down the law about free trade youre all of one kidney sir you none of you realize this there are men as good as any of you whose wives and children are as dear to them as yours to you whove got to see them get thinner and thinner who dont know where to get a days work or lay their hands upon a copper and all the while their kids come crying to them for something to eat put yourself in their place sir and try and realize the torture of it ive been amongst em ive spent half of what i made and a good many thousands it was buying food for them can you wonder that my fingers have itched for the throats of these smug prosperous pigs who spurt platitudes and think things are very well as they are because theyre making their little bit what right have youany of youto hesitate for a second to try any means to help those poor devils unless youve got a better scheme of your own will you tell me that sir  they had reached mannerings house and he threw open the gate  you must come in with me and talk about these things mannering said gravely you seem to be the sort of person ive been wanting to meet for a long time     chapter iv  debts of honour   berenice found the following morning a note from borrowdean which caused her some perplexity    if you really care he said to do mannering a good turn look his   niece up now and then i am afraid that young woman has rather lost her   head since she came to london and she is making friends who will do   her no particular good  berenice ordered her carriage early and drove round to portland crescent  my dear child she exclaimed as clara came into the room what have you been doing with yourself you look ghastly  clara shrugged her shoulders and looked at herself in a mirror  i do look chippy dont i she remarked ive been spending the weekend down at bristow  at bristow berenice repeated her voice spoke volumes clara looked up a little defiantly  yes we had an awful spree i like it there immensely only  berenice looked up  i notice she remarked that there is generally an only about people who have spent weekends at bristow they play cards there dont they until daylight some one once told me that they kept a professional croupier for roulette  that horrid game clara exclaimed please dont mention it ive scarcely slept a wink all night for thinking of it  berenice looked at her in surprise  do you mean to say she inquired deliberately that they allowed you to playand lose  it wasnt their fault i lost clara answered oh what a fool i was bobby bristow showed me a system it seemed so easy i didnt think i could possibly lose it worked beautifully at first i thought that i was going to pay all my bills and have lots of money to spend then i doubled the stakesi wanted to win a lotand everything went wrong  how much did you lose berenice asked clara shivered  dont ask me she cried sir leslie borrowdean gave his own cheques for all my ious he is coming to see me some time today i dont know what i shall say to him  do you mean to go on playing berenice asked quietly or is this experience enough for you  i shall never sit at a roulette table again as long as i live she declared i hate the very thought of it  then you can just ask sir leslie the amount of the ious and tell him that he shall have a cheque in the morning berenice said i will lend you the money  clara gave a little gasp  you are too kind she exclaimed but i dont know when i shall be able to repay you it isnearly three hundred pounds  so long as you keep your word berenice answered and do not play again you need never let that trouble you you shall have the cheque before two oclock no please dont thank me if you take my advice you wont spend another weekend at bristow it is not a fit house for young girls how is your uncle  i havent seen him this morning clara answered perkins told me that he came home after midnight with a man whom he seemed to have picked up in the street and they were in the study talking till nearly five this morning  berenice rose  i came to see if you would care to drive down to ranelagh with me this morning she said but you are evidently fit for nothing except to go back to bed again i wont forget the cheque and remember me to your uncle by the bye wheres that nice young man who used to be always with you down in the country  you must mean mr lindsay clara answered i have no idea at blakely i suppose  if i were you berenice said as she rose i should write to him to come up and look after you you need it  she nodded pleasantly and took her leave clara threw herself into a chair and rang the bell  perkins she said i have had no sleep and no breakfast what should you recommend  an egg beaten up in milk miss the man suggested same as ive just taken mr mannering  is my uncle up clara asked  not yet miss the man answered he is just dressing  clara nodded  very well please get me what you said and if sir leslie borrowdean calls i want to see him at once  sir leslie is in the study now miss the man answered i showed him in there because i thought he would want to see mr mannering but he asked for you  will you say that i shall be there in three minutes clara said  the three minutes became rather a long quarter of an hour but clara had used the time well when she entered the library she had changed her dress rearranged her hair and by some means or another had lost her unnatural pallor sir leslie greeted her a little gravely  glad to see you looking so fit he remarked they did us a bit too well down at bristow i thought its all very well for you children he continued with a smile but when a man gets to my time of life he misses a nights rest  she smiled  you dont call yourself old sir leslie she remarked  well im not young although i like to think i am he answered im afraid theres pretty nearly a generation between us miss clara by the bye wheres your uncle this morning  getting up she answered he did not go to bed until after five perkins tells me he brought some one home with him from dorchesters reception or some one he picked up afterwards and they seem to have sat up talking all night  borrowdean was interested  you have no idea who it was i suppose he asked  she shook her head  none at all perkins had never seen him before when do you poor creatures get your holiday sir leslie  he smiled  the session will be over in about three weeks he answered unless we defeat the government before then your uncle has been hitting them very hard lately i think before long we shall be in office  politics she said seems to be rather a greedy sort of business you are always trying to turn the other side out arent you  you must remember he answered that politics is rather a onesided sort of affair the party which is in makes a very comfortable living out of it and we who are out have to scrape along as best we can rather hard upon people like your uncle and myself who are comparatively speaking poor men that reminds me he said bringing out his pocketbook i thought that i had better bring you these little documents  those horrid ious she remarked  yes he answered i am sorry that you were so unlucky i bought these from the bank miss clara as i thought you would not feel comfortable if you had to leave bristow owing this money to strangers  it was very thoughtful of you she murmured he changed his seat and came over to her side on the sofa  have you any idea how much they come to he asked smoothing them out upon his knee  i am afraid to nearly three hundred pounds she answered  he shook his head gravely  i am sorry to say that they come to a good deal more than that he said i hope you do not forget that i took the liberty of advising you more than once to stop you had the most abominable luck  more than three hundred she gasped how much more  they seem to add up to five hundred and eighty five pounds he declared i must confess that i was surprised myself  therei think there must be some mistake clara faltered  he handed them to her  you had better look them through he said they seem all right  she took them in her hand and looked at them helplessly there was one there for fifty pounds which she tried in vain to rememberand how shaky her handwriting was a sudden flood of recollection brought the colour into her cheeks she remembered the long table the men all smoking the women most of them a little hard a little too much in earnestthe soft click of the ball the silent sickening moments of suspense others had won or lost as much as she but perhaps because she had been so much in earnest her illluck had attracted some attention she remembered major bristows whispered offer or rather suggestion of help even now her cheeks burned at something in his tone or look  i suppose its all right she said dolefully only its a lot more than i thought i shall have three hundred pounds in the morning but ive no idea where to get the rest  you are sure about the three hundred sir leslie asked quietly  quite  then i think that you had better let me lend you the rest for the present he suggested i am afraid your uncle would be rather annoyed to know that you had been gambling to such an extent you may be able to think of some way of paying me back later on  she looked up at him hesitatingly there was nothing in his manner which suggested in the least what major bristow had almost pronounced she drew a little breath of relief he was so much older and after all he was her uncles friend  can you really spare it sir leslie she asked i cant tell you how grateful i should be  he looked down at her with a faint smile  i can spare it for the present he answered only if you see any chance of paying me back before long do so  you will pardon my interference said an ominously quiet voice from the doorway but may i inquire into the nature of this transaction between you and my niece sir leslie perhaps you had better explain it clara  they both turned quickly round mannering was standing upon the threshold the morning paper in his hand clara sank into a chair and covered her face with her hands sir leslie shrugged his shoulders  he was congratulating himself upon the discretion with which he had conducted the interview he had for a few moments entertained other ideas  perhaps you will allow me to explain he began  i should prefer to hear my niece mannering answered coldly  clara looked up she was pale and frightened and she had hard work to choke down the sobs  sir leslie was down at bristow where i was stayingthis last weekend she explained i lost a good deal of money there at roulette he very kindly took up my ious for me and was offering when you came in to let it stand for a little time  what is the amount mannering asked  clara did not answer her head sank again her uncle repeated his inquiry there was no note of anger in his tone he might have been speaking of an altogether indifferent matter  i am afraid i shall have to trouble you to tell me the exact amount he said perhaps borrowdean you would be so good as to inform me as my niece seems a little overcome  the amount of the ious for which i gave my cheque borrowdean said was five hundred and eightyseven pounds i have the papers here  there was a dead silence for a moment or two clara looked up furtively but she could learn nothing from her uncles face it was some time before he spoke when at last he did his voice was certainly a little lower and less distinct than usual  did i understand you to sayfive hundred and eightyseven pounds  that is the amount borrowdean admitted i trust that you do not consider my interference in any way officious mannering i thought it best to settle the claims of perfect strangers against miss mannering  may i ask mannering continued in whose house my niece was permitted to lose this sum  it was at the bristows clara answered  and under whose chaperonage were you mannering asked  lady bristows she called for me here and took me down last friday  are these people who are generally accounted respectable mannering asked  i dont think that bristow is much better or worse than half of our country houses borrowdean answered people who are at all in the swim must have excitement nowadays you know bristow himself isnt very popular but people go to the house  mannering made no further remark  if you will come into the study borrowdean he said i will settle this matter with you  borrowdean hesitated  your niece said something about having three hundred pounds he remarked  mannering glanced towards her  i think he said that that must be a mistake my niece has no such sum at her command  clara rose to her feet  you may as well know everything she said the duchess of lenchester came in and found me very unhappy this morning i told her everything and she offered to lend me the money i told her then that it was only three hundred pounds i thought that was all i owed  have you made any other confidants mannering asked  no  you will return the duchesss cheque mannering said borrowdean will you come this way     chapter v  love versus politics   berenice was a little annoyed it was the hour before dressing for dinner which she always devoted to reposethe hour saved from the stress of the day which had helped towards keeping her the young woman she certainly was yet borrowdeans message was too urgent to ignore she suffered her maid to wrap some sort of loose gown about her and received him in her own study  my dear sir leslie she said a little reproachfully was this really necessary you know that after halfpast six i am practically a person not existinguntil dinner time  i should not have ventured to intrude upon you borrowdean said quickly if the circumstances had not been altogether exceptional i know your habits too well i have just come from mannering  from manneringyes  duchess borrowdean said have youforgive a blunt questionbut have you any influence over him  berenice was silent for several moments  you ask me rather a hard question she said a few months ago i think that i should have said yes todayi am not sure what has happened is anything wrong with him  nothing except that he seems to have gone mad borrowdean said bitterly i went to him today to get him to fix the dates for his meetings at glasgow and leeds what do you think his answer was  dont tell me that he wants to back out berenice exclaimed dont tell me that  almost as bad he told me quite coolly that he was not prepared finally to set out his views upon the question until he had completed a course of personal investigation in some of the northern centres of trade to which he had committed himself  berenice looked bewildered  but what on earth does he mean she exclaimed surely he knows all that there is to be known his mastery of statistics is something wonderful  what he means no man save himself can even surmise borrowdean answered he told me that he had had information of a state of distress in some of our northern townsnewcastle and hull he mentioned and some of the lancashire placeswhich had simply appalled him he was determined to verify it personally and to commit himself to nothing further until he had done so and he even asked me if i could not find him a pair until the end of the session so that he could get away at once i was simply dumbfounded a pair for mannering  berenice rose to her feet she walked up and down the little room restlessly  sir leslie she said at last i am not sure whether i have what you would call any influence over mr mannering now or not i might have had but for you  for me borrowdean exclaimed  yes it was you who told me ofofthat woman she said haughtily but with the colour rising almost to her temples after that of course things were different between us we are scarcely upon such terms at present as would justify my interference  borrowdean dropped his eyeglass and swung it deliberately by its black ribbon he looked steadily at berenice but his eyes seemed to travel past her  my dear duchess he said quietly the game of life is a great one to play and we who would keep our hands upon the board must of necessity make sacrifices it is your duty to disregard in this instance your feelings towards mannering you must consider only his feelings towards you they are such i believe as to give you a hold over him you must make use of that hold for the sake of a great cause  berenice raised her eyebrows  indeed you seem to forget sir leslie that my share in this game as you call it must always be a passive one i have no office to gain no rewards to reap why should i commit myself to an unpleasant task for the sake of you and your friends  it is your party he protested your party as much as ours  granted she answered yet who are the responsible members of it you know my opinion of mannering as a politician i would sooner follow him blindfold than all the others with my eyes open whatever he may lack he is the most honest and rightseeing politician who ever entered the house  he lacks but one thing borrowdean said the mechanical adjustment of the born politician to party matters there was never a time when absolute unity and absolute force were so necessary if he is going to play the intelligent inquirer if he falters for one moment in his wholesale condemnation of this scheme he loses the day for himself and for us the one thing which the political public never forgives is the man who stops to think  what do you want me to do berenice asked  to go to him and find out what he means what influences have been at work what is underneath it all warn him of the danger of even appearing doubtful or for a moment lukewarm the one person whom the public will not have in politics is the trifler think how many there have been brilliant men too who have lost their places through a single false step a single year a month of dilettantism remind him of them the man who moves in a great cause may move slowly if you will but he must move all the time remind him too that he is risking the one great chance of his life  he is to be premier then she asked  yes there is no alternative  very well then she said i will go i make no promises mind i will listen to what he has to say i will put our view of the situation before him but i make no promises it is possible even that i shall come to his point of view whatever it may be  borrowdean smiled  i have no fear of that he declared but at least it would be something to know what this point of view is you will find him in a queer mood that little fool of a niece of his has been getting in with a fast set and making the money fly you have heard of her last escapade at bristow  berenice nodded  yes she said i went there this morning directly i had your note i feel rather selfreproachful about clara mannering i meant to have looked after her more she is rather an uninteresting young woman though and i am afraid i have let her drift away  she will be all right with a little looking after borrowdean said forgive me but it is getting late  i will go at once she said                                       afterwards she wondered often at that strange uncertain fluttering of the heart the rush and glow of feelings warmer than any which had lately stirred her which seemed in those first few minutes of their being together to make an altered woman of her mannering as he entered the room pale and listless was conscious at once of a foreign element in it something which stirred his somewhat slowbeating pulse too which seemed to bring back to him a flood of delicious memories the perfume of his rosegardens at evening the soft night music of his windstirred cedars she had thrown aside her opera cloak the delicate lines of her bust seemed to have expanded with the unusual rise and fall of her bosom a faint rosetint flush of streaming colour had stained the ivory whiteness of her skinher eyes as they sought his were soft almost liquid they met so seldom aloneand she was alone now with him in the room which was so characteristically his own a room with many indications of his constant presence which one by one she had been realizing with curiously quickened pulses during the few minutes of waiting on her way here driving in an open victoria through the soft summer evening she had seemed to be pursued everywhere by a new world of sensuous suggestions of the many carriages which she had passed hers alone seemed to savour of loneliness she was the only beautiful woman who sat alone and companionless in a momentary block she had seen a man in a neighbouring hansom slip his hand a strong brown welllooking hand under the apron to hold for a moment the fingers of the woman who sat by his sideberenice had caught the answering smile she had seen him lean forward and whisper something which had brought a deeper flush into her own cheeks and a look into her eyes half amused half tender these were rare moments with her these moments of sentimentperhaps for that reason all the more dangerous she forgot almost the cause of her coming she remembered only that she was alone with the one man whose voice had the power to thrill her whose touch would call up into life the great hidden forces of her own passionate nature the memory of all other things passed away from her like a cloud gone from the face of the sun she leaned towards him his face was full of wonderwonder and the coming joy  berenice he exclaimed  she let herself drift down the surging tide of this suddenly awakened passion she held out her arms and pressed her lips on his as he caught her                                       presently she pushed him gently awayheld him there at arms length  this is too absurd she murmured and drew him once more towards her with a choking little laugh i came for something quite different  what does it matter what you came for so long as you stay he answered say that you came to bring a glimpse of paradise to a lonely man  she disengaged herself and her long white fingers strayed mechanically to her tumbled hair the elegant precision of her toilette had given place to a most distracting disarray she felt her cheeks burning still and the lace at her bosom was all crushed  and i was on my way to a dinner party she whispered with humorously uplifted eyebrows i must drive back home andand  and what he demanded  and send an excuse she declared demurely i am not equal to a family dinner party  and afterwards  she smiled  would you like she asked to take me out to dinner  would i like  go and change and call for me in half an hour we can go somewhere where we are not likely to be seen she said softly i must cover myself up in my cloak whatever will perkins say please remember that i have no hat  he held her hands and looked into her eyes  dont go for one moment he pleaded i want to realize it i want to feel sure of you  the gravity of his manner was for a moment reflected in her tone  i think she said that you may feel sure there are things which we may have to say to one anotherpresentlybut  he stooped and kissed her fingers     chapter vi  the conscience of a statesman   he was shown into her own little boudoir by a smiling maidservant who seemed already to treat him with an especial consideration the wonder of this thing was still lying like a thrall upon him and yet he knew that the joy of life was burning once more in his veins he caught sight of himself in a mirror and he was amazed the careworn look had gone from his eyes the sallowness from his complexion his step was elastic he felt the firm quick beat of his heart even his pulses seem to throb to a new and a wonderful tune these moments whilst he waited for her were a joy to him the atmosphere was fragrant with the perfume of her favourite roses a book lay upon the little inlaid table face downwards as she had left it there was a delicately engraved etching upon the wall which he recognized as her work the watercolours all of a french school which he had often praised were of her choosing perfect though the room was in colouring and detail there was yet a habitable almost a homely air about it mannering moved about amidst her treasures like a man in a dream only it was a dream of loneliness gone forever of a grey life suddenly coloured and transformed it was wonderful  then the soft swish of a skirt and she came in she had changed her gown she wore white lace with a string of pearls about her neck he looked eagerly into her face and a great relief took the place of that single instant of haunting fear the change was still there it was not the great lady who swept in but the woman who has found an answer to the one question of life a little tremulous still a little less selfassured she looked at him almost appealingly a delicate tinge of colour lingered in her cheeks he moved quickly forward to meet her  dear she murmured  he raised her hand to his lips he was satisfied  you see what my newborn vanity has led to she declared smilingly i have had to keep you waiting whilst i changed my gown i hope you like me in white  you are adorable he declared  she laughed  i wonder she said would you mind dining here alone with me it will be quite a scratch meal but i thought that it would be cosier than a restaurant and afterwardswe could come in here and talk  i should like it better than anything in the world he declared truthfully  you may take me in then she said i hope that you are as hungry as i am no not that way i have ordered dinner to be served in the little room where i dine when i am alone  to mannering there seemed something almost unreal about the chaste perfection of the meal and its wonderful service they dined at a small round table so small that more than once their fingers touched upon the tablecloth a single servant waited upon them swiftly and perfectly the butler appeared only with the wine which he served and quietly withdrew across the tangled mass of flowers only a few feet away all the time sat the woman who had suddenly made the world so beautiful to him a murmur of conversation continually flowed between them but he was never very sure what they were talking about he wanted to sit still to feast his eyes all his senses upon her to strive to realize this new thing that from henceforth she was his and then suddenly she broke the spell she leaned back in her chair and laughed softly  i have just remembered she said in response to his inquiring look why i came to call upon you this evening what a long time ago it seems  he smiled  and i never thought to ask you he remarked  we must have no secrets now she said with a delightful smile leslie borrowdean came to see me this afternoon and he was very anxious about you he declared that you wanted to postpone your great meetings in the north until after you had made some independent investigations in some of the manufacturing centres poor sir leslie you had frightened him so completely that he was scarcely coherent  mannering smiled a little gravely it was like coming back to earth  politics with borrowdean are so much a matter of pounds shillings and pence that the bare idea of his finding himself a day further away from office frightens him to death he said we are all like the pawns to be moved about the chessboard of his life  berenice smiled  he is certainly a very selfcentred person she remarked but do you know i am really a little curious to know how you succeeded in frightening him so thoroughly  i had a fright myself mannering said i was made to feel for an hour or so like a rip van winkle with the cobwebs hanging about merip van winkle looking out upon a new world  you a rip van winkle she laughed what was it that man who wrote in the nineteenth century called you last week the most precise and farseeing of our politicians  the men who write in reviews he murmured sometimes display the most appalling ignorance there was also some one in the saturday review who alluded to me last week as a library politician my friend quoted that against me a man who essays to govern a people he knows nothing of it was one of the labour party who wrote it i know but it sticks  you are not losing confidence in yourself surely she remarked smiling  my views are unchanged if that is what you mean he answered i believe i know what is good for the people and when i am sure of it i shall not be afraid to take up the gauntlet but i must be quite sure  you puzzle me a little she admitted has any one written more convincingly than you arguments which are founded upon logic and statistics must yield truth and you have set it down in black and white  on the other hand he said my unlearned but eloquent friend dismissed all statistics all the science of argument and deduction with the wave of a not too scrupulously clean hand figures he said are dead things they are the playthings of the charlatan politician who by a sort of mental sleight of hand can make them perform the most wonderful antics if you desire the truth seek it from live things if you desire really to call yourself the champion of the people come and see for yourself how they are faring figures will not feed them nor statistics keep them from the great despair come and let me show you the sinews of the country whether they are sound or rotten you cannot see them through your library walls it is only the echo of their voice which you hear so far off if you would really be the peoples man come and learn something of the people from their own lips this is what my friend said to me  and who she asked was this prophet who came to you and talked like this  a retired bookmaker he answered i will tell you of our meeting  she listened gravely after he had finished there was a short silence the dessert was on the table and they were alone berenice was looking thoughtful  tell me he begged exactly what that wrinkled forehead means  i was wondering she said whether sir leslie was right when he said that you had too much conscience ever to be a great politician  it mirrors borrowdeans outlook upon politics precisely he remarked  she smiled at him with a sudden radiance she had risen to her feet and with a quick graceful movement leaned over him this new womanliness which he had found so irresistible was alight once more in her face her eyes sought his fondly she touched his lips with hers the perfume of her clothes the touch of her hair upon his cheek were like a drug he had no more words  you may have one peach and one glass of the princes burgundy and then you must come and look for me she said we have wasted too much time talking of other things you havent even told me yet what i have a right to hear you know i want to be told that you care for me better than anything else in the world  he caught her hands there was a rare passion vibrating in his tone  you do not doubt it berenice  perhaps not she answered but i want to be told i am a middleaged woman you know lawrence but i want to be made love to as though i were a silly girl isnt that foolish but you must do it she whispered with her lips very close to his  he drew her into his arms  i am not at all sure he said that i have enough courage to make love to a duchess  then you can remember only that i am a woman she whispered very very very much a woman andim afraida woman shockingly in love  she disengaged herself suddenly and was at the door before he could reach it she looked back her cheeks were flushed there was even a faint tinge of pink underneath the creamy white of her slender stately neck  dont dare she said to be more than five minutes  mannering poured himself out a glass of wine and sat quite still with his head between his hands he wanted to realize this thing if he could the grinding of the great wheels fell no more upon his ears he looked into a new world so different from the old that he was almost afraid  and in her room berenice waited for him impatiently     chapter vii  a blow for borrowdean   there was a somewhat unusual alertness in borrowdeans manner as he passed out from the little house in sloane gardens and summoned a passing hansom he drove to the corner of hyde park and dismissing the cab strolled along the broad walk  the many acquaintances whom he passed and repassed he greeted with a certain amount of abstraction all the time he kept his eyes upon the road he was waiting to catch sight of some familiar liveries when at last they came he contrived to stop the carriage and hastily threaded his way to the side of the barouche  berenice was looking radiantly beautiful the exquisite simplicity of her white muslin gown and large hat of black feathers the slight flush with which she received him as though she carried about with her a secret which she expected every one to read the extinction of that air of listlessness which had robbed her for some time of a certain share of her good looksof all these things borrowdean made quick note his face grew graver as he accepted her not very enthusiastic invitation and occupied the back seat of the carriage for the first time he admitted to himself the possibility of failure in his carefully laid plans he recognized the fact that there were forces at work against which he had no weapon ready he had believed that berenice was attracted by mannerings personality and genius he had never seriously considered the question of her feelings becoming more deeply involved so many men had paid vain court to her she had a wonderful reputation for inaccessibility and yet he remembered her manner when he had paid his first unexpected visit to blakely it should have been a lesson to him how far had the mischief gone he wondered  so mannering has gone north he remarked noticing that she avoided the subject  she nodded her parasol drooped a little his way and he wondered whether it was because she desired her face hidden  you saw him  yes she answered he explained how he felt to me  and you could not dissuade him  i did not try she answered simply lawrence mannering is not a man of ordinary disposition you know he had come to the conclusion that it was right for him to go and opposition would only have made him the more determined i cannot see that there is any harm likely to come of it  i am not so sure of that borrowdean answered seriously mannering is au fond a man of sentiment there is no clearer thinker or speaker when his judgment is unbiassed but on the other hand the mans nature is sensitive and complex he has a sort of maudlin selfconsciousness which is as dangerous a thing as the nonconformist conscience heaven knows into whose hands he may fall up there  he is going incognito she remarked  he is not the sort of man to escape notice borrowdean answered he will be discovered for certain of course if it comes off all right the whole thing will be a feather in his cap but when i think how much we are dependent upon him i dont like the risk  you are sure she remarked thoughtfully that you do not overrate  mannering himself perhaps borrowdean interrupted there is no man whose personal place cannot be filled but one thing is very certain mannering is the only man who unites both sides of our scattered party the only man under whom fergusson and johns would both serve you know quite well the curse which has rested upon us we have become a party of units and our whole effectiveness is destroyed we want welding into one entity a single session a single year of office and the thing would be done we who do the mechanical work would see that there was no breaking away again but we must have that year we must have mannering that is why i watch him like a child and i must say that he has given me a good deal of anxiety lately  in what way she asked  borrowdean hesitated he seemed uncertain how to answer  if i explain what i mean he said you will understand that i do not speak to you as a woman and an acquaintance of mannerings but simply as one of ourselves mannerings private life is of course interesting to me only as an index to his political destiny and my acquaintance with it arises solely from my political interest in him there are things in connection with it which i feel that i shall never properly be able to understand  she looked at him steadily her cheeks were a little whiter but her tone was deliberate  i do not wish to hear anything about mr mannerings private life she said you will understand that i am not free or disposed to listen when i tell you that i am going to marry him  this was perhaps the worst blow borrowdean had ever experienced in the course of his whole life the possibility of this was a danger which he had recognized might some time have to be reckoned with but for the present he had felt safe enough he was taken so completely aback that for a few moments his mind was a blank he remained silent  you do not offer me the conventional wishes she remarked presently  they gofrom me to youas a matter of course he answered to tell you the truth i never thought of mannering for many reasons as a marrying man  you will have to readjust your views of him she said quietly for i think that we shall be married very soon  borrowdean was a little white and his teeth had come together whatever happened he told himself fiercely this must never be he felt his breastpocket mechanically yes the letter was there dare he risk it she was a proud woman she would be unforgiving if once she believed but supposing she found him out he temporized  thank you for telling me he said do you mind putting me down here  why you seemed in no hurry a few minutes ago  the world he said was a different place then  she looked at him searchingly  you had better tell me all about it she remarked you have something on your mind something which you are half disposed to tell me a little more than half i think go on  he looked at her as one might look at the magician who has achieved the apparently impossible  you are wonderful he said yes i will tell you my dilemma if you like i have just come from sloane gardens  her face changed instantly it was as though a mask had been dropped over it her eyes were fixed her features expressionless  well she said simply  he drew a letter from his pocket  you may as well see it yourself he remarked for reasons which you may doubtless understand i have always kept on good terms with mrs phillimore and she was to have dined with me and some other friends tomorrow night here is a note which i had from her yesterday will you read it  berenice held it between her finger tips there were only a few lines and she read them at a glance    sloane gardens   tuesday    my dear sir leslie    i am so sorry but i must scratch for tomorrow night l is going   north on some mysterious expedition and i am afraid that he will want   me to go with him in fact he has already said so ask me again some   time wont you    yours ever   blanche phillimore  berenice folded up the letter and returned it  it is a little extraordinary she remarked i am much obliged to you for showing me this if you do not mind we will talk of something else look there is clara mannering alone under the trees go and talk to her  berenice touched the checkstring and borrowdean was forced to depart she smiled upon him graciously enough but she spoke not another word about mannering borrowdean was obliged to leave her without knowing whether he had lost or gained the trick  clara mannering received him not altogether graciously as a matter of fact she was looking for some one else they strolled along talking almost in monosyllables borrowdean found time to notice the change which even these few months in london had wrought in her she was still graceful in her movements but a smart dressmaker had contrived to make her a perfect reproduction of the recognized type of the moment she had lost her delicate colouring there was a certain hardness in her young face a certain pallor and listlessness in her movements which borrowdean did not fail to note he tried to lead the conversation into more personal channels  we seem to have met very little during the last month he said i have scarcely had an opportunity to ask you whether you find the life here as pleasant as you hoped whether it has realized your expectations  does anything ever do that she asked a little flippantly it is different of course i do not think that i should be willing to go back to blakely at any rate  you have made a great many friends he remarked i hear of you continually  a host of acquaintances she remarked i do not think that i have materially increased the circle of my friends i hear of you too sir leslie very often it seems that people give you a good deal of credit for inducing my uncle to come back into politics  i certainly did my best to persuade him sir leslie answered smoothly if i had known how much anxiety he was going to cause us i might perhaps have been a little less keen  anxiety she repeated  yes do you know where he is now  i have no idea clara answered all that i do know is that he has gone away for three weeks and that i am going to stay with the duchess till he comes back it is very nice of her and all that of course but i feel rather as though i were going into prison the duchess isnt exactly the modern sort of chaperon  borrowdean nodded sympathetically  and consider my anxiety he remarked your uncle has gone north to consider the true position of the labouring classes now mr mannering is a brilliant politician and a sound thinker but he is also a man of sentiment they will drug him with it up there he will probably come back with half a dozen new schemes and we dont want them you know he ought to be speaking at glasgow and leeds this week he simply ignores his responsibilities he yields to a sudden whim and leaves us plantes la  she seemed scarcely to have heard the conclusion of his sentence her attention was fixed upon a group of men who were talking near  do you knowisnt that major bristow she asked borrowdean abruptly  borrowdean put up his glass  looks like him he admitted  i should be so much obliged she said if you would tell him that i wish to see him i have a message for his sister she concluded a little lamely  borrowdean did as he was asked he noticed the slight impatience of the man as he delivered his message and the flush with which she greeted him then with a little shrug of the shoulders he pursued his way     chapter viii  a page from the past   she swept into the room humming a light opera tune bringing with her the usual flood of perfumes suggestion of cosmetics a vivid apparition of the artificial her skirts rustled aggressively her voice was just one degree too loud mannering rose to his feet a little wearily  she looked at him with raised eyebrows  heavens she exclaimed what have you been doing with yourself lawrence you look like a ghost  i am quite well he answered calmly  then you dont look it she answered bluntly where have you been for the last few weeks  up in the north he answered it was very hot and i had a great deal to do i suppose i am suffering like the rest of us from a little overwork  she spread herself out in a chair opposite to him  dont stand she said you fidget me i have something to say to you  so i gathered from your note he remarked  you havent hurried  i only got back to london last night he answered i could scarcely come sooner could i  i suppose not she admitted  then for a moment or two she was silent she was watching him a little curiously  is this true she asked this rumour  wont you be a little more explicit he begged  they say that you are going to marry the duchess of lenchester  it is true he answered  she leaned forward her clasped hands rested upon her knee she seemed to be examining the tip of her patent shoe suddenly she looked up at him  you ought to have come and told me yourself she said  i had no opportunity he reminded her i left london the morning afterit happenedand i returned last night  political business she asked  entirely  lawrence she said i dont like it  why not he asked has mine been such a successful life do you think that you need grudge me a little happiness towards its close  bosh she answered you are only fortysix you are a young man still  i had forgotten my years he declared i only know that i am tired  you look it she remarked i must say that there is very little of the triumphant suitor about you you work too hard lawrence  if i do he asked with a note of fierceness in his tone whose fault is it i was almost happy at blakely i had almost learned to forget it was you who dragged me out again you were not satisfied with half of my income you were always in debt always wanting more money then borrowdean made use of you he wanted me back into politics you wanted more money for your follies and extravagances back i had to come into harness blanche ive tried to do my duty to you but there is a limit i owed you a comfortable place in life and i have tried to see that you have it i have never refused anything you have asked me i have never mentioned the sacrifices which i have been forced to make but there is a limit i draw it here i will not suffer any interference between the duchess of lenchester and myself  blanche phillimore rose slowly to her feet he was used to her fits of passion but there was no sign of anything of the sort in her face she was agitated but in some new way her words were an attack but her manner suggested rather an appeal her large fine eyes her one perfectly natural feature were soft and luminous they seemed somehow to transfigure her face to him it seemed like the foolish handsome woman of fifteen years ago who had suddenly come to life again  you owed mea comfortable place in life lawrence thankyou you have paid the debt very well you owed mea respectable guardianship you paid that too thank you again now tell me do you owe me nothing else  i owed you one debt he said gravely which neither i nor any other man who incurs it can ever discharge  i am glad you realize it she answered but have you ever tried to discharge it you have given me a home and money to throw away on any folly which could kill thought what about the rest  blanche he said gravely the rest was impossible you know that as well as i do  it is fifteen years ago lawrence she said and all that time we have fenced with our words now i am going to speak a little more plainly you robbed me of my husband the fault may not have been wholly yours but the fact remains you struck him and he died i was left alone  mannerings face was ashen the whole horrible scene was rising up again before him he covered his face with his hands it was more distinct than ever he saw the mans flushed face heard his stream of abuse felt the sting of his blow the hot anger with which he had struck back then those few awful moments of suspense the moment afterwards when they had looked at one another he shivered why had she let loose this flood of memories she was speaking to him again  i was left alone she repeated quietly and i have been alone ever since you dont know much about women lawrence you never did try and realize though what that must mean to a woman like myself not strong not clever with very few resourcesjust a woman i cared for my husband i suppose in an average sort of way at any rate he loved me thenthere was you oh you never made love to me of course you were not the sort of man to make love to another mans wife but you used to show that you liked to be with me lawrence your voice and your eyes and your whole manner used to tell me that then there camethat hideous day i lost you both what have i had since lawrence  very little i am afraid worth having  very littleworth having she flung the words from her with passionate scorn i had your alms your cold hurried visits when you seemed to shiver if our fingers touched it would have seemed to you i suppose a terrible sin to have touched the lips of the woman whom you had helped to rob of her husband to have spoken kindly to her to have given her at least a little affection to warm her heart poor me what a hell you made of my days with your selfish model life your panderings to conscience i didnt want much you know lawrence she said with a sudden choking in her voice i would never have robbed you of your peace of mind all i wanted was kindness and i think lawrence that it was a debt but you never paid it  mannering had a moment of selfrevelation a terrible lurid moment every word that she had said was true  you have never spoken to me like this before he reminded her desperately i never knew that you cared  dont lie she answered calmly you turned your head away that you might not see in your heart you knew very well what else do you think made me a very ordinary nervous sort of woman get you out of the house that day tell my story the story that shielded you without faltering put even the words into your own mouth it was because i was fool enough to care and oh my god how you have tortured me since you would sit there coldly censorious and reason with me about my friends my manner of life i knew what you thought you didnt hide it very well lawrence i wonder i didnt kill you  i wish that you had he said bitterly  she nodded  oh i know how you are feeling just now she said truth strikes home you know and it hurts just a little doesnt it in a few days your admirable common sense will prevail you will say to yourself she was that sort of woman she had that sort of disposition she was bound to go to the dogs anyway so you are going to marry the duchess of lenchester lawrence  he stood up  blanche he said that was all a mistake i didnt understand let us forget that day altogether marry me now and i will try to make up for these past years  she stared at him blankly the colour in her cheek was like a lurid patch under the pallor of her skin she gave a little gasp and her hand went to her side then she laughed hardly almost offensively  what a man of sentiment she declared after fifteen years too and only just engaged to another woman no thank you my dear lawrence ive lived my life such as it has been im not so very old but i look fifty and ive vices enough to blacken an entire neighbourhood fancy if people saw me and heard that you might have married the duchess of lenchester theyd hint at an asylum  never mind about other people he said give me a chance blanche to show that im not such an absolute brute  rubbish she interrupted fifteen years ago i would have married you in fact i expected to the reason why i found the courage to shield you from any unpleasantness that awful day was because i knew if trouble came and there was any scandal you would feel yourself obliged to marry me and i wanted you to marry mebecause you wanted to what an idiot i was now please go away lawrence marry the duchess if you like but dont worry me with your reawakened conscience im going my own way for the rest of my few years and the less i see of you the better i shall be pleased you will forgive mebut i have an engagementdown the river i really must hurry you off  her teeth were set close together the sobs seemed tangled in her throat it seemed to her that all the longing in her life was concentrated in that one passionate desire that he should seize her in his arms now hold her theretell her that it had all been a mistake that the ugly times were dreams that after all he had careda little the room swam round with her but she pointed smilingly to the door which her trim parlourmaid was holding open and mannering went     chapter ix  the faltering of mannering   mannering left by the afternoon train for hampshire where he was to be the guest for a few days of the leader of his party he arrived without sending word of his coming to find the whole of the house party absent at a cricket match the short respite was altogether welcome to him he changed his clothes and wandered off into the gardens here an hour or so later berenices maid found him  her grace would like to see you sir if you would come to her sittingroom the girl said with a demure smile  mannering with something of an inward groan followed her berenice very slim and stately in her simple white muslin gown rose from the couch as he entered and held out her hands  at last she murmured you provoking man to stay away so long and what have you been doing with yourself  her sentence concluded with a little note of dismay mannering was positively haggard in the clear afternoon light there were lines underneath his eyes and his face had a tense drawn appearance he did not kiss her as she had more than half expected he held her hands for a moment and then sank down upon the couch by her side  it was not exactly easy workup there he said  she noticed the repression  tell me all about it she begged  his thoughts surged back to those three weeks of tragedy his personal misery became for the moment a shadowy thing the sorrows of one man what were they to the breaking hearts of millions he thought of the children and he shuddered  it isnt so much to tell he said i have been to a dozen or so of the largest towns in the north and have taken the manufacturers one by one i have taken their wage sheets and compared them with past years the result was always the same less money distributed amongst more people afterwards we went amongst the people themselvesto see how they lived it was like a chapter from the infernoan epic of loathsome tragedy i have seen the children berenice and god help the next generation  you must not forget lawrence she said that character is an essential factor in poverty poverty there must always be because of the idle and shiftless  individual poverty yes he answered not wholesale poverty not streets of it towns of it i dont talk about starving people although i saw them too our vicious charitable system may keep their cry from our ears but my sympathies go out to the man who ought to be earning two pounds a week and who is earning fifteen shillings the man who used to have his bit of garden and smoke and sunday clothes and a day or sos holiday now and then he was a contented decent godfearing citizen the backbone of the whole nation and he has been blotted away from the face of the earth they work now passively like dumb brutes to resist starvation and human character isnt strong enough for such a strain the public houses thrive and the pawnshops are full but the children havent enough to eat they are growing up lank white prematurely aged the spectres to dance us statesmen down into hell  you are overwrought dear she said gently you have been in the hands of a man whose object it was to show you only one side of all this  i have sought for the truth mannering answered and i have seen it i have learned more in three weeks than all the commissions and statistics and boardoftrade figures have taught me in five years  and yet she said thoughtfully you hesitated about that last navy vote dont you see that the imperialism which you are a little disposed to shrug your shoulders at is the most logical and complete cure for all this we must extend and maintain our colonies and people them with our surplus population  he shook his head  that is not a policy which would ever appeal to me he answered it is like an external operation to remove a malady which is of internal origin either our social laws or our political systems are at fault when our trade leaves us and our labouring classes are unable to earn a fair wage that is the position we are in today  she rose to her feet and walked restlessly up and down the room mannering had the look of a crushed man she watched him critically writers in magazines and reviews had often made a study of his character she remembered a brilliant contributor to a recent review who had dwelt upon a certain lack of cohesion in his constitution an inability to relegate sentiment to its proper place in dealing with the great workaday problems of the world conscientious but never to be trusted was the last anomalous but luminous criticism was this frame of mind of his a sign of it she wondered his place in politics was fixed and sure what right had he as a man of principle with a great following to run even the risk of being led away by false prophets a certain hardness stole into her face as she watched him she tried to steel herself against the sight of his suffering and though she was not wholly successful there was a distinct change in her tone and attitude towards him as she resumed her seat  tell me she asked what this means from a practical point of view how will it effect your plans  i must give up my public meetings he answered slowly i have written to manningham to tell him that he must get some one else to lead the campaign  berenice was very pale so many of these wonderful dreams of hers seemed vanishing into thin air  this is a terrible blow she said it is the worst thing which has happened to us for years are you going over to the other side lawrence  he shook his head  i cant do that altogether he said the position is simply this i am still so far as my judgment and research go opposed to tariff reform on the other hand i dare not take any leading part in fighting any scheme which has the barest chance of bringing better times to the working classes i simply stand apart for the moment on this question  she laughed a little bitterly  there is no other question she said you will never be allowed to remain neutral you appear to me to be in a very singular position you are divided between sentiment and conviction and you prefer to yield to the former lawrence do not be hasty think of all that depends upon your judgment in this matter from the very first you have been the bitterest and most formidable opponent of this absurd scheme if you turn round you will unsettle public opinion throughout the country remember the power of the statesman is almost a sacred charge  i am remembering he murmured those children i am bound to think this matter out berenice i am going to meet graham and mellors next week i shall not rest until i have made some effort to put my hand upon the weak spot somewhere there is a rotten place i want to reach it  do you mean to give up your seat she asked  not unless i am asked to he answered i may need to work from there  she sighed  i suppose your mind is quite made up she said  absolutely he answered  her maid came in just then and mannering offered to withdraw she made no effort to detain him and he went at once in search of his host and hostess he found every one assembled in the hall below lord redford borrowdean and the chief whip of his party were talking together in a corner and from their significant look at his approach he felt sure that he himself had been the subject of their conversation the situation was more than a little awkward lord redford stepped forward and welcomed him cordially  im afraid youve been knocking yourself up mannering he said ive just been proposing to culthorpe here that we bar politics completely for twentyfour hours well leave the dinner table with the ladies and you and i will play golf tomorrow ive had taylor down here and i can assure you that my links are worth playing over now then on thursday well have a conference  i was scarcely sure mannering said with a slight smile whether i should be expected to stay until then sir leslie has told you of my telegrams  yes yes lord redford said quickly weve postponed the meetings for the present well talk that all out later on youve had some tea i hope no well eleanor you are a nice hostess he added turning to his wife give mr mannering some tea at once and feed him up with hot cakes come into the billiardroom afterwards mannering will you ive got a new table in the wintergarden and were going to have a pool before dinner  berenice came in and laid her hand upon her hosts arm  you need not worry about mr mannering she declared he is going to have tea with me at that little table and i am going to take him for a walk in the park afterwards  so long as you feed him well lord redford declared with a little laugh and turn up in good time for dinner you may do what you like if you take my advice berenice you will join our league we have pledged ourselves not to utter a word of shop for twentyfour hours  i submit willingly berenice answered mr mannering and i will find something else to talk about     chapter x  the end of a dream   you can guess why i brought you here perhaps berenice said gently as she motioned him to sit down by her side this place more than any other i know certainly more than any other at bayleigh seems to me to be completely restful there are the trees you see and the water and the swans that are certainly the laziest creatures i know you look to me as though you needed rest lawrence  i suppose i do he answered slowly i am not sure though whether i deserve it  you are rather a selfdistrustful mortal she remarked leaning back in her corner and looking at him from under her parasol you have worked hard all the session and now you have finished up by three weeks of i should think herculean labour if you do not deserve rest who does  the rest which i deserve mannering answered bitterly is the rest of those whose bones are bleaching amongst the caves and corals of the sea there that is matapan point isnt it where the hidden rocks are  she nodded  really you are developing into a very gloomy person she said lawrence dont let us fence with one another any longer what you may decide to do politically may be ruinous to your career to your chance of usefulness in the world and to my hopes but i want you to understand this it can make no difference to me i have had dreams perhaps of a great future of being the wife of a prime minister who would lead his country into a new era of prosperity who would put the last rivets into the bonds of a great imperial empire but one never realizes all ones hopes lawrence i love politics i love being behind the scenes and helping to move the pawns across the board but i am a woman too lawrence and i love you put everything connected with your public life on one side let me ask you this you are changed has anything come between us as man and woman  yes he answered something has come between us  she sat quite still for several minutes she prayed that he too might keep silence and he seemed to know her thoughts over the little sheet of ornamental water down the glade of beech and elm trees narrowing towards the cliffs her eyes travelled seawards it was to her a terrible moment mannering had represented so much to her and her standard was a high one if there was a man living whom she would have reckoned above the weaknesses of the herd it was he in those days at blakely she had almost idealized him the simple purity of his life there his delicate and carefully chosen pleasures combined with his almost passionate love of the open places of the earth had led her to regard him as something different from any other man whom she had ever known all borrowdeans hints and open statements had gone for very little she had listened and retained her trust and now she had a horrible fear something had gone out of the man something which went for strength something without which he seemed to lack that splendid militant vitality which had always seemed to her so admirable perhaps he was going to make a confession one of those crude clumsy confessions of a stained life which have drawn the colour and the joy from so many beautiful dreams she shivered a little but she inclined her head to listen  well she said what is it  i have asked another woman to marry me only a few hours ago he said quietly  berenice was a proud woman and for the moment she felt her love for this man a driedup and shrivelled thing she was white to the lips but she commanded her voice and her eyes met his coldly  may i inquire into the circumstancesof thissomewhat remarkable proceeding she inquired  there is a woman he said whose life i helped to wrecknot in the orthodox way he added with a note of scorn in his tone but none the less effectually the one recompense i never thought of offering her was marriage i have seen that despite all my efforts to aid her her life has been a failure her friends have been the wrong sort of friends her life the wrong sort of life what it was that was dragging her downwards i never guessed for she too in her way was a proud woman today she sent for me what passed between us is her secret as much as mine i can only tell you that before i left i had asked her to marry me  i think she said calmly that you need tell me no more  there is very little more that i can tell you he answered i have no affection for her and she has refused to marry me but she remainsbetween usirrevocably  you are lucidity itself she replied will you forgive me if i leave you i am scarcely used to this sort of situation and i should like to be alone  go by all means berenice he answered you and i are better apart but there is one thing which i must say to you and you must hear what has passed between you and me is the epitome of the lovemaking of my life you are the only woman whom i have desired to make my wife you are the only woman whom i have loved and shall love until i die i can make you no reparation none is possible yet these things are my justification  berenice had turned away the passionate ring of truth in his tone arrested her footsteps she paused her heart was beating very fast her coldness was all assumed it was so much happiness to throw away if indeed there was a chance she turned and faced him nervous gaunt holloweyed the wreck of his former self pity triumphed in spite of herself what was this leaven of weakness in the man she wondered which had so suddenly broken him down he had only to hold on his way and he would be prime minister in a year and at the moment of trial he had crumpled up like a piece of false metal a wave of false sentiment a maniacal hyperconscientiousness had been sufficient to sap the very strength from his bones and thenthere was this other woman was she to let him go without an effort he might recover his sanity it was perhaps a mere nervous breakdown which had made him the prey of strange fancies she spoke to him differently she spoke once more as the woman who loved him  lawrence she said you are telling me too much and not enough if you want to send me away i must go but tell me this first what claim has this woman upon you  it is not my secret he groaned i cannot tell you  leslie borrowdean knows it she said i could have heard it but i refused to listen remember whatever you may owe to other people you owe me something too  it is true he answered well listen i killed her husband  you youkilled her husband she repeated vaguely  yes she shielded me there was an inquest and they found that he had heart disease no one knew that i had even seen him that day no one save she and a servant who is dead but the truth lives he had reason to be angry with meover a money affair he came home furious and found me alone with his wife he called mewell it was a lieand he struck me i threw him on one sideand he fell when we picked him up he was dead  it was terrible she said but you should have braved it out they could have done very little to you  i know it he answered but i was young and my career was just beginning the thing stunned me she insisted upon secrecy it would reflect upon her she thought if the truth came out so i acquiesced i left the house unseen all these days i have had to carry the burden of this thing with me todayseemed to be the climax for the first time i understood  she can never marry you berenice said it would be horrible  she refused to marry me today he answered but she laid her life bare and i cannot marry any one else  berenice was trembling she was no longer ashamed to show her agitation  i am very sorry for you lawrence she said i am very sorry for myself goodbye  she left him and mannering sank back upon the seat     chapter xi  borrowdean shows his hand   to be plain with you borrowdean remarked mannerings defection would be irremediable he alone unites redford myself andwell to put it crudely let us say the imperialistic liberal party with manningham and the oldfashioned whigs who prefer the ruts there is no other leader possible redford and i talked till daylight this morning now can nothing be done with mannering  to be plain with you too then sir leslie berenice answered i do not think that anything can be done with him in his present frame of mind i should say that he is better left alone he has worked himself up into a thoroughly sentimental and nervous state for the moment he has lost his sense of balance  borrowdean nodded  desperate necessity he said sometimes justifies desperate measures we need mannering the country and our cause need him if argument will not prevail there is one last alternative left to us it may not be such an alternative as we should choose but beggars must not be choosers i think that you will know what i mean  i have no idea berenice answered  you are aware he continued that there is in mannerings past history an episode the publication of which would entail somewhat serious consequences to him  well  it was a most eloquent monosyllable but borrowdean had gone too far to retreat  i propose that we make use of it he said mannerings attitude is rankly foolish or i would not suggest such a thing but i hold that we are entitled under the circumstances to make use of any means whatever to bring him to his senses  berenice smiled they were standing together upon a small hillock in the park watching the golf  charlatanism in politics does not appeal to me she said drily any party that adopted such means would completely alienate my sympathies no my dear sir leslie dont stoop to such lowdown means mannering is honest but infatuated win him back by fair means if you can but dont attempt anything of the sort you are suggesting i too know his history from his own lips any one who tried to use it against him would forfeit my friendship  success then would be bought too dearly borrowdean answered with a gallantry which it cost him a good deal to assume may i pass on duchess in connexion with this matter to ask you a somewhat more personal question  i think berenice said calmly that i can spare you the necessity you were going to speak i believe of the engagement between lawrence mannering and myself  i was borrowdean admitted  it does not exist any longer berenice said i should be glad if you would inform any one who has heard the rumour that it is without any foundation  borrowdean looked thoughtfully at the woman by his side  i am very glad to hear it he declared i am glad for many reasons and i am glad personally  she raised her eyebrows  indeed i cannot imagine how it should affect you personally  i perhaps said more than i meant to he replied calmly i am a poor struggling politician myself whose capital consists of brains and a capacity for work and whose hopes are coloured with perhaps too daring ambitions amongst them  mr mannering has holed out from off the green she interrupted positively immoral i call it  amongst them borrowdean continued calmly is one which some day or other i must tell you for indeed you are concerned in it  i can assure you sir leslie she said looking at him steadily that i am not at all a sympathetic person my strong advice to you would benot to tell me i do not think that you would gain anything by it  borrowdean met his fate with a bow and a shrug of the shoulders  it only remains he said for me to beg you to pardon what might seem like presumption shall we meet them on the last green  mannering would have avoided berenice but she gave him no option she laid her hand upon his arm and volunteered to show him a new way home  you must be on your guard lawrence she said lord redford is very fond of concealing his plans to the last moment but he is a very clever man and sir leslie borrowdean would give his little finger to catch you tripping all this avoidance of politics is part of a scheme they will spring something upon you quite suddenly dont give any hasty pledges  thank you for your warning he said i will be careful  tell me she said as a friend what are your plans forget that i am interested in politics altogether i simply want to know how you are spending your time for the next few months  it depends upon them he answered looking downwards into the valley where lord redford and borrowdean were walking side by side if they ask me to resign my seat i shall go north again and it is just possible that i might come back into the house as a labour member on the other hand if they are content with such support as i can give them and to have me on the fence at present so far as the tariff question is concerned why i shall go back and do the best i can for them  you are not quite won over to the other side yet then she remarked smiling  not yet he answered if ever there was an honest doubter i am one if i had never left my study england could not have contained a more rabid opponent of any change in our fiscal policy than i i am like a small boy who is absolutely sure that he has worked out his sum correctly but finds the answer is not the one which his examiner expects there is something wrong somewhere i want if i can to discover it i only want the truth i dont see why it should be so hard to find why figures and common sense should clash entirely and horribly with existing facts  you wore duncoloured spectacles when you took your walks abroad she said smiling no one else seems to have discovered so distressing a state of affairs as you have spoken of  because they never looked beneath the surface he answered i myself might have failed to understand if i had not been shown remember that our workingman of the better class does not go marching through the streets with an unemployed banner and a tin cup when he is in want he takes his half wages and closes the door upon his sufferings god help him  adieu politics she declared with a shrug of the shoulders isnt that clara playing croquet with major bristow i wish i didnt dislike that man so much i hate to see the child with him  mannering sighed  poor clara he said i am afraid i have left her a good deal to herself lately  i am afraid you have she agreed a little gravely may i give you a word of advice  you know that i should be grateful for it he declared  be sure that she never goes to the bristows again and ask her whether she has any other card debts it may be my fancy but i dont like the way that man hangs about her and looks at her i am sure that she does not like him and yet she never seems to have the courage to snub him  i am very much obliged to you he said i will speak to her today  i dont know where i am going or what i shall do for the autumn she continued with a little sigh but if you like to trust clara with me i will look after her i think that she needs a woman yes i thought so redford and sir leslie are waiting for you go and have it out with them my friend  you are too kind to me he said kinder than i deserve  oh i dont know she answered i am afraid that my kindness is only another form of selfishness i am rather a lonely person you know lord redford is beckoning to you i am going to break up that croquet party  mannering joined the other two men berenice strolled on to the lawn major bristow eyed her coming with some disfavour he was one of the men whom she always ignored clara on the other hand seemed proportionately relieved  i want you to come to my room as soon as you possibly can child berenice said shall i wait while you finish your game  oh i will come at once clara exclaimed laying down her mallet major bristow will not mind i am sure  major bristow looked as though he did mind very much but lacked the nerve to say so berenice calmly took clara by the arm and led her away  you are not engaged to major bristow by any chance are you she asked calmly  engaged to major bristow heavens no clara answered i dont think he is in the least a marrying man  so much the better for our sex berenice answered i wouldnt spend so much time with him my dear if i were you i have known people with nicer reputations  clara turned a shade paler  i can never get away from him she said he follows meeverywhere and  you do not by any chance i suppose owe him money berenice asked they tell me that he has a somewhat objectionable habit of winning money from girls more than they can afford to pay and then suggesting that it stand over for a time  clara turned towards her with terrified eyes  ii do owe major bristow a little still she admitted i seem to have been so unlucky he told me that any time would do that i should win it back again and i had no idea what stakes we were playing i dont touch a card now at all but this was at ellingham house they insisted on my making a fourth at bridge  berenice tightened her grasp upon the girls arm  dont say anything about this to your uncle just now she insisted i am going to take you up to my room and write you a cheque for the amount whatever it may be afterwards i will have a talk with major bristow nonsense child dont cry the money is nothing to me and i always promised your uncle that i would look after you a little  i have been such a fool the girl sobbed  berenice for a moment was also sad her lips quivered her eyes were wistful  we all think that sometimes child she said quietly we all have our foolish moments and our hours of repentance even the wisest of us     chapter xii  sir leslie borrowdean incurs a heavy debt   i suppose lord redford remarked thoughtfully politics represents a different thing to all of us according to our temperament to me i must confess it is a plain practical business the business of lawmaking to you mannering i fancy that it appeals a little differently now let us understand one another are you prepared to undertake this campaign which we planned out a few months ago  if i did undertake it mannering said it would be to leave unsaid the things which you would naturally expect from me and to say things of which you could not possibly approve i am very sorry you can command my resignation at any moment if you will but my views though in the main they have not changed are very much modified  lord redford nodded  that he said is our misfortune but it certainly is not your fault as for your resignation if you crossed the floor of the house tomorrow we should not require it of you you are responsible to your constituents only we dragged you back into public lifeyou see i admit it freelyand we are willing to take our risk whether you are with us or against us we recognize you as one of those whose place is amongst the rulers of the people  you are very generous lord redford mannering answered  not at all it is no use being peevish you are a great disappointment to us but we have not given up hope if you are not altogether with us today there is tomorrow i tell you frankly mannering that i look upon you as a man temporarily led astray by a wave of sentimentality so long as the world lasts there will be rich men and poor but you must always remember in considering this that it is character as well as circumstances which is at the root of the acquisition of wealth generations have gone to the formation of our social fabric it is the slow evolution of the human laws of necessity the socialist and the sentimentalist and the philanthropist dropping gold through his fingers have each had their fling at it but their cry is like the cry from the wildernessa long lone thing and then to come to the real point mannering grant for a moment all that you have told borrowdean and myself about the condition of the labour classes in the great towns and the universal depression of trade how can you possibly imagine that the imposition of tariff duties is the sovereign or even a possible remedy why you yourself have been one of the most brilliant pamphleteers against anything of the sort you have been called the cobden of the day you cannot throw principles away like an old garment  let us leave for one moment mannering answered the personal side of the matter i have seen in the majority of our large cities terrible and convincing proof of the decline of our manufacturing industries i have seen the outcome of this in hundreds of ruined homes in a whole generation coming into the world half starved half clothedgod help those children i have always maintained that the labouring classes should be the happiest race of people in this country i find them without leisure or recreation fighting fate with both hands for food redford the whole world has never shown us a greater tragedy than the one which we others deliberately and persistently close our eyes toi mean the struggle for life which is being waged in every one of our great cities  we have statistics borrowdean began  damn statistics mannering interrupted i have juggled with figures myself in the old days and i know how easy it is so do you and so does redford this is what i want to put to you the tragedy is there perhaps those who have faced it and come back again to tell of their experiences have been a little hystericalthe horror of it has carried them away they may not have adopted the most effectual means of making the world understand but it is there i have seen it a thousandth part of this misery in a country with which we had nothing to do and no business to interfere and we should be having mass meetings at exeter hall and making general asses of ourselves all over the country shrieking for intervention wasting a whole dictionary of rhetoric and probably getting well snubbed for our pains and because the murders are by slow poison instead of with steel because they are in our own cities and amongst our own people we accept them with a sort of placid satisfaction you lord redford speak of character and enunciate social laws and borrowdean will argue that after all the trade of the country is not so bad as it might be and will make an epigram on the importation of sentimentality into politics in plain words lord redford we as a party are asleep to what is going on one statesman has recognized it and proposed a startling and drastic remedy we attack the remedy tooth and nail but we place forward no counter proposition it is as though a dying man were attended by two doctors one of whom has prepared a remedy which the other declines to administer without suggesting one of his own it is not a logical position the medicine may not cure but let the man have his chance of life  your simile lord redford said assumes that the man is dying  i have seen the mark of death upon his face mannering answered the men who are traitors to their country today are those who healthy enough themselves talk causeless and shallow optimism which is fed alone by their own prosperity the doctrine of christ is the care of others if you do not believe the sickroom is open also to you go there unprejudiced and with an open mind and you will come away as i have come away  must we take it then mannering lord redford said gravely that you are prepared to support the administering of the medicine you spoke of  mannering was silent for a moment  at least he said i am not going to be amongst those who cry out against it and offer nothing themselves i am going to analyze that medicine and if i see a chance of life in it i shall say let us run a little risk rather than stand by inactive to look upon the face of death in other words i become for the moment a passive figure in politics so far as this question is concerned  lord redford held out his hand  let it go at that mannering he said i believe that you will come back to us we shall be always glad of your support but of course you will understand that the position from today is changed if you had carried the standard as we had hoped the reward also was to have been yours we must elect one of ourselves to take your place to put it plainly your defection now releases us from all pledges  i understand mannering answered it was scarcely ambition which brought me back into politics and i must work for the cause in which i believe if i am forced to take any definite action i shall of course resign my seat  the door closed behind him borrowdean struck a match and lord redford looked thoughtfully out of the window across the park  i was always afraid of this borrowdean said gloomily there is a leaven of madness in the man  lord redford shrugged his shoulders  genius or madness he remarked we may yet see him a modern rienzi carried into power on the shoulders of the people such a man might become anything as a matter of fact i think that he will go back into his study he has the brain to fashion wonderful thoughts and the lips to fire them into life but i doubt his adaptability i cannot imagine him ever becoming a real and effective force  borrowdean who was bitterly disappointed smoked furiously  we shall see he said if mannering is not for us i think that i can at least promise that he does no harm on the other side  lord redford turned away from the window he eyed borrowdean curiously  it was you he remarked who brought mannering back into public life you had a certain reward for it and you would have had a much greater one if things had gone our way but i want you to remember this mannering is best left alonenow for the present you understand me  borrowdean shrugged his shoulders there was a good deal too much sentiment in politics                                       mannering and berenice came together for a few moments on the terrace after dinner he was not so completely engrossed in his own affairs as to fail to notice her lack of colour and a certain weariness of manner which had kept her more silent than usual during the whole evening  well she said  there is nothing definite he answered you see the question of tariff reform is not before the house at present and redford does not require me to resign my seat but of course it will come to that sooner or later  she leaned over the grey balustrade with her it was a moment of weakness she was suddenly conscious of the fact that she was no longer a young woman the time when she might hope to find in life the actual flavour and joy of passionate living was nearing the end and a little while ago they had seemed so near the pity of it stirred up a certain sense of rebellion in her heart she was still a beautiful woman she knew very well the arts by which men are enslaved why should she not try them upon himthis man who loved her who seemed willing to sacrifice both their lives to a piece of senseless quixoticism her fingers touched his and held them softly thrilled through all his senses he turned towards her wonderingly  are we wise lawrence she whispered if indeed you love me life is so short and i am not a young woman any more i have been lonely so long i want a little happiness before i go  dont he cried hoarsely you knowwhat comes between us  she was a little indignant but still tender  this woman does not want you lawrence she cried i do oh lawrence  he faltered she laid her fingers upon his arm  come down the steps she murmured and i will show you lady redfords rosegarden  her touch was compelling he could not have resisted it and about his heart lay the joy of her near presence side by side they moved along the terraceit seemed to him that they passed towards their destiny the gentle rustling of her clothes their slight mysterious perfume was like music to him a sudden wave of passion carried him away the primitive virility of the man awake at last demanded its birthright  and then upon the lower step they met borrowdean and he placed himself squarely in their way  i am sorry to interrupt you he said gravely but lord redford has sent me out to look for you and to send you at once into the library something rather serious has happened  mannering came down to earth  the evening papers have come borrowdean said the pall mall has the whole story you were seen at the workingmens club in glasgow  mannering turned towards the house his nerves were all tingling with excitement but the thread had suddenly been snapped he was no longer in danger of yielding to that flood of delicious sensations his voice had been almost steady as he had begged berenice to excuse him berenice stood quite still her hand was pressed to her side her dark eyes were lit with passion she leaned forward towards borrowdean and seemed about to strike him  you will find yourselfrepaid for this sir leslie she murmured  then she turned abruptly away for an hour or more she walked alone amongst the trellised walks of lady redfords rosegarden but mannering did not return     chapter xiii  the woman andthe other woman   you see mannering lord redford said tapping the outspread evening paper with his forefinger the situation now presents a different aspect i have no wish to force your handa few hours ago i think i proved this but if you are to remain even nominally with us some sort of pronouncement must come from you in reply to these statements  yes mannering said that is quite reasonable  the postponement of your campaign has been hinted at before lord redford continued but we have never used the word abandonment now to speak bluntly the whole fat is in the fire your place on the fence is no longer possible you must make your own declaration and it must be for one of three things you must remain with us abandon public life for a time or go over to the other side and you must make promptly an announcement of your intentions  i have no alternative in the matter mannering said in fact i think that this has happened opportunely my presence with you was sure to prove something of an embarrassment to all of us i shall apply for the chiltern hundreds tomorrow and i shall not seek to reenter the present parliament the few months respite will be useful to me i can only express to you lord redford my sincere gratitude for all your consideration and my regret for this disarrangement of your plans  lord redford sighed why were men born he wondered with such a prodigious capacity for playing the fool  my chief regret mannering he said is for you the fates so controlled circumstances that you seemed certain to achieve as a young man what is the crowning triumph of us veterans in the political world i respect the honest scruples of every man but it seems to me that you are throwing away an unparalleled opportunity in a fit of what a practical man like myself can only call sentimentality i have no more to say forgive me if i have said too much for the rest give us the pleasure of your company here for as long as you find it convenient we will abjure politics and you shall give me my revenge at golf  mannering shook his head  i am very much obliged to you he said but there is only one course open to me i must go back and make my plans if i could have a carriage for the nineforty  lord redford made no effort to induce him to change his mind though he remained courteous to the last  i was really glad to have him go he told borrowdean afterwards his very presencethe thought that there could be such colossal fools in the worldirritated me beyond measure you can write his epitaph leslie if your humorous vein is working for the man is politically dead  one never knows berenice said quietly there must be something great about a man capable of such prodigious selfsacrifice for at heart lawrence mannering is an ambitious man  lord redford shrugged his shoulders  perhaps he said but i am very sure of this there is nothing so great about the man as his folly  berenice smiled  we shall see she said personally i believe that sir leslie would find his epitaph a little previous i saw a great deal of lawrence mannering in the country and i think that i understand him as well as either of you i believe that his day will come  well all i can say is lord redford pronounced that i very much wish you had left him down at his country home between you you have created a very serious situation i must go up to town tomorrow and see manningham in the meantime leslie i shall leave those reports severely alone we must ignore mannering altogether  berenice turned away with a smile at her lips she had a very little opinion of lord redford and his following already she saw the man whose career they counted finished at the head of a new and greater party there were plenty of clever men of the coming generation plenty of room for compromises for the formation of a great national party out of the scattered units of a disunited opposition she believed mannering strong enough to do this she saw in it greater possibilities than might have been forthcoming even if he had been chosen to lead the somewhat ragged party represented by lord redford and his followers for the rest she had been very near the success she so desired only an accident had robbed her of victory if once they had reached the rosegarden she knew that she would have triumphed  as her maid took off her jewellery that night she smiled at herself in the glass she was thinking of that moment on the terrace the glow had not wholly faded from her faceshe saw herself with her long slender neck and smooth unwrinkled complexion still beautiful still a woman to be loved her maid ventured to whisper a word of respectful compliment truly madame la duchesse was growing younger                                       what strange whim or evil fate had turned his feet in that direction mannering often tried to trace backwards the workings of his mind that night but he never wholly succeeded he reached london about eleven and sent his man home with his luggage intending merely to call in at the club for letters but afterwards he remembered only that he had strolled aimlessly along homewards thinking deeply and not particularly careful as to his direction even then he would have passed the house in sloane gardens without looking up but for the civil goodnight sir of a coachman sitting on the box of a small brougham drawn up against the kerb he raised his head to return the salute and realized at once where he was almost at the same moment the front door opened and behind a glow of light in the hall he saw a familiar figure in the act of passing out to her carriage the street was well lit and he was almost opposite a lamppost she recognized him at once  lawrence she exclaimed incredulously youwere you coming in  she was wrapped from head to foot in a long white opera cloak but the jewels in her hair and at her throat glistened in the flashing light she moved slowly forward to his side her maid who had been coming out to open the carriage door lingered behind  iupon my word i scarcely know how i came here he answered a little bewildered i was walking homeit is scarcely out of my wayand thinking you are going out  she nodded looking at her now more closely he saw the shadows under her eyes only imperfectly concealed the little gesture with which she answered him savoured of weariness  yes i was going out i have sat alone with my thoughts all day and i dont want to end my life in a lunatic asylum i want a little change that is all if you will come in and talk to me instead that will do as well any sort of distraction you see she added with a hard little laugh just to keep me from  she did not finish her sentence he looked at her gravely and from her to the waiting carriage he suddenly realized how the altered condition of affairs must affect her  i shall have to come and see you in a day or two he said but now he hesitated  why not now then she asked  you have an engagement he said  she shook her head  i was only going somewhere to supper i was going to call for eva fanesborough and i suppose we should have had some bridge afterwards come in instead lawrence i can telephone to her  already a presage of evil seemed to be forming itself in his mind he would have given anything to have thought of some valid excuse  your carriage  pooh she answered john i shall not want you tonight she said to the coachman come  she led the way and mannering followed as the maid closed the door behind them mannering felt his breath quickenhis sense of depression grew stronger he seemed threatened by some new and intangible danger he stood on the hearthrug while she bent over the switch and turned on the electric light in the sittingroom then she threw off her cloak and looked at him curiously for a moment her face softened  my dear lawrence she said has politics done this or are you ill  i am quite well he answered a little tired perhaps i have had rather a trying day  she rang the bell and ordered sandwiches and wine  you look like a corpse she said and stood over him while he ate and drank and all the time that indefinable fear within him grew she made him smoke then she leaned back in an easychair and looked across at him  you had something to say to me what was it  nothing good he answered i have quarrelled with my party and i have to resign my seat in the house  already  already i am sorry as of course in a few months time i should have been in office and drawing a considerable salary as it is he hesitated  oh i understand she said well it doesnt matter much i only have the house for six months furnished and thats paid for in advance john must go and the horses can be sold  he looked at her in amazement only a few months ago she had talked very differently  ii am not sure whether all that will be necessary he said i can find a tenant for blakely and i daresay i can manage another hundred a year or so only of course the large increase we had thought of will not be possible now  no i suppose not she answered idly  he moved in his chair uncomfortably he found her wholly incomprehensible  what a beast i must have seemed to you always she exclaimed suddenly  why he asked pointlessly  ive sponged on you all my life and youre not a rich man are you lawrence then i dragged you into politics to supply me with the means to spend more money my claim on you was one of sentiment only butive made you pay no wonder you hate me  your claim on me even to every penny i possess mannering answered was a perfectly just one i have never denied it and i have done my best and as to hating you you know quite well it is not true  ah she rose suddenly to her feet and before he had realized her intention she was on her knees by his side she caught at his hand and kept her face hidden from him  lawrence she cried i was mad the other day it was all the pentup bitterness of years which seemed to escape me so suddenly i said so much that i did not mean toi was mad dear oh lawrence i am so lonely  then the fear in his heart became a live thing he was dumb he could not have spoken had he tried  it was your coldness all these years she murmured you were different once you know that at first when the horror of what happened was young i thought i understood i thought as it wore off that you would be different the horror has gone now lawrence we know that it was an accident it might as well have been another as you but you have not changed i have given up hoping i have tried everything else and i am a very miserable woman now i am going to pray to you lawrence you do not care for me more pretend that you do you cannot give me your love give me the best you can dont despise me too utterly lawrence pity me if you will heaven knows i need it andyou will be a little kind  her hands were clasped about his neck he disengaged himself gently  blanche he cried hoarsely i love another woman  are you engaged to her  no not now  then what does it matter what does it matter anyhow it is not the real thing i am asking you for lawrenceonly the makebelief keep the rest for her if you must but give me lies false looks hollow caresses anything you see what depths i have fallen to  he held her hands tightly a great pity for her filled his heartpity for her and for himself  blanche he said there is one way only it is for you to decide will you marry me i will do my best to make you a good husband  marry you she gasped lawrence i dare not  i cannot alter the past he said sadly it never seemed to me possible that you could care for myafter what happened but  oh it is not that she interrupted there isthe other woman and lawrence i should be afraid i am not good enough  whatever you are blanche he said gravely remember that it is i who am responsible for your having been left alone to face the world your follies belong to me i am quite free to share their burden with you  but the other woman she faltered  i must love her always he said quietly but i cannot marry her  and you would kiss me sometimes lawrence she whispered  he took her quietly into his arms and kissed her forehead  i will do my best blanche he said i dare not promise any more     book iii     chapter i  matrimony and an awkward meeting   how delightfully continental blanche exclaimed as the headwaiter showed them to their table hester did you ever see anything more quaint  it is perfect the girl answered leaning back in her chair and looking around with quiet content  mannering took up the menu and ordered dinner then he lit a cigarette and looked around  it certainly is quaint he said one dines out of doors often enough especially over here but i have never seen a courtyard made such excellent use of before the place is really old too  they had found their way to a small seaside resort in the north of france which mannering had heard highly praised by some casual acquaintance the courtyard of the small hotel was set out with round dining tables and the illumination was afforded by japanese lanterns hung from every available spot a small band played from a wooden balcony monsieur the proprietor walked anxiously from table to table all smiles and bows through the roofed way which led from the street one caught a distant glimpse of the sea  mannering to the surprise of his friends and to his own secret amazement had survived the crisis which had seemed at one time likely enough to wreck his life politically he was no longer a great power for the party whose cause he had half espoused had met with a distinct reverse and he himself was without a seat in parliament but amongst the masses his was still a name to conjure with socially his marriage with blanche phillimore had scarcely proved the disaster which every one had anticipated her old ways and manner of life lay in the background she had aged a little perhaps and grown thinner but she had shown from the first an almost pathetic desire to adapt her life to his to assume an altogether unobtrusive position and if she could not in any way influence his destiny at least she did not hamper it she had made no demands upon him which he was not able to grant she had lived where he had suggested she had never embarrassed him with too vehement an affection as for mannering himself he had found solace in work defeated at the polls he had declined a safe seat and remained the chosen independent candidate of a great northern constituency he addressed public meetings occasionally and he contributed to the reviews without having ever finally committed himself to a definite scheme of tariff reform he preached everywhere the doctrine of consideration in a modified way he was reckoned now as one of its possible supporters  they were almost halfway through their dinner when some commotion was heard in the narrow street outside then with much tooting of horns and the shrill shouting of directions from the bystanders two heavily laden touring cars turned slowly into the cobbled courtyard and drew up within a few feet of the semicircular line of tables mannerings little party watched the arrivals with an interest shared by every one in the place muffled up in cloaks and veils they were at first unrecognized it was mannering himself who first realized who they were  clara he exclaimed to the young lady who was standing almost by his side welcome to bonestre  she turned towards him with a little start  uncle she exclaimed how extraordinary why how long have you been here  we arrived this afternoon he answered you remember hester dont you and this is mrs mannering  clara shook hands with both she declared afterwards that she was surprised into it but she would certainly never have recognized in the quiet rather wearylooking woman who sat at her uncles side the blanche phillimore whom she had more than once passionately declared that she would sooner die than speak to she murmured a few mechanical words and then suddenly realizing the situation she glanced a little anxiously over her shoulder  you know who i am with uncle she whispered  but mannering was already face to face with berenice she held out her hand without hesitation if she felt any emotion she concealed it perfectly her voice was steady and cordial if her cheeks were pale the dust lay thickly upon them all mannering tall and grave in his plain dinner clothes and black tie stood almost like a statue before her until her extended hand invited his movement  what an extraordinary meeting she said quietly i am very glad to see you again mr mannering we have had such a ride all the way from havre along roads an inch thick in dust this is your wife is it not i am very glad to know you mrs mannering  all that might have been embarrassing in the encounter seemed dissolved by the utterly conventional tone of her greeting sir leslie borrowdean came up and joined them and lord and lady redford then the little party escorted by the landlord disappeared into the hotel mannering resumed his seat and continued his dinner he leaned over and addressed his wife his tone was kinder than usual  when we have had our coffee he said i hope that you will feel like a walk the moon is coming up over the sea  she shook her head  take hester she said she loves that sort of thing i have a headache and i should like to go upstairs as soon as possible  so hester walked with mannering out to the rocks where pools of water left by the tide shone like silver in the moonlight they talked very little at first but as they leaned over the rail and looked out seawards hester broke the silence and spoke of the things which they both had in their minds  i am sorry they came she said i am afraid it will upset mother and it is not pleasant for you is it  for me it is nothing hester he answered and i hope that your mother will not worry about it they all behaved very nicely and we need not see much of them  she passed her arm through his  tell me how you feel about it she begged it must seem to you like a glimpse of the life you left whenwhen youmarried  hester he said earnestly dont make any mistake about this dont let your mother make any mistake it was my political change of views which separated me from all my former friendsthat entirely to them i am an apostate and a very bad sort of one i deserted them just when they needed me i did it from convictions which are stronger today than ever but none the less i threw them over i always said that they very much exaggerated my importance as a factor in the situation and my words are proved they carried the elections without any difficulty and they have formed a strong government they can afford to be magnanimous to me if i had stayed with them i should have been in office as it was i lost even my seat  you did what you thought was right she said softly no one can do any more  mannering thought over her words as they walked homewards over the sanddunes yes he had done that was he satisfied with the result he had become a minor power in politics men spoke of him as a weaklingas one who had shrunk from the burden of great responsibility and left the friends who had trusted him in the lurch and thenthere was the other thing he had paid a great price for this womans salvation had he succeeded she had given up all her old ways she dressed she lived she carried herself through life even with a furtive almost a pathetic attempt to reach his standard often he caught her watching him as though fearful lest some word or action of hers had been displeasing to him and yethe wonderedwas this what she had hoped for had he given her what she had the right to expect had he indeed received value for the price he had paid he asked hester a sudden question  hester is your mother happy  hester started a little  if she is not she answered gravely she must be a very ungrateful woman  he left it at that and together they retraced their steps to the hotel hester slipped up to her room by a side entrance but mannering was obliged to pass the table where the new arrivals were lingering over their coffee clara and lord redford both called to him  come and have a smoke with us mannering and tell us all about this place the latter said the duchess and your niece are charmed with it and they want to stay for a few days are there any golf links  come and sit next me uncle clara cried and tell me how you like being guardian to an heiress how i have blessed that dear departed aunt of mine every day of my life  mannering accepted a cigarette and sat down  the golf links are excellent he said as for your aunt clara she was a very sensible woman her money was so well invested that i have practically nothing to do i expect my duties will commence when the young men come  miss mannering sir leslie said gravely is not at all attracted by young men she prefers something more staid i have serious hopes that before our little tour is over i shall have persuaded her to marry me  you dear man clara exclaimed i only wish youd give me the chance  theres a brazen child to have to chaperon the duchess said positively asking for a proposal  and not in vain sir leslie declared walk down to the sea with me miss clara and ill propose to you in my most approved fashion i think you said that the investments were sound mannering  the investments are all right mannering answered but i shall have nothing to do with fortunehunters  and i a cabinet minister sir leslie declared miss clara let us have that walk  tomorrow night she promised when i get up it will be to go to bed even your lovemaking sir leslie could not keep me awake tonight  the duchess rose the dust was gone but she was pale and looked tired  let us leave these men to make plans for us she said i hope we shall see something of you tomorrow mr mannering goodnight everybody  mannering rose and bowed with the others for a moment their eyes met not a muscle of her face changed and yet mannering was conscious of a sudden wave of emotion he understood that she had not forgotten     chapter ii  the snub for borrowdean   berenice sat at one of the small round tables in the courtyard finishing her morning coffee sir leslie sat upon the steps by her side it was one of those brilliant mornings in early september when the sunlight seems to find its way everywhere even here surrounded by the pile of worn grey stone buildings which threw shadows everywhere it had penetrated a long shaft of soft warm light stretched across the cobbles to their feet berenice slim and elegant fresh as the morning itself glanced up at her companion with a smile  clara she remarked does not like to be kept waiting  she is not down yet he answered and there is something i want to say to you  her delicate eyebrows were a trifle uplifted  do you think that you had better she asked  i am a man he said and things are known to me which a woman would scarcely discover do you think that it is quite fair to send lady redford out motoring with mrs mannering  why not  lady redford is of course ignorant of mrs mannerings antecedents what you may do yourself concerns no one you make your own social laws and you have a right to but i do not think that even you have a right to pass blanche phillimore on to your friends even under the shelter of mannerings name  berenice looked at him for several seconds without speaking borrowdean bit his lip  if we were not acquaintances of long standing sir leslie she said calmly i should consider your remarks impertinent as it is i choose to look upon them as a regrettable mistake the person whoever she may be whom the duchess of lenchester chooses to receive is usually acceptable to her friends i beg that you will not refer to the subject again  sir leslie bowed  i have no more to say he declared knowing naturally a good deal more than you concerning the lady in question i considered it my duty to say what i have said  it is the sort of duty berenice murmured which the whole world seems to accept always with a relish one does not expect it so much from your sex mrs mannering was born one of us and she has had an unhappy life if she has been indiscreet she has her excuses i choose to whitewash her do you understand i pay dearly enough for my social position and i certainly claim its privileges i recognize mrs mannering and i require my friends to do so  sir leslie rose up  you are if you will forgive my saying so he remarked drily more generous than wise  that she answered is my affair here comes clara before you start find mr mannering he is in the hotel somewhere writing letters and tell him that when he has finished i wish to speak to him  sir leslie only bowed he felt himself opposed by a will as strong as his own and he was too seriously annoyed to trust himself to speech clara in her cool white linen dress came strolling up  what have you been doing to sir leslie she asked laughing he has just gone into the hotel with a face like a thundercloud  i have been giving him a lesson in christian charity berenice answered he needs it  clara nodded she understood  i think you are awfully kind she said  berenice smiled  i hate all narrowness she said and if there is a man on gods earth who deserves to have people kind to him it is your uncle  sir leslie returned and he and clara departed for the golf links berenice was left alone in the little grey courtyard fragrant with the perfume of scented shrubs and blossoming plants filled too with the warm sunlight which seemed to find its way into every corner she sat at her little table paler than a few moments ago her teeth clenched her white fingers clasped together underneath her muslin blouse her heart had suddenly commenced to beat fiercelya sense of excitement long absent was stealing through her veins the bonds which a years studied selfrepression had forged were snapped apart she knew now what it meant the great inexpressible thing the one eternal emotion which has come throbbing down the world from the days when poets sung their first song and painters flung truth on to canvas she was a woman like the others and she loved her unique position in society her carefully studied life her lofty ambitions were like vain things crumbling into dust before her eyes a year of cold misery seemed atoned for by the simple fact that within a few yards of her he sat writingthat within a few minutes he would be by her side of the future she scarcely thought hers was the womans love content with small things its passion was of the soul and its song was selfsacrifice but if she had knownif she had only known  he came out to her soon his manner was quiet and a little grave selfcontrol came easier to him because the truth had been with him longer nevertheless he was not wholly at his ease  you know what has happened she asked smiling the redfords have taken mrs mannering and her daughter motoring and sir leslie and clara have gone to the golf links you and i are left to entertain one another  what would you like to do he asked simply  i should like to walk she answered down by the sea somewhere i am ready now  they made their way through the little town along the promenade and on to the sands beyond then a climb and they found themselves in a thick wood stretching back inland from the sea she pointed to a fallen trunk  let us sit down she said there are so many things i want to ask you  on the way they had spoken only of indifferent matters yet from the first mannering had felt the presence of a subtle something in her deportment towards him for which he could find no explanation he himself was feeling the tension of this meeting he had expected to find her so different gracious perhaps because she was a great lady but certainly without any of these suggestions of something kept back which continually without any sort of direct expression made themselves felt and when they sat down she said nothing he had the feeling that it was because she dared not trust herself to speak surprise and agitation kept him too silent  at last she spoke her voice was not very steady and she avoided looking at him  i should like she said to have you tell me about yourselfabout your lifeand your work  it is told in a few words he answered somewhere somehow i have failed i could not adopt the birmingham programme i could not oppose it you know what isolation means politicallyabuse from one side and contempt from the other that is what i am experiencing the working classes have some faith in me i believe my work such as it is is solely for them i suppose the papers tell the truth when they say that mine is a ruined careeronly you see i am trying to do the best i can with the pieces  yes she said softly that is something to do the best one can with the pieces we all might try to do that  he smiled  you at least have no need to consider such a thing he said so far as any woman can be preeminent in politics you have succeeded in becoming so i saw that a ladys paper a few weeks ago said that your influence outside the cabinet was more powerful than any one mans within it  yes she said calmly the papers talk like that it gives their readers something to laugh at i wonder what you would say my friend if i told you that i too am engaged in that same thankless task i too am striving to do the best i can with the pieces  you are not serious he protested  i am very serious indeed she declared shall i tell you more shall i tell you when i made my mistake  no he cried hoarsely  but i shall she continued suddenly gripping his arm i meant to tell you i brought you here to tell you i made my mistake when i let leslie borrowdean take you back to lord redford just as we were entering the rosegarden at bayleigh do you remember i made my mistake when i suffered anything in this great world to come between me and a womans only chance of happiness i made my mistake when i was too proud to tell you that i loved you and that nothing else in the world mattered there you tried me hard you know that but my mistake was none the less fatal i ought to have held fast by you and i let you go and i shall suffer for it all my days  you cared like that he cried  worse she answered turning her flushed face towards him i care now kiss me lawrence  he held her in his arms time stood still until she stole away with an odd little laugh  there she said i have vindicated myself no one can ever call me a proud woman again and you know the truth i might have had you all to myself and i let you go now i am going to do the best i can with the pieces the half of you i want belongs to your wife i must be content with the other half i suppose i may have that  but your friends  bosh my friends and your wife must make the best of it i shant rob her again as i did just now you can blot that outantedate it it belonged to the past but i am not going through life as i have gone through this last year longing for a sight of you longing to hear you speak and denying myself just because you are married live with your wife lawrence and make her as happy as you can but remember that you owe me a great deal too and you must do your best to pay it dont look at me as though i were talking nonsense  he held her hand she placed it in his unresistingly all the lines in his face seemed smoothed out the fire of youth was in his eyes  do you wonder that i am surprised he asked all this year you have made no sign all the time i have been schooling myself to forget you  dont dare to tell me that you have succeeded she exclaimed  not an iota he answered it was the most miserable failure of my life  she smiled upon him delightfully and gently withdrew her hand  lawrence she said i am going to talk to you seriously for one minute you are too conscientious for a politician dont let the same vice spoil our friendship certain things you owe to your wife mind i admit that though from some points of view even that might be disputed but you also owe me certain thingsand i mean to be paid i wont be avoided mind i want to be treated as a very closeand dearcompanionandkiss me once more lawrence and then well begin she wound up with a little sob in her throat  an hour later the whole party had déjeuner together in the courtyard of the little hotel the duchess was noticeably kind to mrs mannering and she snubbed sir leslie clara looked on a little gravely the situation contained many elements of interest     chapter iii  cloudsand a call to arms   the first cloud appeared towards the end of the third day at bonestre blanche and sir leslie were left alone and he hastened to improve the opportunity  the duchess and your husband he remarked appear very easily to have picked up again the threads of their old friendship  the duchess she answered is a very charming woman i am sure that you find her so dont you  we are very old friends he answered but i was never admitted to exactly the same privileges as your husband enjoys  the duchess she answered calmly is a woman of taste  sir leslie muttered something under his breath blanche made a movement as though to take up again the book which she had been reading in a sheltered corner of the hotel garden  dont you think he said that we should make better friends than enemies  i am not at all sure she answered calmly to tell you the truth i dont fancy you particularly in either capacity  he laughed unpleasantly  you are scarcely complimentary he remarked  i did not mean to be she answered why should i  you are content then to let your husband drift back into his old relations with the duchess i presume that you know what they were  whether i am or not she answered what business is it of yours  i will tell you if you like he answered in fact i think it would be better it has been the one desire of my life to marry the duchess of lenchester myself  she smiled at him scornfully  come she said let me give you a little advice give up the idea they say that lookerson see most of the game and so far as i am concerned im certainly the lookeron of this party the duchess doesnt care a row of pins about you  there are other marriages besides marriages of affection sir leslie said stiffly the duchess is ambitious  but she is also a woman blanche declared and she is in love  with whom  with my husband i presume that is clear enough to most people  sir leslie was a little staggered  you take it very coolly he remarked  why not the duchess is too proud a woman to give herself away and my husbandbelongs to me  you havent any idea of taking poison or anything of that sort i suppose have you he inquired the other woman nearly always does that  not in real life blanche answered composedly besides im not the other womanim the one the duchess is the other  but your husband  do you know i should prefer not to discuss my husbandwith you blanche said calmly taking up her book he is not the sort of man you would be at all likely to understand if you want a rich wife why dont you propose to clara mannering i suppose you knew that some unheardof aunt had left her fifty thousand pounds  sir leslie rose to his feet  i dont fancy that you and i are very sympathetic this afternoon he remarked i will go and see if any one has returned  do she answered i shall miss you of course but my book is positively absorbing and i am dying to go on with it  sir leslie left the garden without another word blanche held her book before her face until he had disappeared then it slipped from her fingers she looked hard into a cluster of roses and she saw only two figuresalways the same figures her eyes were set her face was wan and old  the other woman she murmured to herself that is what i am and i cant live up to it i ought to take poison or get run over or something and i know very well i shant bother the man why couldnt he leave me alone  after dinner that evening she accepted her husbands nightly invitation and walked with him for a little while the others followed  how much longer can you stay away from england lawrence she asked him  oha fortnight i should think he answered i am not tied to any particular date you like it here i hope  immensely areour friends going to remain  i havent heard them say anything about moving on yet he answered  are you in love with the duchess still lawrence  am iblanche  dont be angry you made a mistake once you know dont make another im not a jealous woman and i dont ask much from you but im your wife thats all  she turned and called to hester the little party rearranged itself mannering found himself with berenice  what was your wife saying to you she asked  he shrugged his shoulders  it was the beginning he remarked  berenice sighed  it is a strange thing she said but in this world no one can ever be happy except at some one elses expense it is a most unnatural law of compensation shall we move on tomorrow  the day after he pleaded tomorrow we are going to berneval  she nodded  we are queer people i think she said i have been perfectly satisfied this week simply to be with you when it comes to an end i should like it to come suddenly  he thought of her words an hour later when on his return to the hotel they handed him a telegram he passed it on at once to lord redford and glanced at his watch  poor cunningham he said it was a short triumph for him i must go back tonight or the first train tomorrow morning the sitting member for my division of leeds died suddenly last night blanche he said to his wife i must be on the spot at once  she rose to her feet  i will go and pack she said  lady redford followed her very soon clara and sir leslie had not yet returned from their stroll lord redford remained alone with them  i scarcely know what sort of fortune to wish you mannering he said perhaps your first speech will tell us  berenice leaned back in her chair  i cant imagine you as a labour member in the least she remarked  doesnt this force your hand a little mannering lord redford said i understand that you were anxious to avoid a direct pronouncement upon the fiscal policy for the present  mannering nodded gravely  it is quite time i made up my mind he said i shall do so now  may we find ourselves in the same lobby lord redford said i will go and find my man he may as well take you to the station in the car  berenice smiled at mannering luminously through the shadowy lights  dear friend she said i am delighted that you are going our little time here has been delightful but we had reached its limit i like to think that you are going back into the thick of it dont be fainthearted lawrence dont lose faith in yourself you have chosen a terribly lonely path if any man can find his way to the top you can and dont dare to forget me sir  he caught her cheerful tone  you are inspiring he declared thank heaven i have a twelve hours journey before me i need time for thought if ever a man did  dont worry about it she answered lightly the truth is somewhere in your brain i suppose and when the time comes you will find it much better think about your sandwiches  the car backed into the yard blanche reappeared and behind her mannerings bag  i do hope that hester and i have packed everything she said we could come over tomorrow if theres anything you want us for if not we shall stay here for another week goodbye  she calmly held up her lips and mannering kissed them after a moments hesitation she remained by his side even when he turned to say farewell to berenice  i am sure you ought to be going she said calmly i will send on your letters if there are any tomorrow wire your address as soon as you arrive good luck  the car glided away they all stood in a group to see him go and waved indiscriminate farewells blanche moved a little apart as the car disappeared and berenice watched her curiously she was rubbing her lips with her handkerchief  a sting she remarked becoming suddenly aware of the others scrutiny nothing that hurts very much     chapter iv  disaster   mannering in his sittingroom at last locked the door and drew a long breath of relief upon his eardrums there throbbed still the yells of his enthusiastic but noisy adherentsthe truculent cries of those who had heard his great speech with satisfaction of those who saw pass from amongst themselves to a newer school of thought one whom they had regarded as their natural leader it was over at last he had made his pronouncement to some it might seem a compromise to himself it was the only logical outcome of his long period of thought he spoke for the workingman he demanded inquiry consideration experiment he demanded them in a way of his own at once novel and convincing many of the most brilliant articles which had ever come from his pen he abjured he drew a sharp line between the province of the student and the duty of the politician  and now he was alone at last free to think and dream free to think of bonestre to wonder what reports of his meeting would reach the little french wateringplace and how they would be received he could see berenice reading the morning paper in the little grey courtyard with the pigeons flying above her head and the sunlight streaming across the flags he could hear borrowdeans sneer could see lord redfords shrug of the shoulders there is little sympathy in the world for the man who dares to change his mind  there was a knock at the door and his servant entered with a tray  i have brought the whiskey and soda sandwiches and cigarettes sir he announced i am sorry to say that there is a person outside whom i cannot get rid of his name is fardell and he insists upon it that his business is of importance  mannering smiled  you can show him up at once he ordered now and whenever he calls  fardell appeared almost directly mannering had seen him before during the day but noticed at once a change in him he was pale and looked like a man who had received some sort of a shock  come in fardell and sit down mannering said you look tired have a drink  fardell walked straight to the tray and helped himself to some neat whiskey  thank you sir he said iive had rather a knockout blow  he emptied the tumbler and set it down  mr mannering sir he said ive just heard a man bet twenty to one in crisp fivepound banknotes that you never sit for west leeds  was he drunk or sober mannering asked  sober as a judge  mannering smiled  how often did you take him he asked  not once i didnt dare  mannering who had been in the act of helping himself to a whiskey and soda looked around with the decanter in his hand  i dont understand you he said bewildered you know very well that the chances so far as they can be reckoned up are slightly in my favour  they were fardell answered heaven knows what they are now  mannering was a little annoyed it seemed to him that fardell must have been drinking  do you mind explaining yourself he asked  i can do so fardell answered i must do so but while i am about it i want you to put on your hat and come with me  mannering laughed shortly  what tonight he exclaimed no thank you be reasonable fardell ive had my days work and i think ive earned a little rest to be frank with you i dont like mysteries if youve anything to say out with it  right richard fardell answered i am going to ask you a question mr mannering go back a good many years as many years as you like is there anything in your life as a younger man say when you first entered parliament whichif it were brought up against you nowmight beembarrassing  mannering did not answer for several moments he was already pale and tired but he felt what little colour remained leave his face least of all he had expected this even nowwhat could the man mean what could be known  i am not sure that i understand you he said there is nothing that could be known i am sure of that  there is a person fardell said slowly who has made extraordinary statements our opponents have got hold of him the substance of them is this he says that many years ago you were the lover of a married woman that you sold her husband worthless shares and ruined him and that finallyin a quarrelhe declares that he was an eyewitness of thisthat you killed him  mannering slowly subsided into his chair his cheeks were blanched richard fardell watched him with feverish anxiety  it is a lie mannering declared there is no man living who can say this  the man says fardell continued stonily that his name is parkins and that he was butler to mr stephen phillimore eleven years ago  parkins is dead mannering said hoarsely he has been dead for many years  he is living in leeds today fardell answered a journalist from the yorkshire herald was with him for two hours this afternoon  blanchei was told that he was dead mannering said  then the story is true fardell asked  not as you have told it mannering answered  there is truth in it  yes  richard fardell was silent for several moments he paced up and down the room his hands behind his back his eyebrows contracted into a heavy frown for him it was a bitter moment he was only a halfeducated illiterate man possessed of sturdy common sense and a wonderful tenacity of purpose he had permitted himself to indulge in a little silent but none the less absolute heroworship and mannering had been the hero  you must come with me at once and see this man he said at last he has not yet signed his statement we must do what we can to keep him quiet  mannering took up his coat and hat without a word they left the hotel and fardell summoned a cab  it is a long way he explained we will drive part of the distance and walk the rest we may be watched already  mannering nodded the last blow was so unexpected that he felt in a sense numbed his speech only a few hours ago had made large inroads upon his powers of endurance his partial recantation had cost him many hours of torture from which he was still suffering and now without the slightest warning he found himself face to face with a crisis far graver far more acute never in his most gloomy moments had he felt any real fear of a resurrection of the past such as that with which he was now threatened it was a thunderbolt from a clear sky even now he found it hard to persuade himself that he was not dreaming  they were in the cab for nearly half an hour before fardell stopped and dismissed it then they walked up and down and across streets of small houses pitiless in their monotony squalid and depressing in their ugliness  finally fardell stopped and without hesitation knocked at the door of one of them it was opened by a man in shirtsleeves holding a tallow candle in his hand  what yer want he inquired suspiciously  your lodger fardell answered pushing past him and drawing mannering into the room where is he  the man jerked his thumb upwards  where he wont be long he answered shortly the likes of im having visitors and one a toff too say are yer going to pay his rent  we may do that fardell answered is he upstairs  ay the man answered shuffling away pay is rent and yer can chuck im out of the winder if yer like  they climbed the crazy staircase fardell opened the door of the room above without even the formality of knocking an old man sat there bending over a table half dressed before him were several sheets of paper  i believe were in time fardell muttered half to himself parkins is that you he asked in a louder tone  the old man looked up and blinked at them he shaded his eyes with one hand the other he laid flat upon the papers before him he was old bleareyed unkempt  is that master ronaldson he asked in a thin quavering tone ive signed em sir have yer brought the money im a poor old man and i need a drop of something now and then to keep the life in me if yerll just hand over a trifle ill send out foreheh my landlord hes a kindly manhell fetch it eh two of yer i dont see so well as i did is that you mr ronaldson sir  fardell threw some silver coins upon the table the old man snatched them up eagerly  its not mr ronaldson he said but i daresay we shall do as well we want to talk to you about those papers there  the old man nodded he was gazing at the silver in his hand  ive writ it all out he muttered i told un i would a pound a week for ten years thats what i ad and then it stopped did she mean me to starve eh not i john parkins knows better nor that ive writ it all out and theres my signature its gospel truth too  we are going to buy the truth from you fardell said we have more money than ronaldson dont be afraid we have gold to spare where ronaldson had silver  the old man lifted the candle with shaking fingers then it dropped with a crash to the ground and lay there for a moment spluttering he shrank back  its im he muttered dont kill me sir i mean you no harm its mr mannering     chapter v  the journalist intervenes   the old man had sunk into a seat his face and hands were twitching with fear his eyes as though fascinated remained fixed upon mannerings all the while he mumbled to himself fardell drew mannering a little on one side  what can we do with him he asked we might tear up those sheets give him money keep him soddened with drink and even then hed give the whole show away the moment any one got at him it isnt so bad as he makes out i suppose  it is not so bad as that mannering answered but it is bad enough  what became of the woman fardell asked parkinss mistress i mean  she is my wife mannering answered  fardell threw out his hands with a little gesture of despair  we must get him away from here he said if polden gets hold of him you might as well resign at once it is dangerous for you to stay he was evidently expecting that fellow ronaldson tonight  mannering nodded  what shall you do with him he asked  hide him if i can fardell answered grimly if i can get him out of this place it ought not to be impossible the most important thing at present is for you to get away without being recognized  mannering took up his hat  i will go he said i shall leave the cab for you i can find my way back to the hotel  fardell nodded  it would be better he said turn your coatcollar up and draw your hat down over your eyes you mustnt be recognized down here its a pretty low part  nevertheless mannering had not reached the corner of the street before he heard hasty footsteps behind him and felt a light touch upon his shoulder he turned sharply round  well sir he exclaimed what do you want with me  the newcomer was a tall thin young man wearing glasses and although he was a complete stranger to mannering he knew at once who he was  mr mannering i believe he said quickly  what has my name to do with you sir mannering answered coldly  mine is ronaldson the young man answered i am a reporter  mannering regarded him steadily for a moment  you are the young man then he said who has discovered the mares nest of my iniquity  if it is a mares nest the young man answered briskly i shall be quite as much relieved as disappointed but your being down here doesnt look very much like that does it  no man mannering answered hears that a bomb is going to be thrown at him without a certain amount of curiosity as to its nature i have been down to examine the bomb frankly i dont think much of it  you are prepared then to deny this man parkinss story the reporter asked  i am prepared to have a shot at your paper for libel anyhow if you use it mannering answered  do you know the substance of his communication  i can make a pretty good guess at it mannering answered  you really mean to deny it then the reporter asked  assuredly for it is not true mannering answered pray dont let me detain you any longer  he turned on his heel and walked away but the reporter kept pace with him  you will pardon me but this is a very serious affair mr mannering he said serious for both of us do you mind discussing it with me  not in the least mannering answered so long as you permit me to continue my way homewards  i will walk with you sir if you dont mind the reporter said it is a very serious matter indeed this my people are as keen as possible to make use of it if they do and it turns out a true story you of course will never sit for leeds and if on the other hand it is false i shall get the sack  well it is false mannering said  some parts of it perhaps the young man answered smoothly not all mr mannering  old men are garrulous mannering remarked i expect you will find that your friend has been letting his tongue run away with him  he has committed his statements to paper ronaldson remarked  and signed them  he is willing to do so the reporter answered i was to have fetched them away tonight  you may be a little late mannering remarked  the double entente in his tone did not escape ronaldsons notice he stopped short on the pavement  so you have bought him he remarked  mannering glanced at him superciliously  will you pardon me he said if i remark that this conversation has no particular interest for me dont let me bring you any further out of your way  ronaldson took off his hat  very good sir he remarked i will wish you goodnight  mannering pursued his way homeward with the briefest of farewells the young reporter retraced his steps arrived at parkinss lodgings he mounted the stairs and found the room empty he returned and interviewed the landlord from him he only learned that parkins had departed with one of two gentlemen who had come to see him that evening and that they had paid his rent for him the reporter was obliged to depart with no more satisfactory information but next morning before nine oclock he was waiting to see mannering and would not be denied he was accompanied too by a person of no less importance than the editor of the yorkshire herald himself  mannering kept them waiting an hour and then received them coolly  i am glad to see you mr polden he said glancing at the editors card i have already had some conversation with our young friend there he added glancing towards the reporter what can i have the pleasure of doing for you  mr polden produced a sheet of proofs from his pocket he passed them over to mannering  i should like you to examine these sir he said  in type already mannering remarked calmly  in proof for our evenings issue polden answered  mannering read them through  it will cost you several thousand pounds he said  then the money will be well spent polden answered no one has a higher regard for you politically than i have mr mannering but we dont want you as member for west leeds thats all  it happens mannering said that i am particularly anxious to sit for west leeds  you will go onin the face of this the editor asked mannering  yes and with the suit for libel which will follow mannering answered  the editor shrugged his shoulders  do me the favour to believe mr mannering he said that we have not gone into this matter blindfold we had a preliminary intimation as to this affair from a person whose word carries considerable weight and our investigations have been searching i will admit that the disappearance of the man parkins is a little awkward for us but we have ample justification in publishing his story  i trust for your sakes that the law courts will support your views mannering said coldly i scarcely think it likely  mr mannering polden said i quite appreciate your attitude but do you really think it is a wise one i very much regret that it should have been our duty to unearth this unsavoury story and having unearthed it to use it but you must remember that the issue on hand is a great one i belong to the liberal party and the absolute free traders and i consider that for this city to be represented by any one who shows the least indication of being unsafe upon this question would be a national disaster and a local disgrace i want you to understand therefore that i am not playing a game of bluff the proofs you hold in your hand have been set and corrected within a few hours the story will stand out in black and white are you prepared for this  mannering shrugged his shoulders  i am not prepared to resign my candidature if that is what you mean he said i presume that nothing short of that will satisfy you  nothing the editor answered firmly  then there remains nothing more mannering remarked coldly than for me to wish you a very goodmorning  i am sorry mr polden said i trust you will believe mr mannering that i find this a very unpleasant duty  mannering made no answer save a slight bow he held open the door and mr polden and his satellite passed out afterwards he strolled to the window and looked down idly upon the crowd  if i act in accordance with the conventions he murmured to himself i suppose i ought to take a glass of poison or blow my brains out instead of which  he shrugged his shoulders and rang for his hat and coat he was due at one of the great foundries in half an hour to speak to the men during their luncheon interval  instead of which he muttered as he lit a cigarette i shall go on to the end     chapter vi  treachery and a telegram   the sunlight streamed down into the little grey courtyard of the leon dor at bonestre sir leslie borrowdean in an immaculate grey suit and with a carefully chosen pink carnation in his buttonhole sat alone at a small table having his morning coffee his attention was divided between a copy of the figaro and a little pile of letters and telegrams on the other side of his plate more than once he glanced at the topmost of the latter and smiled  mrs mannering and hester came down the grey stone steps and crossed towards their own table the former lingered for a moment as she passed sir leslie who rose to greet the two women  another glorious day he remarked what news from leeds  none she said my husband seldom writes  sir leslie smiled reflectively and glanced towards the pile of papers at his side  perhaps she remarked you know better than i do how things are going there  he shook his head  i have no correspondents in leeds he answered  at that moment a puff of wind disturbed the papers by his side a telegram would have fluttered away but blanche mannering caught it at the edge of the table she was handing it back when a curious expression on borrowdeans face inspired her with a sudden idea she deliberately looked at the telegram and her fingers stiffened upon it his forward movement was checked she stood just out of his reach  no correspondents in leeds she repeated then what about this telegram  you will permit me to remind you he said stretching out his hand for it that it is addressed to me  her hands were behind her she leaned over towards him  it can be addressed to you a thousand times over she answered but before i part with it i want to know what it means  borrowdean was thinking quickly he wanted to gain time  i do not even know which document you havepurloined he said  it is from leeds she answered and it is signed polden parkins found has made statement appears tonight can you explain what this means sir leslie borrowdean  her voice was scarcely raised above a whisper but there was a dangerous glitter in her eyes there were few traces left of the woman whom once before he had found so easy a tool  i cannot tell you he answered it is not an affair for you to concern yourself with at all  not an affair for me to concern myself about she repeated leaning a little over towards him isnt it my husband against whom you are scheming dont i know what low tricks you are capable of isnt this another proof of it not an affair for me to concern myself about indeed didnt you worm the whole miserable story out of me  my dear mrs mannering  she checked a torrent of words her bosom was heaving underneath her lace blouse she was pale almost to the lips the sudden and complete disuse of all manner of cosmetics had to a certain extent blanched her face there was room there now for the writing of tragedy borrowdean still outwardly suave was inwardly cursing the unlucky chance which had blown the telegram her way  might i suggest he said in a low tone that we postpone our conversation till after breakfast time the waiters seem to be favouring us with a great deal of attention and several of them understand english  she did not even turn her head thinner a good deal since her marriage she seemed to him to have grown taller to have gained in dignity and presence as she stood there before him her angry eyes fixed upon his face she was no longer a person to be ignored  you must tell me about thisor  or he repeated stonily  or i will make a public statement she answered if you ruin my husbands career i can at least do the same with yours politics is supposed to be a game for honourable men to play with honourable weapons i wonder if lord redford would approve of your methods  you can go and ask him my dear madam he answered i am perfectly ready to defend myself  defend you have no defence she answered can you deny that you are plotting to keep my husband out of parliament now just as a few months ago you plotted to bring him back you are making use of a personal secret a forgotten chapter of his life to move him about like a puppet to do your will  i work for the good of a cause and a great party he answered you do not understand these things  i understand you so far as this she answered you are one of those to whom life is a chessboard and your one aim is to make the pieces work for you and at your bidding till you sit in the place you covet there isnt much of the patriot about you sir leslie borrowdean  he glanced down at his unfinished breakfast he had the air of one who is a little bored  my dear lady he said is this discussion really worth while  no she answered bluntly it isnt you are quite right we are wandering from the subject  let us talk he suggested after breakfast give me back that telegram now and i will explain it say in the garden in half an hour i detest cold coffee  you can do like me order some fresh she said if i let you out of my sight i know very well how much i shall see of you for the rest of the day explain now if you can what does that telegram mean  surely it is obvious enough he answered the man parkins whom you told me was dead is alive and in leeds he has seen mannerings name about has been talking and the press have got hold of his story i am sorry but there was always this possibility wasnt there  and this telegram she asked  i know polden the editor of the paper and he referred to me to know if there could be any truth in it  these are lies she declared you were the instigator you set them on the track  i have nothing more to say borrowdean declared coldly  i have she said i shall take this telegram to lord redford i shall tell him everything  a faint smile flickered upon borrowdeans lips  lord redford would i am sure be charmed to hear your story he remarked unfortunately he started for dieppe this morning before eight oclock and will not be back until tomorrow  and tomorrow will be too late she added rapidly pursuing his train of thought then i will try the duchess  he started very slightly but she saw it  sit down for a moment mrs mannering he said  she accepted the chair he placed for her there was a distinct change in his manner he realized that this woman held a trump card against him even in her hands it might mean disaster  blanche he began  thank you she interrupted i prefer mrs mannering  he bit his lips in annoyance  mrs mannering then he continued we have been allies before and i think that you will admit that i have always kept faith with you i dont see any reason why we should play at being enemies you have a price i suppose for that telegram and your silence name it  she nodded  yes i have a price she admitted  remember that after all this is not a great issue he said if your husband does not get in for leeds he will probably find a seat somewhere else  that is false she answered if your man polden publishes parkinss story my husbands political career is over and you know it do keep as near to the truth as you can  i will give you he said five hundred pounds for that telegram and your silence  she rose slowly to her feet a dull flush of colour mounted almost to her eyes borrowdean watched her anxiously then for a moment came an interruption the duchess was descending the grey stone steps from the hotel  she had addressed some word of greeting to them they both turned towards her she wore a white serge dress and she carried a white lace parasol over her bare head she moved towards them with her usual languid grace followed by her maid carrying a tiny maltese dog and a budget of letters the loiterrers in the courtyard stared at her with admiration it was impossible to mistake her for anything but a great lady  you have the air of conspirators you two she said as she approached them is it an expedition for the day that you are planning  blanche mannering turned her back upon borrowdean  sir leslie she said has just offered me five hundred pounds for a telegram which i have here and for my silence concerning its contents i was wondering whether he had bid high enough  the duchess looked from one to the other she almost permitted herself to be astonished borrowdeans face was dark with anger blanche mannerings apparent calmness was obviously of the surface only  are you serious she asked  miserably so blanche answered sir leslie has strange ideas of honour i find he is making use of a story which i told him once concerning my husband to drive him out of political life duchess will you do me the favour to let me talk with you for five minutes and to make sir leslie borrowdean promise not to leave this hotel till you have seen him again  i have no intention of leaving the hotel sir leslie said stiffly  berenice pointed to her table  come and take your coffee with me mrs mannering she said                                       mannering passed through the day like a man in a nightmare he addressed two meetings of workingmen and interviewed half a dozen of his workers at midday the afternoon edition of the yorkshire herald was being sold in the streets he bought a copy and glanced it feverishly through nothing he lunched and went on with his work at three oclock a second edition was out again he purchased a copy and again there was nothing the suspense was getting worse even than the disaster itself between four and five they brought him in a telegram he tore it open and found that it was from bonestre the words seemed to stare up at him from the pink form it was incredible  polden muzzled go in and win  the form fluttered from his fingers on to the floor of his sittingroom he stood looking at it dazed outside a mob of people standing round his carriage were shouting his name     chapter vii  mr mannering mp   mannering threw up his window with a sigh of immense relief the air was cold and fresh the land as yet unwarmed by the slowly rising sun was hung with a faint autumn mist traces of an early frost lay in the brown hedgerows inland the sea was like a sheet of polished glass gone the smokestained rows of shapeless houses the atmosphere polluted by a thousand chimneys belching smuts and black vapour the clanging of electric cars the rattle of all manner of vehicles over the cobbled streets gone the hoarse excitement of the shouting mobs the poisonous atmosphere of close rooms all the turmoil and racket and anxiety of those fighting days he was back again in bonestre below in the courtyard the white cockatoo was screaming the waiters in their linen coats were preparing the tables for the few remaining guests and the other things were of yesterday  mannering had arrived in the middle of the night unexpectedly and his appearance was a surprise to every one he had knocked at his wifes door on his way downstairs but blanche had taken to early rising and was already down he found them all breakfasting together in a sheltered corner of the courtyard  berenice after the usual greetings and explanations smiled at him thoughtfully  i am not sure she said whether i ought to congratulate you or not sir leslie here thinks that you mean mischief  only on the principle borrowdean said that whoever is not with us is against us  we are all agreed upon one thing berenice said it was your last speech the one the night before the election which carried you in a national party indeed a legislator not a politician you talked to those canny yorkshiremen with your head in the clouds and yet they listened  mannering smiled as he poured out his coffee  i talked common sense to them he remarked and yorkshiremen like that we have been slaves to the oldfashioned idea of party government long enough its an absurd thing when you come to think of it fancy a great business being carried on by a board of partners of divergent views and unable to make a purchase or a sale or effect any change whatever without talking the whole thing threadbare and then voting upon it the business would go down of course  party government borrowdean declared is the natural evolution of any republican form of administration a nation that chooses its own representatives must select them from its varying standpoint  their views may differ slightly upon some matters mannering said but their first duty should be to come into accord with one another it is a matter for compromises of course the real differences between intelligent men of either party are very slight the trouble is that under the present system everything is done to increase them instead of bridging them over  if you had to form a government then berenice asked you would not choose the members from one party  certainly not mannering answered supposing i were the owner of redfords car there and wanted a driver i should simply try to get the best man i could and i should certainly not worry as to whether he were say a churchman or a dissenter the best man for the post is what the country has a right to expect whatever he may call himself and the country doesnt get it the people pay the piper and i consider that they get shocking bad value for their money the boer war for instance would have cost us less than half as much if we had had the right men to direct the commercial side of it that money would have been useful in the country just now  an absolute monarchy hester said smiling would be really the most logical form of government then but would it answer  why not borrowdean asked if the monarch were incapable he would of course be shot  a dictator berenice began but mannering held out his hands laughing  think of my last few days and spare me he begged i have thirtysix hours holiday how do you people spend your time here  berenice took him away with her as a matter of course blanche watched them depart with a curious tightening of the lips she was standing alone in the gateway of the hotel and she watched them until they were out of sight borrowdean sauntering out to buy some papers paused for a moment as he passed  your husband mrs mannering he said drily is a very fortunate man  she made no reply and borrowdean passed on hester came out with a message from lady redfordwould mrs mannering care to motor over to berneval for luncheon blanche shook her head she scarcely heard the invitation she was still watching the two figures disappearing in the distance hester understood but she spoke lightly  i believe she said that the duchess still has hopes of mr mannering  she is a persistent woman blanche answered they say that she generally succeeds let us go in                                       berenice was listening to mannerings account of his last few days electioneering  the whole affair came upon me like a thunderclap he told her richard fardell found it out somehow and he took me to see parkins but it was too late polden had hold of the story and meant to use it i never imagined but that parkins had been talking and this journalist had got hold of him by accident now i understand that it was borrowdean who was pulling the strings  she nodded  he traced parkins out some time ago and knew exactly where he was to be found  i think mannering said that it is time borrowdean and i came to some understanding i havent said anything about it yet i dont exactly know what to say now you are a very generous woman  she sighed  no she said i dont think that sir leslie is a schemer of the class i detest i listened to him once and i have regretted it ever since yet you must remember this if it had not been for him you would have been at blakely today  his thoughts carried him backwards with a rush once more the thrall of that quiet life of passionless sweetness held him he looked back upon it curiously as a man who has passed into another country days of physical exaltation alone with the sun and the wind and all the murmuring voices of nature gods life he had called it then and now the stress of battle was hard upon him he was fighting in the front ranks a somewhat cheerless battle fighting for great causes with inefficient weapons but he could not go back life had become a more strenuous a more vital a less beautiful thing he felt himself ageing all the inevitable sadness of the man in touch with the worlds great problems was in his heart but he could not go back  yes he said quietly i owe that much to borrowdean  there is a question she said which i have wanted to ask you do you regret or are you glad to have been forced out once more upon the worlds stage  he smiled  how can i answer you he asked at blakely i was as happy as i knew how to be and until you came i was content but today well there are different things how can i answer your question indeed tell me what happiness means tell me whether it is an ignoble or a praiseworthy state  berenice was silent into her face there had come a sudden gravity mannering glancing towards her was at once conscious of the change he saw the weariness so often and zealously repressed the ageing of her face the sudden triumph of the despair which in the quiet moments chilled her heart it seemed to him that for that moment they had come into some closer communion he bent over towards her  ah he murmured you too are beginning to understand happiness is only for the ignorant for you and for me knowledge has eaten its way too far into our lives we climb all the while but the flowers in the meadows are the fairest  she shook her head  the little white flower which grows in the mountains is what we must always seek she answered the meadows are for the others  we are accursed with this knowledge and the desire for it he declared fiercely the suffering is for us and the joy for the beasts of the field why not throw down the cards we are the devils puppets in this game of life  there is no place for us down there she answered sadly there is joy enough for them because the finger has never touched their eyes but for usno we have to go on i was a foolish woman lawrence i lost my sense of proportion traditions you see were hard to break away from i did not understand let this be the end of all mention of such things between us we have missed the turning and we must go on that is the hardest thing in life one can never retrace ones steps  we go onapart  we must she said dont think me prejudiced lawrence i must stand by my party theoretically i think that you are the only logical politician i have ever known actually i think that you are steering your course towards the sandbanks you will fail but you will fail magnificently well that is something  it is a good deal he answered but if i live long enough and my strength remains i shall succeed i shall place the government of this country upon an altogether different basis i shall empty the workhouses and fill the factories nothing short of that will content me nothing short of that would content any man upon whose shoulders the burden has fallen  you have centuries of prejudice to fight she warned him you may not succeed yet you have all my good wishes i shall always watch you  they turned homeward in silence all that had passed between them seemed to be already far back in the past their retrogression seemed almost symbolical they spoke of indifferent things  tell me he asked how you came to know what was going on in leeds  it was your wife she said who discovered it  my wife  she saw a telegram on sir leslies table at breakfast a telegram from the man polden she read it and demanded an explanation sir leslie tried all he could to wriggle out of it but in vain she appealed to me even i had a great deal of difficulty in dealing with him but eventually he gave way  then the telegram mannering asked wasnt that from you  she shook her head  it was from your wife she said i cannot take much credit for myself it is she whom you must thank for your election i came out at rather a dramatic moment sir leslie had just offered her money five hundred pounds i think to give him back his telegram and say nothing she appealed to me at once and sir leslie looked positively foolish  i am much obliged to you for telling me mannering muttered he remembered now that he had scarcely spoken a dozen words to his wife since his return  mrs mannering appears to have your interests very much at heart berenice said quietly she proved herself quite a match for sir leslie i think that he would have left here at once only we are expecting clara back  mannering smiled scornfully  i do not think that even clara he said is quite fool enough not to recognize in borrowdean the arrant opportunist for my part i am glad that all pretence at friendship between us is now at an end he is one of those men whom i should count more dangerous as a friend than as an enemy  berenice did not reply they were already in the courtyard of the hotel blanche was in a wicker chair in a sunny corner talking to a couple of young englishmen berenice turned towards the steps they parted without any further words     chapter viii  playing the game   mannering for a moment hesitated one of the two young men who were talking to his wife he recognized as a former acquaintance of hersone of a genus whom he had little sympathy with and less desire to know while he stood there blanche laughed at some remark made by one of her companions and the laugh too seemed somehow to remind him of the old days he moved slowly forward  the young men strolled off almost at once mannering took a vacant chair by his wifes side  i have only just heard he said how much i have to thank you for i took it for granted somehow that it was the duchess who had discovered our friend borrowdeans little scheme and sent that telegram why didnt you sign it  she shrugged her shoulders  it was the duchess who made him chuck it up she said i could never have made him do that i was an idiot to let parkins stay in england at all  i always understood he said that he was dead  i let you think so she answered i thought you might worry but seriously if he told the truth now after all these years would any one take any notice of it  very likely not he said so far as regards any criminal responsibility but our political life is fenced about by all the middleclass love of propriety and hatred of all form of scandal parkinss story authenticated or not would have lost me my seat for leeds  then i am very glad she said that i happened to see the telegram do you know where parkins is now  one of my supporters he said a queer little man named richard fardell has him in tow he is bringing him up to london i think  she nodded  what are you doing this afternoon he asked  she looked at him curiously  mr englehall has asked me to go out in his car she said i am rather tired of motoring but i think i shall go  mannering lit a cigarette which he had just taken from his case  i dont think i should he remarked  she turned her head slowly and looked at him  why not she asked how can it concern you your plans for the afternoon are i presume already made  it may not concern me directly he answered but i have an idea that mr englehall is not exactly the sort of person i care to have you driving about with  she laughed hardly  i am most flattered by your interest in me she declared pray consider mr englehall disposed of you have some other plans perhaps  if you care to he said we will walk down to the club for lunch and come home by the sea  alone  certainly unless you choose to bring hester  she rose slowly to her feet  no she said let us go alone it will be almost the first time since we were married i think i am curious to see how much i can bore you will you wait here while i find a hat  she disappeared inside the hotel mannering watched her absently in a vague sort of way he was wondering what it was that had made their married life so completely a failure he had imagined her as asking very little from him content with the shelter of his name and home content at any rate without those things of which he had made no mention when he had spoken to her of marriage and he was becoming gradually aware that it was not so she expected had hoped for more the terms which he had zealously striven to cultivate with her were terms of which she clearly did not approve the signs of revolt were already apparent  mannering became absorbed in thought he remembered clearly the feelings with which he had gone to her and made his offer he went over it all again surely he had made himself understood but then there was her confession to him the confession of her love he had ignored that but it was unforgetable had he not tacitly accepted the whole situation if so was he doing his duty the shelter of his name and home what were those to a warmhearted woman if she loved him he had married her loving another woman she must have known this but did she understand that he was not prepared to make any effort to accept the inevitable he was still deep in thought when berenice came out  what are you doing there all by yourself she asked where is your wife  she has gone to get a hat he answered we thought of going to the club for déjeuner  she nodded  a delightful idea she said do invite me and i will take you in the car mrs mannering likes motoring i know  of course he said we shall be delighted  she beckoned to her chauffer who was in the courtyard just then blanche came out she had changed her gown for one of plain white serge and she wore a hat of tuscan straw which mannering had once admired  you wont mind motoring mrs mannering berenice said as she approached i have invited myself to luncheon with you and i am going to take you round to the club in the car  blanche stood quite still for a moment the sun was in her eyes and she lowered her parasol for a moment  it will be very pleasant she said quietly only i think that i will go in and change my hat i thought that we were going to walk  she retraced her steps walking a little wearily berenice came and sat down by mannerings side  i hope mrs mannering does not object to my coming she said it occurred to me that she was not particularly cordial  it is only her manner he answered it is very good of you to take us  your wife doesnt like me berenice said i wonder why i thought that i had been rather decent to her  blanche is a little odd mannering answered i am afraid that it is my fault here are the redfords i wonder if they would join us  three she murmured is certainly an awkward number  in the end the party became rather a large one for lord redford met some old friends at the club who insisted upon their joining tables in the interval whilst they waited for luncheon mannering contrived to have a word alone with his wife  i am not responsible he said for this enlargement of our party the duchess invited herself  it does not matter she declared listlessly what are you doing afterwards  playing golf i fancy he answered you heard what redford said about a foursome  and you are returningwhen  i must leave here at six tomorrow morning  they were leaning over the white palings of the pavilion looking out upon the last green she seemed to be watching the approach of two players who were just coming in  it is a long way to come she remarked for so short a time  he shrugged his shoulders  the aftermath of a contested election is a thing to escape from he said i felt that i wanted to get as far away as possible and then again i wanted to find out who it was who had sent that telegram  they sat apart at luncheon and blanche was much quieter than usual the others were all old friends it seemed to her more than ordinarily apparent that she was present on sufferance accepted as mannerings wife as an evil to be endured and so far as possible ignored mannering himself spoke to her now and then across the table lord redford always goodnatured made a few efforts to draw her into the conversation but it seemed to her that she had lost her confidence the freemasonry of old acquaintance which existed between all of them left her outside an invisible but very real circle words came to her with difficulty she felt stupid almost shy when she made an effort to break through it she was acutely conscious of her failure her laugh was too hard it lacked sincerity or restraint the cigarette which she smoked out of bravado with her coffee seemed somehow out of place when at last luncheon was over mannering left his place and came over to her  the duchess and i he said are going to play lord redford and mrs arbuthnot wont you walk round with us the links are really very pretty  thanks i hate watching golf she answered rising and shaking out her skirt hester and i will walk home  do take the car mrs mannering berenice said it will simply be waiting here doing nothing  thank you blanche answered i shall enjoy the walk  the foursome was played in very leisurely fashion there was plenty of time for conversation  i dont quite understand your wife berenice said to mannering her dislike of me is a little too obvious what does it mean do you know  he shook his head he was looking very pale and tired  i am not sure that i know anything about it at all he said i am beginning to distrust my own judgment  your marriage she began thoughtfully  dont let us talk about it he interrupted i tried to pay a debt it seems to me that i have only incurred a fresh one  they were silent for some time then their opponents lost a ball and displayed no particular diligence in attempting to find it berenice sat down upon a plank seat  your marriage she said seemed always to me a piece of quixotism i never altogether understood it  it was an affair of impulse he said slowly life from a personal point of view had lost all interest to me i did not dream after myshall we call it apostacythat i could rely upon even a modicum of your friendship i looked upon myself as an outcast commencing life afresh then chance intervened i thought i saw my way to making some atonement to a woman whose life i had certainly helped to ruin that was where the serious part of the mistake came i thought what i had to offer would be sufficient i am beginning now to doubt it  and what are you going to do she asked looking steadily away from him  heaven knows he answered bitterly i cannot give what i do not possess  was it his fancy or was there a gleam of satisfaction about her still pale face he went on  i dont want to play the hypocrite on the other hand i dont want all that i have done to go for nothing can you advise me  no nor any one else she answered softly  yet i can perhaps correct a little your point of view i think that you overestimate your indebtedness to the woman whom you have made your wife her husband was a weak dissipated creature and he was a doomed man long before that unfortunate day it is even very questionable whether that scene in which you figured had anything whatever to do in hastening his death that is a good many years ago and ever since then you seem to have impoverished yourself to find her the means to live in luxury i consider that you paid your debt over and over again and that your final act of selfabnegation was entirely uncalled for what more she wants from you i do not know perhaps i can imagine  there was a moments silence she turned her head and looked at himlooked him in the eyes unshamed yet with her secret shining there for him to see  there may be others lawrence she said to whom you owe something a woman cannot take back what she has given there may be sufferers in the world whom you ought also to consider and a woman loves to think that what she may not have herself is at least kept sacredto her memory  fore cried lord redford who had found his ball awfully decent of you people to wait so long we were afraid you meant to claim the hole  mannering rose to play his shot  the duchess and i lord redford he said lightly scorn to take small advantages we mean to play the game     chapter ix  the tragedy of a key   blanche in a plain black net gown sat on lord redfords right hand at the hastily improvised dinner party that evening berenice more subtly and more magnificently dressed was opposite by mannerings side the conversation seemed mostly to circle about them  a very charming place lord redford declared i have enjoyed my stay here thoroughly let us hope that we may all meet here again next year he added raising his glass mannering you will drink to that i hope  with all my heart mannering answered and you blanche  she raised her almost untasted glass and touched it with her lips she set it down with a faint smile berenice moved her head towards him  your wife is not very enthusiastic she remarked  she neither plays golf nor bathes mannering said it is possible that she finds it a little dull  both are habits which it is possible to acquire berenice answered i am telling your husband mrs mannering she continued that you ought to learn to play golf  lawrence has offered to teach me more than once blanche answered calmly i am afraid that games do not attract me besides i am too old to learn  my dear mrs mannering lord redford protested  i am fortytwo blanche replied and at that age a woman thinks twice before she begins anything new in the shape of vigorous exercise besides i find plenty to amuse me here  might one ask in what direction berenice murmured i have found in the place many things that are delightful but not amusing  i find amusement often in watching my neighbours blanche said i like to ask myself what it is they want and to study their way of attaining it you generally find that every one is fairly transparent when once you have found the keyand everybody is trying for something which they dont care for other people to know about  the duchess looked at blanche steadily there was a certain insolence the insolence of her aristocratic birth and assured position in the level stare of her clear brown eyes but blanche did not flinch  i had no idea mrs mannering that you had tastes of that sort berenice said languidly suppose you give us a few examples  not for the world blanche answered fervently did you say that we were to have coffee outside lord redford how delightful i wonder if lady redford is ready  they all trooped out in a minute or two berenice laid her hand upon mannerings arm  your wife she said quietly is going a little too far she is getting positively rude to me  mannering muttered some evasive reply he too had marked the note of battle in blanches tone he had noticed too the unusual restraint of her manner she had drunk little or no wine at dinner time and she had talked quietly and sensibly directly they reached the courtyard she seated herself on a settee for two and made room for him by her side  come and tell me about the golf match she said who won  mannering had no alternative but to obey lady redford however drew her chair up close to theirs and the conversation was always general berenice in a few minutes rose to her feet  listen to the sea she exclaimed dont some of you want to come down to the rocks and watch it  blanche rose up at once  do come lawrence if you are not too tired she said  the whole party trooped out on to the promenade blanche passed her arm through her husbands and calmly appropriated him  you can walk with whom you please presently lawrence she said but i want you for a few minutes i suppose you will admit that i have some claim  certainly mannering answered i have never denied it  i am your wife blanche said though heaven knows why you ever married me the duchess is i suppose the woman whom you would have married if you hadnt got into a mess with your politics she is a very attractive woman and you married me of course out of pity or some such maudlin reason but all the same i am here andi dont care what you do when i cant see you but i wont have her make love to you before my face  the duchess is not that sort of woman blanche mannering said gravely  isnt she blanche remarked unconvinced well ive watched her and in my opinion she isnt very different from any other sort of woman do you wish you were free very much i know she does  is there any object to be gained by this conversation mannering asked frankly i dont like it i made you no absurd promises when i married you i think that you understood the position very well so far as i know i have given you no cause to complain  they had reached the end of the promenade blanche leaned over the rail her eyes seemed fixed upon a light flashing and disappearing across the sea mannering stood uncomfortably by her side  no cause to complain she repeated as though to herself no i suppose not and yet how much the better off do you think i am lawrence i had friends before of some sort or another some of them pretended to like me even if they didnt i did as i chose i lived as i liked i was my own mistress and nowwell there is no one i enjoy the respectability of your name the privilege of knowing your friends the ability to pay my bills but i should go stark mad if it wasnt for hester i gave myself away to you i know you married me for pity i know but what in gods name do i get out of it  a note of real passion quivered in her tone mannering looked down at her helplessly taken wholly aback without the power for a moment to formulate his thoughts there was a touch of colour in her pale cheeks her eyes were lit with an unusual fire the faint moonlight was kind to her her features thinner than they had been seemed to have gained a certain refinement she reminded him more than ever before of the blanche of many years ago he answered her kindly almost tenderly  i am very sorry he said if i have caused you any suffering what i did i did for the best i dont think that i quite understood and i thought that you knewwhat had come into my life  i knew that you cared for her of course she answered with a little sob but i did not know that you meant to nurse itthat feeling i thought that when we were married you would try to care for mea little ihere are the others  lord redford who had failed to amuse berenice and who had a secret preference for the woman who generally amused him broke up their têteàtête he led blanche away and mannering followed with berenice  what does this change in your wife mean she asked abruptly  change he repeated  yes she watches us if it were not too absurd one would believe her jealous of course it is not my business to ask you on what terms you are with your wife but  you know what terms he interrupted  her manner softened she looked at him for a moment and then her eyes dropped  i am rather a hateful woman she said slowly i wish i had not said that i dont think we have managed things very cleverly lawrence still i suppose life is made up of these sorts of idiotic blunders  mine he said has been always distinguished by them  and mine she said only since i came to blakely and learnt to talk nonsense in your rosegarden but come she added more briskly we are breaking our compact we agreed to be friends you know and abjure sentiment  he nodded  it seemed quite easy then he remarked  and it is easy now it must be she added i have scarcely congratulated you upon your election what it all means and with which party you are going to vote i scarcely know even now but i can at least congratulate you personally  you are generous he said for i suppose i am a deserter as to where i shall sit it is very hard to tell i fancy myself that we are on the eve of a complete readjustment of parties wherever i may find myself however it will scarcely be with your friends  she nodded  i realize that and i am sorry she said all that we need is a leader and you might have been he as it is i suppose we shall muddle along somehow until some one comes out of the ruck strong enough to pull us together come and see me in london lawrence who knows but that you may be able to convert me  you are too staunch he answered and you have not seen what i have seen  she sighed  didnt you once tell me at blakely that politics for a woman was a mischosen professionthat we were at once too obstinate and too sentimental perhaps you were right we dont come into touch with the same forces that you meet with and we come into touch with others which make the world seem curiously upsidedown goodnight lawrence i am going to my room quietly lady redford wants to play bridge and i dont feel like it bon voyage  mannering stood alone in the little courtyard lit now with hanging lights and crowded with stray visitors who had strolled in from the streets the rest of the party had gone into the salon beyond and mannering felt curiously disinclined to join them suddenly there was a touch upon his arm he turned round blanche was standing there looking up at him something in her face puzzled him her eyes fell before his she was pale yet as he looked at her a flood of colour rushed into her cheeks his momentary impression of her eyes was that they were very soft and very bright she had thrown off her wrap and with her left hand was holding up her white skirt her right hand was clenched as though holding something and extended timidly towards him  i wanted to say goodnight to youandthere was something elsethis  something passed from her hand to his something cold and hard he looked at her in amazement but she was already on her way up the grey stone steps which led from the courtyard into the hotel and she did not turn back he opened his hand and stared at what he found there it was a keynumber fortyfour premier étage     chapter x  blanche finds a way out   mannering was conscious of an overpowering desire to be alone he made his way out of the courtyard and back to the promenade some of the lights were already extinguished and a slight drizzling rain was falling he walked at once to the further wall and stood leaning over looking into the chaos of darkness the key round which his fingers were still tightly clenched seemed almost to burn his flesh  what to do how much more of himself was he bound to surrender through a confusion of thoughts some things came to him then very clearly amongst others the grim pitiless selfishness of his life how much must she have suffered before she had dared to do this thing he had taken up a burden and adjusted the weight to suit himself he had had no thought for her no care save that the seemliness of his own absorbed life might not be disturbed and behind it all the other reason what a pigmy of a man he was after all  a clock from the town struck eleven he must decide a vision of her rose up before him he understood now her weakness and her strength she was an ordinary woman seeking the affection her sex demanded from its legitimate source he understood the coming and going of the colour in her cheeks her strained attempts to please her barely controlled jealousy in that mad moment when he had planned for her salvation he had imagined that she would have understood what folly why should she the complex workings of his innermost nature were scarcely likely to have been patent to her what right had he to build upon that what right as an honest man to contract a debt he never meant to pay if he had not at the moment realized his responsibilities that was his own fault from her point of view they were obvious enough and it was from her point of view as well as his own that they must be considered  he turned back to the hotel walking a little unsteadily all the time he was not sure that this was not a dream and then on the wet pavement he came face to face with two cloaked figures one of whom stopped short and called him by name it was berenice  you he exclaimed more than ever sure that he was not properly awake  is it so wonderful she answered to tell you the truth i was not sleepy and i felt like a little walk you can go back now bryan she said turning to her maid mr mannering will see me home  as though by mutual consent they crossed to the seawall  what made you come out again she asked no dont answer me i think that i know  impossible he murmured  i was going up to my room she said and as i passed the landing window which looks into the courtyard i saw you talking to your wife ii am afraid that i watched i saw her leave you  yes  what was it that she gave you what is it that you have in your hand  he opened his fingers she turned her head away it seemed to him an eternity that she stood there when she spoke her voice was scarcely more than a whisper  lawrence she said we have been very selfish you and i there have been no words between us but i think the compact has been there all the same it seemed to me somehow that it was a compensation that it was part of the natural order of things that as our own folly had kept us apart you should still belong to mein my thoughts and i have no right to this or any share of you lawrence  he drew a little nearer to her she moved instantly away  i am glad she said that our party breaks up tomorrow when we meet again lawrence it must be differently i am parting with a great deal that has been precious to me but it must be it is quite clear  i made no promise he cried hoarsely i did not mean  she stopped him with a swift glance  never mind that you and i are not of the race of people who shrink from their duty or fear to do what is right your wifes face taught me mine your conscience will tell you yours  you mean he exclaimed  you know what i mean we shall meet again of course but this is none the less our farewell no dont touch me not even my hand lawrence dont make it any harder let us go in  but he did not move the place where they stood was deserted from below the white spray came leaping up almost to their faces as the waves beat against the wall behind them the town was black and deserted save where a few lights gleamed out from the hotel she shivered a little and drew her cloak around her  come she said i am getting cold and cramped  he walked by her side to the hotel at the foot of the steps she left him  we shall meet again in london she said quietly dont be too hard upon your old friends when you take your seat remember that you were once one of us  she looked round and waved her hand as she disappeared he caught a glimpse of her face as she passed underneath the hanging lampthe face of a tired woman suddenly grown old with a little groan he made his way into the hotel and slowly ascended the stairs  early the next morning mannering left bonestre and in twentyfour hours he was back again summoned by a telegram which had met him in london it seemed to him that everybody at the station and about the hotel regarded him with shocked and respectful sympathy hester looking like a ghost took him at once to her room he was haggard and weary with rapid travelling and he sank into a chair  tell methe worst he said  she started with mr englehall about midday hester said they had luggage but i explained that he was going to paris she was coming back by train at two oclock we were rung up on the telephone their brake had snapped going down the hill by st entuiel and the chauffeurhe is mad nowbut they think he lost his nerve they were dashed into a tree andthey were both deadwhen they were got out from the wreck  god in heaven mannering murmured white to the lips  there was a silence between them mannering had covered his head with his hands hester tried once or twice to speak but the tears were streaming from her eyes she had the air of having more to say the white horror of tragedy was still in her face  there is a letter she said at last she left a letter for you  mannering rose slowly to his feet and moved to the lamp directly he had broken the seal he understood he read the first line and looked up his eyes met hesters  who knowsthis he asked hoarsely  no one they had not been gone two hours i explained everything  then mannering read on    my dear husband    i call you that for the last time for i am going off with englehall   to paris dont be too shocked and dont despise me too much i am   just a very ordinary woman and im afraid ive bad blood in my veins   anyhow i cant go on living under a glass case any longer the old   life was rotten enough but this is insupportable im going to have a   fling and after that i dont care what becomes of me    now lawrence i dont want you to blame yourself i did think perhaps   that when we were married i might have got you to care for me a little   but i suppose that was just my vanity it wasnt very possible with a   woman likewell never mind whoabout you did your best you were   very nice and very kind to me last night but it wasnt the real thing   was it i knew you hated being where you were i could almost hear your   sigh of relief when i let you go the fact of it is our marriage was a   mistake i ought to have been satisfied with your name i suppose and   the position it gave me but im not that sort of woman ive been in   bohemia too long i like cheery friends even if their names are not in   debrett and i must have some one to care for me or to pretend to care   for me you know ive cared for youonly you in a certain waybut im   not heroic enough to be content with a shadowy love im not an   idealist imagination doesnt content me in the least id rather have   an inferior substance than ideal perfection you see im a very   commonplace person at heart lawrencealmost vulgar but these are my   last words to you so ive gone in for plain speaking now youre rid   of me    thats all from your point of view i suppose and your friends ive   gone to the devil dont be too sure of it im going to have a good   time and when the end comes im willing to pay if you are idiotic   enough to come after me i shall be angry with you for the first time   in my life and it wouldnt be the least bit of use englehalls an old   friend of mine and hes a good sort hes wanted me to do this often   enough for years but i never felt quite like it i believe hed marry   me after but hes got a wife shut up somewhere    i expect you think this a callous sort of letter well i cant help   it if it disgusts you with me so much the better im sorry for the   scandal but you will get over that goodbye lawrence forgive me all   the bother ive been to you    blanche  mannering looked up from the letter and again his eyes met hesters the secret was theirs alone very carefully he tore the pages into small pieces then he opened the stove and watched them consumed  no one will ever know hester said she saidwhen she leftthat it was a mornings ridebut motors were so uncertain that she took a bag  mannerings eyes were filled once more with tears the intolerable pity of the whole thing its awful suddenness swept every other thought out of his mind he remembered how anxiously she had tried to please him on that last night he loathed himself for the cold brutality of his chilly affection hester came and knelt by his side but she said nothing so the hours passed     book iv     chapter i  the persistency of borrowdean   and what does mannering think of it all i wonder lord redford remarked lighting a fresh cigarette this may be his opportunity who can tell  will he have the nerve to grasp it borrowdean asked mannering has never been proved in a crisis  he may have the nerve i should be more inclined to question the desire lord redford said for a man in his position he has always seemed to me singularly unambitious i dont think that the prospect of being prime minister would dazzle him in the least it is part of the genius of the politician too to know exactly when and how to seize an opportunity i can imagine him watching it come examining it through his eyeglass and standing on one side with a shrug of the shoulders  you do not believe then berenice said that he is sufficiently in earnest to grasp it  exactly lord redford said i have that feeling about mannering i must admit especially during the last two years he seems to have drawn away from all of us to live altogether too absorbed and selfcontained a life for a man who has great ambitions to realize or who is in downright earnest about his work  what you all forget when you discuss lawrence mannering is this berenice said he holds his position almost as a sacred charge he is absolutely conscientious he wants certain things for the sake of the people and he will work steadily on until he gets them i believe it is the truth that he has no personal ambition but if the cause he has at heart is to be furthered at all it must be by his taking office therefore i think that when the time comes he will take it  that sounds reasonable enough lord redford admitted by the bye did you notice that he is included in the house party at sandringham again this week  anstruther the youngest cabinet minister and lord redfords nephew joined in the conversation  i can tell you something for a fact he said my cousin is ladyinwaiting and shes been up in town for a few days and she asked me about mannering a certain personage thinks very highly of him indeed told some one that mr mannering was the most statesmanlike politician in the service of his country i believe hed sooner see mannering prime minister than any one  but he has no following borrowdean objected  i think berenice said slowly that he keeps as far aloof as possible for one reason and one reason only he avoids friendship but he makes no enemies he cultivates a neutral position whenever he can what he is looking forward to i am sure is to found a coalition government  it is very possible lord redford remarked i wonder if he will ask me to join  always selfish berenice laughed you men are all alike  on the contrary lord redford answered my interest was purely patriotic i cannot imagine the affairs of the country flourishing deprived of my valuable services let us go and wander through the crowd members of a government in extremes like ours ought not to whisper together in corners it gives rise to comment  anstruther came hurrying up he drew redford on one side  mannering is here he said quietly just arrived from sandringham he is looking for you  almost as he spoke mannering appeared he did not at first see berenice and from the corner where she stood she watched him closely  it was two years since those few weeks at bonestre and during all that time they had scarcely met berenice knew that he had avoided her for twelve months he had declined all social engagements and since then he had pleaded the stress of political affairs as an excuse for leading the life almost of a recluse unseen herself she studied him closely he was much thinner and every trace of his once healthy colouring had disappeared his eyes seemed deeper set there were streaks of grey in his hair but for all that to her he was unaltered he was still the one man in the world she saw him shake hands with lord redford and draw him a little on one side  can you spare me five minutes he asked i have a matter to discuss with you  certainly lord redford answered i am leaving directly and i might drive you home if you liked we heard that you were at sandringham  i came up this afternoon mannering answered i heard that you were likely to be here and as lady herrington had been kind enough to send me a card i came on  lord redford nodded  borrowdean and anstruther are here too he remarked we all felt in need of diversion as you know very well were in a tight corner  berenice came out from her place at the sound of the rustling of her skirts both men turned their heads she wore a gown of black velvet and a wonderful rope of pearls hung from her neck she raised her hand and smiled at mannering  i am glad to see you again she said softly it is quite an age since we met isnt it  he held her hand for a moment the touch of his fingers chilled her he greeted her with quiet courtesy but there was no answering smile upon his lips  i have heard often of your movements from clara he said you have been very kind to her  it has never occurred to me in that light she said clara needs a chaperon and i need a companion we were talking yesterday of going to cairo for the winter my only fear is that i am robbing you of your niece  please do not let that trouble you he said clara would be a most uncomfortable member of my household  but are you never at all lonely she asked  i never have time to think of such a thing he answered besides i have hester she makes a wonderful secretary and she seems to enjoy the work  i should like to have a talk with you some time she said wont you come and see me  he hesitated  it is very kind of you to ask me he said dont think me churlish but i go nowhere i am trying to make up you see for my years of idleness  she looked at him steadfastly and her heart sank the change in his outward appearance seemed typical of some deeper and more final alteration in his whole nature she felt herself powerless against the absolute impenetrability of his tone and manner she felt that he had fought a battle within himself and conquered that for some reason or other he had decided to walk no longer in the pleasanter paths of life she had come to him unexpectedly but he had shown no sign of emotion her influence over him seemed to be wholly a thing of the past she made one more effort  i think she said that as one grows older one parts the less readily with the few friends who count i hope that you will change your mind  he bowed gravely but he made no answer berenice took borrowdeans arm and passed on there was a little spot of colour in her cheeks borrowdean felt nerved to his enterprise  let us go somewhere and sit down for a few minutes he suggested the rooms are so hot this evening  she assented without words and he found a solitary couch in one of the further apartments  i wonder he said after a moments pause whether i might say something to you whether you would listen to me for a few minutes  berenice was absorbed in her own thoughts she allowed him to proceed  for a good many years he said lowering his voice a little i have worked hard and done all i could to be successful i wanted to have some sort of a position to offer i am a cabinet minister now and although i dont suppose we can last much longer this time i shall have a place whenever we are in again  the sense of what he was saying began to dawn upon her she stopped him at once  please do not say any more sir leslie she begged i should have given you credit for sufficient perception to have known beforehand the absolute impossibility ofof anything of the sort  you are still a young woman he said quietly the world expects you to marry again  i have no interest in what the world expects of me she answered but i may tell you at once that my refusal has nothing whatever to do with the question of marriage in the abstract you are a man of perception sir leslie it will be i trust sufficient if i say that i have no feelings whatever towards you which would induce me to consider the subject even for a moment  she was unchanged then this time he recognized the note of finality in her tone all the time and thought he had given to this matter were wasted he had failed and he knew why he seldom permitted himself the luxury of anger but he felt all the poison of bitter hatred stirring within him at that moment and craving for some sort of expression there was nothing he could do nothing he could say but if mannering had been within reach then he would have struck him he rose and walked slowly away     chapter ii  hester thinks it a great pity   you will understand mannering said as the brougham drove off that you and i are speaking together merely as friends i have nothing official to say to you it would be presumption on my part to assume that the time is ripe for anything definite while you are still at the head of an unbeaten government but one learns to read the signs of the times i think that you and i both know that you cannot last the session  it is a positive luxury at times redford answered to be able to indulge in absolute candour we cannot last the session you pulled us through our last tight corner but we shall part i suppose on the new tenement bill and then we shall come a cropper  mannering nodded  the opposition he said are not strong enough to form a government alone and i do not think that a oneman cabinet would be popular it has been suggested to me that at no time in political history have the conditions been more favourable for a really strong coalition government containing men of moderate views on both sides i am anxious to know whether you would be willing to join such a combination  under whom lord redford asked  under myself mannering answered gravely dont think me overpresumptuous the matter has been very carefully thought out you could not serve under rushleigh nor could he serve under you but you could both be invaluable members of a cabinet of which i was the nominal head i do not wish to entrap you into consent however without your fully understanding this a modified and to a certain extent an experimental scheme of tariff reform would be part of our programme  you wish for a reply lord redford said only in general terms  only in general terms of course mannering assented  then you may take it lord redford said that i should be proud to become a member of such a government anything would be better than a fourthparty administration with imperialism on the brain and rank protection on their programme they might do mischief which it would take centuries to undo  we understand one another lord redford mannering said simply i am very much obliged to you this is my turning  mannering when he found himself alone in his study drew a little sigh of relief he flung himself into an easychair and sat with his hands pressed against his temples the events of the day from the morning at sandringham to his recent conversation with lord redford were certainly of sufficiently exciting a nature to provide him with food for thought and yet his mind was full of one thing only this chance meeting with berenice it was wonderful to him that she should have changed so little he himself felt that the last two years were equal to a decade that events on the other side of that line with which his life was riven were events with which some other person was concerned certainly not the lawrence mannering of today and yet he knew now that the battle which he had fought was far from a final one her power over him was unchanged he was face to face once more with the old problem his life was sworn to the service of the people he had crowded his days with thoughts and deeds and plans for them almost every personal luxury and pleasure had been abnegated he had found a sort of fierce delight in the asceticism of his daily life in the unflinching firmness with which he had barred the gates which might lead him into smoother and happier ways tonight he was beset with a sudden fear he rose and looked at himself in the glass he was pale and wan his face lacked the robust vitality of a few years ago he was ageing fast he was conscious of certain disquieting symptoms in the routine of his daily life he threw himself back into the chair with a little groan the mockery of his life of ceaseless toil seemed suddenly to spread itself out before him a grim and unlovely jest what if his strength should go what if all this labour and selfdenial should be in vain he found himself growing giddy at the thought  he rang the bell and ordered wine then he went to the telephone and rang up a doctor who lived near very soon with coat and waistcoat off he was going through a somewhat prolonged examination afterwards the doctor sat down opposite to him and accepted a cigar  what made you send for me this evening he asked curiously  mannering hesitated  an impulse he said tomorrrow i should have no time to come to you i wasnt feeling quite myself and it is possible that i may be undertaking some very important work before long  i shouldnt if i were you the doctor remarked quietly  the work is of such a nature mannering said that i could not refuse it it may not come but if it does i must go through with it  i doubt whether you will succeed the doctor said there is nothing the matter with you except that you have been drawing on your reserve stock of strength to such an extent that you are on the verge of a collapse the longer you stave it off the more complete it will be  you are a jobs comforter mannering remarked with a smile send me some physic and i will take things as easy as i can  ill send you some the doctor answered but it wont do you much good what you want is rest and amusement  mannering laughed and showed him out when he returned to his study hester was there just returned from a visit to the theatre with some friends she threw off her wrap and looked through the letters which had come by the evenings post  did you see this from richard fardell she asked him parkins is dead at last fardell says that he has been quite childish for the last eighteen months are you ill she broke off suddenly  mannering who was lying back in his easychair white almost to the lips roused himself with an effort he poured out a glass of wine and drank it off  im not ill he said with rather a weak smile but im a little tired  who was your visitor she asked  a doctor i felt a little run down so i sent for him of course he told me the usual story rest and a holiday  she came and sat on the arm of his chair every year she grew less and less like her mother her hair was smoothly brushed back from her forehead and her features were distinctly intellectual she was by far the best secretary mannering had ever had  you need some one to look after you she said decisively  it seems to me that you do that pretty well he answered i dont want any one else  you need some one with more authority than i have she said you ought to marry  marry he gasped  yes  any particular person  of course you know whom  mannering did not reply at once he was looking steadfastly into the fire and the gloom in his face was unlightened  hester he said at last in a very low tone i will tell you if you like a short a very short chapter of my life it lasted a few hours a day or so more or less yet of course it has made a difference always  i should like to hear it she whispered  the two great events of my life he said came together i was engaged to be married to the duchess of lenchester at the same time that i found myself forced to sever my connexion with the liberal party you know of course that the duchess has always been a great figure in politics she has ambitions and her political creed is almost a part of the religion of her life she looked upon my apostasy with horror it came between us at the very moment when i thought that i had found in life the one great and beautiful thing  if ever she let it come between you hester interrupted softly i believe that she has repented we women are quick to find out those things you know she added and i am sure that i am right she has never married any one else i do not believe that she ever will  it is too late mannering said a union between us now could only lead to unhappiness the disintegration of parties is slowly commencing and i think that the next few years will find me still further apart than i am today from my old friends berenicehe slipped so easily into calling her sois heart and soul with them  at least hester said i think that for both your sakes you should give her the opportunity of choosing  even that he said would not be wise we are man and woman still you see hester and there are moments when sentiment is strong enough to triumph over principle and sweep our minds bare of all the everyday thoughts but afterwardsthere is always the afterwards the conflict must come reason stays with us always and sentiment might weaken with the years  she shook her head  the duchess is a woman she said and the hold of all other things grows weak when she loves give her the chance  dont mannering exclaimed almost sharply you cant see this matter as i do i have vowed my life now i have seen my duty and i have kept my face turned steadily towards it once i was contented with very different things and i think that i came as near happiness then as a man often does but those days have gone by they have left a whole world of delightful memories but i have locked the doors of the past behind me  hester shook her head  you are making a mistake she said two people who love one another and who are honest in their opinions find happiness sooner or later if they have the courage to seek for it dont you know she continued after a moments pause thatshe understood i always like to think what i believe to be the truth she went away to leave you free  mannering rose to his feet and pointed to the clock  it is time that you and i were in bed hester he said remember that we have a busy morning  it seems a pity she murmured as she wished him goodnight a great pity     chapter iii  summoned to windsor   berenice who had just returned from making a call was standing in the hall glancing through the cards displayed upon a small round table the majordomo of her household came hurrying out from his office  there is a young lady your grace he announced who has been waiting to see you for half an hour her name is miss phillimore  where is she berenice asked  in the library your grace  show her into my own room berenice said i will see her at once  hester was a little nervous but berenice set her immediately at her ease by the graciousness of her manner they talked for some time of bonestre then there was a moments pause hester summoned up her courage  i am afraid she said that you may consider what i am going to say rather a liberty ive thought it all out and i decided to come to you i couldnt see any other way  berenice smiled encouragingly  i will promise you she said that i will consider it nothing of the sort  that is very kind of you hester said i have come here because mr mannering is the greatest friend i have in the world he stands to me for all the relatives most girls have and i am very fond of him indeed i scarcely remember my father but mr mannering was always kind to me when i was a child you know perhaps that i am living with him now as his secretary  berenice nodded pleasantly  i see him every day hester continued and i notice things he has changed a great deal during the last few years i am getting very anxious about him  he is not ill i hope berenice asked i too noticed a change it grieved me very much  he is simply working himself to death hester continued without relaxation or pleasure of any sort and all the time he is unhappy other men however hard they work have their hobbies and their occasional holidays he has neither and i think that i know why he fights all the time to forget  to forget what berenice asked slowly turning her head  to forget how near he came once to being very happy hester answered boldly to forgetyou  then her heart sang a little song of triumph for she saw the instant change in the still cold face turned now a little away from her she saw the proud lips tremble and the unmistakable light leap out from the dark eyes she saw the colour rush into the cheeks and she had no more fear she rose from her chair and dropped on one knee by berenices side  make him happy please she begged you can do it you only he loves you  berenice smiled although her eyes were wet with tears she laid her long delicate fingers upon the others hand  but my dear child she protested what can i do mr mannering wont come near me he wont even write to me i cant take him by storm can i  he is so foolish hester said also smiling he will not understand how unimportant all other things are when two people care for one another he talks about the difference in your politics as though that were sufficient to keep you apart  berenice was silent for a moment  there was a time she said softly when i thought so too  exactly hester declared and he doesnt know of course that you dont think so now  berenice smiled slightly  you must remember dear she said that mr mannering and i are in rather a peculiar position my greatgrandfather my father and my uncle were all prime ministers of england and they were all staunch liberals my family has always taken its politics very seriously indeed and so have i it is not a little thing this after all  but you will do it hester exclaimed i am sure that you will  berenice rose to her feet a sense of excitement was suddenly quivering in her veins her heart was beating fiercely after all this child was wise she had been drifting into the dull passionless life of a middleaged woman all the joys of youth seemed suddenly to be sweeping up from her heart mocking the serenity of her days these stagnant days sheltered from the great winds of life where the waves were ripples and the hours changeless she raised her arms for a moment and dropped them to her side  oh i do not know she cried it is such an upheaval if he were hereif he asked me himself but he will never come now  i believe that he would come tomorrow hester said if he were sure  berenice laughed softly there was colour in her cheeks as she turned to hester  tell him to come and have tea with me tomorrow afternoon she said i shall be quite alone                                       hester felt all her confidence slipping away from her the echoes of her breathless passionate words had scarcely died away and mannering to all appearance was unmoved his still cold face showed no signs of agitation his dark beringed eyes were full of nothing but an intense weariness  do i understand hester he asked that you have been to see the duchessthat you have spoken of these things to her  her heart sank his tone was almost censorious nevertheless she stood her ground  yes i have told you the truth and i am glad that i went you are very clever people both of you but you are spoiling your lives for the sake of a little common sense it was necessary for some one to interfere  mannering shook his head slowly  you meant kindly hester he said but it was a mistake the time when that might have been possible has gone by neither she nor i can call back the hand of time the last two years have made an old man of me i have no longer my enthusiasm i am in the whirlpool and i must fight my way through to the end  she sat at his feet he was still in the easychair into which he had sunk on his first coming into the room he had been speaking in the house late amidst all the excitement of a political crisis  why fight alone she murmured when she is willing to come to you  he shook his head  there would be conditions he said and she would not understand i may be in office in a month with most of her friends in opposition the situation would be impossible  rubbish hester declared the duchess is too great a woman to lose so utterly her sense of proportion dont you understandthat she loves you  mannering laughed bitterly  she must love a shadow then he said for the man she knew does not exist any longer poor little girl are you disappointed he added more kindly i am sorry  i am disappointed to hear you talking like this she declared i will not believe that it is more than a mood you are overtired perhaps  ay he said but i have been overtired for a long time the strength the gods give us lasts a weary while you must send my excuses to the duchess hester the fates are leading me another way  i wont do it she sobbed you shall be reasonable i will make you go  he shook his head  if you could he murmured you might alter the writing on one little page of history we defeated the government tonight badly and i am going to windsor tomorrow afternoon  hester rose to her feet and paced the room restlessly mannering had spoken without exultation his pallid face seemed to her to have grown thin and hard he saw himself the possible prime minister of the morrow without the slightest suggestion of any sort of gratified ambition  i dont know whether to say that i am glad or not hester declared stopping once more by his side if you are going to shut yourself off from everything else in life which makes for happiness to forget that you are a man and turn yourself into a lawmaking machine well then i am sorry i think that your success will be a curse to you i think that you will live to regret it  mannering looked at her for a moment with a gleam of his old self shining out of his eyes a sudden pathos a wave of selfpity had softened his face  dear child he said gravely i cannot make you understand i carry a burden from which no one can free me for good or for evil the powers that be have set my feet in the path of the climbers and for the sake of those whose sufferings i have seen i must struggle upwards to the end berenice and the duchess of lenchester are two very different persons i cannot take one into my life without the other it is because i love her hester that i let her go goodnight child  she kissed his hand and went slowly to her room stumbling upstairs through a mist of tears there was nothing more that she could do     chapter iv  checkmate to borrowdean   mannerings town house none too large at any time was transformed into a little hive of industry two hurriedly appointed secretaries were at work in the diningroom and hester was busy typing in her own little sanctum  mannering sat in his study before a table covered with papers and for the first time during the day was alone for a few moments  his servant brought in a card mannering glanced at it and frowned  the gentleman said that he would not keep you for more than a moment sir the servant announced quietly mindful of the halfsovereign which had been slipped into his hand  mannering still looked at the card doubtfully  you can show him up he said at last  very good sir  the man withdrew and reappeared to usher in sir leslie borrowdean mannering greeted him without offering his hand  you wished to see me sir leslie he asked  borrowdean came slowly into the room he closed the door behind him  i hope he said that you will not consider my presence an intrusion  you have business with me i presume mannering answered coldly pray sit down  borrowdean ignored the chair towards which mannering had motioned he came and stood by the side of the table  unless your memory mannering he said with a hard little laugh is as short as the proverbial politicians you can scarcely be surprised at my visit  mannering raised his eyebrows and said nothing  i must confess borrowdean continued that i scarcely expected to find it necessary for me to come here and remind you that it was i who am responsible for your reappearance in politics  i am not likely mannering said slowly to forget your good offices in that respect  i felt sure that you would not borrowdean answered yet you must not altogether blame me for my coming i understand that the list of your proposed cabinet is to be completed tomorrow afternoon and as yet i have heard nothing from you  your information mannering said is quite correct in fact my list is complete already if your visit here is one of curiosity i have no objection to gratify it here is a list of the names i have selected  he handed a sheet of paper to borrowdean who glanced it eagerly down afterwards he looked up and met mannerings calm gaze there was an absolute silence for several seconds  my name borrowdean said hoarsely is not amongst these  it really never occurred to me for a single second to place it there mannering answered  borrowdean drew a little breath he was deathly pale  you include redford he said he is a more violent partizan than i have ever been i have heard you say a dozen times that you disapprove of turning a man out of office directly he has got into the swing of it has any one any fault to find with me i have done my duty and done it thoroughly i dont know what your programme may be but if redford can accept it i am sure that i can  possibly mannering answered i have this peculiarity though call it a whim if you like i desire to see my cabinet composed of honourable men  borrowdean started back as though he had received a blow  am i to accept that as a statement of your opinion of me he demanded  it seems fairly obvious mannering answered that such was my intention  you owe your place in public life to me borrowdean exclaimed  if i do mannering answered do you imagine that i consider myself your debtor i tell you that today at this moment i have no political ambitions before you appeared at blakely and commenced your underhand scheming i was a contented almost a happy man you imagined that my reappearance in political life would be beneficial to you and with that in view and that only you set yourself to get me back you succeeded we wont say how if you are disappointed with the result what concern is that of mine you have called yourself my friend i have not for some time considered you as such i owe you nothing i have no feeling for you save one of contempt to me you figure as the modern political adventurer living on his wits and the credulity of other people better see how it will pay you in opposition  borrowdean a coldblooded and calculating man knew for the first time in his life what it was to let his passions govern him every word which this man had spoken was truth and therefore all the more bitter to hear he saw himself beaten and humiliated outwitted by the man whom he had sought to make his tool a slow paroxysm of anger held him rigid he was white to the lips his nerves and senses were all tingling there was red fire before his eyes  if your business with me is ended mannering said waving his hand towards the door you will forgive me if i remind you that i am much occupied  borrowdean snatched up the square glass paper cutter from the table and without a seconds warning he struck mannering with it full upon the temple  damn you he said  mannering tried to struggle to his feet but collapsed and fell upon the floor borrowdean kicked his prostrate body  now go and form your cabinet he muttered may you wake in hell                                       borrowdean who left the study a madman was a sane person the moment he began to descend the stairs and found himself face to face with a tall heavily cloaked woman the flash of familiar jewels in her hair something perhaps in the quiet stateliness of her movements betrayed her identity to him his heart gave a quick jump a sickening fear stole over him he barred the way  duchess he exclaimed  she waved him aside with an impatient gesture he could see the frown gathering upon her face  sir leslie she replied please let me pass i want to see mr mannering before any one else goes up  sir leslie drew immediately to one side  pray do not let me detain you he said coolly between ourselves i do not think that mannering is in a fit state to see anybody i have not been able to get a coherent word out of him he walks all the time backwards and forwards like a man demented  berenice smiled slightly  you are annoyed she declared because you will be in opposition once more  if i go into opposition again borrowdean answered it will be my own choice mannering has asked me to join his cabinet  berenice raised her eyebrows her surprise was genuine  you amaze me she declared  i was amazed myself he answered  she passed on her way and borrowdean descending took a cab quietly home berenice with her hand upon the door hesitated hester had purposely sent her up alone they had waited until they had heard borrowdean leave the room and now at the last moment she hesitated she was a proud woman she was departing now for his sake from the conventions of a lifetime he had declined to come to her no matter she had come to him instead supposehe should not be glad suppose she should fail to see in his face her justification it was very quiet in the room she could not even hear the scratching of his pen twice her fingers closed upon the knob of the door and twice she hesitated if it had not been for facing hester below she would probably have gone silently away  and thenshe heard a sound it was not at all the sort of sound for which she had been listening but it brought her hesitation to a sudden end she threw open the door and a little cry of amazement broke from her trembling lips it was indeed a groan which she had heard mannering was stretched upon the floor his eyes half closed his face ghastly white for a moment she stood motionless a whole torrent of arrested speech upon her quivering lips then she dropped on her knees by his side and lifted his cold hand  oh my love she murmured my love  but he made no sign then she stood up and her cry of horror rang through the house     chapter v  a brazen proceeding   mannering opened his eyes lazily his companion had stopped suddenly in his reading he appeared to be examining a certain paragraph in the paper with much interest mannering stretched out his hand for a match and relit his cigarette  read it out richard he said dont mind me  the young man started slightly  i am very sorry sir he said i thought that you were asleep  mannering smiled  what about the paragraph he asked  it is just this richard answered reading the duchess of lenchester and miss clara mannering have arrived at claridges from the south of italy  mannering looked at him keenly  i am curious to know which part of that announcement you find so interesting he said  certainly not the latter part sir the young man answered i thought perhaps you would have noticedi meant to speak to you as soon as you were a little strongeri have asked hester to be my wife  then all i can say mannering declared gravely is that you are a remarkably sensible young man i am quite strong enough to bear a shock of that sort  im very glad to hear you say so sir richard said of course i shouldnt think of taking her away until you were quite yourself again  the cheek of the young man mannering murmured she wouldnt go  i dont believe she would richard laughed of course we consider that you are very nearly well now  you can consider what you like mannering answered but i shall remain an invalid as long as it pleases me  hester appeared on the upper lawn and richard rose up at once  if you dont mind sir he said i think that i should like to go and tell hester that i have spoken to you  mannering nodded he watched the two young people stroll off together towards the rosegarden talking earnestly he heard the little iron gate open and close he watched them disappear behind the hedge of laurels a puff of breeze brought the faint odour of roses to him and with it a sudden host of memories his eyes grew wistful he felt something tugging at his heartstrings only a few years ago life here had seemed so wonderful a thingonly a few years but with all the passions and struggles of a lifetime crowded into them the maelstrom was there still but he himself had crept out of it what was there left peace haunted with memories rest troubled by desire he heard the sound of their voices in the rosegarden and he turned away with a pain in his heart of which he was ashamed these things were for the young if youth had passed him by still there were compensations  compensations ayebut he wanted none of them he picked up the newspaper and with a little difficulty for his sight was not yet good found a certain paragraph then the paper slipped again from his fingers and he heard the sweeping of a womans dress across the smoothshaven lawn he gripped the sides of his chair and set his teeth hard he struggled to rise but she moved swiftly up to him with a gesture of remonstrance  please dont move she exclaimed as though her coming were the most natural thing in the world i am going to sit down with you if i may  he murmured an expression of conventional delight she wore a dress of some soft white material and her figure was as wonderful as ever he recovered himself almost at once and studied her admiringly  paris he murmured  paquin she answered i remembered that you liked me in white  but where on earth have you come from he asked  the farm she answered im going to take it for three monthsif youre decent to me  that rascal richard he muttered never told me a word pretended to be surprised when he heard you and clara were back  she nodded  clara is going to marry that frenchman next month she said and i shall be looking for another companion do you know of one  i havent another niece he answered  even if you had she said i have come to the conclusion that i want something different will you listen to me patiently for a moment  yes  will you marry me please she said no dont interrupt i want there to be no misunderstandings this time i dont care whether you are an invalid or not i dont care whether you are going back into politics or not i dont care whether we live here or in any other corner of the world you can call yourself anything from an anarchist to a toryor be anything you can have all your workingmen here to dinner in flannel shirts if you like and ill play bowls with their wives on the lawn nothing matters but this one thing lawrence will you marry meand try to care a little  this is absolutely mannering declared taking her into his arms the most brazen proceeding  its a good deal better than the bungle we made of it before she murmured   the end                                                    e phillips oppenheims novels   a prince of sinners  thoroughly matured brilliantly constructed
