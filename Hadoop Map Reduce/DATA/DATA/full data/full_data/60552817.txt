60552817	the young fur traders by rm ballantyne  preface  in writing this book my desire has been to draw an exact copy of the picture which is indelibly stamped on my own memory  i have carefully avoided exaggeration in everything of importance  all the chief and most of the minor incidents are facts  in regard to unimportant matters i have taken the liberty of a novelistnot to colour too highly or to invent improbabilities butto transpose time place and circumstance at pleasure while at the same time i have endeavoured to convey to the readers mind a truthful impression of the general effectto use a painters languageof the life and country of the furtrader  rm  ballantyne  edinburgh 1856    chapter one  plunges the reader into the middle of an arctic winter conveys him into the heart of the wildernesses of north america and introduces him to some of the principal personages of our tale  snowflakes and sunbeams heat and cold winter and summer alternated with their wonted regularity for fifteen years in the wild regions of the far north  during this space of time the hero of our tale sprouted from babyhood to boyhood passed through the usual amount of accidents ailments and vicissitudes incidental to those periods of life and finally entered upon that ambiguous condition that precedes early manhood  it was a clear cold winters day  the sunbeams of summer were long past and snowflakes had fallen thickly on the banks of red river charley sat on a lump of blue ice his head drooping and his eyes bent on the snow at his feet with an expression of deep disconsolation  kate reclined at charleys side looking wistfully up in his expressive face as if to read the thoughts that were chasing each other through his mind like the evervarying clouds that floated in the winter sky above  it was quite evident to the most careless observer that whatever might be the usual temperaments of the boy and girl their present state of mind was not joyous but on the contrary very sad  it wont do sister kate said charley  ive tried him over and over againive implored begged and entreated him to let me go but he wont and im determined to run away so theres an end of it  as charley gave utterance to this unalterable resolution he rose from the bit of blue ice and taking kate by the hand led her over the frozen river climbed up the bank on the opposite sidean operation of some difficulty owing to the snow which had been drifted so deeply during a late storm that the usual track was almost obliteratedand turning into a path that lost itself among the willows they speedily disappeared  as it is possible our reader may desire to know who charley and kate are and the part of the world in which they dwell we will interrupt the thread of our narrative to explain  in the very centre of the great continent of north america far removed from the abodes of civilised men and about twenty miles to the south of lake winnipeg exists a colony composed of indians scotsmen and frenchcanadians which is known by the name of red river settlement red river differs from most colonies in more respects than onethe chief differences being that whereas other colonies cluster on the seacoast this one lies many hundreds of miles in the interior of the country and is surrounded by a wilderness and while other colonies acting on the golden rule export their produce in return for goods imported this of red river imports a large quantity and exports nothing or next to nothing  not but that it might export if it only had an outlet or a market but being eight hundred miles removed from the sea and five hundred miles from the nearest market with a series of rivers lakes rapids and cataracts separating from the one and a wide sweep of treeless prairie dividing from the other the settlers have long since come to the conclusion that they were born to consume their own produce and so regulate the extent of their farming operations by the strength of their appetites  of course there are many of the necessaries or at least the luxuries of life which the colonists cannot growsuch as tea coffee sugar coats trousers and shirtsand which consequently they procure from england by means of the hudsons bay fur companys ships which sail once a year from gravesend laden with supplies for the trade carried on with the indians  and the bales containing these articles are conveyed in boats up the rivers carried past the waterfalls and rapids overland on the shoulders of stalwart voyageurs and finally landed at red river after a rough trip of many weeks duration  the colony was founded in 1811 by the earl of selkirk previously to which it had been a tradingpost of the fur company  at the time of which we write it contained about five thousand souls and extended upwards of fifty miles along the red and assiniboine rivers which streams supplied the settlers with a variety of excellent fish  the banks were clothed with fine trees and immediately behind the settlement lay the great prairies which extend in undulating wavesalmost entirely devoid of shrub or treeto the base of the rocky mountains  although far removed from the civilised world and containing within its precincts much that is savage and very little that is refined red river is quite a populous paradise as compared with the desolate solitary establishments of the hudsons bay fur company  these lonely dwellings of the trader are scattered far and wide over the whole continent north south east and west  their population generally amounts to eight or ten menseldom to thirty  they are planted in the thick of an uninhabited deserttheir next neighbours being from two to five hundred miles off their occasional visitors bands of wandering indians and the sole object of their existence being to trade the furry hides of foxes martens beavers badgers bears buffaloes and wolves  it will not then be deemed a matter of wonder that the gentlemen who have charge of these establishments and who perchance may have spent ten or twenty years in them should look upon the colony of red river as a species of elysiuma sort of haven of rest in which they may lay their weary heads and spend the remainder of their days in peaceful felicity free from the cares of a residence among wild beasts and wild men  many of the retiring traders prefer casting their lot in canada but not a few of them smoke out the remainder of their existence in this colonyespecially those who having left home as boys fifty or sixty years before cannot reasonably expect to find the friends of their childhood where they left them and cannot hope to remodel tastes and habits long nurtured in the backwoods so as to relish the manners and customs of civilised society  such an one was old frank kennedy who sixty years before the date of our story ran away from school in scotland got a severe thrashing from his father for so doing and having no mother in whose sympathising bosom he could weep out his sorrow ran away from home went to sea ran away from his ship while she lay at anchor in the harbour of new york and after leading a wandering unsettled life for several years during which he had been alternately a clerk a daylabourer a storekeeper and a village schoolmaster he wound up by entering the service of the hudsons bay company in which he obtained an insight into savage life a comfortable fortune besides a halfbreed wife and a large family  being a man of great energy and courage and moreover possessed of a large powerful frame he was sent to one of the most distant posts on the mackenzie river as being admirably suited for the display of his powers both mental and physical  here the smallpox broke out among the natives and besides carrying off hundreds of these poor creatures robbed mr kennedy of all his children save two charles and kate whom we have already introduced to the reader  about the same time the council which is annually held at red river in spring for the purpose of arranging the affairs of the country for the ensuing year thought proper to appoint mr kennedy to a still more outlandish part of the countryas near in fact to the north pole as it was possible for mortal man to liveand sent him an order to proceed to his destination without loss of time  on receiving this communication mr kennedy upset his chair stamped his foot ground his teeth and vowed in the hearing of his wife and children that sooner than obey the mandate he would see the governors and council of ruperts land hanged quartered and boiled down into tallow  ebullitions of this kind were peculiar to frank kennedy and meant nothing  they were simply the safetyvalves to his superabundant ire and like safetyvalves in general made much noise but did no damage  it was well however on such occasions to keep out of the old furtraders way for he had an irresistible propensity to hit out at whatever stood before him especially if the object stood on a level with his own eyes and wore whiskers  on second thoughts however he sat down before his writingtable took a sheet of blue ruled foolscap paper seized a quill which he had mended six months previously at a time when he happened to be in high goodhumour and wrote as follows  to the governor and council of ruperts land red river settlement  fort paskisegun june 15 18 hundred and something  gentlemeni have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your favour of 26th april last appointing me to the charge of peels river and directing me to strike out new channels of trade in that quarter  in reply i have to state that i shall have the honour to fulfil your instructions by taking my departure in a light canoe as soon as possible  at the same time i beg humbly to submit that the state of my health is such as to render it expedient for me to retire from the service and i herewith beg to hand in my resignation  i shall hope to be relieved early next springi have the honour to be gentlemen your most obedient humble servant f kennedy  there exclaimed the old gentleman in a tone that would lead one to suppose he had signed the deathwarrant and so had irrevocably fixed the certain destruction of the entire councilthere said he rising from his chair and sticking the quill into the inkbottle with a dab that split it up to the feather and so rendered it hors de combat for all time coming  to this letter the council gave a short reply accepting his resignation and appointing a successor  on the following spring old mr kennedy embarked his wife and children in a bark canoe and in process of time landed them safely in red river settlement  here he purchased a house with six acres of land in which he planted a variety of useful vegetables and built a summerhouse after the fashion of a conservatory where he was wont to solace himself for hours together with a pipe or rather with dozens of pipes of canada twist tobacco  after this he put his two children to school  the settlement was at this time fortunate in having a most excellent academy which was conducted by a very estimable man  charles and kate kennedy being obedient and clever made rapid progress under his judicious management and the only fault that he had to find with the young people was that kate was a little too quiet and fond of books while charley was a little too riotous and fond of fun  when charles arrived at the age of fifteen and kate attained to fourteen years old mr kennedy went into his conservatory locked the door sat down on an easychair filled a long clay pipe with his beloved tobacco smoked vigorously for ten minutes and fell fast asleep  in this condition he remained until the pipe fell from his lips and broke in fragments on the floor  he then rose filled another pipe and sat down to meditate on the subject that had brought him to his smoking apartment  theres my wife said he looking at the bowl of his pipe as if he were addressing himself to it shes getting too old to be looking after everything herself puff and kates getting too old to be humbugging any longer with books besides she ought to be at home learning to keep house and help her mother and cut the baccy puff and that young scamp charley should be entering the service puff hes clever enough now to trade beaver and bears from the redskins besides hes puff a young rascal and ill be bound does nothing but lead the other boys into puff mischief although to be sure the master does say hes the cleverest fellow in the school but he must be reined up a bit now  ill clap on a double curb and martingale ill get him a situation in the countingroom at the fort puff where hell have his nose held tight to the grindstone  yes ill fix both their flints tomorrow and old mr kennedy gave vent to another puff so thick and long that it seemed as if all the previous puffs had concealed themselves up to this moment within his capacious chest and rushed out at last in one thick and longcontinued stream  by fixing their flints mr kennedy meant to express the fact that he intended to place his children in an entirely new sphere of action and with a view to this he ordered out his horse and cariole a sort of sleigh on the following morning went up to the school which was about ten miles distant from his abode and brought his children home with him the same evening  kate was now formally installed as housekeeper and tobaccocutter while charley was told that his future destiny was to wield the quill in the service of the hudsons bay company and that he might take a week to think over it  quiet warmhearted affectionate kate was overjoyed at the thought of being a help and comfort to her old father and mother but reckless joyous goodhumoured harebrained charley was cast into the depths of despair at the idea of spending the livelong day and day after day for years it might be on the top of a longlegged stool  in fact poor charley said that he would rather become a buffalo than do it  now this was very wrong of charley for of course he didnt mean it  indeed it is too much a habit among little boys ay and among grownup people too to say what they dont mean as no doubt you are aware dear reader if you possess half the selfknowledge we give you credit for and we cannot too strongly remonstrate with ourself and others against the practiceleading as it does to all sorts of absurd exaggerations such as gravely asserting that we are broiling hot when we are simply rather warm or more than half dead with fatigue when we are merely very tired  however charley said that he would rather be a buffalo than do it and so we feel bound in honour to record the fact  charley and kate were warmly attached to each other  moreover they had been ever since they could walk in the habit of mingling their little joys and sorrows in each others bosoms and although as years flew past they gradually ceased to sob in each others arms at every little mishap they did not cease to interchange their inmost thoughts and to mingle their tears when occasion called them forth  they knew the power the inexpressible sweetness of sympathy  they understood experimentally the comfort and joy that flow from obedience to that blessed commandment to rejoice with those that do rejoice and weep with those that weep  it was natural therefore that on mr kennedy announcing his decrees charley and kate should hasten to some retired spot where they could commune in solitude the effect of which communing was to reduce them to a somewhat calmer and rather happy state of mind charleys sorrow was blunted by sympathy with kates joy and kates joy was subdued by sympathy with charleys sorrow so that after the first effervescing burst they settled down into a calm and comfortable state of flatness with very red eyes and exceedingly pensive minds  we must however do charley the justice to say that the red eyes applied only to kate for although a tear or two could without much coaxing be induced to hop over his sunburned cheek he had got beyond that period of life when boys are addicted to we must give the word though not pretty because it is eminently expressive blubbering  a week later found charley and his sister seated on the lump of blue ice where they were first introduced to the reader and where charley announced his unalterable resolve to run away following it up with the statement that that was the end of it  he was quite mistaken however for that was by no means the end of it  in fact it was only the beginning of it as we shall see hereafter    chapter two  the old furtrader endeavours to fix his sons flint and finds the thing more difficult to do than he expected  near the centre of the colony of red river the stream from which the settlement derives its name is joined by another called the assiniboine  about five or six hundred yards from the point where this union takes place and on the banks of the latter stream stands the hudsons bay companys tradingpost fort garry  it is a massive square building of stone  four high and thick walls enclose a space of ground on which are built six or eight wooden houses some of which are used as dwellings for the servants of the hudsons bay company and others as stores wherein are contained the furs the provisions which are sent annually to various parts of the country and the goods such as cloth guns powder and shot blankets twine axes knives etcetera etcetera with which the furtrade is carried on  although red river is a peaceful colony and not at all likely to be assaulted by the poor indians it was nevertheless deemed prudent by the traders to make some show of power and so at the corners of the fort four round bastions of a very imposing appearance were built from the embrasures of which several large blackmuzzled guns protruded  no one ever conceived the idea of firing these engines of war and indeed it is highly probable that such an attempt would have been attended with consequences much more dreadful to those behind than to those who might chance to be in front of the guns  nevertheless they were imposing and harmonised well with the flagstaff which was the only other military symptom about the place  this latter was used on particular occasions such as the arrival or departure of a brigade of boats for the purpose of displaying the folds of a red flag on which were the letters hbc  the fort stood as we have said on the banks of the assiniboine river on the opposite side of which the land was somewhat wooded though not heavily with oak maple poplar aspens and willows while at the back of the fort the great prairie rolled out like a green sea to the horizon and far beyond that again to the base of the rocky mountains the plains at this time however were a sheet of unbroken snow and the river a mass of solid ice  it was noon on the day following that on which our friend charley had threatened rebellion when a tall elderly man might have been seen standing at the back gate of fort garry gazing wistfully out into the prairie in the direction of the lower part of the settlement  he was watching a small speck which moved rapidly over the snow in the direction of the fort  its very like our friend frank kennedy said he to himself at least we presume so for there was no one else within earshot to whom he could have said it except the doorpost which every one knows is proverbially a deaf subject  no man in the settlement drives so furiously  i shouldnt wonder if he ran against the corner of the new fence now  ha just sothere he goes  and truly the reckless driver did go just at that moment  he came up to the corner of the new fence where the road took a rather abrupt turn in a style that ensured a capsize  in another second the spirited horse turned sharp round the sleigh turned sharp over and the occupant was pitched out at full length while a black object that might have been mistaken for his hat rose from his side like a rocket and flying over him landed on the snow several yards beyond  a faint shout was heard to float on the breeze as this catastrophe occurred and the driver was seen to jump up and readjust himself in the cariole while the other black object proved itself not to be a hat by getting hastily up on a pair of legs and scrambling back to the seat from which it had been so unceremoniously ejected  in a few minutes more the cheerful tinkling of the merry sleighbells was heard and frank kennedy accompanied by his hopeful son charles dashed up to the gate and pulled up with a jerk  ha  grant my fine fellow how are you exclaimed mr kennedy senior as he disengaged himself from the heavy folds of the buffalo robe and shook the snow from his greatcoat  why on earth man dont you put up a signpost and a board to warn travellers that youve been running out new fences and changing the road eh  why my good friend said mr grant smiling the fence and the road are of themselves pretty conclusive proof to most men that the road is changed and besides we dont often have people driving round corners at full gallop but  hollo  charley you rascal interrupted mr kennedyhere take the mare to the stable and dont drive her too fast  mind now no going off upon the wrong road for the sake of a drive you understand  all right father exclaimed the boy while a bright smile lit up his features and displayed two rows of white teeth ill be particularly careful and he sprang into the light vehicle seized the reins and with a sharp crack of the whip dashed down the road at a hard gallop  hes a fine fellow that son of yours said mr grant and will make a firstrate furtrader  furtrader exclaimed mr kennedy  just look at him  ill be shot if he isnt thrashing the mare as if she were made of leather  the old mans ire was rising rapidly as he heard the whip crack every now and then and saw the mare bound madly over the snow  and see he continued i declare he has taken the wrong turn after all  true said mr grant hell never reach the stable by that road hes much more likely to visit the whitehorse plains  but come friend its of no use fretting  charley will soon tire of his ride so come with me to my room and have a pipe before dinner  old mr kennedy gave a short groan of despair shook his fist at the form of his retreating son and accompanied his friend to the house  it must not be supposed that frank kennedy was very deeply offended with his son although he did shower on him a considerable amount of abuse on the contrary he loved him very much  but it was the old mans nature to give way to little bursts of passion on almost every occasion in which his feelings were at all excited  these bursts however were like the little puffs that ripple the surface of the sea on a calm summers day  they were over in a second and left his goodhumoured rough candid countenance in unruffled serenity  charley knew this well and loved his father tenderly so that his conscience frequently smote him for raising his anger so often and he over and over again promised his sister kate to do his best to refrain from doing anything that was likely to annoy the old man in future  but alas  charleys resolves like those of many other boys were soon forgotten and his fathers equanimity was upset generally two or three times a day but after the gust was over the furtrader would kiss his son call him a rascal and send him off to fill and fetch his pipe  mr grant who was in charge of fort garry led the way to his smoking apartment where the two were soon seated in front of a roaring logfire emulating each other in the manufacture of smoke  well kennedy said mr grant throwing himself back in his chair elevating his chin and emitting a long thin stream of white vapour from his lips through which he gazed at his friend complacentlywell kennedy to what fortunate chance am i indebted for this visit  it is not often that we have the pleasure of seeing you here  mr kennedy created two large volumes of smoke which by means of a vigorous puff he sent rolling over towards his friend and said charley  and what of charley said mr grant with a smile for he was well aware of the boys propensity to fun and of the fathers desire to curb it  the fact is replied kennedy that charley must be broke  hes the wildest colt i ever had to tame but ill do iti willthats a fact  if charleys subjugation had depended on the rapidity with which the little white clouds proceeded from his sires mouth there is no doubt that it would have been a fact in a very short time for they rushed from him with the violence of a high wind  long habit had made the old trader and his pipe not only inseparable companions but part and parcel of each otherso intimately connected that a change in the one was sure to produce a sympathetic change in the other  in the present instance the little clouds rapidly increased in size and number as the old gentleman thought on the obstinacy of his colt  yes he continued after a moments silence ive made up my mind to tame him and i want you mr grant to help me  mr grant looked as if he would rather not undertake to lend his aid in a work that was evidently difficult but being a goodnatured man he said and how friend can i assist in the operation  well you see charleys a good fellow at bottom and a clever fellow tooat least so says the schoolmaster though i must confess that so far as my experience goes hes only clever at finding out excuses for not doing what i want him to  but still im told hes clever and can use his pen well and i know for certain that he can use his tongue well  so i want to get him into the service and have him placed in a situation where he shall have to stick to his desk all day  in fact i want to have him broken in to work for youve no notion sir how that boy talks about bears and buffaloes and badgers and life in the woods among the indians  i do believe continued the old gentleman waxing warm that he would willingly go into the woods tomorrow if i would let him and never show his nose in the settlement again  hes quite incorrigible  but ill tame him yeti will  mr kennedy followed this up with an indignant grunt and a puff of smoke so thick and propelled with such vigour that it rolled and curled in fantastic evolutions towards the ceiling as if it were unable to control itself with delight at the absolute certainty of charley being tamed at last  mr grant however shook his head and remained for five minutes in profound silence during which time the two friends puffed in concert until they began to grow quite indistinct and ghostlike in the thick atmosphere  at last he broke silence  my opinion is that youre wrong mr kennedy  no doubt you know the disposition of your son better than i do but even judging of it from what you have said im quite sure that a sedentary life will ruin him  ruin him  humbug said kennedy who never failed to express his opinion at the shortest notice and in the plainest languagea fact so well known by his friends that they had got into the habit of taking no notice of it  humbug he repeated perfect humbug  you dont mean to tell me that the way to break him in is to let him run loose and wild whenever and wherever he pleases  by no means  but you may rest assured that tying him down wont do it  nonsense said mr kennedy testily dont tell me  have i not broken in young colts by the score and dont i know that the way to fix their flints is to clap on a good strong curb  if you had travelled farther south friend replied mr grant you would have seen the spaniards of mexico break in their wild horses in a very different way for after catching one with a lasso a fellow gets on his back and gives it the rein and the whipay and the spur too and before that race is over there is no need for a curb  what exclaimed kennedy and do you mean to argue from that that i should let charley runand help him too  send him off to the woods with gun and blanket canoe and tent all complete  the old gentleman puffed a furious puff and broke into a loud sarcastic laugh  no no interrupted mr grant i dont exactly mean that but i think that you might give him his way for a year or so  hes a fine active generous fellow and after the novelty wore off he would be in a much better frame of mind to listen to your proposals  besides and mr grant smiled expressively charley is somewhat like his father  he has got a will of his own and if you do not give him his way i very much fear that hell  what inquired mr kennedy abruptly  take it said mr grant  the puff that burst from mr kennedys lips on hearing this would have done credit to a thirtysix pounder  take it said he hed better not  the latter part of this speech was not in itself of a nature calculated to convey much but the tone of the old traders voice the contraction of his eyebrows and above all the overwhelming flow of cloudlets that followed imparted to it a significance that induced the belief that charleys taking his own way would be productive of more terrific consequences than it was in the power of the most highly imaginative man to conceive  theres his sister kate now continued the old gentleman shes as gentle and biddable as a lamb  ive only to say a word and shes off like a shot to do my bidding and she does it with such a sweet smile too  there was a touch of pathos in the old traders voice as he said this  he was a man of strong feeling and as impulsive in his tenderness as in his wrath  but that rascal charley he continued is quite different  hes obstinate as a mule  to be sure he has a good temper and i must say for him he never goes into the sulks which is a comfort for of all things in the world sulking is the most childish and contemptible  he generally does what i bid him too but hes always getting into scrapes of one kind or other  and during the last week notwithstanding all i can say to him he wont admit that the best thing for him is to get a place in your countingroom with the prospect of rapid promotion in the service  very odd  i cant understand it at all and mr kennedy heaved a deep sigh  did you ever explain to him the prospects that he would have in the situation you propose for him inquired mr grant  cant say i ever did  did you ever point out the probable end of a life spent in the woods  no  nor suggest to him that the appointment to the office here would only be temporary and to see how he got on in it  certainly not  then my dear sir im not surprised that charley rebels  you have left him to suppose that once placed at the desk here he is a prisoner for life  but see there he is said mr grant pointing as he spoke towards the subject of their conversation who was passing the window at the moment let me call him and i feel certain that he will listen to reason in a few minutes  humph ejaculated mr kennedy you may try  in another minute charley had been summoned and was seated cap in hand near the door  charley my boy began mr grant standing with his back to the fire his feet pretty wide apart and his coattails under his armscharley my boy your father has just been speaking of you  he is very anxious that you should enter the service of the hudsons bay company and as you are a clever boy and a good penman we think that you would be likely to get on if placed for a year or so in our office here  i need scarcely point out to you my boy that in such a position you would be sure to obtain more rapid promotion than if you were placed in one of the distant outposts where you would have very little to do and perhaps little to eat and no one to converse with except one or two men  of course we would merely place you here on trial to see how you suited us and if you prove steady and diligent there is no saying how fast you might get on  why you might even come to fill my place in course of time  come now charley what think you of it  charleys eyes had been cast on the ground while mr grant was speaking he now raised them looked at his father then at his interrogator and said  it is very kind of you both to be so anxious about my prospects  i thank you indeed very much but ia  dont like the desk said his father in an angry tone  is that it eh  charley made no reply but cast down his eyes again and smiled charley had a sweet smile a peculiarly sweet candid smile as if he meant to say that his father had hit the nail quite on the top of the head that time and no mistake  but consider resumed mr grant although you might probably be pleased with an outpost life at first you would be sure to grow weary of it after the novelty wore off and then you would wish with all your heart to be back here again  believe me child a traders life is a very hard and not often a very satisfactory one  ay broke in the father desirous if possible to help the argument and youll find it a desperately wild unsettled roving sort of life too let me tell you full of dangers both from wild beasts and wild men  hush interrupted mr grant observing that the boys eye kindled when his father spoke of a wild roving life and wild beastsyour father does not mean that life at an outpost is wild and interesting or exciting  he merely means thatait  mr grant could not very well explain what it was that mr kennedy meant if he did not mean that so he turned to him for help  exactly so said that gentleman taking a strong pull at the pipe for inspiration  its no ways interesting or exciting at all  its slow dull and flat a miserable sort of robinson crusoe life with red indians and starvation constantly staring you in the face  besides said mr grant again interrupting the somewhat unfortunate efforts of his friend who seemed to have a happy facility in sending a brilliant dash of romantic allusion across the dark side of his picturebesides youll not have opportunity to amuse yourself or to read as youll have no books and youll have to work hard with your hands oftentimes like your men  in fact broke in the impatient father resolved apparently to carry the point with a grand coupin fact youll have to rough it as i did when i went up the mackenzie river district where i was sent to establish a new post and had to travel for weeks and weeks through a wild country where none of us had ever been before where we shot our own meat caught our own fish and built our own houseand were very near being murdered by the indians though to be sure afterwards they became the most civil fellows in the country and brought us plenty of skins  ay lad youll repent of your obstinacy when you come to have to hunt your own dinner as ive done many a day up the saskatchewan where ive had to fight with redskins and grizzly bears and to chase the buffaloes over miles and miles of prairie on roughgoing nags till my bones ached and i scarce knew whether i sat on  oh exclaimed charley starting to his feet while his eyes flashed and his chest heaved with emotion thats the place for me fatherdo please mr grant send me there and ill work for you with all my might  frank kennedy was not a man to stand this unexpected miscarriage of his eloquence with equanimity  his first action was to throw his pipe at the head of his enthusiastic boy without worse effect however than smashing it to atoms on the opposite wall  he then started up and rushed towards his son who being near the door retreated precipitately and vanished  so said mr grant not very sure whether to laugh or be angry at the result of their united efforts youve settled the question now at all events  frank kennedy said nothing but filled another pipe sat doggedly down in front of the fire and speedily enveloped himself and his friend and all that the room contained in thick impenetrable clouds of smoke  meanwhile his worthy son rushed off in a state of great glee  he had often heard the voyageurs of red river dilate on the delights of roughing it in the woods and his heart had bounded as they spoke of dangers encountered and overcome among the rapids of the far north or with the bears and bisonbulls of the prairie but never till now had he heard his father corroborate their testimony by a recital of his own actual experience and although the old gentlemans intention was undoubtedly to damp the boys spirit his eloquence had exactly the opposite effectso that it was with a hop and a shout that he burst into the countingroom with the occupants of which charley was a special favourite    chapter three  the countingroom  every one knows the general appearance of a countingroom  there are one or two peculiar features about such apartments that are quite unmistakable and very characteristic and the countingroom at fort garry although many hundred miles distant from other specimens of its race and from the peculiar circumstances of its position not therefore likely to bear them much resemblance possessed one or two features of similarity in the shape of two large desks and several very tall stools besides sundry inkbottles rulers books and sheets of blottingpaper  but there were other implements there savouring strongly of the backwoods and savage life which merit more particular notice  the room itself was small and lighted by two little windows which opened into the courtyard  the entire apartment was made of wood  the floor was of unpainted fir boards  the walls were of the same material painted blue from the floor upwards to about three feet where the blue was unceremoniously stopped short by a stripe of bright red above which the somewhat fanciful decorator had laid on a coat of pale yellow and the ceiling by way of variety was of a deep ochre  as the occupants of red river office were however addicted to the use of tobacco and tallow candies the original colour of the ceiling had vanished entirely and that of the walls had considerably changed  there were three doors in the room besides the door of entrance each opening into another apartment where the three clerks were wont to court the favour of morpheus after the labours of the day  no carpets graced the floors of any of these rooms and with the exception of the paint aforementioned no ornament whatever broke the pleasing uniformity of the scene  this was compensated however to some extent by several scarlet sashes brightcoloured shotbelts and gay portions of winter costume peculiar to the country which depended from sundry nails in the bedroom walls and as the three doors always stood open these objects together with one or two fowlingpieces and canoepaddles formed quite a brilliant and highly suggestive background to the otherwise sombre picture  a large open fireplace stood in one corner of the room devoid of a grate and so constructed that large logs of wood might be piled up on end to any extent  and really the fires made in this manner and in this individual fireplace were exquisite beyond description  a woodfire is a particularly cheerful thing  those who have never seen one can form but a faint idea of its splendour especially on a sharp winter night in the arctic regions where the thermometer falls to forty degrees below zero without inducing the inhabitants to suppose that the world has reached its conclusion  the billets are usually piled up on end so that the flames rise and twine round them with a fierce intensity that causes them to crack and sputter cheerfully sending innumerable sparks of fire into the room and throwing out a rich glow of brilliant light that warms a man even to look at it and renders candles quite unnecessary  the clerks who inhabited this countingroom were like itself peculiar there were threecorresponding to the bedrooms  the senior was a tall broadshouldered muscular mana scotchmanvery goodhumoured yet a man whose underlip met the upper with that peculiar degree of precision that indicated the presence of other qualities besides that of goodhumour  he was bookkeeper and accountant and managed the affairs entrusted to his care with the same dogged perseverance with which he would have led an expedition of discovery to the north pole  he was thirty or thereabouts  the second was a small manalso a scotchman  it is curious to note how numerous scotchmen are in the wilds of north america  this specimen was diminutive and sharp  moreover he played the flutean accomplishment of which he was so proud that he ordered out from england a flute of ebony so elaborately enriched with silver keys that ones fingers ached to behold it  this beautiful instrument like most other instruments of a delicate nature found the climate too much for its constitution and soon after the winter began split from top to bottom  peter mactavish however was a genius by nature and a mechanical genius by tendency so that instead of giving way to despair he laboriously bound the flute together with waxed thread which although it could not restore it to its pristine elegance enabled him to play with great effect sundry doleful airs whose influence when performed at night usually sent his companions to sleep or failing this drove them to distraction  the third inhabitant of the office was a ruddy smoothchinned youth of about fourteen who had left home seven months before in the hope of gratifying a desire to lead a wild life which he had entertained ever since he read jack the giant killer and found himself most unexpectedly fastened during the greater part of each day to a stool his name was harry somerville and a fine cheerful little fellow he was full of spirits and curiously addicted to poking and arranging the fire at least every ten minutesa propensity which tested the forbearance of the senior clerk rather severely and would have surprised any one not aware of poor harrys incurable antipathy to the desk and the yearning desire with which he longed for physical action  harry was busily engaged with the refractory fire when charley as stated at the conclusion of the last chapter burst into the room  hollo he exclaimed suspending his operations for a moment whats up  nothing said charley but fathers temper thats all  he gave me a splendid description of his life in the woods and then threw his pipe at me because i admired it too much  ho exclaimed harry making a vigorous thrust at the fire then youve no chance now  no chance what do you mean  only that we are to have a wolfhunt in the plains tomorrow and if youve aggravated your father hell be taking you home tonight thats all  oh no fear of that said charley with a look that seemed to imply that there was very great fear of thatmuch more in fact than he was willing to admit even to himself  my dear old father never keeps his anger long  im sure that hell be all right again in half an hour  hope so but doubt it i do said harry making another deadly poke at the fire and returning with a deep sigh to his stool  would you like to go with us charley said the senior clerk laying down his pen and turning round on his chair the senior clerk never sat on a stool with a benign smile  oh very very much indeed cried charley but even should father agree to stay all night at the fort i have no horse and im sure he would not let me have the mare after what i did today  do you think hes not open to persuasion said the senior clerk  no im sure hes not  well well it dont much signify perhaps we can mount you charleys face brightened go he continued addressing harry somervillego tell tom whyte i wish to speak to him  harry sprang from his stool with a suddenness and vigour that might have justified the belief that he had been fixed to it by means of a powerful spring which had been set free with a sharp recoil and shot him out at the door for he disappeared in a trice  in a few minutes he returned followed by the groom tom whyte  tom said the senior clerk do you think we could manage to mount charley tomorrow  why sir i dont think as how we could  there aint an oss in the stable except them wots required and them wots badly  couldnt he have the brown pony suggested the senior clerk  tom whyte was a cockney and an old soldier and stood so bolt upright that it seemed quite a marvel how the words ever managed to climb up the steep ascent of his throat and turn the corner so as to get out at his mouth  perhaps this was the cause of his speaking on all occasions with great deliberation and slowness  why you see sir he replied the brown ponys got cut under the fetlock of the right hind leg and i ad im down to lesperance the smiths sir to look at im sir and he says to me says he that dont look well that oss dontand hes a knowing feller sir is lesperance though he is an alfbreed  never mind what he said tom interrupted the senior clerk is the pony fit for use thats the question  no sir e haint  and the black mare can he not have that  no sir mr grant is to ride er tomorrow  thats unfortunate said the senior clerki fear charley that youll need to ride behind harry on his gray pony  it wouldnt improve his speed to be sure having two on his back but then hes so like a pig in his movements at any rate i dont think it would spoil his pace much  could he not try the new horse he continued turning to the groom  the noo oss sir he might as well try to ride a mad buffalo bull sir  hes quite a young colt sir only alf brokekicks like a windmill sir ands got an ead like a steamengine e couldnt old im in noow sir  i ad im down to the smith tother day sir an says e to me says e thats a screamer that is  yes says i that his a fact  well says e  hang the smith cried the senior clerk losing all patience cant you answer me without so much talk  is the horse too wild to ride  yes sir e is said the groom with a look of slightly offended dignity and drawing himself upif we may use such an expression to one who was always drawn up to such an extent that he seemed to be just balanced on his heels and required only a gentle push to lay him flat on his back  oh i have it cried peter mactavish who had been standing during the conversation with his back to the fire and a short pipe in his mouth john fowler the miller has just purchased a new pony  im told its an old buffalorunner and im certain he would lend it to charley at once  the very thing said the senior clerkrun tom give the miller my compliments and beg the loan of his horse for charley kennedyi think he knows you charley  the dinnerbell rang as the groom departed and the clerks prepared for their midday meal  the senior clerks order to run was a mere form of speech intended to indicate that haste was desirable  no man imagined for a moment that tom whyte could by any possibility run  he hadnt run since he was dismissed from the army twenty years before for incurable drunkenness and most of toms friends entertained the belief that if he ever attempted to run he would crack all over and go to pieces like a disentombed egyptian mummy  tom therefore walked off to the row of buildings inhabited by the men where he sat down on a bench in front of his bed and proceeded leisurely to fill his pipe  the room in which he sat was a fair specimen of the dwellings devoted to the employes of the hudsons bay company throughout the country  it was large and low in the roof built entirely of wood which was unpainted a matter however of no consequence as from long exposure to dust and tobaccosmoke the floor walls and ceiling had become one deep uniform brown  the mens berths were constructed after the fashion of berths on board ship being wooden boxes ranged in tiers round the room  several tables and benches were strewn miscellaneously about the floor in the centre of which stood a large double iron stove with the word carron stamped on it  this served at once for cooking and warming the place  numerous guns axes and canoepaddles hung round the walls or were piled in corners and the rafters sustained a miscellaneous mass of materials the more conspicuous among which were snowshoes dogsledges axe handles and nets  having filled and lighted his pipe tom whyte thrust his hands into his deerskin mittens and sauntered off to perform his errand    chapter four  a wolfhunt in the prairiescharley astonishes his father and breaks in the noo oss effectually  during the long winter that reigns in the northern regions of america the thermometer ranges for many months together from zero down to 20 30 and 40 degrees below it  in different parts of the country the intensity of the frost varies a little but not sufficiently to make any appreciable change in ones sensation of cold  at york fort on the shores of hudsons bay where the winter is eight months long the spiritofwine mercury being useless in so cold a climate sometimes falls so low as 50 degrees below zero and away in the regions of great bear lake it has been known to fall considerably lower than 60 degrees below zero of fahrenheit  cold of such intensity of course produces many curious and interesting effects which although scarcely noticed by the inhabitants make a strong impression upon the minds of those who visit the country for the first time  a youth goes out to walk on one of the first sharp frosty mornings  his locks are brown and his face ruddy  in half an hour he returns with his face blue his nose frostbitten and his locks whitethe latter effect being produced by his breath congealing on his hair and breast until both are covered with hoarfrost  perhaps he is of a sceptical nature prejudiced it may be in favour of old habits and customs so that although told by those who ought to know that it is absolutely necessary to wear moccasins in winter he prefers the leather boots to which he has been accustomed at home and goes out with them accordingly  in a few minutes the feet begin to lose sensation  first the toes as far as feeling goes vanish then the heels depart and he feels the extraordinary and peculiar and altogether disagreeable sensation of one who has had his heels and toes amputated and is walking about on his insteps  soon however these also fade away and the unhappy youth rushes frantically home on the stumps of his anklebonesat least so it appears to him and so in reality it would turn out to be if he did not speedily rub the benumbed appendages into vitality again  the whole country during this season is buried in snow and the prairies of red river present the appearance of a sea of the purest white for five or six months of the year  impelled by hunger troops of prairie wolves prowl round the settlement safe from the assault of man in consequence of their light weight permitting them to scamper away on the surface of the snow into which man or horse from their greater weight would sink so as to render pursuit either fearfully laborious or altogether impossible  in spring however when the first thaws begin to take place and commence that delightful process of disruption which introduces this charming season of the year the relative position of wolf and man is reversed  the snow becomes suddenly soft so that the short legs of the wolf sinking deep into it fail to reach the solid ground below and he is obliged to drag heavily along while the long legs of the horse enable him to plunge through and dash aside the snow at a rate which although not very fleet is sufficient nevertheless to overtake the chase and give his rider a chance of shooting it  the inhabitants of red river are not much addicted to this sport but the gentlemen of the hudsons bay service sometimes practise it and it was to a hunt of this description that our young friend charley kennedy was now so anxious to go  the morning was propitious  the sun blazed in dazzling splendour in a sky of deep unclouded blue while the white prairie glittered as if it were a sea of diamonds rolling out in an unbroken sheet from the walls of the fort to the horizon and on looking at which one experienced all the pleasurable feelings of being out on a calm day on the wide wide sea without the disagreeable consequence of being very very sick  the thermometer stood at 39 in the shade and everythink as tom white emphatically expressed it looked like a runnin of right away into slush  that unusual sound the trickling of water so inexpressibly grateful to the ears of those who dwell in frosty climes was heard all around as the heavy masses of snow on the housetops sent a few adventurous drops gliding down the icicles which depended from the ewes and gables and there was a balmy softness in the air that told of coming spring  nature in fact seemed to have wakened from her long nap and was beginning to think of getting up  like people however who venture to delay so long as to think about it nature frequently turns round and goes to sleep again in her icy cradle for a few weeks after the first awakening  the scene in the courtyard of fort garry harmonised with the cheerful spirit of the morning  tom whyte with that upright solemnity which constituted one of his characteristic features was standing in the centre of a group of horses whose energy he endeavoured to restrain with the help of a small indian boy to whom meanwhile he imparted a variety of useful and otherwise unattainable information  you see joseph said he to the urchin who gazed gravely in his face with a pair of very large and dark eyes ponies is often skittish reason why one should be an another not i cant comprehend  praps its natral praps not but howsomediver so tis an if its more nor above the likes o me joseph you neednt be surprised that its somethink haltogether beyond you  it will not surprise the reader to be told that joseph made no reply to this speech having a very imperfect acquaintance with the english language especially the peculiar dialect of that tongue in which tom whyte was wont to express his ideas when he had any  he merely gave a grunt and continued to gaze at toms fishy eyes which were about as interesting as the face to which they belonged and that might have been mistaken for almost anything  yes joseph he continued thats a fact  theres the noo brown oss now its a skittish un  and theres mr kennedys gray mare wots a standin of beside me she aint skittish a bit though shes plenty of spirit and wouldnt care hanythink for a fivebarred gate  now wot i want to know is wots the reason why  we fear that the reason why however interesting it might prove to naturalists must remain a profound secret for ever for just as the groom was about to entertain joseph with one of his theories on the point charley kennedy and harry somerville hastily approached  ho tom exclaimed the former have you got the millers pony for me  why no sir e adnt got his shoes on sir last night  oh bother his shoes said charley in a voice of great disappointment  why didnt you bring him up without shoes man eh  well sir the miller said ed get em put on early this mornin an i xpect ell be ere in alf a hour at farthest sir  oh very well replied charley much relieved but still a little nettled at the bare possibility of being latecome along harry lets go and meet him  hell be long enough of coming if we dont go to poke him up a bit  youd better wait called out the groom as the boys hastened away if you go by the river hell praps come by the plains and if you go by the plains hell praps come by the river  charley and harry stopped and looked at each other  then they looked at the groom and as their eyes surveyed his solemn cadaverous countenance which seemed a sort of bad caricature of the long visages of the horses that stood around him they burst into a simultaneous and prolonged laugh  hes a clever old lamppost said harry at last we had better remain charley  you see continued tom whyte the ponys oofs is in an orrible state  last night wen i seed im i said to the miller says i john ill take im down to the smith drectly  very good said john  so i ad im down to the smith  the remainder of toms speech was cut short by one of those unforeseen operations of the laws of nature which are peculiar to arctic climates during the long winter repeated falls of snow cover the housetops with white mantles upwards of a foot thick which become gradually thicker and more consolidated as winter advances  in spring the suddenness of the thaw loosens these from the sloping roofs and precipitates them in masses to the ground  these miniature avalanches are dangerous people having been seriously injured and sometimes killed by them  now it happened that a very large mass of snow which lay on and partly depended from the roof of the house near to which the horses were standing gave way and just at that critical point in tom whytes speech when he ad im down to the smith fell with a stunning crash on the back of mr kennedys gray mare  the mare was not skittishby no meansaccording to toms idea but it would have been more than an ordinary mare to have stood the sudden descent of half a ton of snow without some symptoms of consciousness  no sooner did it feel the blow than it sent both heels with a bang against the wooden store by way of preliminary movement and then rearing up with a wild snort it sprang over tom whytes head jerked the reins from his hand and upset him in the snow  poor tom never bent to anything  the military despotism under which he had been reared having substituted a touch of the cap for a bow rendered it unnecessary to bend prolonged drill laziness and rheumatism made it at last impossible  when he stood up he did so after the manner of a pillar when he sat down he broke across at two points much in the way in which a footrule would have done had it felt disposed to sit down and when he fell he came down like an overturned lamppost  on the present occasion tom became horizontal in a moment and from his unfortunate propensity to fall straight his head reaching much farther than might have been expected came into violent contact with the small indian boy who fell flat likewise letting go the reins of the horses which latter no sooner felt themselves free than they fled curvetting and snorting round the court with reins and manes flying in rare confusion  the two boys who could scarce stand for laughing ran to the gates of the fort to prevent the chargers getting free and in a short time they were again secured although evidently much elated in spirit  a few minutes after this mr grant issued from the principal house leaning on mr kennedys arm and followed by the senior clerk peter mactavish and one or two friends who had come to take part in the wolfhunt  they were all armed with double or single barrelled guns or pistols according to their several fancies  the two elderly gentlemen alone entered upon the scene without any more deadly weapons than their heavy ridingwhips  young harry somerville who had been strongly advised not to take a gun lest he should shoot himself or his horse or his companions was content to take the field with a small pocketpistol which he crammed to the muzzle with a compound of ball and swanshot  it wont do said mr grant in an earnest voice to his friend as they walked towards the horsesit wont do to check him too abruptly my dear sir  it was evident that they were recurring to the subject of conversation of the previous day and it was also evident that the fathers wrath was in that very uncertain state when a word or a look can throw it into violent agitation  just permit me continued mr grant to get him sent to the saskatchewan or athabasca for a couple of years  by that time hell have had enough of a rough life and be only too glad to get a berth at headquarters  if you thwart him now i feel convinced that hell break through all restraint  humph ejaculated mr kennedy with a frowncome here charley he said as the boy approached with a disappointed look to tell of his failure in getting a horse ive been talking with mr grant again about this business and he says he can easily get you into the countingroom here for a year so youll make arrangements  the old gentleman paused  he was going to have followed his wonted course by commanding instantaneous obedience but as his eye fell upon the honest open though disappointed face of his son a gush of tenderness filled his heart  laying his hand upon charleys head he said in a kind but abrupt tone there now charley my boy make up your mind to give in with a good grace  itll only be hard work for a year or two and then plain sailing after that charley  charleys clear blue eyes filled with tears as the accents of kindness fell upon his ear  it is strange that men should frequently be so blind to the potent influence of kindness  independently of the divine authority which assures us that a soft answer turneth away wrath and that love is the fulfilling of the law who has not in the course of his experience felt the overwhelming power of a truly affectionate word not a word which possesses merely an affectionate signification but a word spoken with a gush of tenderness where love rolls in the tone and beams in the eye and revels in every wrinkle of the face  and how much more powerfully does such a word or look or tone strike home to the heart if uttered by one whose lips are not much accustomed to the formation of honeyed words or sweet sentences  had mr kennedy senior known more of this power and put it more frequently to the proof we venture to affirm that mr kennedy junior would have allowed his flint to be fixed as his father pithily expressed it long ago  ere charley could reply to the question mr grants voice pitched in an elevated key interrupted them  eh what said that gentleman to tom whyte  no horse for charley hows that  no sir said tom  wheres the brown pony said mr grant abruptly  cut is fetlock sir said tom slowly  and the new horse  taint alf broke yet sir  ah thats badit wouldnt do to take an unbroken charger charley for although you are a pretty good rider you couldnt manage him i fear  let me see  please sir said the groom touching his hat ive borrowed the millers pony for im and es sure to be ere in alf a hour at farthest  oh thatll do said mr grant you can soon overtake us  we shall ride slowly out straight into the prairie and harry will remain behind to keep you company  so saying mr grant mounted his horse and rode out at the back gate followed by the whole cavalcade  now this is too bad said charley looking with a very perplexed air at his companion  whats to be done  harry evidently did not know what was to be done and made no difficulty of saying so in a very sympathising tone  moreover he begged charley very earnestly to take his pony but this the other would not hear of so they came to the conclusion that there was nothing for it but to wait as patiently as possible for the arrival of the expected horse  in the meantime harry proposed a saunter in the field adjoining the fort charley assented and the two friends walked away leading the gray pony along with them  to the right of fort garry was a small enclosure at the extreme end of which commences a growth of willows and underwood which gradually increases in size till it becomes a pretty thick belt of woodland skirting up the river for many miles  here stood the stable belonging to the establishment and as the boys passed it charley suddenly conceived a strong desire to see the renowned noo oss which tom had said was only alf broke so he turned the key opened the door and went in  there was nothing very peculiar about this horse excepting that his legs seemed rather long for his body and upon a closer examination there was a noticeable breadth of nostril and a latent fire in his eye indicating a good deal of spirit which like charleys own required taming  oh said charley what a splendid fellow  i say harry ill go out with him  youd better not  why not  why just because if you do mr grant will be down upon you and your father wont be very well pleased  nonsense cried charley  father didnt say i wasnt to take him  i dont think hed care much  hes not afraid of my breaking my neck and then mr grant seemed to be only afraid of my being run off with not of his horse being hurt  here goes for it  in another moment charley had him saddled and bridled and led him out into the yard  why i declare hes quite quiet just like a lamb said harry in surprise  so he is replied charley  hes a capital charger and even if he does bolt he cant run five hundred miles at a stretch  if i turn his head to the prairies the rocky mountains are the first things that will bring him up  so let him run if he likes i dont care a fig  and springing lightly into the saddle he cantered out of the yard followed by his friend  the young horse was a wellformed showy animal with a good deal of boneperhaps too much for elegance  he was of a beautiful dark brown and carried a high head and tail with a highstepping gait that gave him a noble appearance  as charley cantered along at a steady pace he could discover no symptoms of the refractory spirit which had been ascribed to him  let us strike out straight for the horizon now said harry after they had galloped half a mile or so along the beaten track  see here are the tracks of our friends  turning sharp round as he spoke he leaped his pony over the heap that lined the road and galloped away through the soft snow  at this point the young horse began to show his evil spirit  instead of following the other he suddenly halted and began to back  hollo harry exclaimed charley hold on a bit  heres this monster begun his tricks  hit him a crack with the whip shouted harry  charley acted upon the advice which had the effect of making the horse shake his head with a sharp snort and back more vigorously than ever  there my fine fellow quiet now said charley in a soothing tone patting the horses neck  its a comfort to know you cant go far in that direction anyhow he added as he glanced over his shoulder and saw an immense drift behind  he was right  in a few minutes the horse backed into the snowdrift finding his hindquarters imprisoned by a power that was too much even for his obstinacy to overcome he gave another snort and a heavy plunge which almost unseated his young rider  hold on fast cried harry who had now come up  no fear cried charley as he clinched his teeth and gathered the reins more firmlynow for it you young villain and raising his whip he brought it down with a heavy slash on the horses flank  had the snowdrift been a cannon and the horse a bombshell he could scarcely have sprung from it with greater velocity  one bound landed him on the road another cleared it and in a second more he stretched out at full speedhis ears flat on his neck mane and tail flying in the wind and the bit tight between his teeth  well done cried harry as he passed  youre off now old fellow goodbye  hurrah shouted charley in reply leaving his cap in the snow as a parting souvenir while seeing that it was useless to endeavour to check his steed he became quite wild with excitement gave him the rein flourished his whip and flew over the white plains casting up the snow in clouds behind him like a hurricane  while this little escapade was being enacted by the boys the hunters were riding leisurely out upon the snowy sea in search of a wolf  words cannot convey to you dear reader an adequate conception of the peculiar fascination the exhilarating splendour of the scene by which our hunters were surrounded  its beauty lay not in variety of feature in the landscape for there was none  one vast sheet of white alone met the view bounded all round by the blue circle of the sky and broken in one or two places by a patch or two of willows which rising on the plain appeared like little islands in a frozen sea  it was the glittering sparkle of the snow in the bright sunshine the dreamy haziness of the atmosphere mingling earth and sky as in a halo of gold the first taste the first smell of spring after a long winter bursting suddenly upon the senses like the unexpected visit of a longabsent muchloved and almost forgotten friend the soft warm feeling of the south wind bearing on its wings the balmy influences of sunny climes and recalling vividly the scenes the pleasures the bustling occupations of summer  it was this that caused the hunters hearts to leap within them as they rode alongthat induced old mr kennedy to forget his years and shout as he had been wont to do in days gone by when he used to follow the track of the elk or hunt the wild buffalo and it was this that made the otherwise monotonous prairies on this particular day so charming  the party had wandered about without discovering anything that bore the smallest resemblance to a wolf for upwards of an hour fort garry had fallen astern to use a nautical phrase until it had become a mere speck on the horizon and vanished altogether peter mactavish had twice given a false alarm in the eagerness of his spirit and had three times plunged his horse up to the girths in a snowdrift the senior clerk was waxing impatient and the horses restive when a sudden hollo from mr grant brought the whole cavalcade to a stand  the object which drew his attention and to which he directed the anxious eyes of his friends was a small speck rather triangular in form which overtopped a little willow bush not more than five or six hundred yards distant  there he is exclaimed mr grant  thats a fact cried mr kennedy and both gentlemen instantaneously giving a shout bounded towards the object not however before the senior clerk who was mounted on a fleet and strong horse had taken the lead by six yards  a moment afterwards the speck rose up and discovered itself to be a veritable wolf  moreover he condescended to show his teeth and then conceiving it probable that his enemies were too numerous for him he suddenly turned round and fled away  for ten minutes or so the chase was kept up at full speed and as the snow happened to be shallow at the startingpoint the wolf kept well ahead of its pursuersindeed distanced them a little  but soon the snow became deeper and the wolf plunged heavily and the horses gained considerably  although to the eye the prairie seemed to be a uniform level there were numerous slight undulations in which drifts of some depth had collected  into one of these the wolf now plunged and laboured slowly through it  but so deep was the snow that the horses almost stuck fast  a few minutes however brought them out and mr grant and mr kennedy who had kept close to each other during the run pulled up for a moment on the summit of a ridge to breathe their panting steeds  what can that be exclaimed the former pointing with his whip to a distant object which was moving rapidly over the plain  eh whatwhere said mr kennedy shading his eyes with his hand and peering in the direction indicated  why thats another wolf isnt it  no it runs too fast for that  strange said his friend what can it be  if i hadnt seen every beast in the country remarked mr kennedy and didnt know that there are no such animals north of the equator i should say it was a mad dromedary mounted by a ringtailed roarer  it cant be surelynot possible exclaimed mr grant  its not charley on the new horse  mr grant said this with an air of vexation that annoyed his friend a little  he would not have much minded charleys taking a horse without leave no matter how wild it might be but he did not at all relish the idea of making an apology for his sons misconduct and for the moment did not exactly know what to say  as usual in such a dilemma the old man took refuge in a towering passion gave his steed a sharp cut with the whip and galloped forward to meet the delinquent  we are not acquainted with the general appearance of a ringtailed roarer in fact we have grave doubts as to whether such an animal exists at all but if it does and is particularly wild dishevelled and fierce in deportment there is no doubt whatever that when mr kennedy applied the name to his hopeful son the application was singularly powerful and appropriate  charley had had a long run since we last saw him  after describing a wide curve in which his charger displayed a surprising aptitude for picking out the ground that was least covered with snow he headed straight for the fort again at the same pace at which he had started at first charley tried every possible method to check him but in vain so he gave it up resolving to enjoy the race since he could not prevent it  the young horse seemed to be made of lightning with bones and muscles of brass for he bounded untiringly forward for miles tossing his head and snorting in his wild career  but charley was a good horseman and did not mind that much being quite satisfied that the horse was a horse and not a spirit and that therefore he could not run for ever  at last he approached the party in search of which he had originally set out  his eyes dilated and his colour heightened as he beheld the wolf running directly towards him  fumbling hastily for the pistol which he had borrowed from his friend harry he drew it from his pocket and prepared to give the animal a shot in passing just at that moment the wolf caught sight of this new enemy in advance and diverged suddenly to the left plunging into a drift in his confusion and so enabling the senior clerk to overtake him and send an ounce of heavy shot into his side which turned him over quite dead the shot however had a double effect  at that instant charley swept past and his mettlesome steed swerved as it heard the loud report of the gun thereby almost unhorsing his rider and causing him unintentionally to discharge the conglomerate of bullets and swanshot into the flank of peter mactavishs horsefortunately at a distance which rendered the shot equivalent to a dozen very sharp and particularly stinging blows  on receiving this unexpected salute the astonished charger reared convulsively and fell back upon his rider who was thereby buried deep in the snow not a vestige of him being left no more than if he had never existed at all  indeed for a moment it seemed to be doubtful whether poor peter did exist or not until a sudden upheaving of the snow took place and his dishevelled head appeared with the eyes and mouth wide open bearing on them an expression of mingled horror and amazement  meanwhile the second shot acted like a spur on the young horse which flew past mr kennedy like a whirlwind  stop you young scoundrel he shouted shaking his fist at charley as he passed  charley was past stopping either by inclination or ability  this sudden and unexpected accumulation of disasters was too much for him as he passed his sire with his brown curls streaming straight out behind and his eyes flashing with excitement his teeth clinched and his horse tearing along more like an incarnate fiend than an animal a spirit of combined recklessness consternation indignation and glee took possession of him  he waved his whip wildly over his head brought it down with a stinging cut on the horses neck and uttered a shout of defiance that threw completely into the shade the loudest warwhoop that was ever uttered by the brazen lungs of the wildest savage between hudsons bay and oregon  seeing and hearing this old mr kennedy wheeled about and dashed off in pursuit with much greater energy than he had displayed in chase of the wolf  the race bade fair to be a long one for the young horse was strong in wind and limb and the gray mare though decidedly not the better horse was much fresher than the other  the hunters who were now joined by harry somerville did not feel it incumbent on them to follow this new chase so they contented themselves with watching their flight towards the fort while they followed at a more leisurely pace  meanwhile charley rapidly neared fort garry and now began to wonder whether the stable door was open and if so whether it were better for him to take his chance of getting his neck broken or to throw himself into the next snowdrift that presented itself  he had not to remain long in suspense  the wooden fence that enclosed the stableyard lay before him  it was between four and five feet high with a beaten track running along the outside and a deep snowdrift on the other  charley felt that the young horse had made up his mind to leap this  as he did not at the moment see that there was anything better to be done he prepared for it  as the horse bent on his haunches to spring he gave him a smart cut with the whip went over like a rocket and plunged up to the neck in the snowdrift which brought his career to an abrupt conclusion  the sudden stoppage of the horse was one thing but the arresting of master charley was another and quite a different thing  the instant his charger landed he left the saddle like a harlequin described an extensive curve in the air and fell head foremost into the drift above which his boots and three inches of his legs alone remained to tell the tale  on witnessing this climax mr kennedy senior pulled up dismounted and ranwith an expression of some anxiety on his countenanceto the help of his son while tom whyte came out of the stable just in time to receive the noo oss as he floundered out of the snow  i believe said the groom as he surveyed the trembling charger that your son has broke the noo oss sir better nor i could ave done myself  i believe that my son has broken his neck said mr kennedy wrathfully  come here and help me to dig him out  in a few minutes charley was dug out in a state of insensibility and carried up to the fort where he was laid on a bed and restoratives actively applied for his recovery    chapter five  peter mactavish becomes an amateur doctor charley promulgates his views of things in general to kate and kate waxes sagacious  shortly after the catastrophe just related charley opened his eyes to consciousness and aroused himself out of a prolonged fainting fit under the combined influence of a strong constitution and the medical treatment of his friends  medical treatment in the wilds of north america by the way is very original in its character and is founded on principles so vague that no one has ever keen found capable of stating them clearly  owing to the stubborn fact that there are no doctors in the country men have been thrown upon their own resources and as a natural consequence every man is a doctor  true there are two it may be three real doctors in the hudsons bay companys employment but as one of these is resident on the shores of hudsons bay another in oregon and a third in red river settlement they are not considered available for every case of emergency that may chance to occur in the hundreds of little outposts scattered far and wide over the whole continent of north america with miles and miles of primeval wilderness between each  we do not think therefore that when we say there are no doctors in the country we use a culpable amount of exaggeration  if a man gets ill he goes on till he gets better and if he doesnt get better he dies  to avert such an undesirable consummation desperate and random efforts are made in an amateur way  the old proverb that extremes meet is verified  and in a land where no doctors are to be had for love or money doctors meet you at every turn ready to practise on everything with anything and all for nothing on the shortest possible notice  as may be supposed the practice is novel and not unfrequently extremely wild  toothdrawing is considered childs play mere blacksmiths work bleeding is a general remedy for everything when all else fails castor oil epsom salts and emetics are the three keynotes the foundations and the copestones of the system  in red river there is only one genuine doctor and as the settlement is fully sixty miles long he has enough to do and is not always to be found when wanted so that charley had to rest content with amateur treatment in the meantime  peter mactavish was the first to try his powers  he was aware that laudanum had the effect of producing sleep and seeing that charley looked somewhat sleepy after recovering consciousness he thought it advisable to help out that propensity to slumber and went to the medicine chest whence he extracted a small phial of tincture of rhubarb the half of which he emptied into a wineglass under the impression that it was laudanum and poured down charleys throat  the poor boy swallowed a little and sputtered the remainder over the bedclothes  it may be remarked here that mactavish was a wild happy halfmad sort of fellowwonderfully erudite in regard to some things and profoundly ignorant in regard to others medicine it need scarcely be added was not his forte  having accomplished this feat to his satisfaction he sat down to watch by the bedside of his friend  peter had taken this opportunity to indulge in a little private practice just after several of the other gentlemen had left the office under the impression that charley had better remain quiet for a short time  well peter whispered mr kennedy senior putting his head in at the door it was harrys room in which charley lay how is he now  oh doing capitally replied peter in a hoarse whisper at the same time rising and entering the office while he gently closed the door behind him  i gave him a small dose of physic which i think has done him good  hes sleeping like a top now  mr kennedy frowned slightly and made one or two remarks in reference to physic which were not calculated to gratify the cars of a physician  what did you give him he inquired abruptly  only a little laudanum  only indeed  its all trash together and thats the worst kind of trash you could have given him  humph and the old gentleman jerked his shoulders testily  how much did you give him said the senior clerk who had entered the apartment with harry a few minutes before  not quite a wineglassful replied peter somewhat subdued  a what cried the father starting from his chair as if he had received an electric shock and rushing into the adjoining room up and down which he raved in a state of distraction being utterly ignorant of what should be done under the circumstances  oh dear gasped peter turning pale as death  poor harry somerville fell rather than leaped off his stool and dashed into the bedroom where old mr kennedy was occupied in alternately heaping unutterable abuse on the head of peter mactavish and imploring him to advise what was best to be done  but peter knew not  he could only make one or two insane proposals to roll charley about the floor and see if that would do him any good while harry suggested in desperation that he should be hung by the heels and perhaps it would run out  meanwhile the senior clerk seized his hat with the intention of going in search of tom whyte and rushed out at the door which he had no sooner done than he found himself tightly embraced in the arms of that worthy who happened to be entering at the moment and who in consequence of the sudden onset was pinned up against the wall of the porch  oh my buzzum exclaimed tom laying his hand on his breast youve amost bust me sir  wats wrong sir  go for the doctor tom quick run like the wind  take the freshest horse fly tom charleys poisonedlaudanum quick  eavens an arth ejaculated the groom wheeling round and stalking rapidly off to the stable like a pair of insane compasses while the senior clerk returned to the bedroom where he found mr kennedy still raving peter mactavish still aghast and deadly pale and harry somerville staring like a maniac at his young friend as if he expected every moment to see him explode although to all appearance he was sleeping soundly and comfortably too notwithstanding the noise that was going on around him  suddenly harrys eye rested on the label of the halfempty phial and he uttered a loud prolonged cheer  its only tincture of  wild cats and furies cried mr kennedy turning sharply round and seizing harry by the collar why dyou kick up such a row eh  its only tincture of rhubarb repeated the boy disengaging himself and holding up the phial triumphantly  so it is i declare exclaimed mr kennedy in a tone that indicated intense relief of mind while peter mactavish uttered a sigh so deep that one might suppose a burden of innumerable tons weight had just been removed from his breast  charley had been roused from his slumbers by this last ebullition but on being told what had caused it he turned languidly round on his pillow and went to sleep again while his friends departed and left him to repose  tom whyte failed to find the doctor  the servant told him that her master had been suddenly called to set a broken leg that morning for a trapper who lived ten miles down the river and on his return had found a man waiting with a horse and cariole who carried him violently away to see his wife who had been taken suddenly ill at a house twenty miles up the river and so she didnt expect him back that night  an where has e been took to inquired tom  she couldnt tell she knew it was somewhere about the whitehorse plains but she didnt know more than that  did e not say wen ed be ome  no he didnt  oh dear said tom rubbing his long nose in great perplexity  its an orrible case o sudden and onexpected pison  she was sorry for it but couldnt help that and thereupon bidding him goodmorning shut the door  toms wits had come to that condition which just precedes giving it up as hopeless when it occurred to him that he was not far from mr kennedys residence so he stepped into the cariole again and drove thither  on his arrival he threw poor mrs kennedy and kate into great consternation by his exceedingly graphic and more than slightly exaggerated account of what had brought him in search of the doctor at first mrs kennedy resolved to go up to fort garry immediately but kate persuaded her to remain at home by pointing out that she could herself go and if anything very serious had occurred which she didnt believe mr kennedy could come down for her immediately while she kate could remain to nurse her brother  in a few minutes kate and tom were seated side by side in the little cariole driving swiftly up the frozen river and two hours later the former was seated by her brothers bedside watching him as he slept with a look of tender affection and solicitude  rousing himself from his slumbers charley looked vacantly round the room  have you slept well darling inquired kate laying her hand lightly on his forehead  slepteh oh yes ive slept  i say kate what a precious bump i came down on my head to be sure  hush charley said kate perceiving that he was becoming energetic father said you were to keep quietand so do i she added with a frown  shut your eyes sir and go to sleep  charley complied by shutting his eyes and opening his mouth and uttering a succession of deep snores  now you bad boy said kate why wont you try to rest  because kate dear said charley opening his eyes againbecause i feel as if i had slept a week at least and not being one of the seven sleepers i dont think it necessary to do more in that way just now besides my sweet but particularly wicked sister i wish just at this moment to have a talk with you  but are you sure it wont do you harm to talk do you feel quite strong enough  quite samson was a mere infant compared to me  oh dont talk nonsense charley dear and keep your hands quiet and dont lift the clothes with your knees in that way else ill go away and leave you  very well my pet if you do ill get up and dress and follow you thats all  but come kate tell me first of all how it was that i got pitched off that longlegged rhinoceros and who it was that picked me up and why wasnt i killed and how did i come here for my head is sadly confused and i scarcely recollect anything that has happened and before commencing your discourse kate please hand me a glass of water for my mouth is as dry as a whistle  kate handed him a glass of water smoothed his pillow brushed the curls gently off his forehead and sat down on the bedside  thank you kate now go on  well you see she began  pardon me dearest interrupted charley if you would please to look at me you would observe that my two eyes are tightly closed so that i dont see at all  well then you must understand  must i oh  that after that wicked horse leaped with you over the stable fence you were thrown high into the air and turning completely round fell head foremost into the snow and your poor head went through the top of an old cask that had been buried there all winter  dear me ejaculated charley did any one see me kate  oh yes  who asked charley somewhat anxiously not mrs grant i hope for if she did shed never let me hear the last of it  no only our father who was chasing you at the time replied kate with a merry laugh  and no one else  nooh yes bythebye tom whyte was there too  oh hes nobody  go on  but tell me charley why do you care about mrs grant seeing you  oh no reason at all only shes such an abominable quiz  we must guard the reader here against the supposition that mrs grant was a quiz of the ordinary kind  she was by no means a sprightly clever woman rather fond of a joke than otherwise as the term might lead you to suppose  her corporeal frame was very large excessively fat and remarkably unwieldy being an appropriate casket in which to enshrine a mind of the heaviest and most sluggish nature  she spoke little ate largely and slept muchthe latter recreation being very frequently enjoyed in a large armchair of a peculiar kind  it had been a waterbutt which her ingenious husband had cut halfway down the middle then halfway across and in the angle thus formed fixed a bottom which together with the back he padded with tow and covered the whole with a mantle of glaring bedcurtain chintz whose pattern alternated in stripes of skyblue and china roses with broken fragments of rainbow between  notwithstanding her excessive slowness however mrs grant was fond of taking a firm hold of anything or any circumstance in the character or affairs of her friends and twitting them thereupon in a grave but persevering manner that was exceedingly irritating  no one could ever ascertain whether mrs grant did this in a sly way or not as her visage never expressed anything except unalterable goodhumour  she was a good wife and an affectionate mother had a family of ten children and could boast of never having had more than one quarrel with her husband  this disagreement was occasioned by a rather awkward mischance  one day not long after her last baby was born mrs grant waddled towards her tub with the intention of enjoying her accustomed siesta  a few minutes previously her seventh child which was just able to walk had scrambled up into the seat and fallen fast asleep there  as has been already said mrs grants intellect was never very bright and at this particular time she was rather drowsy so that she did not observe the child and on reaching her chair turned round preparatory to letting herself plump into it  she always plumped into her chair  her muscles were too soft to lower her gently down into it  invariably on reaching a certain point they ceased to act and let her down with a crash  she had just reached this point and her babys hopes and prospects were on the eve of being cruelly crushed for ever when mr grant noticed the impending calamity  he had no time to warn her for she had already passed the point at which her powers of muscular endurance terminated so grasping the chair he suddenly withdrew it with such force that the baby rolled off upon the floor like a hedgehog straightened out flat and gave vent to an outrageous roar while its horrorstruck mother came to the ground with a sound resembling the fall of an enormous sack of wool  although the old lady could not see exactly that there was anything very blameworthy in her husbands conduct upon this occasion yet her nerves had received so severe a shock that she refused to be comforted for two entire days  but to return from this digression  after charley had two or three times recommended kate who was a little inclined to be quizzical to proceed she continued  well then you were carried up here by father and tom whyte and put to bed and after a good deal of rubbing and rough treatment you were got round  then peter mactavish nearly poisoned you but fortunately he was such a goose that he did not think of reading the label of the phial and so gave you a dose of tincture of rhubarb instead of laudanum as he had intended and then father flew into a passion and tom whyte was sent to fetch the doctor and couldnt find him but fortunately he found me which was much better i think and brought me up here  and so here i am and here i intend to remain  and so thats the end of it  well kate im very glad it was no worse  and i am very thankful said kate with emphasis on the word that its no worse  oh well you know kate i meant that of course  but you did not say it replied his sister earnestly  to be sure not said charley gaily it would be absurd to be always making solemn speeches and things of that sort every time one has a little accident  true charley but when one has a very serious accident and escapes unhurt dont you think that then it would be  oh yes to be sure interrupted charley who still strove to turn kate from her serious frame of mind but sister dear how could i possibly say i was thankful with my head crammed into an old cask and my feet pointing up to the blue sky eh  kate smiled at this and laid her hand on his arm while she bent over the pillow and looked tenderly into his eyes  o my darling charley you are disposed to jest about it but i cannot tell you how my heart trembled this morning when i heard from tom whyte of what had happened  as we drove up to the fort i thought how terrible it would have been if you had been killed and then the happy days we have spent together rushed into my mind and i thought of the willow creek where we used to fish for goldeyes and the spot in the woods where we have so often chased the little birds and the lake in the prairies where we used to go in spring to watch the waterfowl sporting in the sunshine  when i recalled these things charley and thought of you as dead i felt as if i should die too  and when i came here and found that my fears were needless that you were alive and safe and almost well i felt thankfulyes very very thankfulto god for sparing your life my dear dear charley  and kate laid her head on his bosom and sobbed when she thought of what might have been as if her very heart would break  charleys disposition to levity entirely vanished while his sister spoke and twining his tough little arm round her neck he pressed her fervently to his heart  bless you kate he said at length  i am indeed thankful to god not only for sparing my life but for giving me such a darling sister to live for  but now kate tell me what do you think of fathers determination to have me placed in the office here  indeed i think its very hard  oh i do wish so much that i could do it for you said kate with a sigh  do what for me asked charley  why the office work said kate  tuts fiddlesticks  but isnt it now really a very hard case  indeed it is but then what can you do  do said charley impatiently run away to be sure  oh dont speak of that said kate anxiously  you know it will kill our beloved mother and then it would grieve father very much  well father dont care much about grieving me when he hunted me down like a wolf till i nearly broke my neck  now charley you must not speak so  father loves you tenderly although he is a little rough at times  if you only heard how kindly he speaks of you to our mother when you are away you could not think of giving him so much pain  and then the bible says honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee and as god speaks in the bible surely we should pay attention to it  charley was silent for a few seconds then heaving a deep sigh he saidwell i believe youre right kate but then what am i to do if i dont run away i must live like poor harry somerville on a longlegged stool and if i do that illill  as charley spoke the door opened and his father entered  well my boy said he seating himself on the bedside and taking his sons hand how goes it now  head getting all right again  i fear that kate has been talking too much to youis it so you little chatterbox  mr kennedy parted kates clustering ringlets and kissed her forehead  charley assured his father that he was almost well and much the better of having kate to tend him  in fact he felt so much revived that he said he would get up and go out for a walk  had i not better tell tom whyte to saddle the young horse for you said his father half ironically  no no boy lie still where you are today and get up if you feel better tomorrow  in the meantime ive come to say goodbye as i intend to go home to relieve your mothers anxiety about you  ill see you again probably the day after tomorrow  hark you boy ive been talking your affairs over again with mr grant and weve come to the conclusion to give you a run in the woods for a time  youll have to be ready to start early in spring with the first brigades for the north  so adieu  mr kennedy patted him on the head and hastily left the room  a burning blush of shame arose on charleys cheek as he recollected his late remarks about his father and then recalling the purport of his last words he sent forth an exulting shout as he thought of the coming spring  well now charley said kate with an arch smile let us talk seriously over your arrangements for running away  charley replied by seizing the pillow and throwing it at his sisters head but being accustomed to such eccentricities she anticipated the movement and evaded the blow  ah charley cried kate laughing you mustnt let your hand get out of practice  that was a shockingly bad shot for a man thirsting to become a bear and buffalo hunter  ill make my fortune at once cried charley as kate replaced the pillow build a wooden castle on the shores of great bear lake take you to keep house for me and when im out hunting youll fish for whales in the lake and well live there to a good old age so goodnight kate dear and go to bed  kate laughed gave her brother a parting kiss and left him    chapter six  spring and the voyageurs  winter with its snow and its ice winter with its sharp winds and white drifts winter with its various characteristic occupations and employments is past and it is spring now  the sun no longer glitters on fields of white the woodmans axe is no longer heard hacking the oaken billets to keep alive the roaring fires that inexpressibly cheerful sound the merry chime of sleighbells that tells more of winter than all other sounds together is no longer heard on the bosom of red river for the sleighs are thrown aside as useless lumbercarts and gigs have supplanted them  the old canadian who used to drive the ox with its waterbarrel to the icehole for his daily supply has substituted a small cart with wheels for the old sleigh that used to glide so smoothly over the snow and grit so sharply on it in the more than usually frosty mornings in the days gone by  the trees have lost their white patches and the clump of willows that used to look like islands in the prairie have disappeared as the carpeting that gave them prominence has dissolved  the aspect of everything in the isolated settlement has changed  the winter is gone and spring bright beautiful hilarious springhas come again  by those who have never known an arctic winter the delights of an arctic spring can never we fear be fully appreciated or understood contrast is one of its strongest elements indeed we might say the element which gives to all the others peculiar zest  life in the arctic regions is like one of turners pictures in which the lights are strong the shadows deep and the tout ensemble hazy and romantic  so cold and prolonged is the winter that the first mild breath of spring breaks on the senses like a zephyr from the plains of paradise everything bursts suddenly into vigorous life after the long deathlike sleep of nature as little children burst into the romping gaieties of a new day after the deep repose of a long and tranquil night  the snow melts the ice breaks up and rushes in broken masses heaving and tossing in the rising flood that grind and whirl them into the ocean or into those great freshwater lakes that vie with ocean itself in magnitude and grandeur  the buds come out and the leaves appear clothing all nature with a bright refreshing green which derives additional brilliancy from sundry patches of snow that fill the deep creeks and hollows everywhere and form ephemeral fountains whose waters continue to supply a thousand rills for many a long day until the fierce glare of the summer sun prevails at last and melts them all away  red river flows on now to mix its longpentup waters with lake winnipeg  boats are seen rowing about upon its waters as the settlers travel from place to place and wooden canoes made of the hollowedout trunks of large trees shoot across from shore to shorethese canoes being a substitute for bridges of which there are none although the settlement lies on both sides of the river  birds have now entered upon the scene their wild cries and ceaseless flight adding to it a cheerful activity  ground squirrels pop up out of their holes to bask their round fat beautifullystriped little bodies in the sun or to gaze in admiration at the farmer as he urges a pair of very slowgoing oxen that drag the plough at a pace which induces one to believe that the wide field may possibly be ploughed up by the end of next year  frogs whistle in the marshy ground so loudly that men new to the country believe they are being regaled by the songs of millions of birds  there is no mistake about their whistle  it is not merely like a whistle but it is a whistle shrill and continuous and as the swamps swarm with these creatures the song never ceases for a moment although each individual frog creates only one little gush of music composed of half a dozen trills and then stops a moment for breath before commencing the second bar  bullfrogs too though not so numerous help to vary the sound by croaking vociferously as if they understood the value of bass and were glad of having an opportunity to join in the universal hum of life and joy which rises everywhere from the river and the swamp the forest and the prairie to welcome back the spring  such was the state of things in red river one beautiful morning in april when a band of voyageurs lounged in scattered groups about the front gate of fort garry  they were as fine a set of picturesque manly fellows as one could desire to see  their mode of life rendered them healthy hardy and goodhumoured with a strong dash of recklessness perhaps too much of itin some of the younger men  being descended generally from frenchcanadian sires and indian mothers they united some of the good and not a few of the bad qualities of both mentally as well as physicallycombining the light gayhearted spirit and full muscular frame of the canadian with the fierce passions and active habits of the indian  and this wildness of disposition was not a little fostered by the nature of their usual occupations  they were employed during a great part of the year in navigating the hudsons bay companys boats laden with furs and goods through the labyrinth of rivers and lakes that stud and intersect the whole continent or they were engaged in pursuit of the bisons these animals are always called buffaloes by american hunters and furtraders which roam the prairies in vast herds  they were dressed in the costume of the country most of them wore lightblue cloth capotes girded tightly round them by scarlet or crimson worsted belts  some of them had blue and others scarlet cloth leggings ornamented more or less with stained porcupine quills coloured silk or variegated beads while some might be seen clad in the leathern coats of winterdeerskin dressed like chamois leather fringed all round with little tails and ornamented much in the same way as those already described  the heavy winter moccasins and duffel socks which gave to their feet the appearance of being afflicted with gout were now replaced by moccasins of a lighter and more elegant character having no socks below and fitting tightly to the feet like gloves some wore hats similar to those made of silk or beaver which are worn by ourselves in britain but so bedizened with scarlet cocktail feathers and silver cords and tassels as to leave the original form of the headdress a matter of great uncertainty  these hats however are only used on high occasions and chiefly by the fops  most of the men wore coarse blue cloth caps with peaks and not a few discarded headpieces altogether under the impression apparently that nature had supplied a covering which was in itself sufficient  these costumes varied not only in character but in quality according to the circumstances of the wearer some being highly ornamental and mendedevincing the felicity of the owner in the possession of a good wifewhile others were soiled and torn or but slightly ornamented  the voyageurs were collected as we have said in groups  here stood a dozen of the youngest consequently the most noisy and showily dressedlaughing loudly gesticulating violently and bragging tremendously  near to them were collected a number of sterner spiritsmen of middle age with all the energy and muscle and bone of youth but without its swaggering hilarity men whose powers and nerves had been tried over and over again amid the stirring scenes of a voyageurs life men whose heads were cool and eyes sharp and hands ready and powerful in the mad whirl of boiling rapids in the sudden attack of wild beast and hostile man or in the unexpected approach of any danger men who having been well tried needed not to boast and who having carried off triumphantly their respective brides many years ago needed not to decorate their persons with the absurd finery that characterised their younger brethren  they were comparatively few in number but they composed a sterling band of which every man was a hero  among them were those who occupied the high positions of bowman and steersman and when we tell the reader that on these two men frequently hangs the safety of a boat with all its crew and lading it will be easily understood how needful it is that they should be men of iron nerve and strength of mind  boattravelling in those regions is conducted in a way that would astonish most people who dwell in the civilised quarters of the globe the country being intersected in all directions by great lakes and rivers these have been adopted as the most convenient highways along which to convey the supplies and bring back the furs from outposts rivers in america however as in other parts of the world are distinguished by sudden ebullitions and turbulent points of character in the shape of rapids falls and cataracts up and down which neither men nor boats can by any possibility go with impunity consequently on arriving at such obstructions the cargoes are carried overland to navigable water above or below the falls as the case may be then the boats are dragged over and launched again reloaded and the travellers proceed  this operation is called making a portage and as these portages vary from twelve yards to twelve miles in length it may be readily conceived that a voyageurs life is not an easy one by any means  this however is only one of his difficulties  rapids occur which are not so dangerous as to make a portage necessary but are sufficiently turbulent to render the descent of them perilous  in such cases the boats being lightened of part of their cargo are ran down and frequently they descend with full cargoes and crews  it is then that the whole management of each boat devolves upon its bowman and steersman  the rest of the crew or middlemen as they are called merely sit still and look on or give a stroke with their oars if required while the steersman with powerful sweeps of his heavy oar directs the flying boat as it bounds from surge to surge like a thing of life and the bowman stands erect in front to assist in directing his comrade at the stern having a strong and long pole in his hands with which ever and anon he violently forces the boats head away from sunken rocks against which it might otherwise strike and be stove in capsized or seriously damaged  besides the groups already enumerated there were one or two others composed of grave elderly men whose wrinkled brows grey hairs and slow quiet step showed that the strength of their days was past although their upright figures and warm brown complexions gave promise of their living to see many summers still  these were the principal steersmen and old guidesmen of renown to whom the others bowed as oracles or looked up to as fathers men whose youth and manhood had been spent in roaming the trackless wilderness and who were therefore eminently qualified to guide brigades through the length and breadth of the land men whose power of threading their way among the perplexing intricacies of the forest had become a second nature a kind of instinct that was as sure of attaining its end as the instinct of the feathered tribes which brings the swallow after a long absence with unerring certainty back to its former haunts again in spring    chapter seven  the store  at whatever establishment in the furtraders dominions you may chance to alight you will find a particular building which is surrounded by a halo of interest towards which there seems to be a general leaning on the part of everybody especially of the indians and with which are connected in the minds of all the most stirring reminiscences and pleasing associations  this is the tradingstore  it is always recognisable if natives are in the neighbourhood by the bevy of red men that cluster round it awaiting the coming of the storekeeper or the trader with that stoic patience which is peculiar to indians  it may be further recognised by a close observer by the soiled condition of its walls occasioned by loungers rubbing their backs perpetually against it and the peculiar dinginess round the keyhole caused by frequent applications of the key which renders it conspicuous beyond all its comrades  here is contained that which makes the red mans life enjoyable that which causes his heart to leap and induces him to toil for months and months together in the heat of summer and amid the frost and snow of winter that which actually accomplishes what music is said to achieve the soothing of the savage breast in short here are stored up blankets guns powder shot kettles axes and knives twine for nets vermilion for warpaint fishhooks and scalpingknives capotes cloth beads needles and a host of miscellaneous articles much too numerous to mention  here also occur periodical scenes of bustle and excitement when bands of natives arrive from distant huntinggrounds laden with rich furs which are speedily transferred to the hudsons bay companys stores in exchange for the goods aforementioned  and many a tough wrangle has the trader on such occasions with sharp natives who might have graduated in billingsgate so close are they at a bargain  here too voyageurs are supplied with an equivalent for their wages part in advance if they desire it and they generally do desire it and part at the conclusion of their long and arduous voyages  it is to one of these stores reader that we wish to introduce you now that you may witness the men of the north brigade receive their advances  the store at fort garry stands on the right of the fort as you enter by the front gate  its interior resembles that of the other stores in the country being only a little larger  a counter encloses a space sufficiently wide to admit a dozen men and serves to keep back those who are more eager than the rest  inside this counter at the time we write of stood our friend peter mactavish who was the presiding genius of the scene  shut the door now and lock it said peter in an authoritative tone after eight or ten young voyageurs had crushed into the space in front of the counter  ill not supply you with so much as an ounce of tobacco if you let in another man  peter needed not to repeat the command  three or four stalwart shoulders were applied to the door which shut with a bang like a cannonshot and the key was turned  come now antoine began the trader weve lots to do and not much time to do it in so pray look sharp  antoine however was not to be urged on so easily  he had been meditating deeply all morning on what he should purchase  moreover he had a sweetheart and of course he had to buy something for her before setting out on his travels  besides antoine was six feet high and broad shouldered and well made with a dark face and glossy black hair and he entertained a notion that there were one or two points in his costume which required to be carefully rectified ere he could consider that he had attained to perfection so he brushed the long hair off his forehead crossed his arms and gazed around him  come now antoine said peter throwing a green blanket at him i know you want that to begin with  whats the use of thinking so long about it eh  and that too he added throwing him a blue cloth capote  anything else  oui oui monsieur cried antoine as he disengaged himself from the folds of the coat which peter had thrown over his head  tabac monsieur tabac  oh to be sure cried peter  i might have guessed that that was uppermost in your mind  well how much will you have  peter began to unwind the fragrant weed off a coil of most appalling size and thickness which looked like a snake of endless length  will that do and he flourished about four feet of the snake before the eyes of the voyageur  antoine accepted the quantity and young harry somerville entered the articles against him in a book  anything more antoine said the trader  ah some beads and silks eh  oho antoineby the way louis have you seen annette lately  peter turned to another voyageur when he put this question and the voyageur gave a broad grin as he replied in the affirmative while antoine looked a little confused  he did not care much however for jesting  so after getting one or two more articlesnot forgetting half a dozen clay pipes and a few yards of gaudy calico which called forth from peter a second reference to annettehe bundled up his goods and made way for another comrade  louis peltier one of the principal guides and a man of importance therefore now stood forward  he was probably about fortyfive years of age had a plain olivecoloured countenance surrounded by a mass of long jetblack hair which he inherited along with a pair of dark piercing eyes from his indian mother and a robust heavy yet active frame which bore a strong resemblance to what his canadian fathers had been many years before  his arms in particular were of herculean mould with large swelling veins and stronglymarked muscles  they seemed in fact just formed for the purpose of pulling the heavy sweep of an inland boat among strong rapids  his face combined an expression of stern resolution with great goodhumour and truly his countenance did not belie him for he was known among his comrades as the most courageous and at the same time the most peaceable man in the settlement  louis peltier was singular in possessing the latter quality for assuredly the halfbreeds whatever other good points they boast cannot lay claim to very gentle or dovelike dispositions  his grey capote and blue leggings were decorated with no unusual ornaments and the scarlet belt which encircled his massive figure was the only bit of colour he displayed  the younger men fell respectfully into the rear as louis stepped forward and begged pardon for coming so early in the day  mais monsieur he said i have to look after the boats today and get them ready for a start tomorrow  peter mactavish gave louis a hearty shake of the hand before proceeding to supply his wants which were simple and moderate excepting in the article of tabac in the use of which he was immoderate being an inveterate smoker so that a considerable portion of the snake had to be uncoiled for his benefit  fond as ever of smoking louis said peter mactavish as he handed him the coil  oui monsieurvery fond answered the guide smelling the weed  ah this is very good  i must take a good supply this voyage because i lost the half of my roll last year and the guide gave a sigh as he thought of the overwhelming bereavement  lost the half of it louis said mactavish  why how was that  you must have lost more than half your spirits with it  ah oui i lost all my spirits and my comrade francois at the same time  dear me exclaimed the clerk bustling about the store while the guide continued to talk  oui monsieur oui  i lost him and my tabac and my spirits and very nearly my life all in one moment  why how came that about said peter pausing in his work and laying a handful of pipes on the counter  ah monsieur it was very sad merci monsieur merci thirty pipes if you please and i thought at the time that i should give up my voyageur life and remain altogether in the settlement with my old woman  mais monsieur that was not possible  when i spoke of it to my old woman she called me an old woman and you know monsieur that two old women never could live together in peace for twelve months under the same roof  so here i am you see ready again for the voyage  the voyageurs who had drawn round louis when he alluded to an anecdote which they had often heard before but were never weary of hearing over again laughed loudly at this sally and urged the guide to relate the story to monsieur who nothing loath to suspend his operations for a little leaned his arms on the counter and saidtell us all about it louis i am anxious to know how you managed to come by so many losses all at one time  bien monsieur i shall soon relate it for the story is very short  harry somerville who was entering the pipes in louiss account had just set down the figures 30 when louis cleared his throat to begin not having the mental fortitude to finish the line he dropped his pen sprang off his stool which he upset in so doing jumped up sittingways upon the counter and gazed with breathless interest into the guides face as he spoke  it was on a cold wet afternoon said louis that we were descending the hill river at a part of the rapids where there is a sharp bend in the stream and two or three great rocks that stand up in front of the water as it plunges over a ledge as if they were put there a purpose to catch it and split it up into foam or to stop the boats and canoes that try to run the rapids and cut them up into splinters  it was an ugly place monsieur i can tell you and though ive run it again and again i always hold my breath tighter when we get to the top and breathe freer when we get to the bottom  well there was a chum of mine at the bow francois by name and a fine fellow he was as i ever came across  he used to sleep with me at night under the same blanket although it was somewhat inconvenient for being as big as myself and a stone heavier it was all we could do to make the blanket cover us however he and i were great friends and we managed it somehow  well he was at the bow when we took the rapids and a firstrate bowman he made  his pole was twice as long and twice as thick as any other pole in the boat and he twisted it about just like a fiddlestick  i remember well the night before we came to the rapids as he was sitting by the fire which was blazing up among the pine branches that overhung us he said that he wanted a good pole for the rapids next day and with that he jumped up laid hold of an axe and went back into the woods a bit to get one  when he returned he brought a young tree on his shoulder which he began to strip of its branches and bark  louis says he this is hot work give us a pipe  so i rummaged about for some tobacco but found there was none left in my bag so i went to my kit and got out my roll about three fathoms or so and cutting half of it off i went to the fire and twisted it round his neck by way of a joke and he said hed wear it as a necklace all nightand so he did too and forgot to take it off in the morning and when we came near the rapids i couldnt get at my bag to stow it away so says i francois youll have to run with it on for i cant stop to stow it now  all right says he go ahead and just as he said it we came in sight of the first run foaming and boiling like a kettle of robbiboo  take care lads i cried and the next moment we were dashing down towards the bend in the river  as we came near to the shoot i saw francois standing up on the gunwale to get a better view of the rocks ahead and every now and then giving me a signal with his hand how to steer suddenly he gave a shout and plunged his long pole into the water to fend off from a rock which a swirl in the stream had concealed  for a second or two his pole bent like a willow and we could feel the heavy boat jerk off a little with the tremendous strain but all at once the pole broke off short with a crack francois heels made a flourish in the air and then he disappeared head foremost into the foaming water with my tobacco coiled round his neck  as we flew past the place one of his arms appeared and i made a grab at it and caught him by the sleeve but the effort upset myself and over i went too  fortunately however one of my men caught me by the foot and held on like a vice but the force of the current tore francois sleeve out of my grasp and i was dragged into the boat again just in time to see my comrades legs and arms going like the sails of a windmill as he rolled over several times and disappeared  well we put ashore the moment we got into still water and then five or six of us started off on foot to look for francois  after half an hours search we found him pitched upon a flat rock in the middle of the stream like a bit of driftwood  we immediately waded out to the rock and brought him ashore where we lighted a fire took off all his clothes and rubbed him till he began to show signs of life again  but you may judge mes garcons of my misery when i found that the coil of tobacco was gone  it had come off his neck during his struggles and there wasnt a vestige of it left except a bright red mark on the throat where it had nearly strangled him  when he began to recover he put his hand up to his neck as if feeling for something and muttered faintly the tabac  ah morbleu said i you may say that  where is it  well we soon brought him round but he had swallowed so much water that it damaged his lungs and we had to leave him at the next post we came to and so i lost my friend too  did francois get better said charley kennedy in a voice of great concern  charley had entered the store by another door just as the guide began his story and had listened to it unobserved with breathless interest  recover  oh oui monsieur he soon got well again  oh im so glad cried charley  but i lost him for that voyage added the guide and i lost my tabac for ever  you must take better care of it this time louis said peter mactavish as he resumed his work  that i shall monsieur replied louis shouldering his goods and quitting the store while a short slim active little canadian took his place  now then baptiste said mactavish you want a  blanket monsieur  good  and  a capote monsieur  and  an axe  stop stop shouted harry somerville from his desk  heres an entry in louiss account that i cant make out30 something or other what can it have been  how often said mactavish going up to him with a look of annoyancehow often have i told you mr somerville not to leave an entry half finished on any account  i didnt know that i left it so said harry twisting his features and scratching his head in great perplexity  what can it have been 30 30not blankets eh  harry was becoming banteringly bitter he couldnt have got thirty guns could he or thirty knives or thirty copper kettles  perhaps it was thirty pounds of tea suggested charley  no doubt it was thirty pipes said peter mactavish  oh that was it cried harry that was it thirty pipes to be sure what an ass i am  and pray what is that said mactavish pointing sarcastically to an entry in the previous account5 yards of superfine annette  really mr somerville i wish you would pay more attention to your work and less to the conversation  oh dear cried harry becoming almost hysterical under the combined effects of chagrin at making so many mistakes and suppressed merriment at the idea of selling annettes by the yard  oh dear me  harry could say no more but stuffed his handkerchief into his mouth and turned away  well sir said the offended peter when you have laughed to your entire satisfaction we will go on with our work if you please  all right cried harry suppressing his feelings with a strong effort what next  just then a tall rawboned man entered the store and rudely thrusting baptiste aside asked if he could get his supplies now  no said mactavish sharply youll take your turn like the rest  the newcomer was a native of orkney a country from which and the neighbouring islands the fur company almost exclusively recruits its staff of labourers  these men are steady useful servants although inclined to be slow and lazy at first but they soon get used to the country and rapidly improve under the example of the active canadians and halfbreeds with whom they associate  some of them are the best servants the company possess  hugh mathison however was a very bad specimen of the race being rough and coarse in his manners and very lazy withal  upon receiving the traders answer hugh turned sulkily on his heel and strode towards the door  now it happened that baptistes bundle lay just behind him and on turning to leave the place he tripped over it and stumbled whereat the voyageurs burst into an ironical laugh for hugh was not a favourite  confound your trash he cried giving the little bundle a kick that scattered everything over the floor  crapaud said baptiste between his set teeth while his eyes flashed angrily and he stood up before hugh with clinched fists what mean you by that eh  the big scotchman held his little opponent in contempt so that instead of putting himself on the defensive he leaned his back against the door thrust his hands into his pockets and requested to know what that was to him  baptiste was not a man of many words and this reply coupled with the insolent sneer with which it was uttered caused him to plant a sudden and welldirected blow on the point of hughs nose which flattened it on his face and brought the back of his head into violent contact with the door  well done shouted the men bravo baptiste  regardez le nez mes enfants  hold cried mactavish vaulting the counter and intercepting hugh as he rushed upon his antagonist no fighting here you blackguards  if you want to do that go outside the fort and peter opening the door thrust the orkneyman out  in the meantime baptiste gathered up his goods and left the store in company with several of his friends vowing that he would wreak his vengeance on the gros chien before the sun should set  he had not long to wait however for just outside the gate he found hugh still smarting under the pain and indignity of the blow and ready to pounce upon him like a cat on a mouse  baptiste instantly threw down his bundle and prepared for battle by discarding his coat  every nation has its own peculiar method of fighting and its own ideas of what is honourable and dishonourable in combat  the english as every one knows have particularly stringent rules regarding the part of the body which may or may not be hit with propriety and count it foul disgrace to strike a man when he is down although by some strange perversity of reasoning they deem it right and fair to fall upon him while in this helpless condition and burst him if possible  the scotchman has less of the science and we are half inclined to believe that he would go the length of kicking a fallen opponent but on this point we are not quite positive  in regard to the style adopted by the halfbreeds however we have no doubt  they fight any way and every way without reference to rules at all and really although we may bring ourselves into contempt by admitting the fact we think they are quite right  no doubt the best course of action is not to fight but if a man does find it necessary to do so surely the wisest plan is to get it over at once as the dentist suggested to his timorous patient and to do it in the most effectual manner  be this as it may baptiste flew at hugh and alighted upon him not head first or fist first or feet first or anything first but altogether in a heap as it were fist feet knees nails and teeth all taking effect at one and the same time with a force so irresistible that the next moment they both rolled in the dust together  for a minute or so they struggled and kicked like a couple of serpents and then bounding to their feet again they began to perform a wardance round each other revolving their fists at the same time in we presume the most approved fashion  owing to his bulk and natural laziness which rendered jumping about like a jackinthebox impossible hugh mathison preferred to stand on the defensive while his lighter opponent giving way to the natural bent of his mercurial temperament and corporeal predilections comported himself in a manner that cannot be likened to anything mortal or immortal human or inhuman unless it be to an insane cat whose veins ran wildfire instead of blood  or perhaps we might liken him to that ingenious piece of firework called a zigzag cracker which explodes with unexpected and repeated suddenness changing its position in a most perplexing manner at every crack  baptiste after the first onset danced backwards with surprising lightness glaring at his adversary the while and rapidly revolving his fists as before mentioned then a terrific yell was heard his head arms and legs became a sort of whirling conglomerate the spot on which he danced was suddenly vacant and at the same moment mathison received a bite a scratch a dab on the nose and a kick on the stomach all at once  feeling that it was impossible to plant a welldirected blow on such an assailant he waited for the next onslaught and the moment he saw the explosive object flying through the air towards him he met it with a crack of his heavy fist which happening to take effect in the middle of the chest drove it backwards with about as much velocity as it had approached and poor baptiste measured his length on the ground  oh pauvre chien cried the spectators cest fini  not yet cried baptiste as he sprang with a scream to his feet again and began his dance with redoubled energy just as if all that had gone before was a mere sketcha sort of playful rehearsal as it were of what was now to follow  at this moment hugh stumbled over a canoe paddle and fell headlong into baptistes arms as he was in the very act of making one of his violent descents  this unlookedfor occurrence brought them both to a sudden pause partly from necessity and partly from surprise  out of this state baptiste recovered first and taking advantage of the accident threw mathison heavily to the ground  he rose quickly however and renewed the fight with freshened vigour  just at this moment a passionate growl was heard and old mr kennedy rushed out of the fort in a towering rage  now mr kennedy had no reason whatever for being angry  he was only a visitor at the fort and so had no concern in the behaviour of those connected with it  he was not even in the companys service now and could not therefore lay claim as one of its officers to any right to interfere with its men  but mr kennedy never acted much from reason impulse was generally his guidingstar  he had moreover been an absolute monarch and a commander of men for many years past in his capacity of furtrader  being as we have said a powerful fiery man he had ruled very much by means of brute forcea species of suasion by the way which is too common among many of the gentlemen  in the employment of the hudsons bay company  on hearing therefore that the men were fighting in front of the fort mr kennedy rushed out in a towering rage  oh you precious blackguards he cried running up to the combatants while with flashing eyes he gazed first at one and then at the other as if uncertain on which to launch his ire  have you no place in the world to fight but hereeh blackguards  o monsieur said baptiste lowering his hands and assuming that politeness of demeanour which seems inseparable from french blood however much mixed with baser fluid i was just giving that dog a thrashing monsieur  go cried mr kennedy in a voice of thunder turning to hugh who still stood in a pugilistic attitude with very little respect in his looks  hugh hesitated to obey the order but mr kennedy continued to advance grinding his teeth and working his fingers convulsively as if belonged to lay violent hold of the orkneymans swelled nose so he retreated in his uncertainty but still with his face to the foe  as has been already said the assiniboine river flows within a hundred yards of the gate of fort garry  the two men in their combat had approached pretty near to the bank at a place where it descends somewhat precipitately into the stream  it was towards this bank that hugh mathison was now retreating crab fashion followed by mr kennedy and both of them so taken up with each other that neither perceived the fact until hughs heel struck against a stone just at the moment that mr kennedy raised his clinched fist in a threatening attitude  the effect of this combination was to pitch the poor man head over heels down the bank into a row of willow bushes through which as he rolled with great speed he went with a loud crash and shot head first like a startled alligator into the water amid a roar of laughter from his comrades and the people belonging to the fort most of whom attracted by the fight were now assembled on the banks of the river  mr kennedys wrath vanished immediately and he joined in the laughter but his face instantly changed when he beheld hugh sputtering in deep water and heard some one say that he could not swim  what cant swim he exclaimed running down the bank to the edge of the water  baptiste was before him however  in a moment he plunged in up to the neck stretched forth his arm grasped hugh by the hair and dragged him to the land    chapter eight  farewell to katedeparture of the brigadecharley becomes a voyageur  on the following day at noon the spot on which the late combat had taken place became the theatre of a stirring and animated scene  fort garry and the space between it and the river swarmed with voyageurs dressed in their cleanest newest and most brilliant costume  the large boats for the north six in number lay moored to the rivers bank laden with bales of furs and ready to start on their long voyage young men who had never been on the road before stood with animated looks watching the operations of the guides as they passed critical examination upon their boats overhauled the oars to see that they were in good condition or with crooked knives a species of instrument in the use of which voyageurs and natives are very expert polished off the top of a mast the blade of an oar or the handle of a tiller  old men who had passed their lives in similar occupations looked on in silencesome standing with their heads bent on their bosoms and an expression of sadness about their faces as if the scene recalled some mournful event of their early life or possibly reminded them of wild joyous scenes of other days when the blood coursed warmly in their young veins and the strong muscles sprang lightly to obey their will when the work they had to do was hard and the sleep that followed it was soundscenes and days that were now gone by for ever  others reclined against the wooden fence their arms crossed their thin white hair waving gently in the breeze and a kind smile playing on their sunburned faces as they observed the swagger and coxcombry of the younger men or watched the gambols of several darkeyed little childrenembryo buffalohunters and voyageurswhose mothers had brought them to the fort to get a last kiss from papa and witness the departure of the boats  several tender scenes were going on in outoftheway placesin angles of the walls and bastions or behind the gatesbetween youthful couples about to be separated for a season  interesting scenes these of pathos and pleasantrya combination of soft glances and affectionate fervent assurances alternate embraces that were apparently received with reluctance but actually with delight and proffers of pieces of calico and beads and other trinkets received both apparently and actually with extreme satisfaction as souvenirs of happy days that were past and pledges of unalterable constancy and bright hopes in days that were yet to come  a little apart from the others a youth and a girl might be seen sauntering slowly towards the copse beyond the stable  these were charley kennedy and his sister kate who had retired from the bustling scene to take a last short walk together ere they separated it might be for years perhaps for ever  charley held kates hand while her sweet little head rested on his shoulder  o charley charley my own dear darling charley im quite miserable and you ought not to go away its very wrong and i dont mind a bit what you say i shall die if you leave me  and kate pressed him tightly to her heart and sobbed in the depth of her woe  now kate my darling dont go on so  you know i cant help it  i dont know cried kate interrupting him and speaking vehementlyi dont know and i dont believe and i dont care for anything at all its very hardhearted of you and wrong and not right and im just quite wretched  poor kate was undoubtedly speaking the absolute truth for a more disconsolate and wretched look of woebegone misery was never seen on so sweet and tender and lovable a little face before  her blue eyes swam in two lakes of pure crystal that overflowed continually her mouth which was usually round had become an elongated oval and her nutbrown hair fell in dishevelled masses over her soft cheeks  o charley she continued why wont you stay  listen to me dearest kate said charley in a very husky voice its too late to draw back now even if i wished to do so and you dont consider darling that ill be back again soon  besides im a man now kate and i must make my own bread  who ever heard of a man being supported by his old father  well but you can do that here  now dont interrupt me kate said charley kissing her forehead im quite satisfied with two short legs and have no desire whatever to make my bread on the top of three long ones  besides you know i can write to you  but you wont youll forget  no indeed i will not  ill write you long letters about all that i see and do and you shall write long letters to me about  stop charley cried kate i wont listen to you  i hate to think of it  and her tears burst forth again with fresh violence  this time charleys heart sank too  the lump in his throat all but choked him so he was fain to lay his head upon kates heaving bosom and weep along with her  for a few minutes they remained silent when a slight rustling in the bushes was heard  in another moment a tall broadshouldered gentlemanly man dressed in black stood before them  charley and kate on seeing this personage arose and wiping the tears from their eyes gave a sad smile as they shook hands with their clergyman  my poor children said mr addison affectionately i know well why your hearts are sad  may god bless and comfort you  i saw you enter the wood and came to bid you farewell charley my dear boy as i shall not have another opportunity of doing so  o dear mr addison cried kate grasping his hand in both of hers and gazing imploringly up at him through a perfect wilderness of ringlets and tears do prevail upon charley to stay at home please do  mr addison could scarcely help smiling at the poor girls extreme earnestness  i fear my sweet child that it is too late now to attempt to dissuade charley  besides he goes with the consent of his father and i am inclined to think that a change of life for a short time may do him good  come kate cheer up  charley will return to us again ere long improved i trust both physically and mentally  kate did not cheer up but she dried her eyes and endeavoured to look more composed while mr addison took charley by the hand and as they walked slowly through the wood gave him much earnest advice and counsel  the clergymans manner was peculiar  with a large warm generous heart he possessed an enthusiastic nature a quick brusque manner and a loud voice which when his spirit was influenced by the strong emotions of pity or anxiety for the souls of his flock sank into a deep soft bass of the most thrilling earnestness  he belonged to the church of england but conducted service very much in the presbyterian form as being more suited to his mixed congregation  after a long conversation with charley he concluded by saying  i do not care to say much to you about being kind and obliging to all whom you may meet with during your travels nor about the dangers to which you will be exposed by being thrown into the company of wild and reckless perhaps very wicked men  there is but one incentive to every good and one safeguard against all evil my boy and that is the love of god  you may perhaps forget much that i have said to you but remember this charley if you would be happy in this world and have a good hope for the next centre your hearts affection on our blessed lord jesus christ for believe me boy his hearts affection is centred upon you  as mr addison spoke a loud hollo from mr kennedy apprised them that their time was exhausted and that the boats were ready to start charley sprang towards kate locked her in a long passionate embrace and then forgetting mr addison altogether in his haste ran out of the wood and hastened towards the scene of departure  goodbye charley cried harry somerville running up to his friend and giving him a warm grasp of the hand  dont forget me charley  i wish i were going with you with all my heart but im an unlucky dog goodbye  the senior clerk and peter mactavish had also a kindly word and a cheerful farewell for him as he hurried past  goodbye charley my lad said old mr kennedy in an excessively loud voice as if by such means he intended to crush back some unusual but very powerful feelings that had a peculiar influence on a certain lump in his throat  goodbye my lad dont forget to write to your oldhang it said the old man brushing his coatsleeve somewhat violently across his eyes and turning abruptly round as charley left him and sprang into the boati say grant iiwhat are you staring at eh  the latter part of his speech was addressed in an angry tone to an innocent voyageur who happened accidentally to confront him at the moment  come along kennedy said mr grant interposing and grasping his excited friend by the armcome with me  ah to be sureyes said he looking over his shoulder and waving a last adieu to charley  goodbye god bless you my dear boyi say grant come along quick man and lets have a pipeyes lets have a pipe  mr kennedy essaying once more to crush back his rebellious feelings strode rapidly up the bank and entering the house sought to overwhelm his sorrow in smoke in which attempt he failed    chapter nine  the voyagethe encampmenta surprise  it was a fine sight to see the boats depart for the north  it was a thrilling heartstirring sight to behold these picturesque athletic men on receiving the word of command from their guides spring lightly into the long heavy boats to see them let the oars fall into the water with a loud splash and then taking their seats give way with a will knowing that the eyes of friends and sweethearts and rivals were bent earnestly upon them  it was a splendid sight to see boat after boat shoot out from the landingplace and cut through the calm bosom of the river as the men bent their sturdy backs until the thick oars creaked and groaned on the gunwales and flashed in the stream more and more vigorously at each successive stroke until their friends on the bank who were anxious to see the last of them had to run faster and faster in order to keep up with them as the rowers warmed at their work and made the water gurgle at the bowstheir bright blue and scarlet and white trappings reflected in the dark waters in broken masses of colour streaked with long lines of shining ripples as if they floated on a lake of liquid rainbows  and it was a glorious thing to hear the wild plaintive song led by one clear sonorous voice that rang out full and strong in the still air while at the close of every two lines the whole brigade burst into a loud enthusiastic chorus that rolled far and wide over the smooth waterstelling of their approach to settlers beyond the reach of vision in advance and floating faintly back a last farewell to the listening ears of fathers mothers wives and sisters left behind  and it was interesting to observe how as the rushing boats sped onwards past the cottages on shore groups of men and women and children stood before the open doors and waved adieu while ever and anon a solitary voice rang louder than the others in the chorus and a pair of dark eyes grew brighter as a voyageur swept past his home and recognised his little ones screaming farewell and seeking to attract their sires attention by tossing their chubby arms or flourishing round their heads the bright vermilion blades of canoe paddles  it was interesting too to hear the men shout as they ran a small rapid which occurs about the lower part of the settlement and dashed in full career up to the lower fortwhich stands about twenty miles down the river from fort garryand then sped onward again with unabated energy until they passed the indian settlement with its scattered wooden buildings and its small church passed the last cottage on the bank passed the low swampy land at the rivers mouth and emerged at last as evening closed upon the wide calm sealike bosom of lake winnipeg  charley saw and heard all this during the whole of that long exciting afternoon and as he heard and saw it his heart swelled as if it would burst its prisonbars his voice rang out wildly in the choruses regardless alike of tune and time and his spirit boiled within him as he quaffed the first sweet draught of a rovers lifea life in the woods the wild free enchanting woods where all appeared in his eyes bright and sunny and green and beautiful  as the suns last rays sank in the west and the clouds losing their crimson hue began gradually to fade into grey the boats heads were turned landward  in a few seconds they grounded on a low point covered with small trees and bushes which stretched out into the lake  here louis peltier had resolved to bivouac for the night  now then mes garcons he exclaimed leaping ashore and helping to drag the boat a little way on to the beach vite vite a terre a terretake the kettle pierre and lets have supper  pierre needed no second bidding  he grasped a large tin kettle and an axe with which he hurried into a clump of trees  laying down the kettle which he had previously filled with water from the lake he singled out a dead tree and with three powerful blows of his axe brought it to the ground  a few additional strokes cut it up into logs varying from three to five feet in length which he piled together first placing a small bundle of dry grass and twigs beneath them and a few splinters of wood which he cut from off one of the logs  having accomplished this pierre took a flint and steel out of a gaily ornamented pouch which depended from his waist and which went by the name of a firebag in consequence of its containing the implements for procuring that element  it might have been as appropriately named tobaccobag or smokingbag however seeing that such things had more to do with it if possible than fire  having struck a spark which he took captive by means of a piece of tinder he placed it in the centre of a very dry handful of soft grass and whirled it rapidly round his head thereby producing a current of air which blew the spark into a flame which when applied lighted the grass and twigs and so in a few minutes a blazing fire roared up among the treesspouted volumes of sparks into the air like a gigantic squib which made it quite a marvel that all the bushes in the neighbourhood were not burnt up at onceglared out red and fierce upon the rippling water until it became as it were red hot in the neighbourhood of the boats and caused the night to become suddenly darker by contrast the night reciprocating the compliment as it grew later by causing the space around the fire to glow brighter and brighter until it became a brilliant chamber surrounded by walls of the blackest ebony  while pierre was thus engaged there were at least ten voyageurs similarly occupied  ten steels were made instrumental in creating ten sparks which were severally captured by ten pieces of tinder and whirled round by ten lusty arms until ten flames were produced and ten fires sprang up and flared wildly on the busy scene that had a few hours before been so calm so solitary and so peaceful bathed in the soft beams of the setting sun  in less than half an hour the several camps were completed the kettles boiling over the fires the men smoking in every variety of attitude and talking loudly  it was a cheerful scene and so charley thought as he reclined in his canvas tent the opening of which faced the fire and enabled him to see all that was going on  pierre was standing over the great kettle dancing round it and making sudden plunges with a stick into it in the desperate effort to stir its boiling contentsdesperate because the fire was very fierce and large and the flames seemed to take a fiendish pleasure in leaping up suddenly just under pierres nose thereby endangering his beard or shooting out between his legs and licking round them at most unexpected moments when the light wind ought to have been blowing them quite in the opposite direction and then as he danced round to the other side to avoid them wheeling about and roaring viciously in his face until it seemed as if the poor man would be roasted long before the supper was boiled indeed what between the everchanging and violent flames the rolling smoke the steam from the kettle the showering sparks and the mans own wild grimaces and violent antics pierre seemed to charley like a raging demon who danced not only round but above and on and through and in the flames as if they were his natural element in which he took special delight  quite close to the tent the massive form of louis the guide lay extended his back supported by the stump of a tree his eyes blinking sleepily at the blaze and his beloved pipe hanging from his lips while wreaths of smoke encircled his head  louiss days work was done  few could do a better and when his work was over louis always acted on the belief that his position and his years entitled him to rest and took things very easy in consequence  six of the boats crew sat in a semicircle beside the guide and fronting the fire each paying particular attention to his pipe and talking between the puffs to any one who chose to listen  suddenly pierre vanished into the smoke and flames altogether whence in another moment he issued bearing in his hand the large tin kettle which he deposited triumphantly at the feet of his comrades  now then cried pierre  it was unnecessary to have said even that much by way of invitation voyageurs do not require to have their food pressed upon them after a hard days work  indeed it was as much as they could do to refrain from laying violent hands on the kettle long before their worthy cook considered its contents sufficiently done  charley sat in company with mr parka chief factor on his way to norway house  gibault one of the men who acted as their servant had placed a kettle of hot tea before them which with several slices of buffalo tongue a lump of pemmican and some hard biscuit and butter formed their evening meal  indeed we may add that these viands during a great part of the voyage constituted their every meal  in fact they had no variety in their fare except a wild duck or two now and then and a goose when they chanced to shoot one  charley sipped a pannikin of tea as he reclined on his blanket and being somewhat fatigued in consequence of his exertions and excitement during the day said nothing  mr park for the same reasons besides being naturally taciturn was equally mute so they both enjoyed in silence the spectacle of the men eating their supper  and it was a sight worth seeing  their food consisted of robbiboo a compound of flour pemmican and water boiled to the consistency of very thick soup  though not a species of food that would satisfy the fastidious taste of an epicure robbiboo is nevertheless very wholesome exceedingly nutritious and withal palatable  pemmican its principal component is made of buffalo flesh which fully equals some think greatly excels beef  the recipe for making it is as followsfirst kill your buffaloa matter of considerable difficulty by the way as doing so requires you to travel to the buffalogrounds to arm yourself with a gun and mount a horse on which you have to gallop perhaps several miles over rough ground and among badgerholes at the imminent risk of breaking your neck then you have to run up alongside of a buffalo and put a ball through his heart which apart from the murderous nature of the action is a difficult thing to do  but we will suppose that you have killed your buffalo  then you must skin him then cut him up and slice the flesh into layers which must be dried in the sun  at this stage of the process you have produced a substance which in the fur countries goes by the name of dried meat and is largely used as an article of food  as its name implies it is very dry and it is also very tough and very undesirable if one can manage to procure anything better  but to proceed  having thus prepared dried meat lay a quantity of it on a flat stone and take another stone with which pound it into shreds you must then take the animals hide while it is yet new and make bags of it about two feet and a half long by a foot and a half broad  into this put the pounded meat loosely  melt the fat of your buffalo over a fire and when quite liquid pour it into the bag until full mix the contents well together sew the whole up before it cools and you have a bag of pemmican of about ninety pounds weight  this forms the chief food of the voyageur in consequence of its being the largest possible quantity of sustenance compressed into the smallest possible space and in an extremely convenient portable shape  it will keep fresh for years and has been much used in consequence by the heroes of arctic discovery in their perilous journeys along the shores of the frozen sea  the voyageurs used no plates  men who travel in these countries become independent of many things that are supposed to be necessary here  they sat in a circle round the kettle each man armed with a large wooden or pewter spoon with which he ladled the robbiboo down his capacious throat in a style that not only caused charley to laugh but afterwards threw him into a deep reverie on the powers of appetite in general and the strength of voyageur stomachs in particular  at first the keen edge of appetite induced the men to eat in silence but as the contents of the kettle began to get low their tongues loosened and at last when the kettles were emptied and the pipes filled fresh logs thrown on the fires and their limbs stretched out around them the babel of english french and indian that arose was quite overwhelming  the middleaged men told long stories of what they had done the young men boasted of what they meant to do while the more aged smiled nodded smoked their pipes put in a word or two as occasion offered and listened  while they conversed the quick ears of one of the men of charleys camp detected some unusual sound  hist said he turning his head aside slightly in a listening attitude while his comrades suddenly ceased their noisy laugh  do ducks travel in canoes hereabouts said the man after a moments silence for if not theres some one about to pay us a visit  i would wager my best gun that i hear the stroke of paddles  if your ears had been sharper francois you might have heard them some time ago said the guide shaking the ashes out of his pipe and refilling it for the third time  ah louis i do not pretend to such sharp ears as you possess nor to such sharp wit either  but who do you think can be en route so late  that my wit does not enable me to divine said louis but if you have any faith in the sharpness of your eyes i would recommend you to go to the beach and see as the best and shortest way of finding out  by this time the men had risen and were peering out into the gloom in the direction whence the sound came while one or two sauntered down to the margin of the lake to meet the newcomers  who can it be i wonder said charley who had left the tent and was now standing beside the guide  difficult to say monsieur  perhaps injins though i thought there were none here just now  but im not surprised that weve attracted something to us  livin creeturs always come natrally to the light and theres plenty fire on the point tonight  rather more than enough replied charley abruptly as a slight motion of wind sent the flames curling round his head and singed off his eyelashes  why louis its my firm belief that if i ever get to the end of this journey ill not have a hair left on my head  louis smiled  o monsieur you will learn to observe things before you have been long in the wilderness  if you will edge round to leeward of the fire you cant expect it to respect you  just at this moment a loud hurrah rang through the copse and harry somerville sprang over the fire into the arms of charley who received him with a hug and a look of unutterable amazement  charley my boy  harry somerville i declare  for at least five minutes charley could not recover his composure sufficiently to declare anything else but stood with open mouth and eyes and elevated eyebrows looking at his young friend who capered and danced round the fire in a manner that threw the cooks performances in that line quite into the shade while he continued all the time to shout fragments of sentences that were quite unintelligible to any one it was evident that harry was in a state of immense delight at something unknown save to himself but which in the course of a few minutes was revealed to his wondering friends  charley im going hurrah and he leaped about in a manner that induced charley to say he would not only be going but very soon gone if he did not keep further away from the fire  yes charley im going with you  i upset the stool tilted the inkbottle over the invoicebook sent the poker almost through the back of the fireplace and smashed tom whytes best whip on the back of the noo oss as i galloped him over the plains for the last timeall for joy because im going with you charley my darling  here harry suddenly threw his arms round his friends neck meditating an embrace  as both boys were rather fond of using their muscles violently the embrace degenerated into a wrestle which caused them to threaten complete destruction to the fire as they staggered in front of it and ended in their tumbling against the tent and nearly breaking its poles and fastenings to the horror and indignation of mr park who was smoking his pipe within quietly waiting till harrys superabundant glee was over that he might get an explanation of his unexpected arrival among them  ah they will be good voyageurs cried one of the men as he looked on at this scene  oui oui good boys active lads replied the others laughing  the two boys rose hastily  yes cried harry breathless but still excited im going all the way and a great deal farther  im going to hunt buffaloes in the saskatchewan and grizzly bears in thethein fact everywhere  im going down the mackenzie riverim going mad i believe and harry gave another caper and another shout and tossed his cap high into the air  having been recklessly tossed it came down into the fire  when it went in it was dark blue but when harry dashed into the flames in consternation to save it it came out of a rich brown colour  now youngster said mr park when youve done capering i should like to ask you one or two questions  what brought you here  a canoe said harry inclined to be impudent  oh and pray for what purpose have you come here  these are my credentials handing him a letter  mr park opened the note and read  ah oh  saskatchewanhumyesoutpostwild boyjust sokeep him at itay fit for nothing else  so said mr park folding the paper i find that mr grant has sent you to take the place of a young gentleman we expected to pick up at norway house but who is required elsewhere and that he wishes you to see a good deal of rough lifeto be made a trader of in fact  is that your desire  thats the very ticket replied harry scarcely able to restrain his delight at the prospect  well then you had better get supper and turn in for youll have to begin your new life by rising at three oclock tomorrow morning  have you got a tent  yes said harry pointing to his canoe which had been brought to the fire and turned bottom up by the two indians to whom it belonged and who were reclining under its shelter enjoying their pipes and watching with looks of great gravity the doings of harry and his friend  that will return whence it came tomorrow  have you no other  oh yes said harry pointing to the overhanging branches of a willow close at hand lots more  mr park smiled grimly and turning on his heel reentered the tent and continued his pipe while harry flung himself down beside charley under the bark canoe  this species of tent is however by no means a perfect one  an indian canoe is seldom three feet broadfrequently much narrowerso that it only affords shelter for the body as far down as the waist leaving the extremities exposed  true one may double up as nearly as possible into half ones length but this is not a desirable position to maintain throughout an entire night  sometimes when the weather is very bad an additional protection is procured by leaning several poles against the bottom of the canoe on the weather side in such a way as to slope considerably over the front and over these are spread pieces of birch bark or branches and moss so as to form a screen which is an admirable shelter  but this involves too much time and labour to be adopted during a voyage and is only done when the travellers are under the necessity of remaining for some time in one place  the canoe in which harry arrived was a pretty large one and looked so comfortable when arranged for the night that charley resolved to abandon his own tent and mr parks society and sleep with his friend  ill sleep with you harry my boy said he after harry had explained to him in detail the cause of his being sent away from red river which was no other than that a young gentleman as mr park said who was to have gone had been ordered elsewhere  thats right charley spread out our blankets while i get some supper like a good fellow  harry went in search of the kettle while his friend prepared their bed  first he examined the ground on which the canoe lay and found that the two indians had already taken possession of the only level places under it  humph he ejaculated half inclined to rouse them up but immediately dismissed the idea as unworthy of a voyageur  besides charley was an amiable unselfish fellow and would rather have lain on the top of a dozen stumps than have made himself comfortable at the expense of any one else  he paused a moment to consider  on one side was a hollow that as he soliloquised to himself would break the back of a buffalo  on the other side were a dozen little stumps surrounding three very prominent ones that threatened destruction to the ribs of any one who should venture to lie there  but charley did not pause to consider long seizing his axe he laid about him vigorously with the head of it and in a few seconds destroyed all the stumps which he carefully collected and along with some loose moss and twigs put into the hollow and so filled it up  having improved things thus far he rose and strode out of the circle of light into the wood  in a few minutes he reappeared bearing a young spruce fir tree on his shoulder which with the axe he stripped of its branches  these branches were flat in form and elasticadmirably adapted for making a bed on and when charley spread them out under the canoe in a pile of about four inches in depth by four feet broad and six feet long the stumps and the hollow were overwhelmed altogether  he then ran to mr parks tent and fetched thence a small flat bundle covered with oilcloth and tied with a rope  opening this he tossed out its contents which were two large and very thick blanketsone green the other white a particularly minute feather pillow a pair of moccasins a broken comb and a bit of soap  then he opened a similar bundle containing harrys bed which he likewise tossed out and then kneeling down he spread the two white blankets on the top of the branches the two green blankets above these and the two pillows at the top as far under the shelter of the canoe as he could push them having completed the whole in a manner that would have done credit to a chambermaid he continued to sit on his knees with his hands in his pockets smiling complacently and saying capitalfirstrate  here we are charley  have a second supperdo  harry placed the smoking kettle by the head of the bed and squatting down beside it began to eat as only a boy can eat who has had nothing since breakfast  charley attacked the kettle tooas he said out of sympathy although he wasnt hungry a bit  and really for a man who was not hungry and had supped half an hour before the appetite of sympathy was wonderfully strong  but harrys powers of endurance were now exhausted  he had spent a long day of excessive fatigue and excitement and having wound it up with a heavy supper sleep began to assail him with a fell ferocity that nothing could resist  he yawned once or twice and sat on the bed blinking unmeaningly at the fire as if he had something to say to it which he could not recollect just then  he nodded violently much to his own surprise once or twice and began to address remarks to the kettle instead of to his friend  i say charley this wont do  im off to bed and suiting the action to the word he took off his coat and placed it on his pillow  he then removed his moccasins which were wet and put on a dry pair and this being all that is ever done in the way of preparation before going to bed in the woods he lay down and pulled the green blankets over him  before doing so however harry leaned his head on his hands and prayed this was the one link left of the chain of habit with which he had left home  until the period of his departure for the wild scenes of the northwest harry had lived in a quiet happy home in the west highlands of scotland where he had been surrounded by the benign influences of a family the members of which were united by the sweet bonds of christian lovebonds which were strengthened by the additional tie of amiability of disposition  from childhood he had been accustomed to the routine of a pious and wellregulated household where the bible was perused and spoken of with an interest that indicated a genuine hungering and thirsting after righteousness and where the name of jesus sounded often and sweetly on the ear  under such training harry though naturally of a wild volatile disposition was deeply and irresistibly impressed with a reverence for sacred things which now that he was thousands of miles away from his peaceful home clung to him with the force of old habit and association despite the jeers of comrades and the evil influences and ungodliness by which he was surrounded  it is true that he was not altogether unhurt by the withering indifference to god that he beheld on all sides  deep impression is not renewal of heart  but early training in the path of christian love saved him many a deadly fall  it guarded him from many of the grosser sins into which other boys who had merely broken away from the restraints of home too easily fell  it twined round himas the ivy encircles the oakwith a soft tender but powerful grasp that held him back when he was tempted to dash aside all restraint and held him up when in the weakness of his human nature he was about to fall  it exerted its benign sway over him in the silence of night when his thoughts reverted to home and during his waking hours when he wandered from scene to scene in the wide wilderness and in after years when sin prevailed and intercourse with rough men had worn off much of at least the superficial amiability of his character and to some extent blunted the finer feelings of his nature it clung faintly to him still in the memory of his mothers gentle look and tender voice and never forsook him altogether  home had a blessed and powerful influence on harry  may god bless such homes where the ruling power is love  god bless and multiply such homes in the earth  were there more of them there would be fewer heartbroken mothers to weep over the memory of the blooming manly boys they sent away to foreign climeswith trembling hearts but high hopesand never saw them more they were vessels launched upon the troubled sea of time with stout timbers firm masts and gallant sailswith all that was necessary above and below from stem to stern for battling with the billows of adverse fortune for stemming the tide of opposition for riding the storms of persecution or bounding with a press of canvas before the gales of prosperity but without the rudderwithout the guiding principle that renders the great power of plank and sail and mast available with which the vessel moves obedient to the owners will without which it drifts about with every current and sails along with every shifting wind that blows  yes may the best blessings of prosperity and peace rest on such families whose bread cast continually on the waters returns to them after many days  after harry had lain down charley who did not feel inclined for repose sauntered to the margin of the lake and sat down upon a rock  it was a beautiful calm evening  the moon shone faintly through a mass of heavy clouds casting a pale light on the waters of lake winnipeg which stretched without a ripple out to the distant horizon  the great freshwater lakes of america bear a strong resemblance to the sea in storms the waves rise mountains high and break with heavy sullen roar upon a beach composed in many places of sand and pebbles while they are so large that one not only looks out to a straight horizon but may even sail out of sight of land altogether  as charley sat resting his head on his hand and listening to the soft hiss that the ripples made upon the beach he felt all the solemnising influence that steals irresistibly over the mind as we sit on a still night gazing out upon the moonlit sea  his thoughts were sad for he thought of kate and his mother and father and the home he was now leaving  he remembered all that he had ever done to injure or annoy the dear ones he was leaving and it is strange how much alive our consciences become when we are unexpectedly or suddenly removed from those with whom we have lived and held daily intercourse  how bitterly we reproach ourselves for harsh words unkind actions and how intensely we long for one word more with them one fervent embrace to prove at once that all we have ever said or done was not meant ill and at any rate is deeply sincerely repented of now  as charley looked up into the starry sky his mind recurred to the parting words of mr addison with uplifted hands and a full heart he prayed that god would bless for jesus sake the beloved ones in red river but especially kate for whether he prayed or meditated charleys thoughts always ended with kate  a black cloud passed across the moon and reminded him that but a few hours of the night remained so hastening up to the camp again he lay gently down beside his friend and drew the green blanket over him  in the camp all was silent  the men had chosen their several beds according to fancy under the shadow of a bush or tree  the fires had burned lowso low that it was with difficulty charley as he lay could discern the recumbent forms of the men whose presence was indicated by the deep soft regular breathing of tired but healthy constitutions sometimes a stray moonbeam shot through the leaves and branches and cast a ghostlike flickering light over the scene which ever and anon was rendered more mysterious by a red flare of the fire as an ember fell blazed up for an instant and left all shrouded in greater darkness than before  at first charley continued his sad thoughts staring all the while at the red embers of the expiring fire but soon his eyes began to blink and the stumps of trees began to assume the form of voyageurs and voyageurs to look like stumps of trees  then a moonbeam darted in and mr addison stood on the other side of the fire  at this sight charley started and mr addison disappeared while the boy smiled to think how he had been dreaming while only half asleep  then kate appeared and seemed to smile on him but another ember fell and another red flame sprang up and put her to flight too  then a low sigh of wind rustled through the branches and charley felt sure that he saw kate again coming through the woods singing the low soft tune that she was so fond of singing because it was his own favourite air  but soon the air ceased the fire faded away so did the trees and the sleeping voyageurs kate last of all dissolved and charley sank into a deep untroubled slumber    chapter ten  varieties vexations and vicissitudes  life is checkeredthere is no doubt about that whatever doubts a man may entertain upon other subjects he can have none upon this we feel quite certain  in fact so true is it that we would not for a moment have drawn the readers attention to it here were it not that our experience of life in the backwoods corroborates the truth and truth however well corroborated is none the worse of getting a little additional testimony now and then in this sceptical generation  life is checkered then undoubtedly  and life in the backwoods strengthens the proverb for it is a peculiarly striking and remarkable specimen of lifes variegated character  there is a difference between sailing smoothly along the shores of lake winnipeg with favouring breezes and being tossed on its surging billows by the howling of a norwest wind that threatens destruction to the boat or forces it to seek shelter on the shore  this difference is one of the checkered scenes of which we write and one that was experienced by the brigade more than once during its passage across the lake  since we are dealing in truisms it may not perhaps be out of place here to say that going to bed at night is not by any means getting up in the morning at least so several of our friends found to be the case when the deep sonorous voice of louis peltier sounded through the camp on the following morning just as a very faint scarcely perceptible light tinged the eastern sky  leve leve leve he cried leve leve mes enfants  some of louiss infants replied to the summons in a way that would have done credit to a harlequin  one or two active little canadians on hearing the cry of the awful word leve rose to their feet with a quick bound as if they had been keeping up an appearance of sleep as a sort of practical joke all night on purpose to be ready to leap as the first sound fell from the guides lips  others lay still in the same attitude in which they had fallen asleep having made up their minds apparently to lie there in spite of all the guides in the world  not a few got slowly into the sitting position their hair dishevelled their caps awry their eyes alternately winking very hard and staring awfully in the vain effort to keep open and their whole physiognomy wearing an expression of blank stupidity that is peculiar to man when engaged in that struggle which occurs each morning as he endeavours to disconnect and shake off the entanglement of nightly dreams and the realities of the breaking day  throughout the whole camp there was a low muffled sound as of men moving lazily with broken whispers and disjointed sentences uttered in very deep hoarse tones mingled with confused unearthly noises which upon consideration sounded like prolonged yawns  gradually these sounds increased for the guides leve is inexorable and the voyageurs fate inevitable  oh dearyei aaow yawning hang your leve  oui vraimentyei aaowmorbleu  eh whats that  oh misere  tare an ages  from an irishman an i had only got to slaape yit butyei aaow  french and irish yawns are very similar the only difference being that whereas the frenchman finishes the yawn resignedly and springs to his legs the irishman finishes it with an energetic gasp as if he were hurling it remonstratively into the face of fate turns round again and shuts his eyes doggedlya piece of bravado which he knows is useless and of very short duration  leve leve leve  there was no mistake this time in the tones of louiss voice  embark embark vite vite  the subdued sounds of rousing broke into a loud buzz of active preparation as the men busied themselves in bundling up blankets carrying down campkettles to the lake launching the boats kicking up lazy comrades stumbling over and swearing at fallen trees which were not visible in the cold uncertain light of the early dawn searching hopelessly among a tangled conglomeration of leaves and broken branches and crushed herbage for lost pipes and missing tobaccopouches  hollo exclaimed harry somerville starting suddenly from his sleeping posture and unintentionally cramming his elbow into charleys mouth i declare theyre all up and nearly ready to start  thats no reason replied charley why you should knock out all my front teeth is it  just then mr park issued from his tent dressed and ready to step into his boat  he first gave a glance round the camp to see that all the men were moving then he looked up through the trees to ascertain the present state and if possible the future prospects of the weather having come to a satisfactory conclusion on that head he drew forth his pipe and began to fill it when his eye fell on the two boys who were still sitting up in their lairs and staring idiotically at the place where the fire had been as if the white ashes halfburned logs and bits of charcoal were a sight of the most novel and interesting character that filled them with intense amazement  mr park could scarce forbear smiling  hello youngsters precious voyageurs youll make to be sure if this is the way youre going to begin  dont you see that the things are all aboard and well be ready to start in five minutes and you sitting there with your neckcloths off  mr park gave a slight sneer when he spoke of neckcloths as if he thought in the first place that they were quite superfluous portions of attire and in the second place that having once put them on the taking of them off at night was a piece of effeminacy altogether unworthy of a norwester  charley and harry needed no second rebuke  it flashed instantly upon them that sleeping comfortably under their blankets when the men were bustling about the camp was extremely inconsistent with the heroic resolves of the previous day  they sprang up rolled their blankets in the oilcloths which they fastened tightly with ropes tied the neckcloths held in such contempt by mr park in a twinkling threw on their coats and in less than five minutes were ready to embark  they then found that they might have done things more leisurely as the crews had not yet got all their traps on board so they began to look around them and discovered that each had omitted to pack up a blanket  very much crestfallen at their stupidity they proceeded to untie the bundles again when it became apparent to the eyes of charley that his friend had put on his capote inside out which had a peculiarly ragged and grotesque effect  these mistakes were soon rectified and shouldering their beds they carried them down to the boat and tossed them in  meanwhile mr park who had been watching the movements of the boys with a peculiar smile that filled them with confusion went round the different camps to see that nothing was left behind  the men were all in their places with oars ready and the boats floating on the calm water a yard or two from shore with the exception of the guides boat the stern of which still rested on the sand awaiting mr park  who does this belong to shouted that gentleman holding up a cloth cap part of which was of a mottled brown and part deep blue  harry instantly tore the covering from his head and discovered that among his numerous mistakes he had put on the headdress of one of the indians who had brought him to the camp  to do him justice the cap was not unlike his own excepting that it was a little more mottled and dirty in colour besides being decorated with a gaudy but very much crushed and broken feather  you had better change with our friend here i think said mr park grinning from ear to ear as he tossed the cap to its owner while harry handed the other to the indian amid the laughter of the crew  never mind boy added mr park in an encouraging tone youll make a voyageur yetnow then lads give way and with a nod to the indians who stood on the shore watching their departure the trader sprang into the boat and took his place beside the two boys  ho sing mes garcons cried the guide seizing the massive sweep and directing the boat out to sea  at this part of the lake there occurs a deep bay or inlet to save rounding which travellers usually strike straight across from point to point making what is called in voyageur parlance a traverse  these traverses are subjects of considerable anxiety and frequently of delay to travellers being sometimes of considerable extent varying from four to five and in such immense seas as lake superior to fourteen miles with boats indeed there is little to fear as the inland craft of the furtraders can stand a heavy sea and often ride out a pretty severe storm but it is far otherwise with the bark canoes that are often used in travelling  these frail craft can stand very little seatheir frames being made of thin flat slips of wood and sheets of bark not more than a quarter of an inch thick which are sewed together with the fibrous roots of the pine called by the natives wattape and rendered watertight by means of melted gum  although light and buoyant therefore and extremely useful in a country where portages are numerous they require very tender usage and when a traverse has to be made the guides have always a grave consultation with some of the most sagacious among the men as to the probability of the wind rising or fallingconsultations which are more or less marked by anxiety and tediousness in proportion to the length of the traverse the state of the weather and the courage or timidity of the guides  on the present occasion there was no consultation as has been already seen  the traverse was a short one the morning fine and the boats good  a warm glow began to overspread the horizon giving promise of a splendid day as the numerous oars dipped with a plash and a loud hiss into the water and sent the boats leaping forth upon the white wave  sing sing cried the guide again and clearing his throat he began the beautiful quicktuned canoesong rose blanche to which the men chorused with such power of lungs that a family of plovers which up to that time had stood in mute astonishment on a sandy point tumbled precipitately into the water from which they rose with a shrill inexpressibly wild plaintive cry and fled screaming away to a more secure refuge among the reeds and sedges of a swamp  a number of ducks too awakened by the unwonted sound shot suddenly out from the concealment of their nights bivouac with erect heads and startled looks sputtered heavily over the surface of their liquid bed and rising into the air flew in a wide circuit with whistling wings away from the scene of so much uproar and confusion  the rough voices of the men grew softer and softer as the two indians listened to the song of their departing friends mellowing down and becoming more harmonious and more plaintive as the distance increased and the boats grew smaller and smaller until they were lost in the blaze of light that now bathed both water and sky in the eastern horizon and began rapidly to climb the zenith while the sweet tones became less and less audible as they floated faintly across the still water and melted at last into the deep silence of the wilderness  the two indians still stood with downcast heads and listening ears as if they loved the last echo of the dying music while their grave statuelike forms added to rather than detracted from the solitude of the deserted scene    chapter eleven  charley and harry begin their sporting career without much success whiskyjohn catching  the place in the boats usually allotted to gentlemen in the companys service while travelling is the stern  here the lading is so arranged as to form a pretty level hollow where the flat bundles containing their blankets are placed and a couch is thus formed that rivals eastern effeminacy in luxuriance  there are occasions however when this couch is converted into a bed not of thorns exactly but of corners and really it would be hard to say which of the two is the more disagreeable  should the men be careless in arranging the cargo the inevitable consequence is that monsieur will find the leg of an iron stove the sharp edge of a keg or the corner of a wooden box occupying the place where his ribs should be  so common however is this occurrence that the clerks usually superintend the arrangements themselves and so secure comfort  on a couch then of this kind charley and harry now found themselves constrained to sit all morningsometimes asleep occasionally awake and always earnestly desiring that it was time to put ashore for breakfast as they had now travelled for four hours without halt except twice for about five minutes to let the men light their pipes  charley said harry somerville to his friend who sat beside him it strikes me that we are to have no breakfast at all today  here have i been holding my breath and tightening my belt until i feel much more like a spider or a wasp than aa  man harry out with it at once dont be afraid said charley  well no i wasnt going to have said that exactly but i was going to have said a voyageur only i recollected our doings this morning and hesitated to take the name until i had won it  its well that you entertain so modest an opinion of yourself said mr park who still smoked his pipe as if he were impressed with the idea that to stop for a moment would produce instant death  i may tell you for your comfort youngsters that we shant breakfast till we reach yonder point  the shores of lake winnipeg are flat and low and the point indicated by mr park lay directly in the light of the sun which now shone with such splendour in the cloudless sky and flashed on the polished water that it was with difficulty they could look towards the point of land  where is it asked charley shading his eyes with his hand i cannot make out anything at all  try again my boy theres nothing like practice  ah yes  i make it out now a faint shadow just under the sun  is that it  ay and well break our fast there  i would like very much to break your head here thought charley but he did not say it as besides being likely to produce unpleasant consequences he felt that such a speech to an elderly gentleman would be highly improper and charley had some respect for grey hairs for their own sake whether the owner of them was a good man or a goose  what shall we do harry  if i had only thought of keeping out a book  i know what i shall do said harry with a resolute air  ill go and shoot  shoot cried charley  you dont mean to say that youre going to waste your powder and shot by firing at the clouds for unless you take them i see nothing else here  thats because you dont use your eyes retorted harry  will you just look at yonder rock ahead of us and tell me what you see  charley looked earnestly at the rock which to a cursory glance seemed as if composed of whiter stone on the top  gulls i declare shouted charley at the same time jumping up in haste  just then one of the gulls probably a scout sent out to watch the approaching enemy wheeled in a circle overhead  the two youths dragged their guns from beneath the thwarts of the boat and rummaged about in great anxiety for shotbelts and powderhorns  at last they were found and having loaded they sat on the edge of the boat looking out for game with as muchay with more intense interest than a blackfoot indian would have watched for a fat buffalo cow  there he goes said harry take the first shot charley  where where is it  right ahead  look out  as harry spoke a small white gull with brightred legs and beak flew over the boat so close to them that as the guide remarked he could see it wink  charleys equanimity already pretty well disturbed was entirely upset at the suddenness of the birds appearance for he had been gazing intently at the rock when his friends exclamation drew his attention in time to see the gull within about four feet of his head with a sudden oh  charley threw forward his gun took a short wavering aim and blew the cocktail feather out of baptistes hat while the gull sailed tranquilly away as much as to say if thats all you can do theres no need for me to hurry  confound the boy cried mr park  youll be the death of some one yet im convinced of that  parbleu you may say that cest vrai remarked the voyageur with a rueful gaze at his hat which besides having its ornamental feather shattered was sadly cut up about the crown  the poor lads face became much redder than the legs or beak of the gull as he sat down in confusion which he sought to hide by busily reloading his gun while the men indulged in a somewhat witty and sarcastic criticism of his powers of shooting remarking in flattering terms on the precision of the shot that blew baptistes feather into atoms and declaring that if every shot he fired was as truly aimed he would certainly be the best in the country  baptiste also came in for a share of their repartee  it serves you right said the guide laughing for wearing such things on the voyage  you should put away such foppery till you return to the settlement where there are girls to admire you  baptiste had continued to wear the tall hat ornamented with gold cords and tassels with which he had left red river  ah cried another pulling vigorously at his oar i fear that marie wont look at you now that all your beautys gone  tis not quite gone said a third theres all the brim and half a tassel left besides the wreck of the remainder  oh i can lend you a few fragments retorted baptiste endeavouring to parry some of the thrusts  they would improve you vastly  no no friend gather them up and replace them they will look more picturesque and becoming now  i believe if you had worn them much longer all the men in the boat would have fallen in love with you  by st patrick said mike brady an irishman who sat at the oar immediately behind the unfortunate canadian theres more than enough o rubbish scattered over mysilf nor would do to stuff a fitherbed with  as mike spoke he collected the fragments of feathers and ribbons with which the unlucky shot had strewn him and placed them slyly on the top of the dilapidated hat which baptiste after clearing away the wreck had replaced on his head  its very purty said mike as the action was received by the crew with a shout of merriment  baptiste was waxing wrathful under this fire when the general attention was drawn again towards charley and his friend who having now got close to the rock had quite forgotten their mishap in the excitement of expectation  this excitement in the shooting of such small game might perhaps surprise our readers did we not acquaint them with the fact that neither of the boys had up to that time enjoyed much opportunity of shooting  it is true that harry had once or twice borrowed the fowlingpiece of the senior clerk and had sallied forth with a beating heart to pursue the grouse which are found in the belt of woodland skirting the assiniboine river near to fort garry  but these expeditions were of rare occurrence and they had not sufficed to rub off much of the bounding excitement with which he loaded and fired at anything and everything that came within range of his gun  charley on the other hand had never fired a shot before except out of an old horsepistol having up to this period been busily engaged at school except during the holidays which he always spent in the society of his sister kate whose tastes were not such as were likely to induce him to take up the gun even if he had possessed such a weapon  just before leaving red river his father presented him with his own gun remarking as he did so with a sigh that his day was past now and adding that the gun was a good one for shot or ball and if he charley brought down half as much game with it as he mr kennedy had brought down in the course of his life he might consider himself a crack shot undoubtedly  it was not surprising therefore that the two friends went nearly mad with excitation when the whole flock of gulls rose into the air like a white cloud and sailed in endless circles and gyrations above and around their headsflying so close at times that they might almost have been caught by the hand  neither was it surprising that innumerable shots were fired by both sportsmen without a single bird being a whit the worse for it or themselves much the better the energetic efforts made to hit being rendered abortive by the very eagerness which caused them to miss  and this was the less extraordinary too when it is remembered that harry in his haste loaded several times without shot and charley rendered the right barrel of his gun hors de combat at last by ramming down a charge of shot and omitting powder altogether whereby he snapped and primed and snapped and primed again till he grew desperate and then suspicious of the true cause which he finally rectified with much difficulty  frequently the gulls flew straight over the heads of the youthswhich produced peculiar consequences as in such cases they took aim while the birds were approaching but being somewhat slow at taking aim the gulls were almost perpendicularly above them ere they were ready to shoot so that they were obliged to fire hastily in hope feeling that they were losing their balance or give up the chance altogether  mr park sat grimly in his place all the while enjoying the scene and smoking  now then charley said he take that fellow  which where  oh if i could only get one said charley looking up eagerly at the screaming birds at which he had been staring so long in their varying and crossing flight that his sight had become hopelessly unsteady  there  look sharp fire away  bang went charleys piece as he spoke at a gull which flew straight towards him but so rapidly that it was directly above his head indeed he was leaning a little backwards at the moment which caused him to miss again while the recoil of the gun brought matters to a climax by toppling him over into mr parks lap thereby smashing that gentlemans pipe to atoms  the fall accidentally exploded the second barrel causing the butt to strike charley in the pit of his stomachas if to ram him well home into mr parks open armsand hitting with a stray shot a gull that was sailing high up in the sky in fancied security  it fell with a fluttering crash into the boat while the men were laughing at the accident  didnt i say so cried mr park wrathfully as he pitched charley out of his lap and spat out the remnants of his broken pipe  fortunately for all parties at this moment the boat approached a spot on which the guide had resolved to land for breakfast and seeing the unpleasant predicament into which poor charley had fallen he assumed the strong tones of command with which guides are frequently gifted and called outho ho a terre a terre to land to land  breakfast my boys breakfastat the same time sweeping the boats head shoreward and running into a rocky bay whose margin was fringed by a growth of small trees  here in a few minutes they were joined by the other boats of the brigade which had kept within sight of each other nearly the whole morning  while travelling through the wilds of north america in boats voyageurs always make a point of landing to breakfast  dinner is a meal with which they are unacquainted at least on the voyage and luncheon is likewise unknown  if a man feels hungry during the day the pemmicanbag and its contents are there he may pause in his work at any time for a minute to seize the axe and cut off a lump which he may devour as he best can but there is no going ashoreno resting for dinner  two great meals are recognised and the time allotted to their preparation and consumption held inviolablebreakfast and supper the first varying between the hours of seven and nine in the morning the second about sunset at which time travellers usually encamp for the night  of the two meals it would be difficult to say which is more agreeable  for our own part we prefer the former  it is the meal to which a man addresses himself with peculiar gusto especially if he has been astir three or four hours previously in the open air  it is the time of day too when the spirits are freshest and highest animated by the prospect of the work the difficulties the pleasures or the adventures of the day that has begun and cheered by that cool clear buoyancy of nature which belongs exclusively to the happy morning hours and has led poets in all ages to compare these hours to the first sweet months of spring or the early years of childhood  voyageurs not less than poets have felt the exhilarating influence of the young day although they have lacked the power to tell it in sounding numbers but where words were wanting the sparkling eye the beaming countenance the light step and hearty laugh were more powerful exponents of the feelings within  poet and painter too might have spent a profitable hour on the shores of that great sequestered lake and as they watched the picturesque groups clustering round the blazing fires preparing their morning meal smoking their pipes examining and repairing the boats or sunning their stalwart limbs in wild careless attitudes upon the greenswardmight have found a subject worthy the most brilliant effusions of the pen or the most graphic touches of the pencil  an hour sufficed for breakfast  while it was preparing the two friends sauntered into the forest in search of game in which they were unsuccessful in fact with the exception of the gulls before mentioned there was not a feather to be seensave always one or two whiskyjohns  whiskyjohns are the most impudent puffy conceited little birds that exist  not much larger in reality than sparrows they nevertheless manage to swell out their feathers to such an extent that they appear to be as large as magpies which they further resemble in their plumage go where you will in the woods of ruperts land the instant that you light a fire two or three whiskyjohns come down and sit beside you on a branch it may be or on the ground and generally so near that you cannot but wonder at their recklessness  there is a species of impudence which seems to be specially attached to little birds  in them it reaches the highest pitch of perfection  a bold swelling arrogant effronterya sort of stark staring sellcomplacent comfortable and yet innocent impertinencewhich is at once irritating and amusing aggravating and attractive and which is exhibited in the greatest intensity in the whiskyjohn  he will jump down almost under your nose and seize a fragment of biscuit or pemmican  he will go right into the pemmicanbag when you are but a few paces off and pilfer as it were at the fountainhead  or if these resources are closed against him he will sit on a twig within an inch of your head and look at you as only a whiskyjohn can look  ill catch one of these rascals said harry as he saw them jump unceremoniously into and out of the pemmican bag  going down to the boat harry hid himself under the tarpaulin leaving a hole open near to the mouth of the bag  he had not remained more than a few minutes in this concealment when one of the birds flew down and alighted on the edge of the boat  after a glance round to see that all was right it jumped into the bag  a moment after harry darting his hand through the aperture grasped him round the neck and secured him poor whiskyjohn screamed and pecked ferociously while harry brought him in triumph to his friend but so unremittingly did the bird scream that his captor was fain at last to let him off the more especially as the cook came up at the moment and announced that breakfast was ready    chapter twelve  the storm  two days after the events of the last chapter the brigade was making one of the traverses which have already been noticed as of frequent occurrence in the great lakes  the morning was calm and sultry  a deep stillness pervaded nature which tended to produce a corresponding quiescence in the mind and to fill it with those indescribably solemn feelings that frequently arise before a thunderstorm  dark lurid clouds hung overhead in gigantic masses piled above each other like the battlements of a dark fortress from whose ragged embrasures the artillery of heaven was about to play  shall we get over in time louis asked mr park as he turned to the guide who sat holding the tiller with a firm grasp while the men aware of the necessity of reaching shelter ere the storm burst upon them were bending to the oars with steady and sustained energy  perhaps replied louis laconicallypull lads pull else youll have to sleep in wet skins tonight  a low growl of distant thunder followed the guides words and the men pulled with additional energy while the slow measured hiss of the water and the clank of oars as they cut swiftly through the lakes clear surface alone interrupted the dead silence that ensued  charley and his friend conversed in low whispers for there is a strange power in a thunderstorm whether raging or about to break that overawes the heart of manas if natures god were nearer then than at other times as if hewhose voice indeed if listened to speaks even in the slightest evolution of natural phenomenawere about to tread the visible earth with more than usual majesty in the vivid glare of the lightning flash and in the awful crash of thunder  i dont know how it is but i feel more like a coward said charley just before a thunderstorm than i think i should do in the arms of a polar bear  do you feel queer harry  a little replied harry in a low whisper and yet im not frightened  i can scarcely tell what i feel but im certain its not fear  well i dont know said charley  when fathers black bull chased kate and me in the prairies and almost overtook us as we ran for the fence of the big field i felt my heart leap to my mouth and the blood rush to my cheeks as i turned about and faced him while kate climbed the fence but after she was over i felt a wild sort of wickedness in me as if i should like to tantalise and torment himand i felt altogether different from what i feel now while i look up at these black clouds  isnt there something quite awful in them harry  ere harry replied a bright flash of lightning shot athwart the sky followed by a loud roar of thunder and in a moment the wind rushed like a fiend set suddenly free down upon the boats tearing up the smooth surface of the water as it flew and cutting it into gleaming white streaks  fortunately the storm came down behind the boats so that after the first wild burst was over they hoisted a small portion of their lug sails and scudded rapidly before it  there was still a considerable portion of the traverse to cross and the guide cast an anxious glance over his shoulder occasionally as the dark waves began to rise and their crests were cut into white foam by the increasing gale  thunder roared in continued successive peals as if the heavens were breaking up while rain descended in sheets  for a time the crews continued to ply their oars but as the wind increased these were rendered superfluous  they were taken in therefore and the men sought partial shelter under the tarpaulin while mr park and the two boys were covered excepting their heads by an oilcloth which was always kept at hand in rainy weather  what think you now louis said mr park resuming the pipe which the sudden outburst of the storm had caused him to forget  have we seen the worst of it  louis replied abruptly in the negative and in a few seconds shouted loudly look out lads here comes a squall  stand by to let go the sheet there  mike brady happening to be near the sheet seized hold of the rope and prepared to let go while the men rose as if by instinct and gazed anxiously at the approaching squall which could be seen in the distance extending along the horizon like a bar of blackest ink spotted with flakes of white  the guide sat with compressed lips and motionless as a statue guiding the boat as it bounded madly towards the land which was now not more than half a mile distant  let go shouted the guide in a voice that was heard loud and clear above the roar of the elements  ay ay replied the irishman untwisting the rope instantly as with a sharp hiss the squall descended on the boat  at that moment the rope became entangled round one of the oars and the gale burst with all its fury on the distended sail burying the prow in the waves which rushed inboard in a black volume and in an instant half filled the boat  let go roared the guide again in a voice of thunder while mike struggled with awkward energy to disentangle the rope  as he spoke an indian who during the storm had been sitting beside the mast gazing at the boiling water with a grave contemplative aspect sprang quickly forward drew his knife and with two blows so rapidly delivered that they seemed but one cut asunder first the sheet and then the halyards which let the sail blow out and fall flat upon the boat he was just in time  another moment and the gushing water which curled over the bow would have filled them to the gunwale  as it was the little vessel was so full of water that she lay like a log while every toss of the waves sent an additional torrent into her  bail for your lives lads cried mr park as he sprang forward and seizing a tin dish began energetically to bail out the water following his example the whole crew seized whatever came first to hand in the shape of dish or kettle and began to bail  charley and harry somerville acted a vigorous part on this occasionthe one with a bark dish which had been originally made by the natives for the purpose of holding maplesugar the other with his cap  for a time it seemed doubtful whether the curling waves should send most water into the boat or the crew should bail most out of it  but the latter soon prevailed and in a few minutes it was so far got under that three of the men were enabled to leave off bailing and reset the sail while louis peltier returned to his post at the helm  at first the boat moved but slowly owing to the weight of water in her but as this grew gradually less she increased her speed and neared the land  well done redfeather said mr park addressing the indian as he resumed his seat your knife did us good service that time my fine fellow  redfeather who was the only pure native in the brigade acknowledged the compliment with a smile  ah oui said the guide whose features had now lost their stern expression  them injins are always ready enough with their knives its not the first time my life has been saved by the knife of a redskin  humph bad luck to them muttered mike brady its not the first time that my windpipe has been pretty near spiflicated by the knives o the redskins the murtherin varmints  as mike gave vent to this malediction the boat ran swiftly past a low rocky point over which the surf was breaking wildly  down with the sail mike cried the guide at the same time putting the helm hard up  the beat flew round obedient to the ruling power made one last plunge as it left the rolling surf behind and slid gently and smoothly into still water under the lee of the point  here in the snug shelter of a little bay two of the other boats were found with their prows already on the beach and their crews actively employed in landing their goods opening bales that had received damage from the water and preparing the encampment while ever and anon they paused a moment to watch the various boats as they flew before the gale and one by one doubled the friendly promontory  if there is one thing that provokes a voyageur more than another it is being windbound on the shores of a large lake  rain or sleet heat or cold icicles forming on the oars or a broiling sun glaring in a cloudless sky the stings of sandflies or the sharp probes of a million mosquitoes he will bear with comparative indifference but being detained by high wind for two three or four days togetherlying inactively on shore when everything else it may be is favourable the sun bright the sky blue the air invigorating and all but the wind propitiousis more than his philosophy can carry him through with equanimity  he grumbles at it sometimes makes believe to laugh at it very often we are sorry to say swears at it does his best to sleep through it but whatever he does he does with a bad grace because hes in a bad humour and cant stand it  for the next three days this was the fate of our friends  part of the time it rained when the whole party slept as much as was possible and then endeavoured to sleep more than was possible under the shelter afforded by the spreading branches of the trees  part of the time was fair with occasional gleams of sunshine when the men turned out to eat and smoke and gamble round the fires and the two friends sauntered down to a sheltered place on the shore sunned themselves in a warm nook among the rocks while they gazed ruefully at the foaming billows told endless stories of what they had done in time past and equally endless prospective adventures that they earnestly hoped should befall them in time to come  while they were thus engaged redfeather the indian who had cut the ropes so opportunely during the storm walked down to the shore and sitting down on a rock not far distant fell apparently into a reverie  i like that fellow said harry pointing to the indian  so do i  hes a sharp active man  had it not been for him we should have had to swim for it  indeed had it not been for him i should have had to sink for it said harry with a smile for i cant swim  ah true i forgot that  i wonder what the redskin as the guide calls him is thinking about added charley in a musing tone  of home perhaps sweet home said harry with a sigh  do you think much of home charley now that you have left it  charley did not reply for a few seconds he seemed to muse over the question  at last he said slowly  think of home  i think of little else when i am not talking with you harry  my dear mother is always in my thoughts and my poor old father home ay and darling kate too is at my elbow night and day with the tears streaming from her eyes and her ringlets scattered over my shoulder as i saw her the day we parted beckoning me back again or reproaching me for having gone awaygod bless her  yes i often very often think of home harry  harry made no reply  his friends words had directed his thoughts to a very different and fardistant sceneto another kate and another father and mother who lived in a glen far away over the waters of the broad atlantic  he thought of them as they used to be when he was one of the number a unit in the beloved circle whose absence would have caused a blank there  he thought of the kind voice that used to read the word of god and the tender kiss of his mother as they parted for the night  he thought of the dreary day when he left them all behind and sailed away in the midst of strangers across the wide ocean to a strange land  he thought of them nowwithout himaccustomed to his absence and forgetful perhaps at times that he had once been there as he thought of all this a tear rolled down his cheek and when charley looked up in his face that teardrop told plainly that he too thought sometimes of home  let us ask redfeather to tell us something about the indians he said at length rousing himself  i have no doubt he has had many adventures in his life  shall we charley  by all meansho redfeather are you trying to stop the wind by looking it out of countenance  the indian rose and walked towards the spot where the boys lay  what was redfeather thinking about said charley adopting the somewhat pompous style of speech occasionally used by indians  was he thinking of the white swan and his little ones in the prairie or did he dream of giving his enemies a good licking the next time he meets them  redfeather has no enemies replied the indian  he was thinking of the great manito god who made the wild winds and the great lakes and the forest  and pray good redfeather what did your thoughts tell you  they told me that men are very weak and very foolish and wicked and that manito is very good and patient to let them live  that is to say cried harry who was surprised and a little nettled to hear what he called the heads of a sermon from a redskin that you being a man are very weak and very foolish and wicked and that manito is very good and patient to let you live  good said the indian calmly that is what i mean  come redfeather said charley laying his hand on the indians arm sit down beside us and tell us some of your adventures  i know that you must have had plenty and its quite clear that were not to get away from this place all day so youve nothing better to do  the indian readily assented and began his story in english  redfeather was one of the very few indians who had acquired the power of speaking the english language  having been while a youth brought much into contact with the furtraders and having been induced by them to enter their service for a time he had picked up enough of english to make himself easily understood  being engaged at a later period of life as guide to one of the exploring parties sent out by the british government to discover the famous northwest passage he had learned to read and write and had become so much accustomed to the habits and occupations of the palefaces that he spent more of his time in one way or another with them than in the society of his tribe which dwelt in the thick woods bordering on one of the great prairies of the interior  he was about thirty years of age had a tall thin but wiry and powerful frame and was of a mild retiring disposition  his face wore a habitually grave expression verging towards melancholy induced probably by the vicissitudes of a wild life in which he had seen much of the rugged side of nature in men and things acting upon a sensitive heart and a naturally warm temperament  redfeather however was by no means morose and when seated along with his canadian comrades round the camp fire he listened with evidently genuine interest to their stories and entered into the spirit of their jests  but he was always an auditor and rarely took part in their conversations  he was frequently consulted by the guide in matters of difficulty and it was observed that the redskins opinion always carried much weight with it although it was seldom given unless asked for  the men respected him much because he was a hard worker obliging and modestthree qualities that ensure respect whether found under a red skin or a white one  i shall tell you he began in a soft musing tone as if he were wandering in memories of the pasti shall tell you how it was that i came by the name of redfeather  au interrupted charley i intended to ask you about that you dont wear one  i did once  my father was a great warrior in his tribe continued the indian and i was but a youth when i got the name  my tribe was at war at the time with the chipewyans and one of our scouts having come in with the intelligence that a party of our enemies was in the neighbourhood our warriors armed themselves to go in pursuit of them  i had been out once before with a warparty but had not been successful as the enemys scouts gave notice of our approach in time to enable them to escape  at the time the information was brought to us the young men of our village were amusing themselves with athletic games and loud challenges were being given and accepted to wrestle or race or swim in the deep water of the river which flowed calmly past the green bank on which our wigwams stood  on a bank near to us sat about a dozen of our womensome employed in ornamenting moccasins with coloured porcupine quills others making rogans of bark for maple sugar or nursing their young infants while a few chiefly the old women grouped themselves together and kept up an incessant chattering chiefly with reference to the doings of the young men  apart from these stood three or four of the principal men of our tribe smoking their pipes and although apparently engrossed in conversation still evidently interested in what was going forward on the bank of the river  among the young men assembled there was one of about my own age who had taken a violent dislike to me because the most beautiful girl in all the village preferred me before him  his name was misconna  he was a hottempered cruel youth and although i endeavoured as much as possible to keep out of his way he sought every opportunity of picking a quarrel with me  i had just been running a race along with several other youths and although not the winner i had kept ahead of misconna all the distance  he now stood leaning against a tree burning with rage and disappointment  i was sorry for this because i bore him no illwill and if it had occurred to me at the time i would have allowed him to pass me since i was unable to gain the race at any rate  dog he said at length stepping forward and confronting me will you wrestle  just as he approached i had turned round to leave the place  not wishing to have more to do with him i pretended not to hear and made a step or two towards the lodges  dog he cried again while his eyes flashed fiercely and he grasped me by the arm will you wrestle or are you afraid  has the brave boys heart changed into that of a girl  no misconna said i  you know that i am not afraid but i have no desire to quarrel with you  you lie cried he with a cold sneeryou are afraid and see he added pointing towards the women with a triumphant smile the darkeyed girl sees it and believes it too  i turned to look and there i saw wabisca gazing on me with a look of blank amazement  i could see also that several of the other women and some of my companions shared in her surprise  with a burst of anger i turned round  no misconna said i i am not afraid as you shall find and springing upon him i grasped him round the body  he was nearly if not quite as strong a youth as myself but i was burning with indignation at the insolence of his conduct before so many of the womenwhich gave me more than usual energy  for several minutes we swayed to and fro each endeavouring in vain to bend the others back but we were too well matched for this and sought to accomplish our purpose by taking advantage of an unguarded movement  at last such a movement occurred  my adversary made a sudden and violent attempt to throw me to the left hoping that an inequality in the ground would favour his effort  but he was mistaken  i had seen the danger and was prepared for it so that the instant he attempted it i threw forward my right leg and thrust him backwards with all my might  misconna was quick in his motions  he saw my intentiontoo late indeed to prevent it altogether but in time to throw back his left foot and stiffen his body till it felt like a block of stone  the effort was now entirely one of endurance  we stood each with his muscles strained to the utmost without the slightest motion  at length i felt my adversary give way a little  slight though the motion was it instantly removed all doubt as to who should go down  my heart gave a bound of exultation and with the energy which such a feeling always inspires i put forth all my strength threw him heavily over on his back and fell upon him  a shout of applause from my comrades greeted me as i rose and left the ground but at the same moment the attention of all was taken from myself and the baffled misconna by the arrival of the scout bringing us information that a party of chipewyans were in the neighbourhood  in a moment all was bustle and preparation  an indian warparty is soon got ready  forty of our braves threw off the principal parts of their clothing painted their faces with stripes of vermilion and charcoal armed themselves with guns bows tomahawks and scalpingknives and in a few minutes left the camp in silence and at a quick pace  one or two of the youths who had been playing on the rivers bank were permitted to accompany the party and among these were misconna and myself  as we passed a group of women assembled to see us depart i observed the girl who had caused so much jealousy between us  she cast down her eyes as we came up and as we advanced close to the group she dropped a white feather as if by accident  stooping hastily down i picked it up in passing and stuck it in an ornamented band that bound my hair  as we hurried on i heard two or three old hags laugh and say with a sneer his hand is as white as the feather it has never seen blood  the next moment we were hid in the forest and pursued our rapid course in dead silence  the country through which we passed was varied extending in broken bits of open prairie and partly covered with thick wood yet not so thick as to offer any hindrance to our march  we walked in single file each treading in his comrades footsteps while the band was headed by the scout who had brought the information  the principal chief of our tribe came next and he was followed by the braves according to their age or influence  misconna and i brought up the rear  the sun was just sinking as we left the belt of wood land in which our village stood crossed over a short plain descended a dark hollow at the bottom of which the river flowed and following its course for a considerable distance turned off to the right and emerged upon a sweep of prairieland  here the scout halted and taking the chief and two or three braves aside entered into earnest consultation with them  what they said we could not hear but as we stood leaning on our guns in the deep shade of the forest we could observe by their animated gestures that they differed in opinion  we saw that the scout pointed several times to the moon which was just rising above the treetops and then to the distant horizon but the chief shook his head pointed to the woods and seemed to be much in doubt while the whole band watched his motions in deep silence but evident interest  at length they appeared to agree  the scout took his place at the head of the line and we resumed our march keeping close to the margin of the wood it was perhaps three hours after this ere we again halted to hold another consultation  this time their deliberations were shorter  in a few seconds our chief himself took the lead and turned into the woods through which he guided us to a small fountain which bubbled up at the root of a birch tree where there was a smooth green spot of level ground  here we halted and prepared to rest for an hour at the end of which time the moon which now shone bright and full in the clear sky would be nearly down and we could resume our march  we now sat down in a circle and taking a hasty mouthful of dried meat stretched ourselves on the ground with our arms beside us while our chief kept watch leaning against the birch tree  it seemed as if i had scarcely been asleep five minutes when i felt a light touch on my shoulder  springing up i found the whole party already astir and in a few minutes more we were again hurrying onwards  we travelled thus until a faint light in the east told us that the day was at hand when the scouts steps became more cautious and he paused to examine the ground frequently  at last we came to a place where the ground sank slightly and at the distance of a hundred yards rose again forming a low ridge which was crowned with small bushes  here we came to a halt and were told that our enemies were on the other side of that ridge that they were about twenty in number all chipewyan warriors with the exception of one palefacea trapper and his indian wife  the scout had learned while lying like a snake in the grass around their camp that this man was merely travelling with them on his way to the rocky mountains and that as they were a warparty he intended to leave them soon  on hearing this the warriors gave a grim smile and our chief directing the scout to fall behind cautiously led the way to the top of the ridge  on reaching it we saw a valley of great extent dotted with trees and shrubs and watered by one of the many rivers that flow into the great saskatchewan  it was nearly dark however and we could only get an indistinct view of the land  far ahead of us on the right bank of the stream and close to its margin we saw the faint red light of watchfires which caused us some surprise for watchfires are never lighted by a warparty so near to an enemys country  so we could only conjecture that they were quite ignorant of our being in that part of the country which was indeed not unlikely seeing that we had shifted our camp during the summer  our chief now made arrangements for the attack  we were directed to separate and approach individually as near to the camp as was possible without risk of discovery and then taking up an advantageous position to await our chiefs signal which was to be the hooting of an owl  we immediately separated  my course lay along the banks of the stream and as i strode rapidly along listening to its low solemn murmur which sounded clear and distinct in the stillness of a calm summer night i could not help feeling as if it were reproaching me for the bloody work i was hastening to perform  then the recollection of what the old woman said of me raised a desperate spirit in my heart  remembering the white feather in my head i grasped my gun and quickened my pace  as i neared the camp i went into the woods and climbed a low hillock to look out  i found that it still lay about five hundred yards distant and that the greater part of the ground between it and the place where i stood was quite flat and without cover of any kind  i therefore prepared to creep towards it although the attempt was likely to be attended with great danger for chipewyans have quick ears and sharp eyes  observing however that the river ran close past the camp i determined to follow its course as before  in a few seconds more i came to a dark narrow gap where the river flowed between broken rocks overhung by branches and from which i could obtain a clear view of the camp within fifty yards of me  examining the priming of my gun i sat down on a rock to await the chiefs signal  it was evident from the careless manner in which the fires were placed that no enemy was supposed to be near  from my concealment i could plainly distinguish ten or fifteen of the sleeping forms of our enemies among which the trapper was conspicuous from his superior bulk and the reckless way in which his brawny arms were flung on the turf while his right hand clutched his rifle  i could not but smile as i thought of the proud boldness of the palefacelying all exposed to view in the grey light of dawn while an indians rifle was so close at hand  one indian kept watch but he seemed more than half asleep  i had not sat more than a minute when my observations were interrupted by the cracking of a branch in the bushes near me  starting up i was about to bound into the underwood when a figure sprang down the bank and rapidly approached me  my first impulse was to throw forward my gun but a glance sufficed to show me that it was a woman  wah  i exclaimed in surprise as she hurried forward and laid her hand on my shoulder  she was dressed partly in the costume of the indians but wore a shawl on her shoulders and a handkerchief on her head that showed she had been in the settlements and from the lightness of her skin and hair i judged at once that she was the trappers wife of whom i had heard the scout speak  has the lighthair got a medicinebag or does she speak with spirits that she has found me so easily  the girl looked anxiously up in my face as if to read my thoughts and then said in a low voiceno i neither carry the medicinebag nor hold palaver with spirits but i do think the good manito must have led me here  i wandered into the woods because i could not sleep and i saw you pass  but tell me she added with still deeper anxiety does the whitefeather come alone  does he approach friends during the dark hours with a soft step like a fox  feeling the necessity of detaining her until my comrades should have time to surround the camp i said the whitefeather hunts far from his lands  he sees indians whom he does not know and must approach with a light step  perhaps they are enemies  do knisteneux hunt at night prowling in the bed of a stream said the girl still regarding me with a keen glance  speak truth stranger and she started suddenly back in a moment i can alarm the camp with a cry and if your tongue is forkedbut i do not wish to bring enemies upon you if they are indeed such  i am not one of them my husband and i travel with them for a time  we do not desire to see blood  god knows she added in french which seemed her native tongue i have seen enough of that already  as her earnest eyes looked into my face a sudden thought occurred to me  go said i hastily tell your husband to leave the camp instantly and meet me here and see that the chipewyans do not observe your departure  quick his life and yours may depend on your speed  the girl instantly comprehended my meaning  in a moment she sprang up the bank but as she did so the loud report of a gun was heard followed by a yell and the warwhoop of the knisteneux rent the air as they rushed upon the devoted camp sending arrows and bullets before them  on the instant i sprang after the girl and grasped her by the arm stay whitecheek it is too late now  you cannot save your husband but i think hell save himself  i saw him dive into the bushes like a caribou  hide yourself here perhaps you may escape  the halfbreed girl sank on a fallen tree with a deep groan and clasped her hands convulsively before her eyes while i bounded over the tree intending to join my comrades in pursuing the enemy  as i did so a shrill cry arose behind me and looking back i beheld the trappers wife prostrate on the ground and misconna standing over her his spear uplifted and a fierce frown on his dark face  hold  i cried rushing back and seizing his arm  misconna did not come to kill women  she is not our enemy  does the young wrestler want another wife he said with a wild laugh at the same time wrenching his arm from my gripe and driving his spear through the fleshy part of the womans breast and deep into the ground  a shriek rent the air as he drew it out again to repeat the thrust but before he could do so i struck him with the butt of my gun on the head  staggering backwards he fell heavily among the bushes at this moment a second whoop rang out and another of our band sprang from the thicket that surrounded us  seeing no one but myself and the bleeding girl he gave me a short glance of surprise as if he wondered why i did not finish the work which he evidently supposed i had begun  wah he exclaimed and uttering another yell plunged his spear into the womans breast despite my efforts to prevent himthis time with more deadly effect as the blood spouted from the wound while she uttered a piercing scream and twined her arms round my legs as i stood beside her as if imploring for mercy  poor girl  i saw that she was past my help  the wound was evidently mortal  already the signs of death overspread her features and i felt that a second blow would be one of mercy so that when the indian stooped and passed his long knife through her heart i made but a feeble effort to prevent it  just as the man rose with the warm blood dripping from his keen blade the sharp crack of a rifle was heard and the indian fell dead at my feet shot through the forehead while the trapper bounded into the open space his massive frame quivering and his sunburned face distorted with rage and horror  from the other side of the brake six of our band rushed forward and levelled their guns at him  for one moment the trapper paused to cast a glance at the mangled corpse of his wife as if to make quite sure that she was dead and then uttering a howl of despair he hurled his axe with a giants force at the knisteneux and disappeared over the precipitous bank of the stream  so rapid was the action that the volley which immediately succeeded passed harmlessly over his head while the indians dashed forward in pursuit  at the same instant i myself was felled to the earth  the axe which the trapper had flung struck a tree in its flight and as it glanced off the handle gave me a violent blow in passing  i fell stunned  as i did so my head alighted on the shoulder of the woman and the last thing i felt as my wandering senses forsook me was her still warm blood flowing over my face and neck  while this scene was going on the yells and screams of the warriors in the camp became fainter and fainter as they pursued and fled through the woods  the whole band of chipewyans was entirely routed with the exception of four who escaped and the trapper whose flight i have described all the rest were slain and their scalps hung at the belts of the victorious knisteneux warriors while only one of our party was killed  not more than a few minutes after receiving the blow that stunned me i recovered and rising as hastily as my scattered faculties would permit me i staggered towards the camp where i heard the shouts of our men as they collected the arms of their enemies  as i rose the feather which wabisca had dropped fell from my brow and as i picked it up to replace it i perceived that it was red being entirely covered with the blood of the halfbreed girl  the place where misconna had fallen was vacant as i passed and i found him standing among his comrades round the camp fires examining the guns and other articles which they had collected  he gave me a short glance of deep hatred as i passed and turned his head hastily away  a few minutes sufficed to collect the spoils and so rapidly had everything been done that the light of day was still faint as we silently returned on our track  we marched in the same order as before misconna and i bringing up the rear  as we passed near the place where the poor woman had been murdered i felt a strong desire to return to the spot  i could not very well understand the feeling but it lay so strong upon me that when we reached the ridge where we first came in sight of the chipewyan camp i fell behind until my companions disappeared in the woods and then ran swiftly back  just as i was about to step beyond the circle of bushes that surrounded the spot i saw that some one was there before me  it was a man and as he advanced into the open space and the light fell on his face i saw that it was the trapper  no doubt he had watched us off the ground and then when all was safe returned to bury his wife  i crouched to watch him  stepping slowly up to the body of his murdered wife he stood beside it with his arms folded on his breast and quite motionless  his head hung down for the heart of the white man was heavy and i could see as the light increased that his brows were dark as the thundercloud and the corners of his mouth twitched from a feeling that the indian scorns to show  my heart is full of sorrow for him now redfeathers voice sank as he spoke it was full of sorrow for him even then when i was taught to think that pity for an enemy was unworthy of a brave  the trapper stood gazing very long  his wife was young he could not leave her yet  at length a deep groan burst from his heart as the waters of a great river long held down swell up in spring and burst the ice at last  groan followed groan as the trapper still stood and pressed his arms on his broad breast as if to crush the heart within  at last he slowly knelt beside her bending more and more over the lifeless form until he lay extended on the ground beside it and twining his arms round the neck he drew the cold cheek close to his and pressed the bloodcovered bosom tighter and tighter while his form quivered with agony as he gave her a last long embrace  oh continued redfeather while his brow darkened and his black eye flashed with an expression of fierceness that his young listeners had never seen before may the curse he paused  god forgive them how could they know better  at length the trapper rose hastily  the expression of his brow was still the same but his mouth was altered  the lips were pressed tightly like those of a brave when led to torture and there was a fierce activity in his motions as he sprang down the bank and proceeded to dig a hole in the soft earth  for half an hour he laboured shovelling away the earth with a large flat stone and carrying down the body he buried it there under the shadow of a willow  the trapper then shouldered his rifle and hurried away  on reaching the turn of the stream which shuts the little hollow out from view he halted suddenly gave one look into the prairie he was thenceforth to tread alone one short glance back and then raising both arms in the air looked up into the sky while he stretched himself to his full height  even at that distance i could see the wild glare of his eye and the heaving of his breast  a moment after and he was gone  and did you never see him again inquired harry somerville eagerly  no i never saw him more  immediately afterwards i turned to rejoin my companions whom i soon overtook and entered our village along with them  i was regarded as a poor warrior because i brought home no scalps and ever afterwards i went by the name of redfeather in our tribe  but are you still thought a poor warrior asked charley in some concern as if he were jealous of the reputation of his new friend  the indian smiled  no he said our village was twice attacked afterwards and in defending it redfeather took many scalps  he was made a chief  ah cried charley im glad of that  and wabisca what came of her did misconna get her  she is my wife replied redfeather  your wife  why i thought i heard the voyageurs call your wife the white swan  wabisca is white in the language of the knisteneux  she is beautiful in form and my comrades call her the white swan  redfeather said this with an air of gratified pride  he did not perhaps love his wife with more fervour than he would have done had he remained with his tribe but redfeather had associated a great deal with the traders and he had imbibed much of that spirit which prompts white men to treat their females with deference and respecta feeling which is very foreign to an indians bosom  to do so was besides more congenial to his naturally unselfish and affectionate disposition so that any flattering allusion to his partner was always received by him with immense gratification  ill pay you a visit some day redfeather if im sent to any place within fifty miles of your tribe said charley with the air of one who had fully made up his mind  and misconna asked harry  misconna is with his tribe replied the indian and a frown overspread his features as he spoke  but redfeather has been following in the track of his white friends he has not seen his nation for many moons    chapter thirteen  the canoeascending the rapidsthe portagedeershooting and life in the woods  we must now beg the patient reader to take a leap with us not only through space but also through time  we must pass over the events of the remainder of the journey along the shore of lake winnipeg unwilling though we are to omit anything in the history of our friends that would be likely to prove interesting we think it wise not to run the risk of being tedious or of dwelling too minutely on the details of scenes which recall powerfully the feelings and memories of bygone days to the writer but may nevertheless appear somewhat flat to the reader  we shall not therefore enlarge at present on the arrival of the boats at norway house which lies at the north end of the lake nor on what was said and done by our friends and by several other young comrades whom they found there  we shall not speak of the horror of harry somerville and the extreme disappointment of his friend charley kennedy when the former was told that instead of hunting grizzly bears up the saskatchewan he was condemned to the desk again at york fort the depot on hudsons baya low swampy place near the seashore where the goods for the interior are annually landed and the furs shipped for england where the greater part of the summer and much of the winter is occupied by the clerks who may be doomed to vegetate there in making up the accounts of what is termed the northern department and where the brigades converge from all the widescattered and fardistant outposts and the ship from englandthat great event of the yeararrives keeping the place in a state of constant bustle and effervescence until autumn when ship and brigades finally depart leaving the residents about thirty in number shut up for eight long dreary months of winter with a tenantless wilderness around and behind them and the wide cold frozen sea before  this was among the first of harrys disappointments  he suffered many afterwards poor fellow  neither shall we accompany charley up the south branch of the saskatchewan where his utmost expectations in the way of hunting were more than realised and where he became so accustomed to shooting ducks and geese and bears and buffaloes that he could not forbear smiling when he chanced to meet with a redlegged gull and remembered how he and his friend harry had comported themselves when they first met with these birds on the shores of lake winnipeg  we shall pass over all this and the summer autumn and winter too and leap at once into the spring of the following year  on a very bright cheery morning of that spring a canoe might have been seen slowly ascending one of the numerous streams which meander through a richlywooded fertile country and mingle their waters with those of the athabasca river terminating their united career in a large lake of the same name  the canoe was smallone of the kind used by the natives while engaged in hunting and capable of holding only two persons conveniently with their baggage  to any one unacquainted with the nature or capabilities of a northern indian canoe the fragile bright orangecoloured machine that was battling with the strong current of a rapid must indeed have appeared an unsafe and insignificant craft but a more careful study of its performances in the rapid and of the immense quantity of miscellaneous goods and chattels which were at a later period of the day disgorged from its interior would have convinced the beholder that it was in truth the most convenient and serviceable craft that could be devised for the exigencies of such a country  true it could only hold two men it might have taken three at a pinch because men and women too are awkward unyielding baggage very difficult to stow compactly but it is otherwise with tractable goods  the canoe is exceedingly thin so that no space is taken up or rendered useless by its own structure and there is no end to the amount of blankets and furs and coats and paddles and tentcovers and dogs and babies that can be stowed away in its capacious interior the canoe of which we are now writing contained two persons whose active figures were thrown alternately into every graceful attitude of manly vigour as with poles in hand they struggled to force their light craft against the boiling stream  one was a man apparently of about fortyfive years of age  he was a squareshouldered muscular man and from the ruggedness of his general appearance the soiled huntingshirt that was strapped round his waist with a particoloured worsted belt the leather leggings a good deal the worse for wear together with the quiet selfpossessed glance of his grey eye the compressed lip and sunburned brow it was evident that he was a hunter and one who had seen rough work in his day  the expression of his face was pleasing despite a look of habitual severity which sat upon it and a deep scar which traversed his brow from the right temple to the top of his nose it was difficult to tell to what country he belonged  his father was a canadian his mother a scotchwoman  he was born in canada brought up in one of the yankee settlements on the missouri and had from a mere youth spent his life as a hunter in the wilderness  he could speak english french or indian with equal ease and fluency but it would have been hard for any one to say which of the three was his native tongue  the younger man who occupied the stern of the canoe acting the part of steersman was quite a youth apparently about seventeen but tall and stout beyond his years and deeply sunburned  indeed were it not for this fact the unusual quantity of hair that hung in massive curls down his neck and the voyageur costume we should have recognised our young friend charley kennedy again more easily  had any doubts remained in our mind the shout of his merry voice would have scattered them at once  hold hard jacques he cried as the canoe trembled in the current one moment till i get my pole fixed behind this rock  now then shove ahead  ah he exclaimed with chagrin as the pole slipped on the treacherous bottom and the canoe whirled round  mind the rock cried the bowsman giving an energetic thrust with his pole that sent the light bark into an eddy formed by a large rock which rose above the turbulent waters  here it rested while jacques and charley raised themselves on their knees travellers in small canoes always sit in a kneeling position to survey the rapid  its too much for us i fear mr charles said jacques shading his brow with his horny hand  ive paddled up it many a time alone but never saw the water so big as now  humph we shall have to make a portage then i presume  could we not give it one trial more  i think we might make a dash for the tail of that eddy and then the stream above seems not quite so strong  do you think so jacques  jacques was not the man to check a daring young spirit  his motto through life had ever been never venture never wina sentiment which his intercourse among furtraders had taught him to embody in the pithy expression never say die so that although quite satisfied that the thing was impossible he merely replied to his companions speech by an assenting ho and pushed out again into the stream  an energetic effort enabled them to gain the tail of the eddy spoken of when charleys pole snapped across and falling heavily on the gunwale he would have upset the little craft had not jacques whose wits were habitually on the qui vive thrown his own weight at the same moment on the opposite side and counterbalanced charleys slip  the action saved them a ducking but the canoe being left to its own devices for an instant whirled off again into the stream and before charley could seize a paddle to prevent it they were floating in the still water at the foot of the rapids  now isnt that a bore said charley with a comical look of disappointment at his companion  jacques laughed  it was well to try master  i mind a young clerk who came into these parts the same year as i did and he seldom tried anything  he couldnt abide canoes  he didnt want for courage neither but he had a natral dislike to them i suppose that he couldnt help and never entered one except when he was obliged to do so  well one day he wounded a grizzly bear on the banks o the saskatchewan mind the tail o that rapid mr charles well land tother side o yon rock  well the bear made after him and he cut stick right away for the river where there was a canoe hauled up on the bank  he didnt take time to put his rifle aboard but dropped it on the gravel crammed the canoe into the water and jumped in almost driving his feet through its bottom as he did so and then plumped down so suddenly to prevent its capsizing that he split it right across  by this time the bear was at his heels and took the water like a duck  the poor clerk in his hurry swayed from side to side tryin to prevent the canoe goin over but when he went to one side he was so unused to it that he went too far and had to jerk over to the other pretty sharp and so he got worse and worse until he heard the bear give a great snort beside him  then he grabbed the paddle in desperation but at the first dash he missed his stroke and over he went  the current was pretty strong at the place which was lucky for him for it kept him down a bit so that the bear didnt observe him for a little and while it was pokin away at the canoe he was carried downstream like a log and stranded on a shallow  jumping up he made tracks for the wood and the bear which had found out its mistake after him so he was obliged at last to take to a tree where the beast watched him for a day and a night till his friends thinking that something must be wrong sent out to look for him  steady now mr charles a little more to the right  thats it  now if that young man had only ventured boldly into small canoes when he got the chance he might have laughed at the grizzly and killed him too  as jacques finished the canoe glided into a quiet bay formed by an eddy of the rapid where the still water was overhung by dense foliage  is the portage a long one asked charley as he stepped out on the bank and helped to unload the canoe  about half a mile replied his companion  we might make it shorter by poling up the last rapid but its stiff work mr charles and well do the thing quicker and easier at one lift  the two travellers now proceeded to make a portage  they prepared to carry their canoe and baggage overland so as to avoid a succession of rapids and waterfalls which intercepted their further progress  now jacques up with it said charley after the loading had been taken out and placed on the grassy bank  the hunter stooped and seizing the canoe by its centre bar lifted it out of the water placed it on his shoulders and walked off with it into the woods  this was not accomplished by the mans superior strength  charley could have done it quite as well and indeed the strong hunter could have carried a canoe of twice the size with perfect ease  immediately afterwards charley followed with as much of the lading as he could carry leaving enough on the bank to form another load  the banks of the river were steepin some places so much so that jacques found it a matter of no small difficulty to climb over the broken rocks with the unwieldy canoe on his back the more so that the branches interlaced overhead so thickly as to present a strong barrier through which the canoe had to be forced at the risk of damaging its delicate bark covering  on reaching the comparatively level land above however there was more open space and the hunter threaded his way among the tree stems more rapidly making a detour occasionally to avoid a swamp or piece of broken ground sometimes descending a deep gorge formed by a small tributary of the stream they were ascending and which to an unpractised eye would have appeared almost impassable even without the encumbrance of a canoe  but the said canoe never bore jacques more gallantly or safely over the surges of lake or stream than did he bear it through the intricate mazes of the forest now diving down and disappearing altogether in the umbrageous foliage of a dell anon reappearing on the other side and scrambling up the bank on allfours he and the canoe together looking like some frightful yellow reptile of antediluvian proportions and then speeding rapidly forward over a level plain until he reached a sheet of still water above the rapids  here he deposited his burden on the grass and halting only for a few seconds to carry a few drops of the clear water to his lips retraced his steps to bring over the remainder of the baggage  soon afterwards charley made his appearance on the spot where the canoe was left and throwing down his load seated himself on it and surveyed the prospect  before him lay a reach of the stream which spread out so widely as to resemble a small lake in whose clear still bosom were reflected the overhanging foliage of graceful willows and here and there the bright stem of a silver birch whose lightgreen leaves contrasted well with scattered groups and solitary specimens of the spruce fir  reeds and sedges grew in the water along the banks rendering the junction of the land and the stream uncertain and confused  all this and a great deal more charley noted at a glance for the hundreds of beautiful and interesting objects in nature that take so long to describe even partially and are feebly set forth after all even by the most graphic language flash upon the eye in all their force and beauty and are drunk in at once in a single glance  but charley noted several objects floating on the water which we have not yet mentioned  these were five grey geese feeding among the reeds at a considerable distance off and all unconscious of the presence of a human foe in their remote domains  the travellers had trusted very much to their guns and nets for food having only a small quantity of pemmican in reserve lest these should failan event which was not at all likely as the country through which they passed was teeming with wildfowl of all kinds besides deer  these latter however were only shot when they came inadvertently within riflerange as our voyageurs had a definite object in view and could not afford to devote much of their time to the chase  during the day previous to that on which we have introduced them to our readers charley and his companion had been so much occupied in navigating their frail bark among a succession of rapids that they had not attended to the replenishing of their larder so that the geese which now showed themselves were looked upon by charley with a longing eye  unfortunately they were feeding on the opposite side of the river and out of shot  but charley was a hunter now and knew how to overcome slight difficulties  he first cut down a pretty large and leafy branch of a tree and placed it in the bow of the canoe in such a way as to hang down before it and form a perfect screen through the interstices of which he could see the geese while they could only see what was to them no novelty the branch of a tree floating down the stream  having gently launched the canoe charley was soon close to the unsuspecting birds from among which he selected one that appeared to be unusually complacent and selfsatisfied concluding at once with an amount of wisdom that bespoke him a true philosopher that such must as a matter of course be the fattest  bang went the gun and immediately the sleek goose turned round upon its back and stretched out its feet towards the sky waving them once or twice as if bidding adieu to its friend  the others thereupon took to flight with such a deal of sputter and noise as made it quite apparent that their astonishment was unfeigned  bang went the gun again and down fell a second goose  ha exclaimed jacques throwing down the remainder of the cargo as charley landed with his booty thats well  i was just thinking as i comed across that we should have to take to pemmican tonight  well jacques and if we had im sure an old hunter like you who have roughed it so often need not complain said charley smiling  as to that master replied jacques ive roughed it often enough and when it does come to a clear fix i can eat my shoes without grumblin as well as any man  but you see fresh meat is better than dried meat when its to be had and so im glad to see that youve been lucky mr charles  to say truth so am i and these fellows are delightfully plump  but you spoke of eating your shoes jacques when were you reduced to that direful extremity  jacques finished reloading the canoe while they conversed and the two were seated in their places and quietly but swiftly ascending the stream again ere the hunter replied  youve heerd of sir john franklin i spose he inquired after a minutes consideration  yes often  an praps youve heerd tell of his first trip of discovery along the shores of the polar sea  do you refer to the time when he was nearly starved to death and when poor hood was shot by the indian  the same said jacques  oh yes i know all about that  were you with them inquired charley in great surprise  why nonot exactly on the trip but i was sent in winter with provisions to themand much need they had of them poor fellows  i found them tearing away at some old parchment skins that had lain under the snow all winter and that an injins dog would ha turned up his nose atand they dont turn up their snouts at many things i can tell ye  well after we had left all our provisions with them we started for the fort again just keepin as much as would drive off starvation for you see we thought that surely we would git something on the road but neither hoof nor feather did we see all the way i was travellin with an injin and our grub was soon done though we saved it up and only took a mouthful or two the last three days  at last it was done and we was pretty well used up and the fort two days ahead of us  so says i to my comradewho had been looking at me for some time as if he thought that a cut off my shoulder wouldnt be a bad thingsays i nipitabo im afeard the shoes must go for it now so with that i pulls out a pair o deerskin moccasins  they looks tender said i trying to be cheerful  wah said the injin and then i held them over the fire till they was done black and nipitabo ate one and i ate the tother with a lump o snow to wash it down  it must have been rather dry eating said charley laughing  rayther but it was better than the injins leather breeches which we took in hand next day  they was uncommon tough and very dirty havin been worn about a year and a half  howsever they kept us up an as we only ate the legs he had the benefit o the stump to arrive with at the fort next day  whats yon ahead exclaimed charley pausing as he spoke and shading his eyes with his hand  its uncommon like trees said jacques  its likely a tree thats been tumbled across the river and from its appearance i think well have to cut through it  cut through it exclaimed charley if my sight is worth a gunflint well have to cut through a dozen trees  charley was right  the river ahead of them became rapidly narrower and either from the looseness of the surrounding soil or the passing of a whirlwind dozens of trees had been upset and lay right across the narrow stream in terrible confusion  what made the thing worse was that the banks on either side which were low and flat were covered with such a dense thicket down to the waters edge that the idea of making a portage to overcome the barrier seemed altogether hopeless  heres a pretty business to be sure cried charley in great disgust  never say die mister charles replied jacques taking up the axe from the bottom of the canoe its quite clear that cuttin through the trees is easier than cuttin through the bushes so here goes  for fully three hours the travellers were engaged in cutting their way up the encumbered stream during which time they did not advance three miles and it was evening ere they broke down the last barrier and paddled out into a sheet of clear water again  thatll prepare us for the geese jacques said charley as he wiped the perspiration from his brow theres nothing like warm work for whetting the appetite and making one sleep soundly  thats true replied the hunter resuming his paddle  i often wonder how them whitefaced fellows in the settlements manage to keep body and soul togetherasittin as they do all day in the house and alyin all night in a feather bed  for my part rather than live as they do i would cut my way up streams like them weve just passed every day and all day and sleep on top of a flat rock o nights under the blue sky all my life through  with this decided expression of his sentiments the stout hunter steered the canoe up alongside of a huge flat rock as if he were bent on giving a practical illustration of the latter part of his speech then and there  wed better camp now mister charles theres a portage o two miles here and itll take us till sundown to get the canoe and things over  be it so said charley landing  is there a good place at the other end to camp on  firstrate  its smooth as a blanket on the turf and a clear spring bubbling at the root of a wide tree that would keep off the rain if it was to come down like waterspouts  the spot on which the travellers encamped that evening overlooked one of those scenes in which vast extent and rich soft variety of natural objects were united with much that was grand and savage  it filled the mind with the calm satisfaction that is experienced when one gazes on the wide lawns studded with noble trees the spreading fields of waving grain that mingle with stream and copse rock and dell vineyard and garden of the cultivated lands of civilised men while it produced that exulting throb of freedom which stirs mans heart to its centre when he casts a first glance over miles and miles of broad lands that are yet unowned unclaimed that yet lie in the unmutilated beauty with which the beneficent creator originally clothed themfar away from the wellknown scenes of mans chequered history entirely devoid of those ancient monuments of mans power and skill that carry the mind back with feelings of awe to bygone ages yet stamped with evidences of an antiquity more ancient still in the wild primeval forests and the noble trees that have sprouted and spread and towered in their strength for centuriestrees that have fallen at their posts while others took their place and rose and fell as they did like longlived sentinels whose duty it was to keep perpetual guard over the vast solitudes of the great american wilderness  the fire was lighted and the canoe turned bottom up in front of it under the branches of a spreading tree that stood on an eminence whence was obtained a birdseye view of the noble scene  it was a flat valley on either side of which rose two ranges of hills which were clothed to the top with trees of various kinds the plain of the valley itself being dotted with clumps of wood among which the fresh green foliage of the plane tree and the silverstemmed birch were conspicuous giving an airy lightness to the scene and enhancing the picturesque effect of the dark pines  a small stream could be traced winding out and in among clumps of willows reflecting their drooping boughs and the more sombre branches of the spruce fir and the straight larch with which in many places its banks were shaded  here and there were stretches of clearer ground where the green herbage of spring gave to it a lawnlike appearance and the whole magnificent scene was bounded by blue hills that became fainter as they receded from the eye and mingled at last with the horizon  the sun had just set and a rich glow of red bathed the whole scene which was further enlivened by flocks of wildfowls and herds of reindeer  these last soon drew charleys attention from the contemplation of the scenery and observing a deer feeding in an open space towards which he could approach without coming between it and the wind he ran for his gun and hurried into the woods while jacques busied himself in arranging their blankets under the upturned canoe and in preparing supper  charley discovered soon after starting what all hunters discover sooner or laternamely that appearances are deceitful for he no sooner reached the foot of the hill than he found between him and the lawnlike country an almost impenetrable thicket of underwood  our young hero however was of that disposition which sticks at nothing and instead of taking time to search for an opening he took a race and sprang into the middle of it in hopes of forcing his way through  his hopes were not disappointed  he got throughquite throughand alighted up to the armpits in a swamp to the infinite consternation of a flock of teal ducks that were slumbering peacefully there with their heads under their wings and had evidently gone to bed for the night fortunately he held his gun above the water and kept his balance so that he was able to proceed with a dry charge though with an uncommonly wet skin  half an hour brought charley within range and watching patiently until the animal presented his side towards the place of his concealment he fired and shot it through the heart  well done mister charles exclaimed jacques as the former staggered into camp with the reindeer on his shoulders  a fat doe too  ay said charley but she has cost me a wet skin  so pray jacques rouse up the fire and lets have supper as soon as you can  jacques speedily skinned the deer cut a couple of steaks from its flank and placing them on wooden spikes stuck them up to roast while his young friend put on a dry shirt and hung his coat before the blaze the goose which had been shot earlier in the day was also plucked split open impaled in the same manner as the steaks and set up to roast  by this time the shadows of night had deepened and ere long all was shrouded in gloom except the circle of ruddy light around the camp fire in the centre of which jacques and charley sat with the canoe at their backs knives in their hands and the two spits on the top of which smoked their ample supper planted in the ground before them  one by one the stars went out until none were visible except the bright beautiful morning star as it rose higher and higher in the eastern sky  one by one the owls and the wolves illomened birds and beasts of night retired to rest in the dark recesses of the forest little by little the grey dawn overspread the sky and paled the lustre of the morning star until it faded away altogether and then jacques awoke with a start and throwing out his arm brought it accidentally into violent contact with charleys nose  this caused charley to awake not only with a start but also with a roar which brought them both suddenly into a sitting posture in which they continued for some time in a state between sleeping and waking their faces meanwhile expressive of mingled imbecility and extreme surprise  bursting into a simultaneous laugh which degenerated into a loud yawn they sprang up launched and reloaded their canoe and resumed their journey    chapter fourteen  the indian campthe new outpostcharley sent on a mission to the indians  in the councils of the furtraders on the spring previous to that about which we are now writing it had been decided to extend their operations a little in the lands that lie in central america to the north of the saskatchewan river and in furtherance of that object it had been intimated to the chief trader in charge of the district that an expedition should be set on foot having for its object the examination of a territory into which they had not yet penetrated and the establishment of an outpost therein  it was furthermore ordered that operations should be commenced at once and that the choice of men to carry out the end in view was graciously left to the chief traders wellknown sagacity  upon receiving this communication the chief trader selected a gentleman named mr whyte to lead the party gave him a clerk and five men provided him with a boat and a large supply of goods necessary for trade implements requisite for building an establishment and sent him off with a hearty shake of the hand and a recommendation to go and prosper  charles kennedy spent part of the previous year at rocky mountain house where he had shown so much energy in conducting the trade especially what he called the rough and tumble part of it that he was selected as the clerk to accompany mr whyte to his new ground  after proceeding up many rivers whose waters had seldom borne the craft of white men and across innumerable lakes the party reached a spot that presented so inviting an aspect that it was resolved to pitch their tent there for a time and if things in the way of trade and provision looked favourable establish themselves altogether  the place was situated on the margin of a large lake whose shores were covered with the most luxuriant verdure and whose waters teemed with the finest fish while the air was alive with wildfowl and the woods swarming with game here mr whyte rested awhile and having found everything to his satisfaction he took his axe selected a green lawn that commanded an extensive view of the lake and going up to a tall larch struck the steel into it and thus put the first touch to an establishment which afterwards went by the name of stoney creek  a solitary indian whom they had met with on the way to their new home had informed them that a large band of knisteneux had lately migrated to a river about four days journey beyond the lake at which they halted and when the new fort was just beginning to spring up our friend charley and the interpreter jacques caradoc were ordered by mr whyte to make a canoe and then embarking in it to proceed to the indian camp to inform the natives of their rare good luck in having a band of white men come to settle near their lands to trade with them  the interpreter and charley soon found birch bark pine roots for sewing it and gum for plastering the seams wherewith they constructed the light machine whose progress we have partly traced in the last chapter and which on the following day at sunset carried them to their journeys end  from some remarks made by the indian who gave them information of the camp charley gathered that it was the tribe to which redfeather belonged and furthermore that redfeather himself was there at that time so that it was with feelings of no little interest that he saw the tops of the yellow tents embedded among the green trees and soon afterwards beheld them and their picturesque owners reflected in the clear river on whose banks the natives crowded to witness the arrival of the white men  upon the greensward and under the umbrageous shade of the forest trees the tents were pitched to the number of perhaps eighteen or twenty and the whole population of whom very few were absent on the present occasion might number a hundredmen women and children  they were dressed in habiliments formed chiefly of materials procured by themselves in the chase but ornamented with cloth beads and silk thread which showed that they had had intercourse with the furtraders before now  the men wore leggings of deerskin which reached more than halfway up the thigh and were fastened to a leathern girdle strapped round the waist  a loose tunic or huntingshirt of the same material covered the figure from the shoulders almost to the knees and was confined round the middle by a beltin some cases of worsted in others of leather gaily ornamented with quills  caps of various indescribable shapes and made chiefly of skin with the animals tail left on by way of ornament covered their heads and moccasins for the feet completed their costume  these last may be simply described as leather mittens for the feet without fingers or rather toes  they were gaudily ornamented as was almost every portion of costume with porcupines quills dyed with brilliant colours and worked into fanciful and in many cases extremely elegant figures and designs for north american indians oftentimes display an amount of taste in the harmonious arrangement of colour that would astonish those who fancy that education is absolutely necessary to the just appreciation of the beautiful  the women attired themselves in leggings and coats differing little from those of the men except that the latter were longer the sleeves detached from the body and fastened on separately while on their heads they wore caps which hung down and covered their backs to the waist these caps were of the simplest construction being pieces of cloth cut into an oblong shape and sewed together at one end  they were however richly ornamented with silkwork and beads  on landing charley and jacques walked up to a tall goodlooking indian whom they judged from him demeanour and the somewhat deferential regard paid to him by the others to be one of the chief men of the little community  ho what cheer said jacques taking him by the hand after the manner of europeans and accosting him with the phrase used by the furtraders to the natives  the indian returned the compliment in kind and led the visitors to his tent where he spread a buffalo robe for them on the ground and begged them to be seated  a repast of dried meat and reindeer tongues was then served to which our friends did ample justice while the women and children satisfied their curiosity by peering at them through chinks and holes in the tent  when they had finished several of the principal men assembled and the chief who had entertained them made a speech to the effect that he was much gratified by the honour done to his people by the visit of his white brothers that he hoped they would continue long at the camp to enjoy their hospitality and that he would be glad to know what had brought them so far into the country of the red men  during the course of this speech the chief made eloquent allusion to all the good qualities supposed to belong to white men in general and he had no doubt to the two white men before him in particular  he also boasted considerably of the prowess and bravery of himself and his tribe launched a few sarcastic hits at his enemies and wound up with a poetical hope that his guests might live for ever in these beautiful plains of bliss where the sun never sets and nothing goes wrong anywhere and everything goes right at all times and where especially the deer are outrageously fat and always come out on purpose to be shot  during the course of these remarks his comrades signified their hearty concurrence in his sentiments by giving vent to sundry lowtoned hums and hahs and wahs and hohs according to circumstances after it was over jacques rose and addressing them in their own language said  my indian brethren are great  they are brave and their fame has travelled far  their deeds are known even so far as where the great salt lake beats on the shore where the sun rises  they are not women and when their enemies hear the sound of their name they grow pale their hearts become like those of the reindeer  my brethren are famous too in the use of the snowshoe the snare and the gun  the furtraders know that they must build large stores when they come into their lands  they bring up much goods because the young men are active and require much  the silver fox and the marten are no longer safe when their traps and snares are set  yes they are good hunters and we have now come to live among you jacques changed his style as he came nearer to the point to trade with you and to save you the trouble of making long journeys with your skins  a few days distance from your wigwams we have pitched our tents  our young men are even now felling the trees to build a house  our nets are set our hunters are prowling in the woods our goods are ready and my young master and i have come to smoke the pipe of friendship with you and to invite you to come to trade with us  having delivered this oration jacques sat down amid deep silence other speeches of a highly satisfactory character were then made after which the house adjourned and the visitors opening one of their packages distributed a variety of presents to the delighted natives  several times during the course of these proceedings charleys eyes wandered among the faces of his entertainers in the hope of seeing redfeather among them but without success and he began to fear that his friend was not with the tribe  i say jacques he said as they left the tent ask whether a chief called redfeather is here  i knew him of old and half expected to find him at this place  the indian to whom jacques put the question replied that redfeather was with them but that he had gone out on a hunting expedition that morning and might be absent a day or two  ah exclaimed charley im glad hes here  come now let us take a walk in the wood these good people stare at us as if we were ghosts and taking jacquess arm he led him beyond the circuit of the camp turned into a path which winding among the thick underwood speedily screened them from view and led them into a sequestered glade through which a rivulet trickled along its course almost hid from view by the dense foliage and long grasses that overhung it  what a delightful place to live in said charley  do you ever think of building a hut in such a spot as this jacques and settling down altogether  charleys thoughts reverted to his sister kate when he said this  why no replied jacques in a pensive tone as if the question had aroused some sorrowful recollections i cant say that id like to settle here now  there was a time when i thought nothin could be better than to squat in the woods with one or two jolly comrades and jacques sighed but times is changed now master and so is my mind my chums are most of them dead or gone one way or other  no i shouldnt care to squat alone  charley thought of the hut without kate and it seemed so desolate and dreary a dwelling notwithstanding its beautiful situation that he agreed with his companion that to squat alone would never do at all  no man was not made to live alone continued jacques pursuing the subject even the injins draw together  i never knew but one as didnt like his fellows and hes gone now poor fellow  he cut his foot with an axe one day while fellin a tree  it was a bad cut and havin nobody to look after him he half bled and half starved to death  by the way jacques said charley stepping over the clear brook and following the track which led up the opposite bank what did you say to these redskins  you made them a most eloquent speech apparently  why as to that i cant boast much of its eloquence but i think it was clear enough  i told them that they were a great nationfor you see mr charles the red men are just like the white in their fondness for butter so i gave them some to begin with though for the matter o that im not overly fond o givin butter to any man red or white but i holds that its as well always to fall in with the ways and customs o the people a man happens to be among so long as them ways and customs ant contrary to whats right  it makes them feel more kindly to you an dont raise any onnecessary illwill  however the knisteneux are a brave race and when i told them that the hearts of their enemies trembled when they heard of them i told nothing but the truth for the chipewyans are a miserable set and not much given to fighting  your principles on that point wont stand much sifting i fear replied charley according to your own showing you would fall into the chipewyans way of glorifying themselves on account of their bravery if you chanced to be dwelling among them and yet you say they are not brave  that would not be sticking to truth jacques would it  well replied jacques with a smile perhaps not exactly but im sure there could be small harm in helping the miserable objects to boast sometimes for theyve little else than boasting to comfort them  and yet jacques i cannot help feeling that truth is a grand a glorious thing that should not be trifled with even in small matters  jacques opened his eyes a little  then do you think master that a man should never tell a lie no matter what fix he may be in  i think not jacques  the hunter paused a few minutes and looked as if an unusual train of ideas had been raised in his mind by the turn their conversation had taken  jacques was a man of no religion and little morality beyond what flowed from a naturally kind candid disposition and entertained the belief that the end if a good one always justifies the means a doctrine which had it been clearly exposed to him in all its bearings and results would have been spurned by his straightforward nature with the indignant contempt that it merits  mr charles he said at length i once travelled across the plains to the head waters of the missouri with a party of six trappers  one night we came to a part of the plains which was very much broken up with wood here and there and bein a good place for water we camped  while the other lads were gettin ready the supper i started off to look for a deer as we had been unlucky that daywe had shot nothin  well about three miles from the camp i came upon a band o somewhere about thirty sioux illlooking sneaking dogs they are too and before i could whistle they rushed upon me took away my rifle and huntingknife and were dancing round me like so many devils  at last a big blacklookin thief stepped forward and said in the cree language white men seldom travel through this country alone where are your comrades  now thought i heres a nice fix  if i pretend not to understand theyll send out parties in all directions and as sure as fate theyll find my companions in half an hour and butcher them in cold blood for you see we did not expect to find sioux or indeed any injins in them parts so i made believe to be very narvous and tried to tremble all over and look pale  did you ever try to look pale and frightened mr charles  i cant say that i ever did said charley laughing  you cant think how troublesome it is continued jacques with a look of earnest simplicity  i shook and trembled pretty well but the more i tried to grow pale the more i grew red in the face and when i thought of the six broadshouldered rawboned lads in the camp and how easy they would have made these jumping villains fly like chaff if they only knew the fix i was in i gave a frown that had wellnigh showed i was shamming  howsever what with shakin a little more and givin one or two most awful groans i managed to deceive them  then i said i was hunter to a party of white men that were travellin from red river to st louis with all their goods and wives and children and that they were away in the plains about a league off  the big chap looked very hard into my face when i said this to see if i was telling the truth and i tried to make my teeth chatter but it wouldnt do so i took to groanin very bad instead  but them sioux are such awful liars natrally that they couldnt understand the signs of truth even if they saw them  whitefaced coward says he to me tell me in what direction your people are  at this i made believe not to understand but the big chap flourished his knife before my face called me a dog and told me to point out the direction  i looked as simple as i could and said i would rather not  at this they laughed loudly and then gave a yell and said if i didnt show them the direction they would roast me alive  so i pointed towards a part of the plains pretty wide o the spot where our camp was  now lead us to them said the big chap givin me a shove with the butt of his gun an if you have told lies he gave the handle of his scalpinknife a slap as much as to say hed tickle up my liver with it  well away we went in silence me thinkin all the time how i was to get out o the scrape  i led them pretty close past our camp hopin that the lads would hear us  i didnt dare to yell out as that would have showed them there was somebody within hearin and they would have made short work of me just as we came near the place where my companions lay a prairie wolf sprang out from under a bush where it had been sleepin so i gave a loud hurrah and shied my cap at it  giving a loud growl the big injin hit me over the head with his fist and told me to keep silence  in a few minutes i heard the low distant howl of a wolf  i recognised the voice or one of my comrades and knew that they had seen us and would be on our track soon  watchin my opportunity and walkin for a good bit as if i was awful tiredall but done upto throw them off their guard i suddenly tripped up the big chap as he was stepping over a small brook and dived in among the bushes  in a moment a dozen bullets tore up the bark on the trees about me and an arrow passed through my hair  the clump of wood into which i had dived was about half a mile long and as i could run well ive found in my experience that white men are more than a match for redskins at their own work i was almost out of range by the time i was forced to quit the cover and take to the plain  when the blackguard got out of the cover too and saw me cuttin ahead like a deer they gave a yell of disappointment and sent another shower of arrows and bullets after me some of which came nearer than was pleasant  i then headed for our camp with the whole pack screechin at my heels  yell away you stupid sinners thought i some of you shall pay for your music  at that moment an arrow grazed my shoulder and looking over it i saw that the black fellow i had pitched into the water was far ahead of the rest strainin after me like mad and every now and then stopping to try an arrow on me so i kept a lookout and when i saw him stop to draw i stopped too and dodged so the arrows passed me and then we took to our heels again in this way i ran for dear life till i came up to the cover  as i came close up i saw our six fellows crouchin in the bushes and one o them takin aim almost straight for my face  your days come at last thought i looking over my shoulder at the big injin who was drawing his bow again  just then there was a sharp crack heard a bullet whistled past my ear and the big fellow fell like a stone while my comrade stood coolly up to reload his rifle  the injins on seein this pulled up in a moment and our lads stepping forward delivered a volley that made three more o them bite the dust  there would have been six in that fix but somehow or other three of us pitched upon the same man who was afterwards found with a bullet in each eye and one through his heart  they didnt wait for more but turned about and bolted like the wind  now mr charles if i had told the truth that time we would have been all killed and if i had simply said nothin to their questions they would have sent out to scour the country and have found out the camp for sartin so that the only way to escape was by tellin them a heap o downright lies  charley looked very much perplexed at this  you have indeed placed me in a difficulty  i know not what i would have done  i dont know even what i ought to do under these circumstances  difficulties may perplex me and the force of circumstances might tempt me to do what i believed to be wrong  i am a sinner jacques like other mortals i know but one thing i am quite sure ofnamely that when men speak it should always be truth and never falsehood  jacques looked perplexed too  he was strongly impressed with the necessity of telling falsehood in the circumstances in which he had been placed as just related while at the same time he felt deeply the grandeur and the power of charleys last remark  i should have been under the sod now said he if i had not told a lie then  is it better to die than to speak falsehood  some men have thought so replied charley  i acknowledge the difficulty of your case and of all similar cases  i dont know what should be done but i have read of a minister of the gospel whose people were very wicked and would not attend to his instructions although they could not but respect himself he was so consistent and christianlike in his conduct  persecution arose in the country where he lived and men and women were cruelly murdered because of their religious belief  for a long time he was left unmolested but one day a band of soldiers came to his house and asked him whether he was a papist or a protestant papist jacques being a man who has sold his liberty in religious matters to the pope and a protestant being one who protests against such an ineffably silly and unmanly state of slavery  well his people urged the good old man to say he was a papist telling him that he would then be spared to live among them and preach the true faith for many years perhaps  now if there was one thing that this old man would have toiled for and died for it was that his people should become true christiansand he told them so but he added i will not tell a lie to accomplish that end my childrenno not even to save my life  so he told the soldiers that he was a protestant and immediately they carried him away and he was soon afterwards burned to death  well said jacques he didnt gain much by sticking to the truth i think  im not so sure of that  the story goes on to say that he rejoiced that he had done so and wouldnt draw back even when he was in the flames  but the point lies here jacques so deep an impression did the old mans conduct make on his people that from that day forward they were noted for their christian life and conduct  they brought up their children with a deeper reverence for the truth than they would otherwise have done always bearing in affectionate remembrance and holding up to them as an example the unflinching truthfulness of the good old man who was burned in the year of the terrible persecutions and at last their influence and example had such an effect that the protestant religion spread like wildfire far and wide around them so that the very thing was accomplished for which the old pastor said he would have died accomplished too very much in consequence of his death and in a way and to an extent that very likely would not have been the case had he lived and preached among them for a hundred years  i dont understand it nohow said jacques it seems to me right both ways and wrong both ways and all upside down everyhow  charley smiled  your remark is about as clear as my head on the subject jacques but i still remain convinced that truth is right and that falsehood is wrong and that we should stick to the first through thick and thin  i spose remarked the hunter who had walked along in deep cogitation for the last five minutes and had apparently come to some conclusion of profound depth and sagacityi spose that its all human natur that some men takes to preachin as injins take to huntin and that to understand sich things requires them to begin young and risk their lives in it as i would in followin up a grizzly shebear with cubs  yonder is an illustration of one part of your remark  they begin young enough anyhow said charley pointing as he spoke to an opening in the bushes where a particularly small indian boy stood in the act of discharging an arrow  the two men halted to watch his movements  according to a common custom among juvenile indians during the warm months of the year he was dressed in nothing save a mere rag tied round his waist  his body was very brown extremely round fat and wonderfully diminutive while his little legs and arms were disproportionately small  he was so young as to be barely able to walk and yet there he stood his black eyes glittering with excitement his tiny bow bent to its utmost and a bluntheaded arrow about to be discharged at a squirrel whose flight had been suddenly arrested by the unexpected apparition of charley and jacques  as he stood there for a single instant perfectly motionless he might have been mistaken for a grotesque statue of an indian cupid taking advantage of the squirrels pause the child let fly the arrow hit it exactly on the point of the nose and turned it over deada consummation which he greeted with a rapid succession of frightful yells  cleverly done my lad youre a chip of the old block i see said jacques patting the childs head as he passed and retraced his steps with charley to the indian camp    chapter fifteen  the feastcharley makes his first speech in public and meets with an old friendan evening in the grass  savages not less than civilised men are fond of a good dinner  in saying this we do not expect our reader to be overwhelmed with astonishment  he might have guessed as much but when we state that savages upon particular occasions eat six dinners in one and make it a point of honour to do so we apprehend that we have thrown a slightly new light on an old subject  doubtless there are men in civilised society who would do likewise if they could but they cannot fortunately as great gastronomic powers are dependent on severe healthful and prolonged physical exertion  therefore it is that in england we find men capable only of eating about two dinners at once and suffering a good deal for it afterward while in the backwood we see men consume a weeks dinner in one without any evil consequences following the act  the feast which was given by the knisteneux in honour of the visit of our two friends was provided on a more moderate scale than usual in order to accommodate the capacities of the white men three days allowance being cooked for each man  women are never admitted to the public feasts  on the day preceding the ceremony charley and jacques had received cards of invitation from the principal chief in the shape of two quills similar invites being issued at the same time to all the braves  jacques being accustomed to the doings of indians and aware of the fact that whatever was provided for each man must be eaten before he quitted the scene of operations advised charley to eat no breakfast and to take a good walk as a preparative  charley had strong faith however in his digestive powers and felt much inclined when morning came to satisfy the cravings of his appetite as usual but jacques drew such a vivid picture of the work that lay before him that he forbore to urge the matter and went off to walk with a light step and an uncomfortable feeling of vacuity about the region of the stomach  about noon the chiefs and braves assembled in an open enclosure situated in an exposed place on the banks of the river where the proceedings were watched by the women children and dogs  the oldest chief sat himself down on the turf at one end of the enclosure with jacques caradoc on his right hand and next to him charley kennedy who had ornamented himself with a blue stripe painted down the middle of his nose and a red bar across his chin  charleys propensity for fun had led him thus to decorate his face in spite of his companions remonstrancesurging by way of excuse that worthys former argument that it was well to fall in with the ways o the people a man happened to be among so long as these ways and customs were not contrary to what was right  now charley was sure there was nothing wrong in his painting his nose skyblue if he thought fit  jacques thought it was absurd and entertained the opinion that it would be more dignified to leave his face its natral colour  charley didnt agree with him at all  he thought it would be paying the indians a high compliment to follow their customs as far as possible and said that after all his blue nose would not be very conspicuous as he jacques had told him that he would look blue at any rate when he saw the quantity of deers meat he should have to devour  jacques laughed at this but suggested that the bar across his chin was red  whereupon charley said that he could easily neutralise that by putting a green star under each eye and then uttered a fervent wish that his friend harry somerville could only see him in that guise finding him incorrigible jacques who notwithstanding his remonstrances was more than half imbued with charleys spirit gave in and accompanied him to the feast himself decorated with the additional ornament of a red nightcap to whose crown was attached a tuft of white feathers  a fire burned in the centre of the enclosure round which the indians seated themselves according to seniority and with deep solemnity for it is a trait in the indians character that all his ceremonies are performed with extreme gravity  each man brought a dish or platter and a wooden spoon  the old chief whose hair was very grey and his face covered with old wounds and scars received either in war or in hunting having seated himself allowed a few minutes to elapse in silence during which the company sat motionless gazing at their plates as if they half expected them to become converted into beefsteaks  while they were seated thus another party of indians who had been absent on a hunting expedition strode rapidly but noiselessly into the enclosure and seated themselves in the circle  one of these passed close to charley and in doing so stooped took his hand and pressed it  charley looked up in surprise and beheld the face of his old friend redfeather gazing at him with an expression in which were mingled affection surprise and amusement at the peculiar alteration in his visage  redfeather exclaimed charley in delight half rising but the indian pressed him down  you must not rise he whispered and giving his hand another squeeze passed round the circle and took his place directly opposite  having continued motionless for five minutes with becoming gravity the company began operations by proceeding to smoke out of the sacred stem a ceremony which precedes all occasions of importance and is conducted as followsthe sacred stem is placed on two forked sticks to prevent its touching the ground as that would be considered a great evil  a stone pipe is then filled with tobacco by an attendant appointed specially to that office and affixed to the stem which is presented to the principal chief  that individual with a gravity and hauteur that is unsurpassed in the annals of pomposity receives the pipe in both hands blows a puff to the east probably in consequence of its being the quarter whence the sun rises and thereafter pays a similar mark of attention to the other three points  he then raises the pipe above his head points and balances it in various directions for what reason and with what end in view is best known to himself and replaces it again on the forks  the company meanwhile observe his proceedings with sedate interest evidently imbued with the idea that they are deriving from the ceremony a vast amount of edificationan idea which is helped out doubtless by the appearance of the women and children who surround the enclosure and gaze at the proceedings with looks of awestruck seriousness that are quite solemnising to behold  the chief then makes a speech relative to the circumstance which has called them together and which is always more or less interlarded with boastful reference to his own deeds past present and prospective eulogistic remarks on those of his forefathers and a general condemnation of all other indian tribes whatever  these speeches are usually delivered with great animation and contain much poetic allusion to the objects of nature that surround the homes of the savage  the speech being finished the chief sits down amid a universal ho uttered by the company with an emphatic prolongation of the last letterthis syllable being the indian substitute we presume for rapturous applause  the chief who officiated on the present occasion having accomplished the opening ceremonies thus far sat down while the pipebearer presented the sacred stem to the members of the company in succession each of whom drew a few whiffs and mumbled a few words  do as you see the redskins do mr charles whispered jacques while the pipe was going round  thats impossible replied charley in a tone that could not be heard except by his friend  i couldnt make a face of hideous solemnity like that black thief opposite if i was to try ever so hard  dont let them think you are laughing at them returned the hunter they would be ill pleased if they thought so  ill try said charley but it is hard work jacques to keep from laughing i feel like a highpressure steamengine already  theres a woman standing out there with a little brown baby on her back she has quite fascinated me i cant keep my eyes off her and if she goes on contorting her visage much longer i feel that i shall give way  hush  at this moment the pipe was presented to charley who put it to his lips drew three whiffs and returned it with a bland smile to the bearer  the smile was a very sweet one for that was a peculiar trait in the native urbanity of charleys disposition and it would have gone far in civilised society to prepossess strangers in his favour but it lowered him considerably in the estimation of his red friends who entertained a whole some feeling of contempt for any appearance of levity on high occasions  but charleys face was of that agreeable stamp that though gentle and bland when lighted up with a smile is particularly masculine and manly in expression when in repose and the frown that knit his brows when he observed the bad impression he had given almost reinstated him in their esteem  but his popularity became great and the admiration of his swarthy friends greater when he rose and made an eloquent speech in english which jacques translated into the indian language  he told them in reply to the chiefs oration wherein that warrior had complimented his palefaced brothers on their numerous good qualities that he was delighted and proud to meet with his indian friends that the object of his mission was to acquaint them with the fact that a new tradingfort was established not far off by himself and his comrades for their special benefit and behoof that the stores were full of goods which he hoped they would soon obtain possession of in exchange for furs that he had travelled a great distance on purpose to see their land and ascertain its capabilities in the way of furbearing animals and game that he had not been disappointed in his expectations as he had found the animals to be as numerous as bees the fish plentiful in the rivers and lakes and the country at large a perfect paradise  he proceeded to tell them further that he expected they would justify the report he had heard of them that they were a brave nation and good hunters by bringing in large quantities of furs  being strongly urged by jacques to compliment them on their various good qualities charley launched out into an extravagantly poetic vein said that he had heard but he hoped to have many opportunities of seeing it proved that there was no nation under the sun equal to them in bravery activity and perseverance that he had heard of men in olden times who made it their profession to fight with wild bulls for the amusement of their friends but he had no doubt whatever their courage would be made conspicuous in the way of fighting wild bears and buffaloes not for the amusement but the benefit of their wives and children he might have added of the hudsons bay company but he didnt supposing that that was selfevident probably  he complimented them on the way in which they had conducted themselves in war in times past comparing their stealthy approach to enemies camps to the insidious snake that glides among the bushes and darts unexpectedly on its prey said that their eyes were sharp to follow the wartrail through the forest or over the dry sward of the prairie their aim with gun or bow true and sure as the flight of the goose when it leaves the lands of the sun and points its beak to the icy regions of the north their warwhoops loud as the thunders of the cataract and their sudden onset like the lightning flash that darts from the sky and scatters the stout oak in splinters on the plain  at this point jacques expressed his satisfaction at the style in which his young friend was progressing  thats your sort mr charles  dont spare the butter lay it on thick  youve not said too much yet for they are a brave race thats a fact as ive good reason to know  jacques however did not feel quite so well satisfied when charley went on to tell them that although bravery in war was an admirable thing war itself was a thing not at all to be desired and should only be undertaken in case of necessity  he especially pointed out that there was not much glory to be earned in fighting against the chipewyans who everybody knew were a poor timid set of people whom they ought rather to pity than to destroy and recommended them to devote themselves more to the chase than they had done in times past and less to the prosecution of war in time to come  all this and a great deal more did charley say in a manner and with a rapidity of utterance that surprised himself when he considered the fact that he had never adventured into the field of public speaking before  all this and a great deal morea very great deal moredid jacques caradoc interpret to the admiring indians who listened with the utmost gravity and profound attention greeting the close with a very emphatic ho  jacquess translation was by no means perfect  many of the flights into which charley ventured especially in regard to the manners and customs of the savages of ancient greece and rome were quite incomprehensible to the worthy backwoodsman but he invariably proceeded when charley halted giving a flight of his own when at a loss varying and modifying when he thought it advisable and altering adding or cutting off as he pleased  several other chiefs addressed the assembly and then dinner if we may so call it was served  in charleys case it was breakfast to the indians it was breakfast dinner and supper in one  it consisted of a large platter of dried meat reindeer tongues considered a great delicacy and marrowbones  notwithstanding the graphic power with which jacques had prepared his young companion for this meal charleys heart sank when he beheld the mountain of boiled meat that was placed before him  he was ravenously hungry it is true but it was patent to his perception at a glance that no powers of gormandising of which he was capable could enable him to consume the mass in the course of one day  jacques observed his consternation and was not a little entertained by it although his face wore an expression of profound gravity while he proceeded to attack his own dish which was equal to that of his friend  before commencing a small portion of meat was thrown into the fire as a sacrifice to the great master of life  how they do eat to be sure whispered charley to jacques after he had glanced in wonder at the circle of men who were devouring their food with the most extraordinary rapidity  why you must know replied jacques that its considered a point of honour to get it over soon and the man that is done first gets most credit  but its hard work he sighed and paused a little to breathe and ive not got half through yet  its quite plain that i must lose credit with them then if it depends on my eating that  tell me jacques is there no way of escape  must i sit here till it is all consumed  no doubt of it  every bit that has been cooked must be crammed down our throats somehow or other  charley heaved a deep sigh and made another desperate attack on a large steak while the indians around him made considerable progress in reducing their respective mountains  several times charley and redfeather exchanged glances as they paused in their labours  i say jacques said charley pulling up once more how do you get on  pretty well stuffed by this time i should imagine  oh no  ive a good deal o room yet  i give in  credit or disgrace its all one  ill not make a pig of myself for any redskin in the land  jacques smiled  see continued charley theres a fellow opposite who has devoured as much as would have served me for three days  i dont know whether its imagination or not but i do verily believe that hes blacker in the face than when he sat down  very likely replied jacques wiping his lips  now ive done  done you have left at least a third of your supply  true and i may as well tell you for your comfort that there is one way of escape open to you  it is a custom among these fellows that when any one cannot gulp his share o the prog he may get help from any of his friends who can cram it down their throats and as there are always such fellows among these injins they seldom have any difficulty  a most convenient practice replied charley ill adopt it at once  charley turned to his next neighbour with the intent to beg of him to eat his remnant of the feast  bless my heart jacques ive no chance with the fellow on my left hand hes stuffed quite full already and is not quite done with his own share  never fear replied his friend looking at the individual in question who was languidly lifting a marrowbone to his lips hell do it easy i knows the gauge o them chaps and for all his sleepy look just now hes game for a lot more  impossible replied charley looking in despair at his unfinished viands and then at the indian  a glance round the circle seemed further to convince him that if he did not eat it himself there were none of the party likely to do so  youll have to give him a good lump o tobacco to do it though he wont undertake so much for a trifle i can tell you  jacques chuckled as he said this and handed his own portion over to another indian who readily undertook to finish it for him  hell burst i feel certain of that said charley with a deep sigh as he surveyed his friend on the left  at last he took courage to propose the thing to him and just as the man finished the last morsel of his own repast charley placed his own plate before him with a look that seemed to say eat it my friend if you can  the indian much to his surprise immediately commenced to it and in less than half an hour the whole was disposed of  during this scene of gluttony one of the chiefs entertained the assembly with a wild and most unmusical chant to which he beat time on a sort of tambourine while the women outside of the enclosure beat a similar accompaniment  i say master whispered jacques it seems to my observation that the fellow you called redfeather eats less than any injin i ever saw  he has got a comrade to eat more than half of his share now thats strange  it wont appear strange jacques when i tell you that redfeather has lived much more among white men than indians during the last ten years and although voyageurs eat an enormous quantity of food they dont make it a point of honour as these fellows seem to do to eat much more than enough  besides redfeather is a very different man from those around him he has been partially educated by the missionaries on playgreen lake and i think has a strong leaning towards them  while they were thus conversing in whispers redfeather rose and holding forth his hand delivered himself of the following oration  the time has come for redfeather to speak  he has kept silence for many moons now but his heart has been full of words  it is too full he must speak now  redfeather has fought with his tribe and has been accounted a brave and one who loves his people  this is true  he does love even more than they can understand  his friends know that he has never feared to face danger or death in their defence and that if it were necessary he would do so still  but redfeather is going to leave his people now  his heart is heavy at the thought  perhaps many moons will come and go many snows may fall and melt away before he sees his people again and it is this that makes him full of sorrow it is this that makes his head to droop like the branches of the weeping willow  redfeather paused at this point but not a sound escaped from the listening circle the indians were evidently taken by surprise at this abrupt announcement  he proceeded  when redfeather travelled not long since with the white men he met with a paleface who came from the other side of the great salt lake towards the rising sun  this man was called by some of the people a missionary  he spoke wonderful words in the ears of redfeather  he told him of things about the great spirit which he did not know before and he asked redfeather to go and help him to speak to the indians about these strange things  redfeather would not go  he loved his people too much and he thought that the words of the missionary seemed foolishness  but he has thought much about it since  he does not understand the strange things that were told to him and he has tried to forget them but he cannot  he can get no rest  he hears strange sounds in the breeze that shakes the pine  he thinks that there are voices in the waterfall the rivers seem to speak  redfeathers spirit is vexed  the great spirit perhaps is talking to him  he has resolved to go to the dwelling of the missionary and stay with him  the indian paused again but still no sound escaped from his comrades dropping his voice to a soft plaintive tone he continued  but redfeather loves his kindred  he desires very much that they should hear the things that the missionary said  he spoke of the happy huntinggrounds to which the spirits of our fathers have gone and said that we required a guide to lead us there that there was but one guide whose name he said was jesus  redfeather would stay and hunt with his people but his spirit is troubled he cannot rest he must go  redfeather sat down and a long silence ensued  his words had evidently taken the whole party by surprise although not a countenance there showed the smallest symptom of astonishment except that of charley kennedy whose intercourse with indians had not yet been so great as to have taught him to conceal his feelings  at length the old chief rose and after complimenting redfeather on his bravery in general and admitting that he had shown much love to his people on all occasions went into the subject of his quitting them at some length  he reminded him that there were evil spirits as well as good that it was not for him to say which kind had been troubling him but that he ought to consider well before he went to live altogether with palefaces  several other speeches were made some to the same effect and others applauding his resolve  these latter had perhaps some idea that his bringing the palefaced missionary among them would gratify their taste for the marvellousa taste that is pretty strong in all uneducated minds  one man however was particularly urgent in endeavouring to dissuade him from his purpose  he was a tall lowbrowed man muscular and well built but possessed of a most villainous expression of countenance from a remark that fell from one of the company charley discovered that his name was misconna and so learned to his surprise that he was the very indian mentioned by redfeather as the man who had been his rival for the hand of wabisca and who had so cruelly killed the wife of the poor trapper the night on which the chipewyan camp was attacked and the people slaughtered  what reason misconna had for objecting so strongly to redfeathers leaving the community no one could tell although some of those who knew his unforgiving nature suspected that he still entertained the hope of being able some day or other to wreak his vengeance on his old rival but whatever was his object he failed in moving redfeathers resolution and it was at last admitted by the whole party that redfeather was a wise chief that he knew best what ought to be done under the circumstances and it was hoped that his promised visit in company with the missionary would not be delayed many moons  that night in the deep shadow of the trees by the brook that murmured near the indian camp while the stars twinkled through the branches overhead charley introduced redfeather to his friend jacques caradoc and a friendship was struck up between the bold hunter and the red man that grew and strengthened as each successive day made them acquainted with their respective good qualities  in the same place and with the same stars looking down upon them it was further agreed that redfeather should accompany his new friends taking his wife along with him in another canoe as far as their several routes led them in the same direction which was about four or five days journey and that while the one party diverged towards the fort at stoney creek the other should pursue its course to the missionary station on the shores of lake winnipeg  but there was a snake in the grass there that they little suspected misconna had crept through the bushes after them with a degree of caution that might have baffled their vigilance even had they suspected treason in a friendly camp  he lay listening intently to all their plans and when they returned to their camp he rose out from among the bushes like a dark spirit of evil clutched the handle of his scalpingknife and gave utterance to a malicious growl then walking hastily after them his dusky figure was soon concealed among the trees    chapter sixteen  the returnnarrow escapea murderous attempt which failsand a discovery  all nature was joyous and brilliant and bright and beautiful  morning was still very youngabout an hour old  sounds of the most cheerful lighthearted character floated over the waters and echoed through the woods as birds and beasts hurried to and fro with all the bustling energy that betokened preparation and search for breakfast  fish leaped in the pools with a rapidity that brought forcibly to mind that wise saying the more hurry the less speed for they appeared constantly to miss their mark although they jumped twice their own length out of the water in the effort  ducks and geese sprang from their liquid beds with an amazing amount of unnecessary sputter as if they had awakened to the sudden consciousness of being late for breakfast then alighted in the water again with a squash on finding probably that it was too early for that meal but observing other flocks passing and repassing on noisy wing took to flight again unable apparently to restrain their feelings of delight at the freshness of the morning air the brightness of the rising sun and the sweet perfume of the dewy verdure as the mists cleared away over the treetops and lost themselves in the blue sky  everything seemed instinct not only with life but with a large amount of superabundant energy  earth air sky animal vegetable and mineral solid and liquid all were either actually in a state of lively exulting motion or had a peculiarly sprightly look about them as if nature had just burst out of prison en masse and gone raving mad with joy  such was the delectable state of things the morning on which two canoes darted from the camp of the knisteneux amid many expressions of goodwill  one canoe contained our two friends charley and jacques the other redfeather and his wife wabisca  a few strokes of the paddle shot them out into the stream which carried them rapidly away from the scene of their late festivities  in five minutes they swept round a point which shut them out from view and they were swiftly descending those rapid rivers that had cost charley and jacques so much labour to ascend  look out for rocks ahead mr charles cried jacques as he steered the light bark into the middle of a rapid which they had avoided when ascending by making a portage  keep well to the left o yon swirl parbleu if we touch the rock there itll be all over with us  all right was charleys laconic reply  and so it proved for their canoe after getting fairly into the run of the rapid was evidently under the complete command of its expert crew and darted forward amid the foaming waters like a thing instinct with life  now it careered and plunged over the waves where the rough bed of the stream made them more than usually turbulent  anon it flew with increased rapidity through a narrow gap where the compressed water was smooth and black but deep and powerful rendering great care necessary to prevent the canoes frail sides from being dashed on the rocks  then it met a curling wave into which it plunged like an impetuous charger and was checked for a moment by its own violence  presently an eddy threw the canoe a little out of its course disconcerting charleys intention of shaving a rock which lay in their track so that he slightly grazed it in passing  ah mr charles said jacques shaking his head that was not well done an inch more would have sent us down the rapids like drowned cats  true replied charley somewhat crestfallen but you see the other inch was not lost so were not much the worse for it  well after all it was a ticklish bit and i should have guessed that your experience was not up to it quite  ive seen many a man in my day who wouldnt ha done it half so slick an yet ha thought no small beer of himself so you neednt be ashamed mr charles  but wabisca beats you for all that continued the hunter glancing hastily over his shoulder at redfeather who followed closely in their wake he and his modestlooking wife guiding their little craft through the dangerous passage with the utmost sangfroid and precision  weve about run them all now said jacques as they paddled over a sheet of still water which intervened between the rapid they had just descended and another which thundered about a hundred yards in advance  i was so engrossed with the one we have just come down said charley that i quite forgot this one  quite right mr charles said jacques in an approving tone quite right  i holds that a man should always attend to what hes at an to nothin else  ive lived long in the woods now and that fact becomes more and more sartin every day  ive knowd chaps now as timersome as settlement girls that were always in such a mortal funk about what was to happen or might happen that they were never fit for anything that did happen always lookin ahead and never around them of coorse i dont mean that a man shouldnt look ahead at all but their great mistake was that they looked out too far ahead and always kep their eyes nailed there just as if they had the fixin o everything an providence had nothin to do with it at all  i mind a canadian o that sort that travelled in company with me once  we were goin just as we are now mr charles two canoes of ushim and a comrade in one and me and a comrade in tother  one night we got to a lot o rapids that came one after another for the matter o three miles or thereabouts  they were all easy ones however except the last but it was a tickler with a sharp turn o the land that hid it from sight till ye were right into it with a foamin current and a range o ragged rocks that stood straight in front o ye like the teeth of a crosscut saw  it was easy enough however if a man knew it and was a cool hand  well the pauvre canadian was in a terrible takin about this shoot long afore he came to it  he had run it often enough in boats where he was one of a halfdozen men and had nothin to do but look on but he had never steered down it before  when he came to the top o the rapids his mind was so filled with this shoot that he couldnt attend to nothin and scraped agin a dozen rocks in almost smooth water so that when he got little more than halfway down the canoe was as rickety as if it had just come off a six months cruise at last we came to the big rapid and after wed run down our canoe i climbed the bank to see them do it  down they came the poor canadian white as a sheet and his comrade who was brave enough but knew nothin about light craft not very comfortable  at first he could see nothin for the point but in another moment round they went end on for the big rocks  the canadian gave a great yell when he saw them and plunged at the paddle till i thought hed have capsized altogether they ran it well enough straight between the rocks more by good luck than good guidance and sloped down to the smooth water below but the canoe had got such a battering in the rapids above where an injin baby could have steered it in safety that the last plunge shook it all to pieces  it opened up and lay down flat on the water while the two men fell right through the bottom screechin like mad and rolling about among shreds o birchbark  while jacques was thus descanting philosophically on his experiences in time past they had approached the head of the second rapid and in accordance with the principles just enunciated the stout backwoodsman gave his undivided attention to the work before him  the rapid was short and deep so that little care was required in descending it excepting at one point where the stream rushed impetuously between two rocks about six yards asunder  here it was requisite to keep the canoe as much in the middle of the stream as possible  just as they began to feel the drag of the water redfeather was heard to shout in a loud warning tone which caused jacques and charley to back their paddles hurriedly  what can the injin mean i wonder said jacques in a perplexed tone he dont look like a man that would stop us at the top of a strong rapid for nothin  its too late to do that now whatever is his reason said charley as he and his companion struggled in vain to paddle up stream  its o no use mr charles we must run it nowthe currents too strong to make head against  besides i do think the man has only seen a bear or somethin o that sort for i see hes ashore and jumpin among the bushes like a caribou  saying this they turned the canoes head down stream again and allowed it to drift merely retarding its progress a little with the paddles  suddenly jacques uttered a sharp exclamation  mon dieu said he its plain enough now  look there  jacques pointed as he spoke to the narrows which they were now approaching with tremendous speed which increased every instant  a heavy tree lay directly across the stream reaching from rock to rock and placed in such a way that it was impossible for a canoe to descend without being dashed in pieces against it  this was the more curious that no trees grew in the immediate vicinity so that this one must have been designedly conveyed there  there has been foul work here said jacques in a deep tone  we must dive mr charles theres no chance any way else and thats but a poor one  this was true  the rocks on each side rose almost perpendicularly out of the water so that it was utterly impossible to run ashore and the only way of escape as jacques said was by diving under the treea thing involving great risk as the stream immediately below was broken by rocks against which it dashed in foam and through which the chances of steering ones way in safety by means of swimming were very slender indeed  charley made no reply but with tightlycompressed lips and a look of stern resolution on his brow threw off his coat and hastily tied his belt tightly round his waist  the canoe was now sweeping forward with lightning speed in a few minutes it would be dashed to pieces  at that moment a shout was heard in the woods and redfeather darting out rushed over the ledge of rock on which one end of the tree rested seized the trunk in his arms and exerting all his strength hurled it over into the river  in doing so he stumbled and ere he could recover himself a branch caught him under the arm as the tree fell over and dragged him into the boiling stream  this accident was probably the means of saving his life for just as he fell the loud report of a gun rang through the woods and a bullet passed through his cap  for a second or two both man and tree were lost in the foam while the canoe dashed past in safety  the next instant wabisca passed the narrows in her small craft and steered for the tree  redfeather who had risen and sunk several times saw her as she passed and making a violent effort he caught hold of the gunwale and was carried down in safety  ill tell you what it is said jacques as the party stood on a rock promontory after the events just narrated i would give a dollar to have that fellows nose and the sights o my rifle in a line at any distance short of two hundred yards  it was misconna said redfeather  i did not see him but theres not another man in the tribe that could do that  im thankful we escaped jacques  i never felt so near death before and had it not been for the timely aid of our friend here it strikes me that our wild life would have come to an abrupt closegod bless you redfeather said charley taking the indians hand in both of his and kissing it  charleys ebullition of feeling was natural  he had not yet become used to the dangers of the wilderness so as to treat them with indifference jacques on the other hand had risked his life so often that escape from danger was treated very much as a matter of course and called forth little expression of feeling  still it must not be inferred from this that his nature had become callous  the backwoodsmans frame was hard and unyielding as iron but his heart was as soft still as it was on the day on which he first donned the huntingshirt and there was much more of tenderness than met the eye in the squeeze that he gave redfeathers hand on landing  as the four travellers encircled the fire that night under the leafy branches of the forest and smoked their pipes in concert while wabisca busied herself in clearing away the remnants of their evening meal they waxed communicative and stories pathetic comic and tragic followed each other in rapid succession  now redfeather said charley while jacques rose and went down to the luggage to get more tobacco tell jacques about the way in which you got your name  i am sure he will feel deeply interested in that story at least i am certain that harry somerville and i did when you told it to us the day we were windbound on lake winnipeg  redfeather made no reply for a few seconds  will mr charles speak for me he said at length his tongue is smooth and quick  a doubtful kind of compliment said charley laughing but i will if you dont wish to tell it yourself  and dont mention names  do not let him know that you speak of me or my friends said the indian in a low whisper as jacques returned and sat down by the fire again  charley gave him a glance of surprise but being prevented from asking questions he nodded in reply and proceeded to relate to his friend the story that has been recounted in a previous chapter  redfeather leaned back against a tree and appeared to listen intently  charleys powers of description were by no means inconsiderable and the backwoodsmans face assumed a look of goodhumoured attention as the story proceeded  but when the narrator went on to tell of the meditated attack and the midnight march his interest was aroused the pipe which he had been smoking was allowed to go out and he gazed at his young friend with the most earnest attention  it was evident that the hunters spirit entered with deep sympathy into such scenes and when charley described the attack and the death of the trappers wife jacques seemed unable to restrain his feelings  he leaned his elbows on his knees buried his face in his hands and groaned aloud  mr charles he said in a deep voice when the story was ended there are two men i would like to meet with in this world before i die one is the young injin who tried to save that girls life the other is the cowardly villain that took it  i dont mean the one who finished the bloody work my rifle sent his accursed spirit to its own place  your rifle cried charley in amazement  ay mine  it was my wife who was butchered by these savage dogs on that dark night  oh what avails the strength o that right arm said jacques bitterly as he lifted up his clenched fist it was powerless to save herthe sweet girl who left her home and people to follow me a rough hunter through the lonesome wilderness  he covered his face again and groaned in agony of spirit while his whole frame quivered with emotion  jacques remained silent and his sympathising friends refrained from intruding on a sorrow which they felt they had no power to relieve  at length he spoke  yes said he i would give much to meet with the man who tried to save her  i saw him do it twice but the devils about him were too eager to be balked of their prey  charley and the indian exchanged glances  that indians name said the former was redfeather  what exclaimed the trapper jumping to his feet and grasping redfeather who had also risen by the two shoulders stared wildly into his face was it you that did it  redfeather smiled and held out his hand which the other took and wrung with an energy that would have extorted a cry of pain from any one but an indian  then dropping it suddenly and clinching his hands he exclaimed  i said that i would like to meet the villain who killed heryes i said it in passion when your words had roused all my old feelings again but i am thankfuli bless god that i did not know this sooner that you did not tell me of it when i was at the camp for i verily believe that i would not only have fixed him but half the warriors o your tribe too before they had settled me  it need scarcely be added that the friendship which already subsisted between jacques and redfeather was now doubly cemented nor will it create surprise when we say that the former in the fullness of his heart and from sheer inability to find adequate outlets for the expression of his feelings offered redfeather in succession all the articles of value he possessed even to his muchloved rifle and was seriously annoyed at their not being accepted  at last he finished off by assuring the indian that he might look out for him soon at the missionary settlement where he meant to stay with him evermore in the capacity of hunter fisherman and jackofalltrades to the whole clan    chapter seventeen  the scene changesbachelors halla practical joke and its consequencesa snowshoe walk at night in the forest  leaving charley to pursue his adventurous career among the indians we will introduce our reader to a new scene and follow for a time the fortunes of our friend harry somerville  it will be remembered that we left him labouring under severe disappointment at the idea of having to spend a year it might be many years at the depot and being condemned to the desk instead of realising his fond dreams of bearhunting and deerstalking in the woods and prairies  it was now the autumn of harrys second year at york fort  this period of the year happens to be the busiest at the depot in consequence of the preparation of the annual accounts for transmission to england in the solitary ship which visits this lonely spot once a year so that harry was tied to his desk all day and the greater part of the night too till his spirits fell infinitely below zero and he began to look on himself as the most miserable of mortals  his spirits rose however with amazing rapidity after the ship went away and the young gentlemen as the clerks were styled en masse were permitted to run wild in the swamps and woods for the three weeks succeeding that event during this glimpse of sunshine they recruited their exhausted frames by paddling about all day in indian canoes or wandering through the marshes sleeping at nights in tents or under the pine trees and spreading dismay among the feathered tribes of which there were immense numbers of all kinds  after this they returned to their regular work at the desk but as this was not so severe as in summer and was further lightened by wednesdays and saturdays being devoted entirely to recreation harry began to look on things in a less gloomy aspect and at length regained his wonted cheerful spirits  autumn passed away  the ducks and geese took their departure to more genial climes  the swamps froze up and became solid  snow fell in great abundance covering every vestige of vegetable nature except the dark fir trees that only helped to render the scenery more dreary and winter settled down upon the land  within the pickets of york fort the thirty or forty souls who lived there were actively employed in cutting their firewood putting in double windowframes to keep out the severe cold cutting tracks in the snow from one house to another and otherwise preparing for a winter of eight months duration as cold as that of nova zembla and in the course of which the only new faces they had any chance of seeing were those of the two men who conveyed the annual winter packet of letters from the next station  outside of the fort all was a wide waste wilderness for thousands of miles around deathlike stillness and solitude reigned everywhere except when a covey of ptarmigan whirred like large snowflakes athwart the sky or an arctic fox prowled stealthily through the woods in search of prey  as if in opposition to the gloom and stillness and solitude outside the interior of the clerks house presented a striking contrast of ruddy warmth cheerful sounds and bustling activity  it was evening but although the sun had set there was still sufficient daylight to render candles unnecessary though not enough to prevent a bright glare from the stove in the centre of the hall taking full effect in the darkening chamber and making it glow with fiery red  harry somerville sat in front and full in the blaze of this stove resting after the labours of the day his arms crossed on his breast his head a little to one side as if in deep contemplation as he gazed earnestly into the fire and his chair tilted on its hind legs so as to balance with such nicety that a feathers weight additional outside its centre of gravity would have upset it  he had divested himself of his coata practice that prevailed among the young gentlemen when at home as being freeandeasy as well as convenient  the doctor a tall broadshouldered man with red hair and whiskers paced the room sedately with a long pipe depending from his lips which he removed occasionally to address a few remarks to the accountant a stout heavy man of about thirty with a voice like a stentor eyes sharp and active as those of a ferret and a tongue that moved with twice the ordinary amount of lingual rapidity  the doctors remarks seemed to be particularly humorous if one might judge from the peals of laughter with which they were received by the accountant who stood with his back to the stove in such a position that while it warmed him from his heels to his waist he enjoyed the additional benefit of the pipe or chimney which rose upwards parallel with his spine and taking a sudden bend near the roof passed over his headthus producing a genial and equable warmth from top to toe  yes said the doctor i left him hotly following up a rabbittrack in the firm belief that it was that of a silver fox  and did you not undeceive the greenhorn cried the accountant with another shout of laughter  not i replied the doctor  i merely recommended him to keep his eye on the sun lest he should lose his way and hastened home for it just occurred to me that i had forgotten to visit louis blanc who cut his foot with an axe yesterday and whose wound required redressing so i left the poor youth to learn from experience  pray who did you leave to that delightful fate asked mr wilson issuing from his bedroom and approaching the stove  mr wilson was a middleaged goodhumoured active man who filled the onerous offices of superintendent of the men trader of furs seller of goods to the indians and general factotum  our friend hamilton answered the doctor in reply to his question i think he is without exception the most egregious nincompoop i ever saw  just as i passed the long swamp on my way home i met him crashing through the bushes in hot pursuit of a rabbit the track of which he mistook for a fox  poor fellow he had been out since breakfast and only shot a brace of ptarmigan although they are as thick as bees and quite tame  but then do you see said he in excuse im so very shortsighted  would you believe it ive blown fifteen lumps of snow to atoms in the belief that they were ptarmigan and then he rushed off again  no doubt said mr wilson smiling the lad is very green but hes a good fellow for all that  ill answer for that said the accountant i found him over at the mens houses this morning doing your work for you doctor  how so inquired the disciple of aesculapius  attending to your wounded man louis blanc to be sure and he seemed to speak to him as wisely as if he had walked the hospitals and regularly passed for an md  indeed said the doctor with a mischievous grin  then i must pay him off for interfering with my patients  ah doctor youre too fond of practical jokes  you never let slip an opportunity of paying off your friends for something or other  its a bad habit  practical jokes are very bad thingsshockingly bad said mr wilson as he put on his fur cap and wound a thick shawl round his throat preparatory to leaving the room  as mr wilson gave utterance to this opinion he passed harry somerville who was still staring at the fire in deep mental abstraction and as he did so gave his tilted chair a very slight push backwards with his fingeran action which caused harry to toss up his legs grasp convulsively with both hands at empty air and fall with a loud noise and an angry yell to the ground while his persecutor vanished from the scene  o you outrageous villain cried harry shaking his fist at the door as he slowly gathered himself up i might have expected that  quite so said the doctor you might  it was very neatly done undoubtedly  wilson deserves credit for the way in which it was executed  he deserves to be executed for doing it at all replied harry rubbing his elbow as he resumed his seat  any bark knocked off inquired the accountant as he took a piece of glowing charcoal from the stove wherewith to light his pipe  try a whiff harry  its good for such things  bruises sores contusions sprains rheumatic affections of the back and loins carbuncles and earachetheres nothing that smoking wont cure eh doctor  certainly  if applied inwardly theres nothing so good for digestion when one doesnt require tonicstry it harry it will do you good i assure you  no thank you replied harry ill leave that to you and the chimney i dont wish to make a sootbag of my mouth  but tell me doctor what do you mean to do with that lump of snow there  harry pointed to a mass of snow of about two feet square which lay on the floor beside the door  it had been placed there by the doctor some time previously  do with it  have patience my friend and you shall see  it is a little surprise i have in store for hamilton  as he spoke the door opened and a short squarebuilt man rushed into the room with a pistol in one hand and a bright little bullet in the other  hullo skipper cried harry whats the row  all right cried the skipper here it is at last solid as the fluke of an anchor  toss me the powderflask harry look sharp else itll melt  a powderflask was immediately produced from which the skipper hastily charged the pistol and rammed down the shining bullet  now then said he look out for squalls  clear the decks there  and rushing to the door he flung it open took a steady aim at something outside and fired  is the man mad said the accountant as with a look of amazement he beheld the skipper spring through the doorway and immediately return bearing in his arms a large piece of fir plank  not quite mad yet he said in reply but ive sent a ball of quicksilver through an inch plank and thats not a thing to be done every dayeven here although it is cold enough sometimes to freeze up ones very ideas  dear me interrupted harry somerville looking as if a new thought had struck him that must be it  ive no doubt that poor hamiltons ideas are frozen which accounts for the total absence of any indication of his possessing such things  i observed continued the skipper not noticing the interruption that the glass was down at 45 degrees below zero this morning and put out a bulletmould full of mercury and you see the result  as he spoke he held up the perforated plank in triumph  the skipper was a strange mixture of qualities  to a wild offhand sailorlike hilarity of disposition in hours of leisure he united a grave stern energy of character while employed in the performance of his duties  duty was always paramount with him  a smile could scarcely be extracted from him while it was in the course of performance  but the instant his work was done a new spirit seemed to take possession of the man  fun mischief of any kind no matter how childish he entered into with the greatest delight and enthusiasm  among other peculiarities he had become deeply imbued with a thirst for scientific knowledge ever since he had acquired with infinite labour the small modicum of science necessary to navigation and his doings in pursuit of statistical information relative to the weather and the phenomena of nature generally were very peculiar and in some cases outrageous  his transaction with the quicksilver was in consequence of an eager desire to see that metal frozen an effect which takes place when the spiritofwine thermometer falls to 39 degrees below zero of fahrenheit and a wish to be able to boast of having actually fired a mercurial bullet through an inch plank  having made a careful note of the fact with all the relative circumstances attending it in a very much blotted book which he denominated his scientific log the worthy skipper threw off his coat drew a chair to the stove and prepared to regale himself with a pipe  as he glanced slowly round the room while thus engaged his eye fell on the mass of snow before alluded to  on being informed by the doctor for what it was intended he laid down his pipe and rose hastily from his chair  youve not a moment to lose said he  as i came in at the gate just now i saw hamilton coming down the river on the ice and he must be almost arrived now  up with it then cried the doctor seizing the snow and lifting it to the top of the door  hand me those bits of stick harry quick man stir your stumpsnow then skipper fix them in so while i hold this up  the skipper lent willing and effective aid so that in a few minutes the snow was placed in such a position that upon the opening of the door it must inevitably fall on the head of the first person who should enter the room  so said the skipper thats rigged up in what i call a shipshape fashion  true remarked the doctor eyeing the arrangement with a look of approval it will do i think admirably  dont you think skipper said harry somerville gravely as he resumed his seat in front of the fire that it would be worth while to make a careful and minute entry in your private log of the manner in which it was put up to be afterwards followed by an account of its effect  you might write an essay on it now and call it the extraordinary effects of a fall of snow in latitude so and so eh  what think you of it  the skipper vouchsafed no reply but made a significant gesture with his fist which caused harry to put himself in a posture of defence  at this moment footsteps were heard on the wooden platform in front of the building  instantly all became silence and expectation in the hall as the result of the practical joke was about to be realised  just then another step was heard on the platform and it became evident that two persons were approaching the door  hope itll be the right man said the skipper with a look savouring slightly of anxiety  as he spoke the door opened and a foot crossed the threshold the next instant the miniature avalanche descended on the head and shoulders of a man who reeled forward from the weight of the blow and covered from head to foot with snow fell to the ground amid shouts of laughter  with a convulsive stamp and shake the prostrate figure sprang up and confronted the party  had the castiron stove suddenly burst into atoms and blown the roof off the house it could scarcely have created greater consternation than that which filled the merry jesters when they beheld the visage of mr rogan the superintendent of the fort red with passion and fringed with snow  so said he stamping violently with his foot partly from anger and partly with the view of shaking off the unexpected covering which stuck all over his dress in little patches producing a somewhat piebald effectso you are pleased to jest gentlemen  pray who placed that piece of snow over the door  mr rogan glared fiercely round upon the culprits who stood speechless before him  for a moment he stood silent as if uncertain how to act then turning short on his heel he strode quickly out of the room nearly overturning mr hamilton who at the same instant entered it carrying his gun and snowshoes under his arm  dear me what has happened he exclaimed in a peculiarly gentle tone of voice at the same time regarding the snow and the horrorstricken circle with a look of intense surprise  you see what has happened replied harry somerville who was the first to recover his composure i presume you intended to ask what has caused it to happen  perhaps the skipper will explain its beyond me quite  thus appealed to that worthy cleared his throat and said  why you see mr hamilton a great phenomenon of meteorology has happened  we were all standing you must know at the open door taking a squint at the weather when our attention was attracted by a curious object that appeared in the sky and seemed to be coming down at the rate of ten knots an hour right endon for the house  i had just time to cry clear out lads when it came slap in through the doorway and smashed to shivers there where you see the fragments  in fact its a wonderful aerolite and mr rogan has just gone out with a lot of the bits in his pocket to make a careful examination of them and draw up a report for the geological society in london  i shouldnt wonder if he were to send off an express tonight and maybe you will have to convey the news to headquarters so youd better go and see him about it soon  soft although mr hamilton was supposed to be he was not quite prepared to give credit to this explanation but being of a peaceful disposition and altogether unaccustomed to retort he merely smiled his disbelief as he proceeded to lay aside his fowlingpiece and divest himself of the voluminous outofdoor trappings with which he was clad mr hamilton was a tall slender youth of about nineteen  he had come out by the ship in autumn and was spending his first winter at york fort  up to the period of his entering the hudsons bay companys service he had never been more than twenty miles from home and having mingled little with the world was somewhat unsophisticated besides being by nature gentle and unassuming  soon after this the man who acted as cook waiter and butler to the mess entered and said that mr rogan desired to see the accountant immediately  who am i to say did it inquired that gentleman as he rose to obey the summons  wouldnt it be a disinterested piece of kindness if you were to say it was yourself suggested the doctor  perhaps it would but i wont replied the accountant as he made his exit  in about half an hour mr rogan and the accountant reentered the apartment  the former had quite regained his composure  he was naturally amiable which happy disposition was indicated by a habitually cheerful look and smile  now gentlemen said he i find that this practical joke was not intended for me and therefore look upon it as an unlucky accident but i cannot too strongly express my dislike to practical jokes of all kinds  i have seen great evil and some bloodshed result from practical jokes and i think that being a sufferer in consequence of your fondness for them i have a right to beg that you will abstain from such doings in futureat least from such jokes as involve risk to those who do not choose to enter into them  having given vent to this speech mr rogan left his volatile friends to digest it at their leisure  serves us right said the skipper pacing up and down the room in a repentant frame of mind with his thumbs hooked into the armholes of his vest  the doctor said nothing but breathed hard and smoked vigorously  while we admit most thoroughly with mr rogan that practical jokes are exceedingly bad and productive frequently of far more evil than fun we feel it our duty as a faithful delineator of manners customs and character in these regions to urge in palliation of the offence committed by the young gentlemen at york fort that they had really about as few amusements and sources of excitement as fall to the lot of any class of men  they were entirely dependent on their own unaided exertions during eight or nine months of the year for amusement or recreation of any kind  their books were few in number and soon read through  the desolate wilderness around afforded no incidents to form subjects of conversation further than the events of a days shooting which being nearly similar every day soon lost all interest  no newspapers came to tell of the doings of the busy world from which they were shut out and nothing occurred to vary the dull routine of their life so that it is not matter for wonder that they were driven to seek for relaxation and excitement occasionally in most outrageous and unnatural ways and to indulge now and then in the perpetration of a practical joke  for some time after the rebuke administered by mr rogan silence reigned in bachelors hall as the clerks house was termed  but at length symptoms of ennui began to be displayed  the doctor yawned and lay down on his bed to enjoy an american newspaper about twelve months old  harry somerville sat down to reread a volume of franklins travels in the polar regions which he had perused twice already  mr hamilton busied himself in cleaning his fowlingpiece while the skipper conversed with mr wilson who was engaged in his room in adjusting an ivory head to a walkingstick  mr wilson was a jackofalltrades who could make shift one way or other to do anything  the accountant paced the uncarpeted floor in deep contemplation  at length he paused and looked at harry somerville for some time  what say you to a walk through the woods to north river harry  ready cried harry tossing down the book with a look of contemptready for anything  will you come hamilton added the accountant  hamilton looked up in surprise  you dont mean surely to take so long a walk in the dark do you  it is snowing too very heavily and i think you said that north river was five miles off did you not  of course i mean to walk in the dark replied the accountant unless you can extemporise an artificial light for the occasion or prevail on the moon to come out for my special benefit  as to snowing and a short tramp of five miles why the sooner you get to think of such things as trifles the better if you hope to be fit for anything in this country  i dont think much of them replied hamilton softly and with a slight smile i only meant that such a walk was not very attractive so late in the evening  attractive shouted harry somerville from his bedroom where he was equipping himself for the walk what can be more attractive than a sharp run of ten miles through the woods on a cool night to visit your traps with the prospect of a silver fox or a wolf at the end of it and an extra sound sleep as the result  come man dont be soft get ready and go along with us  besides added the accountant i dont mean to come back tonight tomorrow you know is a holiday so we can camp out in the snow after visiting the traps have our supper and start early in the morning to search for ptarmigan  well i will go said hamilton after this account of the pleasures that were to be expected i am exceedingly anxious to learn to shoot birds on the wing  bless me have you not learned that yet asked the doctor in affected surprise as he sauntered out of his bedroom to relight his pipe  the various bedrooms in the clerks house were ranged round the hall having doors that opened directly into it so that conversation carried on in a loud voice was heard in all the rooms at once and was not unfrequently sustained in elevated tones from different apartments when the occupants were lounging as they often did of an evening in their beds  no said hamilton in reply to the doctors question i have not learned yet although there were a great many grouse in the part of scotland where i was brought up  but my aunt with whom i lived was so fearful of my shooting either myself or some one else and had such an aversion to firearms that i determined to make her mind easy by promising that i would never use them so long as i remained under her roof  quite right very dutiful and proper said the doctor with a grave patronising air  perhaps youll fall in with more fox tracks of the same sort as the one you gave chase to this morning shouted the skipper from wilsons room  oh theres hundreds of them out there said the accountant so lets off at once  the trio now proceeded to equip themselves for the walk  their costumes were peculiar and merit description  as they were similar in the chief points it will suffice to describe that of our friend harry  on his head he wore a fur cap made of otterskin with a flap on each side to cover the ears the frost being so intense in these climates that without some such protection they would inevitably freeze and fall off  as the nose is constantly in use for the purposes of respiration it is always left uncovered to fight with the cold as it best can but it is a hard battle and there is no doubt that if it were possible a nasal covering would be extremely pleasant  indeed several desperate efforts have been made to construct some sort of nosebag but hitherto without success owing to the uncomfortable fact that the breath issuing from that organ immediately freezes and converts the covering into a bag of snow or ice which is not agreeable  round his neck harry wound a thick shawl of such portentous dimensions that it entirely enveloped the neck and lower part of the face thus the entire head was as it were eclipsedthe eyes the nose and the cheekbones alone being visible  he then threw on a coat made of deerskin so prepared that it bore a slight resemblance to excessively coarse chamois leather  it was somewhat in the form of a long wide surtout overlapping very much in front and confined closely to the figure by means of a scarlet worsted belt instead of buttons and was ornamented round the foot by a number of cuts which produced a fringe of little tails  being lined with thick flannel this portion of attire was rather heavy but extremely necessary  a pair of blue cloth leggings having a loose flap on the outside were next drawn over the trousers as an additional protection to the knees  the feet besides being portions of the body that are peculiarly susceptible of cold had further to contend against the chafing of the lines which attach them to the snowshoes so that special care in their preparation for duty was necessary  first were put on a pair of blanketing or duffel socks which were merely oblong in form without sewing or makingup of any kind  these were wrapped round the feet which were next thrust into a pair of madeup socks of the same material having anklepieces above these were put another pair without flaps for the ankles  over all was drawn a pair of moccasins made of stout deerskin similar to that of the coat  of course the elegance of harrys feet was entirely destroyed and had he been met in this guise by any of his friends in the old country they would infallibly have come to the conclusion that he was afflicted with gout over his shoulders he slung a powderhorn and shotpouch the latter tastefully embroidered with dyed quillwork  a pair of deerskin mittens having a little bag for the thumb and a large bag for the fingers completed his costume  while the three were making ready with a running accompaniment of grunts and groans at refractory pieces of apparel the night without became darker and the snow fell thicker so that when they issued suddenly out of their warm abode and emerged into the sharp frosty air which blew the snowdrift into their eyes they felt a momentary desire to give up the project and return to their comfortable quarters  what a dismallooking night it is said the accountant as he led the way along the wooden platform towards the gate of the fort  very replied hamilton with an involuntary shudder  keep up your heart said harry in a cheerful voice youve no notion how your mind will change on that point when you have walked a mile or so and got into a comfortable heat  i must confess however that a little moonshine would be an improvement he added on stumbling for the third time off the platform into the deep snow  it is full moon just now said the accountant and i think the clouds look as if they would break soon  at any rate ive been at north river so often that i believe i could walk out there blindfold  as he spoke they passed the gate and diverging to the right proceeded as well as the imperfect light permitted along the footpath that led to the forest    chapter eighteen  the walk continuedfrozen toesan encampment in the snow  after quitting york fort the three friends followed the track leading to the spot where the winters firewood was cut  snow was still falling thickly and it was with some difficulty that the accountant kept in the right direction  the night was excessively dark while the dense fir forest through which the narrow road ran rendered the gloom if possible more intense  when they had proceeded about a mile their leader suddenly came to a stand  we must quit the track now said he so get on your snowshoes as fast as you can  hitherto they had carried their snowshoes under their arms as the beaten track along which they travelled rendered them unnecessary but now having to leave the path and pursue the remainder of their journey through deep snow they availed themselves of those useful machines by means of which the inhabitants of this part of north america are enabled to journey over many miles of trackless wilderness with nearly as much ease as a sportsman can traverse the moors in autumn and that over snow so deep that one hours walk through it without such aids would completely exhaust the stoutest trapper and advance him only a mile or so on his journey  in other words to walk without snowshoes would be utterly impossible while to walk with them is easy and agreeable  they are not used after the manner of skates with a sliding but a stepping action and their sole use is to support the wearer on the top of snow into which without them he would sink up to the waist when we say that they support the wearer on the top of the snow of course we do not mean that they literally do not break the surface at all  but the depth to which they sink is comparatively trifling and varies according to the state of the snow and the season of the year in the woods they sink frequently about six inches sometimes more sometimes less while on frozen rivers where the snow is packed solid by the action of the wind they sink only two or three inches and sometimes so little as to render it preferable to walk without them altogether  snowshoes are made of a light strong framework of wood varying from three to six feet long by eighteen and twenty inches broad tapering to a point before and behind and turning up in front different tribes of indians modify the form a little but in all essential points they are the same  the framework is filled up with a netting of deerskin threads which unites lightness with great strength and permits any snow that may chance to fall upon the netting to pass through it like a sieve  on the present occasion the snow having recently fallen was soft and the walking consequently what is called heavy  come on shouted the accountant as he came to a stand for the third time within half an hour to await the coming up of poor hamilton who being rather awkward in snowshoe walking even in daylight found it nearly impossible in the dark  wait a little please replied a faint voice in the distance ive got among a quantity of willows and find it very difficult to get on ive been down twice al  the sudden cessation of the voice and a loud crash as of breaking branches proved too clearly that our friend had accomplished his third fall  there he goes again exclaimed harry somerville who came up at the moment  ive helped him up once already  well never get to north river at this rate  what is to be done  lets see what has become of him this time however said the accountant as he began to retrace his steps  if i mistake not he made rather a heavy plunge that time judging from the sound  at that moment the clouds overhead broke and a moonbeam shot down into the forest throwing a pale light over the cold scene  a few steps brought harry and the accountant to the spot whence the sound had proceeded and a loud startling laugh rang through the night air as the latter suddenly beheld poor hamilton struggling with his arms head and shoulders stuck into the snow his snowshoes twisted and sticking with the heels up and awry in a sort of rampant confusion and his gun buried to the locks beside him  regaining ones perpendicular after a fall in deep snow when the feet are encumbered by a pair of long snowshoes is by no means an easy thing to accomplish in consequence of the impossibility of getting hold of anything solid on which to rest the hands  the depth is so great that the outstretched arms cannot find bottom and every successive struggle only sinks the unhappy victim deeper down  should no assistance be near he will soon beat the snow to a solidity that will enable him to rise but not in a very enviable or comfortable condition  give me a hand harry gasped hamilton as he managed to twist his head upwards for a moment  here you are cried harry holding out his hand and endeavouring to suppress his desire to laugh up with you and in another moment the poor youth was upon his legs with every fold and crevice about his person stuffed to repletion with snow  come cheer up cried the accountant giving the youth a slap on the back theres nothing like experiencethe proverb says that it even teaches fools so you need not despair  hamilton smiled as he endeavoured to shake off some of his white coating  well be all right immediately added harry i see that the country ahead is more open so the walking will be easier  oh i wish that i had not come said hamilton sorrowfully because i am only detaining you  but perhaps i shall do better as we get on  at any rate i cannot go back now as i could never find the way  go back of course not said the accountant in a short time we shall get into the old woodcutters track of last year and although its not beaten at all yet it is pretty level and open so that we shall get on famously  go on then sighed hamilton  drive ahead laughed harry and without further delay they resumed their march which was soon rendered more cheerful as the clouds rolled away the snow ceased to fall and the bright full moon poured its rays down upon their path  for a long time they proceeded in silence the muffled sound of the snow as it sank beneath their regular footsteps being the only interruption to the universal stillness around  there is something very solemnising in a scene such as we are now describingthe calm tranquillity of the arctic night the pure whiteness of the snowy carpet which rendered the dark firs inky black by contrast the clear cold starry sky that glimmered behind the dark clouds whose heavy masses now rolling across the moon partially obscured the landscape and anon passing slowly away let a flood of light down upon the forest which penetrating between the thick branches scattered the surface of the snow as it were with flakes of silver  sleep has often been applied as a simile to nature in repose but in this case death seemed more appropriate  so silent so cold so still was the scene that it filled the mind with an indefinable feeling of dread as if there was some mysterious danger near  once or twice during their walk the three travellers paused to rest but they spoke little and in subdued voices as if they feared to break the silence of the night  it is strange said harry in a low tone as he walked beside hamilton that such a scene as this always makes me think more than usual of home  and yet it is natural replied the other because it reminds us more forcibly than any other that we are in a foreign landin the lonely wildernessfar away from home  both harry and hamilton had been trained in families where the almighty was feared and loved and where their minds had been early led to reflect upon the creator when regarding the works of his hand their thoughts therefore naturally reverted to another home compared with which this world is indeed a cold lonely wilderness but on such subjects they feared to converse partly from a dread of the ridicule of reckless companions partly from ignorance of each others feelings on religious matters and although their minds were busy their tongues were silent  the ground over which the greater part of their path lay was a swamp which being now frozen was a beautiful white plain so that their advance was more rapid until they approached the belt of woodland that skirts north river  here they again encountered the heavy snow which had been such a source of difficulty to hamilton at setting out  he had profited by his former experience however and by the exercise of an excessive degree of caution managed to scramble through the woods tolerably well emerging at last along with his companions on the bleak margin of what appeared to be the frozen sea  north river at this place is several miles broad and the opposite shore is so low that the snow causes it to appear but a slight undulation of the frozen bed of the river  indeed it would not be distinguishable at all were it not for the willow bushes and dwarf pines whose tops rising above the white garb of winter indicate that terra firma lies below  what a cold desolatelooking place said hamilton as the party stood still to recover breath before taking their way over the plain to the spot where the accountants traps were set  it looks much more like the frozen sea than a river  it can scarcely be called a river at this place remarked the accountant seeing that the water hereabouts is brackish and the tides ebb and flow a good way up  in fact this is the extreme mouth of north river and if you turn your eyes a little to the right towards yonder icehummock in the plain you behold the frozen sea itself  where are your traps set inquired harry  down in the hollow behind yon point covered with brushwood  oh we shall soon get to them then come along cried harry  harry was mistaken however  he had not yet learned by experience the extreme difficulty of judging of distance in the uncertain light of nighta difficulty that was increased by his ignorance of the locality and by the gleams of moonshine that shot through the driving clouds and threw confused fantastic shadows over the plain  the point which he had at first supposed was covered with low bushes and about a hundred yards off proved to be clad in reality with large bushes and small trees and lay at a distance of two miles  i think you have been mistaken in supposing the point so near harry said hamilton as he trudged on beside his friend  a fact evident to the naked eye replied harry  how do your feet stand it eh  beginning to lose bark yet  hamilton did not feel quite sure  i think said he softly that there is a blister under the big toe of my left foot  it feels very painful  if you feel at all uncertain about it you may rest assured that there is a blister  these things dont give much pain at first  im sorry to tell you my dear fellow that youll be painfully aware of the fact tomorrow  however dont distress yourself its a part of the experience that every one goes through in this country  besides said harry smiling we can send to the fort for medical advice  dont bother the poor fellow and hold your tongue harry said the accountant who now began to tread more cautiously as he approached the place where the traps were set  how many traps have you inquired harry in a low tone  three replied the accountant  do you know i have a very strange feeling about my heelsor rather a want of feeling said hamilton smiling dubiously  a want of feeling what do you mean cried the accountant stopping suddenly and confronting his young friend  oh i daresay its nothing he exclaimed looking as if ashamed of having spoken of it only i feel exactly as if both my heels were cut off and i were walking on tiptoe  say you so then right about wheel  your heels are frozen man and youll lose them if you dont look sharp  frozen cried hamilton with a look of incredulity  ay frozen and its lucky you told me  ive a place up in the woods here which i call my winter camp where we can get you put to rights but step out the longer we are about it the worse for you  harry somerville was at first disposed to think that the accountant jested but seeing that he turned his back towards his traps and made for the nearest point of the thick woods with a stride that betokened thorough sincerity he became anxious too and followed as fast as possible  the place to which the accountant led his young friends was a group of fir trees which grew on a little knoll that rose a few feet above the surrounding level country  at the foot of this hillock a small rivulet or burn ran in summer but the only evidence of its presence now was the absence of willow bushes all along its covered narrow bed  a level tract was thus formed by nature free from all underwood and running inland about the distance of a mile where it was lost in the swamp whence the stream issued  the wooded knoll or hillock lay at the mouth of this brook and being the only elevated spot in the neighbourhood besides having the largest trees growing on it had been selected by the accountant as a convenient place for camping out on when he visited his traps in winter and happened to be either too late or disinclined to return home  moreover the spreading fir branches afforded an excellent shelter alike from wind and snow in the centre of the clump while from the margin was obtained a partial view of the river and the sea beyond  indeed from this lookout there was a very fine prospect on clear winter nights of the white landscape enlivened occasionally by groups of arctic foxes which might be seen scampering about in sport and gambolling among the hummocks of ice like young kittens  now we shall turn up here said the accountant as he walked a short way up the brook before mentioned and halted in front of what appeared to be an impenetrable mass of bushes  we shall have to cut our way then said harry looking to the right and left in the vain hope of discovering a place where the bushes being less dense they might effect an entrance into the knoll or grove  not so  i have taken care to make a passage into my winter camp although it was only a whim after all to make a concealed entrance seeing that no one ever passes this way except wolves and foxes whose noses render the use of their eyes in most cases unnecessary  so saying the accountant turned aside a thick branch and disclosed a narrow track into which he entered followed by his two companions  a few minutes brought them to the centre of the knoll  here they found a clear space of about twenty feet in diameter around which the trees circled so thickly that in daylight nothing could be seen but treestems as far as the eye could penetrate while overhead the broad flat branches of the firs with their evergreen verdure spread out and interlaced so thickly that very little light penetrated into the space below  of course at night even in moonlight the place was pitch dark into this retreat the accountant led his companions and bidding them stand still for a minute lest they should tumble into the fireplace he proceeded to strike a light  those who have never travelled in the wild parts of this world can form but a faint conception of the extraordinary and sudden change that is produced not only in the scene but in the mind of the beholder when a blazing fire is lighted in a dark night  before the fire is kindled and you stand perhaps as harry and his friend did on the present occasion shivering in the cold the heart sinks and sad gloomy thoughts arise while your eye endeavours to pierce the thick darkness which if it succeed in doing so only adds to the effect by disclosing the pallid snow the cold chilling beams of the moon the white vistas of savage scenery the aweinspiring solitudes that tell of your isolated condition or stir up sad memories of other and fardistant scenes  but the moment the first spark of fire sends a fitful gleam of light upwards these thoughts and feelings take wing and vanish  the indistinct scenery is rendered utterly invisible by the red light which attracts and rivets the eye as if by a species of fascination  the deep shadows of the woods immediately around you grow deeper and blacker as the flames leap and sparkle upwards causing the stems of the surrounding trees and the foliage of the overhanging branches to stand out in bold relief bathed in a ruddy glow which converts the forest chamber into a snug homelike place and fills the mind with agreeable homelike feelings and meditations  it seems as if the spirit in the one case were set loose and etherealised to enable it to spread itself over the plains of cold cheerless illimitable space and left to dwell upon objects too wide to grasp too indistinct to comprehend while in the other it is recalled and concentrated upon matters circumscribed and congenial things of which it has long been cognisant and which it can appreciate and enjoy without the effort of a thought  some such thoughts and feelings passed rapidly through the minds of harry and hamilton while the accountant struck a light and kindled a roaring fire of logs which he had cut and arranged there on a previous occasion  in the middle of the space thus brilliantly illuminated the snow had been cleared away till the moss was uncovered thus leaving a hole of about ten feet in diameter  as the snow was quite four feet deep the hole was surrounded with a pure white wall whose height was further increased by the masses thrown out in the process of digging to nearly six feet  at one end of this space was the large fire which had just been kindled and which owing to the intense cold only melted a very little of the snow in its immediate neighbourhood  at the other end lay a mass of flat pine branches which were piled up so thickly as to form a pleasant elastic couch the upper end being slightly raised so as to form a kind of bolster while the lower extended almost into the fire  indeed the branches at the extremity were burnt quite brown and some of them charred  beside the bolster lay a small wooden box a round tin kettle an iron teakettle two tin mugs a hatchet and a large bundle tied up in a green blanket  there were thus as it were two apartments one within the othernamely the outer one whose walls were formed of treestems and thick darkness and the ceiling of green boughs and then the inner one with walls of snow that sparkled in the firelight as if set with precious stones and a carpet of evergreen branches  within this latter our three friends were soon actively employed  poor hamiltons moccasins were speedily removed and his friends going down on their knees began to rub his feet with a degree of energy that induced him to beg for mercy  mercy exclaimed the accountant without pausing for an instant faith its little mercy there would be in stopping just nowrub away harry  dont give in  theyre coming right at last  after a very severe rubbing the heels began to show symptoms of returning vitality  they were then wrapped up in the folds of a thick blanket and held sufficiently near to the fire to prevent any chance of the frost getting at them again  now my boy said the accountant as he sat down to enjoy a pipe and rest himself on a blanket which along with the one wrapped round hamiltons feet had been extracted from the green bundle before mentionednow my boy youll have to enjoy yourself here as you best can for an hour or two while harry and i visit the traps  would you like supper before we go or shall we have it on our return  oh ill wait for it by all means till you return  i dont feel a bit hungry just now and it will be much more cheerful to have it after all your work is over  besides i feel my feet too painful to enjoy it just now  my poor fellow said harry whose heart smote him for having been disposed at first to treat the thing lightly im really sorry for you would you not like me to stay with you  by no means replied hamilton quickly  you can do nothing more for me harry and i should be very sorry if you missed seeing the traps  oh never mind the traps  ive seen traps and set them too fifty times before now  ill stop with you old boy i will said harry doggedly while he made arrangements to settle down for the evening  well if you wont go i will said hamilton coolly as he unwound the blanket from his feet and began to pull on his socks  bravo my lad exclaimed the accountant patting him approvingly on the back i didnt think you had half so much pluck in you  but it wont do old fellow  youre in my castle just now and must obey orders  you couldnt walk half a mile for your life so just be pleased to pull off your socks again  besides i want harry to help me to carry up my foxes if there are anyso get ready sirrah  ay ay captain cried harry with a laugh while he sprang up and put on his snowshoes  you neednt bring your gun said the accountant shaking the ashes from his pipe as he prepared to depart but you may as well shove that axe into your belt you may want itnow mind dont roast your feet he added turning to hamilton  adieu cried harry with a nod and a smile as he turned to go  take care the bears dont find you out  no fear  goodbye harry replied hamilton as his two friends disappeared in the wood and left him to his solitary meditations    chapter nineteen  shows how the accountant and harry set their traps and what came of it  the moon was still up and the sky less overcast when our amateur trappers quitted the encampment and descending to the mouth of the little brook took their way over north river in the direction of the accountants traps  being somewhat fatigued both in mind and body by the unusual exertions of the night neither of them spoke for some time but continued to walk in silence contemplatively gazing at their long shadows  did you ever trap a fox harry said the accountant at length  yes i used to set traps at red river  but the foxes there are not numerous and are so closely watched by the dogs that they have become suspicious  i caught but few  then you know how to set a trap  oh yes ive set both steel and snow traps often  youve heard of old labonte who used to carry one of the winter packets from red river until within a few years back  yes ive heard of him his name is in my ledgerat least if you mean pierre labonte who came down last fall with the brigade  the same  well he was a great friend of mine  his little cabin lay about two miles from fort garry and after work was over in the office i used to go down to sit and chat with him by the fire and many a time i have sat up half the night listening to him as he recounted his adventures  the old man never tired of relating them and of smoking twist tobacco  among other things he set my mind upon trapping by giving me an account of an expedition he made when quite a youth to the rocky mountains so i got him to go into the woods and teach me how to set traps and snares and i flatter myself he found me an apt pupil  humph ejaculated the accountant i have no doubt you do flatter yourself  but here we are  the traps are just beyond that mound so look out and dont stick your feet into them  hist exclaimed harry laying his hand suddenly on his companions arm  do you see that pointing towards the place where the traps were said to be  you have sharp eyes younker  i do see it now that you point it out  its a fox and caught too as im a scrivener  youre in luck tonight exclaimed harry eagerly  its a silver fox  i see the white tip on its tail  nonsense cried the accountant hastening forward but well soon settle the point  harry proved to be right  on reaching the spot they found a beautiful black fox caught by the fore leg in a steel trap and gazing at them with a look of terror  the skin of the silver foxso called from a slight sprinkling of pure white hairs covering its otherwise jetblack bodyis the most valuable fur obtained by the furtraders and fetches an enormous price in the british market so much as thirty pounds sterling being frequently obtained for a single skin  the foxes vary in colour from jet black which is the most valuable to a light silvery hue and are hailed as great prizes by the indians and trappers when they are so fortunate as to catch them  they are not numerous however and being exceedingly wary and suspicious are difficult to catch  it may be supposed therefore that our friend the accountant ran to secure his prize with some eagerness  now then my beauty dont shrink he said as the poor fox backed at his approach as far as the chain which fastened the trap to a log of wood would permit and then standing at bay showed a formidable row of teeth  that grin was its last another moment and the handle of the accountants axe stretched it lifeless on the snow  isnt it a beauty cried he surveying the animal with a look of triumphant pleasure and then feeling as if he had compromised his dignity a little by betraying so much glee he added but come now harry we must see to the other traps  its getting late  the others were soon visited but no more foxes were caught  however the accountant set them both off to see that all was right and then readjusting one himself told harry to set the other in order to clear himself of the charge of boasting  harry nothing loath went down on his knees to do so  the steel trap used for catching foxes is of exactly the same form as the ordinary rattrap with this difference that it has two springs instead of one is considerably larger and has no teeth as these latter would only tend to spoil the skin  owing to the strength of the springs a pretty strong effort is required to set the trap and clumsy fellows frequently catch the tails of their coats or the ends of their belts and not unfrequently the ends of their fingers in their awkward attempts  having set it without any of the above untoward accidents occurring harry placed it gently on a hole which he had previously scrapedplacing it in such a manner that the jaws and plate or trigger were a hairbreadth below the level of the snow  after this he spread over it a very thin sheet of paper observing as he did so that hay or grass was preferable but as there was none at hand paper would do  over this he sprinkled snow very lightly until every vestige of the trap was concealed from view and the whole was made quite level with the surrounding plain so that even the accountant himself after he had once removed his eyes from it could not tell where it lay  some chips of a frozen ptarmigan were then scattered around the spot and a piece of wood left to mark its whereabouts  the bait is always scattered round and not on the trap as the fox in running from one piece to another is almost certain to set his foot on it and so get caught by the leg whereas were the bait placed upon the trap the fox would be apt to get caught while in the act of eating by the snout which being wedgelike in form is easily dragged out of its gripe  now then what say you to going farther out on the river and making a snow trap for white foxes said the accountant  we shall still have time to do so before the moon sets  agreed cried harry  come along  without further parley they left the spot and stretched out towards the sea  the snow on the river was quite hard on its surface so that snowshoes being unnecessary they carried them over their shoulders and advanced much more rapidly  it is true that their road was a good deal broken and jagged pieces of ice protruded their sharp corners so as to render a little attention necessary in walking but one or two severe bumps on their toes made our friends sensitively alive to these minor dangers of the way  there goes a pack of them exclaimed harry as a troop of white foxes scampered past gambolling as they went and coming suddenly to a halt at a short distance wheeled about and sat down on their haunches apparently resolved to have a good look at the strangers who dared to venture into their wild domain  oh they are the most stupid brutes alive said the accountant as he regarded the pack with a look of contempt  ive seen one of them sit down and look at me while i set a trap right before his eyes and i had not got a hundred yards from the spot when a yell informed me that the gentlemans curiosity had led him to put his foot right into it  indeed exclaimed harry  i had no idea that they were so tame certainly no other kind of fox would do that  no thats certain  but these fellows have done it to me again and again  i shouldnt wonder if we got one tonight in the very same way im sure by the look of these rascals that they would do anything of a reckless stupid nature just now  had we not better make our trap here then  there is a point not fifty yards off with trees on it large enough for our purpose  yes it will do very well here  now then to work  go to the wood harry and fetch a log or two while i cut out the slabs  so saying the accountant drew the axe which he always carried in his belt and while harry entered the wood and began to hew off the branch of a tree he proceeded as he had said to cut out the slabs  with the point of his knife he first of all marked out an oblong in the snow then cut down three or four inches with the axe and putting the handle under the cut after the manner of a lever detached a thick solid slab of about three inches thick which although not so hard as ice was quite hard enough for the purpose for which it was intended  he then cut two similar slabs and a smaller one the same in thickness and breadth but only half the length  having accomplished this he raised himself to rest a little and observed that harry approached staggering under a load of wood and that the foxes were still sitting on their haunches gazing at him with a look of deep interest  if i only had my gun here thought he  but not having it he merely shook his fist at them stooped down again and resumed his work  with harrys assistance the slabs were placed in such a way as to form a sort of box or house having one end of it open  this was further plastered with soft snow at the joinings and banked up in such a way that no animal could break into it easilyat least such an attempt would be so difficult as to make an entrance into the interior by the open side much more probable  when this was finished they took the logs that harry had cut and carried with so much difficulty from the wood and began to lop off the smaller branches and twigs  one large log was placed across the opening of the trap while the others were piled on one end of it so as to press it down with their weight  three small pieces of stick were now preparedtwo of them being about half a foot long and the other about a foot  on the long piece of stick the breast of a ptarmigan was fixed as a bait and two notches cut the one at the end of it the other about four or five inches further down  all was now ready to set the trap  raise the log now while i place the trigger said harry kneeling down in front of the door while the accountant as directed lifted up the log on which the others lay so as to allow his companion to introduce the baitstick in such a manner as to support it while the slightest pull on the bait would set the stick with the notches free and thus permit the log to fall on the back of the fox whose effort to reach the bait would necessarily place him under it  while harry was thus engaged the accountant stood up and looked towards the foxes  they had approached so near in their curiosity that he was induced to throw his axe frantically at the foremost of the pack  this set them galloping off but they soon halted and sat down as before  what aggravating brutes they are to be sure said harry with a laugh as his companion returned with the hatchet  humph yes but well be upsides with them yet  come along into the wood and i wager that in ten minutes we shall have one  they immediately hurried towards the wood but had not walked fifty paces when they were startled by a loud yell behind them  dear me exclaimed the accountant while he and harry turned round with a start  it cannot surely be possible that they have gone in already  a loud howl followed the remark and the whole pack fled over the plain like snowdrift and disappeared  ah thats a pity something must have scared them to make them take wing like that  however well get one tomorrow for certain so come along lad let us make for the camp  not so fast replied the other if you hadnt pored over the big ledger till you were blind you would see that there is one prisoner already  this proved to be the case  on returning to the spot they found an arctic fox in his last gasp lying flat on the snow with the heavy log across his back which seemed to be broken  a slight tap on the snout with the accountants deadly axehandle completed his destruction  were in luck tonight cried harry as he kneeled again to reset the trap  but after all these white brutes are worth very little i fancy a hundred of their skins would not be worth the black one you got first  be quick harry the moon is almost down and poor hamilton will think that the polar bears have got hold of us  all right  now then step out and glancing once more at the trap to see that all was properly arranged the two friends once more turned their faces homewards and travelled over the snow with rapid strides  the moon had just set leaving the desolate scene in deep gloom so that they could scarcely find their way to the forest and when they did at last reach its shelter the night became so intensely dark that they had almost to grope their way and would certainly have lost it altogether were it not for the accountants thorough knowledge of the locality  to add to their discomfort as they stumbled on snow began to fall and ere long a pretty steady breeze of wind drove it sharply in their faces however this mattered but little as they penetrated deeper in among the trees which proved a complete shelter both from wind and snow  an hours march brought them to the mouth of the brook although half that time would have been sufficient had it been daylight and a few minutes later they had the satisfaction of hearing hamiltons voice hailing them as they pushed aside the bushes and sprang into the cheerful light of their encampment  hurrah shouted harry as he leaped into the space before the fire and flung the two foxes at hamiltons feet  what do you think of that old fellow  how are the heels  rather sore eh  now for the kettle  polly put the kettle on well all have my eye wheres the kettle hamilton have you eaten it  if you compose yourself a little harry and look at the fire youll see it boiling there  man what a chap you are for making unnecessary speeches  couldnt you tell me to look at the fire without the preliminary piece of advice to compose myself  besides you talk nonsense for im composed already of blood bones flesh sinews fat and  humbug interrupted the accountant  lend a hand to get supper you young goose  and so continued harry not noticing the interruption i cannot be expected nor is it necessary to compose myself over again  but to be serious he added it was very kind and considerate of you hammy to put on the kettle when your heels were in a manner uppermost  oh it was nothing at all my heels are much better thank you and it kept me from wearying  poor fellow said the accountant while he busied himself in preparing their evening meal you must be quite ravenous by this timeat least i am which is the same thing  supper was soon ready  it consisted of a large kettle of tea a lump of pemmican a handful of broken biscuit and three ptarmiganall of which were produced from the small wooden box which the accountant was wont to call his camplarder  the ptarmigan had been shot two weeks before and carefully laid up for future use the intense frost being a sufficient guarantee for their preservation for many months had that been desired  it would have done you good reader supposing you to be possessed of sympathetic feelings to have witnessed those three norwesters enjoying their supper in the snowy camp  the fire had been replenished with logs till it roared and crackled again as if it were endued with a vicious spirit and wished to set the very snow in flames  the walls shone like alabaster studded with diamonds while the green boughs overhead and the stems around were of a deep red colour in the light of the fierce blaze  the teakettle hissed fumed and boiled over into the fire  a mass of pemmican simmered in the lid in front of it  three pannikins of tea reposed on the green branches their refreshing contents sending up little clouds of steam while the ptarmigan now split up skewered and roasted were being heartily devoured by our three hungry friends  the pleasures that fall to the lot of man are transient  doubtless they are numerous and oft recurring still they are transient and sosupper came to an end  now for a pipe said the accountant disposing his limbs at full length on a green blanket  o thou precious weed what should we do without thee  smoke tea to be sure answered harry  ah true it is possible to exist on a pipe of tealeaves for a time but only for a time  i tried it myself once in desperation when i ran short of tobacco on a journey and found it execrable but better than nothing  pity we cant join you in that remarked harry  true but perhaps since you cannot pipe it might prove an agreeable diversification to dance  thank you id rather not said harry and as for hamilton im convinced that his mind is made up on the subjecthow go the heels now  thank you pretty well he replied reclining his head on the pine branches and extending his smitten members towards the fire  i think they will be quite well in the morning  it is a curious thing remarked the accountant in a soliloquising tone that soft fellows never smoke  i beg your pardon said harry ive often seen hot loaves smoke and theyre soft enough fellows in all conscience  ah sighed the accountant that reminds me of poor peterkin who was so soft that he went by the name of butter  did you ever hear of what he did the summer before last with an indians head  no never what was it  ill tell you the story replied the accountant drawing a few vigorous whiffs of smoke to prevent his pipe going out while he spoke  as the story in question however depicts a new phase of society in the woods it deserves a chapter to itself    chapter twenty  the accountants story  spring had passed away and york fort was filled with all the bustle and activity of summer  brigades came pouring in upon us with furs from the interior and as every boat brought a ct or a clerk our messtable began to overflow  youve not seen the summer messroom filled yet hamilton  thats a treat in store for you  it was pretty full last autumn i think suggested hamilton at the time i arrived from england  full why man it was getting to feel quite lonely at that time  ive seen more than fifty sit down to table there and it was worth going fifty miles to hear the row they kicked uptelling stories without end and sometimes without foundation about their wild doings in the interior where every manjack of them having spent at least eight months almost in perfect solitude they hadnt had a chance of letting their tongues go till they came down here  but to proceed  when the ship came out in the fall she brought a batch of new clerks and among them was this miserable chap peterkin whom we soon nicknamed butter he was the softest fellow i ever knew far worse than you hamilton and he hadnt been here a week before the wild blades from the interior who were bursting with fun and mischief began to play off all kinds of practical jokes upon him  the very first day he sat down at the messtable our worthy governor who you are aware detests practical jokes played him a trick quite unintentionally which raised a laugh against him for many a day  you know that old mr rogan is rather absent at times well the first day that peterkin came to mess it was breakfast the old governor asked him in a patronising sort of way to sit at his right hand  accordingly down he sat and having never i fancy been away from his mothers apronstring before he seemed to feel very uncomfortable especially as he was regarded as a sort of novelty  the first thing he did was to capsize his plate into his lap which set the youngsters at the lower end of the table into suppressed fits of laughter  however he was eating the leg of a dry grouse at the time so it didnt make much of a mess  try some fish peterkin said mr rogan kindly seeing that the youth was ill at ease  that old grouse is tough enough to break your knife  a very rough passage replied the youngster whose mind was quite confused by hearing the captain of the ship who sat next to him giving to his next neighbour a graphic account of the voyage in a very loud keyi mean if you please no thank you he stammered endeavouring to correct himself  ah a cup of tea perhapshere anderson turning to the butler a cup of tea to mr peterkin  the butler obeyed the order  and here fill my cup said old rogan interrupting himself in an earnest conversation into which he had plunged with the gentleman on his left hand  as he said this he lifted his cup to empty the slops but without paying attention to what he was doing  as luck would have it the slopbasin was not at hand and peterkins cup was so he emptied it innocently into that  peterkin hadnt courage to arrest his hand and when the deed was done he looked timidly round to see if the action had been observed  nearly half the table had seen it but they pretended ignorance of the thing so well that he thought no one had observed and so went quietly on with his breakfast and drank the tea but i am wandering from my story  well about this time there was a young indian who shot himself accidentally in the woods and was brought to the fort to see if anything could be done for him  the doctor examined his wound and found that the ball had passed through the upper part of his right arm and the middle of his right thigh breaking the bone of the latter in its passage  it was an extraordinary shot for a man to put into himself for it would have been next to impossible even for another man to have done it unless the indian had been creeping on all fours  when he was able to speak however he explained the mystery  while running through a rough part of the wood after a wounded bird he stumbled and fell on all fours  the gun which he was carrying over his shoulder holding it as the indians usually do by the muzzle flew forward and turned right round as he fell so that the mouth of it was presented towards him  striking against the stem of a tree it exploded and shot him through the arm and leg as described ere he had time to rise  a comrade carried him to his lodge and his wife brought him in a canoe to the fort  for three or four days the doctor had hopes of him but at last he began to sink and died on the sixth day after his arrival  his wife and one or two friends buried him in our graveyard which lies as you know on that lonelylooking point just below the powdermagazine  for several months previous to this our worthy doctor had been making strenuous efforts to get an indian skull to send home to one of his medical friends but without success  the indians could not be prevailed upon to cut off the head of one of their dead countrymen for love or money and the doctor had a dislike to the idea i suppose of killing one for himself but now here was a golden opportunity  the indian was buried near to the fort and his relatives had gone away to their tents again  what was to prevent his being dug up  the doctor brooded over the thing for one hour and a half being exactly the length of time required to smoke out his large turkey pipe and then sauntered into wilsons room  wilson was busy as usual at some of his mechanical contrivances  thrusting his hands deep into his breeches pockets and seating himself on an old seachest he began  i say wilson will you do me a favour  that depends entirely on what the favour is he replied without raising his head from his work  i want you to help me to cut off an indians head  then i wont do you the favour  but pray dont humbug me just now im busy  no but im serious and i cant get it done without help and i know youre an obliging fellow  besides the savage is dead and has no manner of use for his head now  wilson turned round with a look of intelligence on hearing this  ha he exclaimed i see what youre up to but i dont half like it in the first place his friends would be terribly cut up if they heard of it and then ive no sort of aptitude for the work of a resurrectionist and then if it got wind we should never hear the last of it and then  and then interrupted the doctor it would be adding to the light of medical science you unaspiring monster  a light retorted wilson which in passing through some members of the medical profession is totally absorbed and reproduced in the shape of impenetrable darkness  now dont object my dear fellow you know youre going to do it so dont coquette with me but agree at once  well i consent upon one condition  and what is that  that you do not play any practical jokes on me with the head when you have got it  agreed cried the doctor laughing i give you my word of honour now he has been buried three days already so we must set about it at once  fortunately the graveyard is composed of a sandy soil so hell keep for some time yet  the two worthies then entered into a deep consultation as to how they were to set about this deed of darkness  it was arranged that wilson should take his gun and sally forth a little before dark as if he were bent on an hours sport and not forgetting his gamebag proceed to the graveyard where the doctor engaged to meet him with a couple of spades and a dark lantern  accordingly next evening mr wilson true to his promise shouldered his gun and sallied forth  it soon became an intensely dark night  not a single star shone forth to illumine the track along which he stumbled  everything around was silent and dark and congenial with the work on which he was bent  but wilsons heart beat a little more rapidly than usual  he is a bold enough man as you know but boldness goes for nothing when superstition comes into play  however he trudged along fearlessly enough till he came to the thick woods just below the fort into which he entered with something of a qualm  scarcely had he set foot on the narrow track that leads to the graveyard when he ran slap against the post that stands there but which in his trepidation he had entirely forgotten  this quite upset the small amount of courage that remained and he has since confessed that if he had not had the hope of meeting with the doctor in a few minutes he would have turned round and fled at that moment  recovering a little from this accident he hurried forward but with more caution for although the night seemed as dark as could possibly be while he was crossing the open country it became speedily evident that there were several shades of darkness which he had not yet conceived in a few minutes he came to the creek that runs past the graveyard and here again his nerves got another shake for slipping his foot while in the act of commencing the descent he fell and rolled heavily to the bottom making noise enough in his fall to scare away all the ghosts in the country  with a palpitating heart poor wilson gathered himself up and searched for his gun which fortunately had not been injured and then commenced to climb the opposite bank starting at every twig that snapped under his feet  on reaching the level ground again he breathed a little more freely and hurried forward with more speed than caution suddenly he came into violent contact with a figure which uttered a loud growl as wilson reeled backwards  back you monster he cried with a hysterical yell or ill blow your brains out  its little good that would do ye cried the doctor as he came forward  why you stupid what did you take me for  youve nearly knocked out my brains as it is and the doctor rubbed his forehead ruefully  oh its you doctor said wilson feeling as if a ton weight had been lifted off his heart i verily thought it was the ghost of the poor fellow were going to disturb  i do think you had better give it up  mischief will come of it youll see  nonsense cried the doctor dont be a goose but lets to work at once  why ive got half the thing dug up already  so saying he led the way to the grave in which there was a large opening  setting the lantern down by the side of it the two seized their spades and began to dig as if in earnest  the fact is that the doctor was nearly as frightened as wilson and he afterwards confessed to me that it was an immense relief to him when he heard him fall down the bank of the creek and knew by the growl he gave that it was he  in about half an hour the doctors spade struck upon the coffin lid which gave forth a hollow sound  now then were about done with it said he standing up to wipe away the perspiration that trickled down his face  take the axe and force up the lid its only fixed with common nails while i he did not finish the sentence but drew a large scalpingknife from a sheath which hung at his belt  wilson shuddered and obeyed  a good wrench caused the lid to start and while he held it partially open the doctor inserted the knife  for five minutes he continued to twist and work with his arms muttering between his teeth every now and then that he was a tough subject while the crackling of bones and other disagreeable sounds struck upon the horrified ears of his companion  all right he exclaimed at last as he dragged a round object from the coffin and let down the lid with a bang at the same time placing the savages head with its ghastly features full in the blaze of the lantern  now then close up said he jumping out of the hole and shovelling in the earth  in a few minutes they had filled the grave up and smoothed it down on the surface and then throwing the head into the gamebag retraced their steps to the fort  their nerves were by this time worked up to such a pitch of excitement and their minds filled with such a degree of supernatural horror that they tripped and stumbled over stumps and branches innumerable in their doublequick march  neither would confess to the other however that he was afraid  they even attempted to pass a few facetious remarks as they hurried along but it would not do so they relapsed into silence till they came to the hollow beside the powdermagazine  here the doctors foot happening to slip he suddenly grasped wilson by the shoulder to support himselfa movement which being unexpected made his friend leap as he afterwards expressed it nearly out of his skin  this was almost too much for them  for a moment they looked at each other as well as the darkness would permit when all at once a large stone which the doctors slip had overbalanced fell down the bank and through the bushes with a loud crash  nothing more was wanting  all further effort to disguise their feelings was dropped  leaping the rail of the open field in a twinkling they gave a simultaneous yell of consternation and fled to the fort like autumn leaves before the wind never drawing breath till they were safe within the pickets  but what has all this to do with peterkin asked harry as the accountant paused to relight his pipe and toss a fresh log on the fire  have patience lad you shall hear  the accountant stirred the logs with his toe drew a few whiffs to see that the pipe was properly ignited and proceeded  for a day or two after this the doctor was observed to be often mysteriously engaged in an outhouse of which he kept the key  by some means or other the skipper who is always up to mischief managed to discover the secret  watching where the doctor hid the key he possessed himself of it one day and sallied forth bent on a lark of some kind or other but without very well knowing what  passing the kitchen he observed anderson the butler raking the fire out of the large oven which stands in the backyard  baking again anderson said he in passing  you get soon through with a heavy cargo of bread just now  yes sir many mouths to feed sir replied the butler proceeding with his work  the skipper sauntered on and took the track which leads to the boathouse where he stood for some time in meditation  casting up his eyes he saw peterkin in the distance looking as if he didnt very well know what to do  a sudden thought struck him  pulling off his coat he seized a mallet and a caulkingchisel and began to belabour the side of a boat as if his life depended on it  all at once he stopped and stood up blowing with the exertion  hollo peterkin he shouted and waved his hand  peterkin hastened towards him  well sir said he do you wish to speak to me  yes replied the skipper scratching his head as if in great perplexity  i wish you to do me a favour peterkin but i dont know very well how to ask you  oh i shall be most happy said poor butter eagerly if i can be of any use to you  i dont doubt your willingness replied the other but thenthe doctor you seethe fact is peterkin the doctor being called away to see a sick indian has entrusted me with a delicate piece of business rather a nasty piece of business i may saywhich i promised to do for him  you must know that the surgical society of london has written to him begging as a great favour that he would if possible procure them the skull of a native  after much trouble he has succeeded in getting one but is obliged to keep it a great secret even from his fellowclerks lest it should get wind for if the indians heard of it they would be sure to kill him and perhaps burn the fort too  now i suppose you are aware that it is necessary to boil an indians head in order to get the flesh clean off the skull  yes i have heard something of that sort from the students at college who say that boiling brings flesh more easily away from the bone  but i dont know much about it replied peterkin  well continued the skipper the doctor who is fond of experiments wishes to try whether baking wont do better than boiling and ordered the oven to be heated for that purpose this morning but being called suddenly away as i have said he begged me to put the head into it as soon as it was ready  i agreed quite forgetting at the time that i had to get this precious boat ready for sea this very afternoon  now the oven is prepared and i dare not leave my work indeed i doubt whether i shall have it quite ready and taut after all and theres the oven cooling so if you dont help me im a lost man  having said this the skipper looked as miserable as his jolly visage would permit and rubbed his nose  oh ill be happy to do it for you although it is not an agreeable job replied butter  thats rightthats friendly now exclaimed the skipper as if greatly relieved  give us your flipper my lad and seizing peterkins hand he wrung it affectionately  now here is the key of the outhouse do it as quickly as you can and dont let any one see you  its in a good cause you know but the results might be terrible if discovered  so saying the skipper fell to hammering the boat again with surprising vigour till butter was out of sight and then resuming his coat returned to the house  an hour after this anderson went to take his loaves out of the oven but he had no sooner taken down the door than a rich odour of cooked meat greeted his nostrils  uttering a deep growl the butler shouted out sprat  upon this a very thin boy with arms and legs like pipe stems issued from the kitchen and came timidly towards his master  didnt i tell you you young blackguard that the grousepie was to be kept for sunday and there youve gone and put it to fire today  the grousepie said the boy in amazement  yes the grousepie retorted the indignant butler and seizing the urchin by the neck he held his head down to the mouth of the oven  smell that you villain  what did you mean by it eh  oh murder shouted the boy as with a violent effort he freed himself and ran shrieking into the house  murder repeated anderson in astonishment while he stooped to look into the oven where the first thing that met his gaze was a human head whose ghastly visage and staring eyeballs worked and moved about under the influence of the heat as if it were alive  with a yell that rang through the whole fort the horrified butler rushed through the kitchen and out at the front door where as illluck would have it mr rogan happened to be standing at the moment pitching head first into the small of the old gentlemans back he threw him off the platform and fell into his arms  starting up in a moment the governor dealt anderson a cuff that sent him reeling towards the kitchen door again on the steps of which he sat down and began to sing out oh murder murder the oven the oven and not another word bad good or indifferent could be got out of him for the next halfhour as he swayed himself to and fro and wrung his hands  to make a long story short mr rogan went himself to the oven and fished out the head along with the loaves which were of course all spoiled  and what was the result inquired harry  oh there was a long investigation and the skipper got a blowingup and the doctor a warning to let indians skulls lie at peace in their graves for the future and poor butter was sent to mckenzies river as a punishment for old rogan could never be brought to believe that he hadnt been a willing tool in the skippers hands and anderson lost his batch of bread and his oven for it had to be pulled down and a new one built  humph and ive no doubt the governor read you a pretty stiff lecture on practical joking  he did replied the accountant laying aside his pipe and drawing the green blanket over him while harry piled several large logs on the fire  goodnight said the accountant  goodnight replied his companions and in a few minutes more they were sound asleep in their snowy camp while the huge fire continued during the greater part of the night to cast its light on their slumbering forms    chapter twenty one  ptarmiganhuntinghamiltons shooting powers severely testeda snowstorm  at about four oclock on the following morning the sleepers were awakened by the cold which had become very intense  the fire had burned down to a few embers which merely emitted enough light to make darkness visible  harry being the most active of the party was the first to bestir himself  raising himself on his elbow while his teeth chattered and his limbs trembled with cold he cast a woebegone and excessively sleepy glance towards the place where the fire had been then he scratched his head slowly then he stared at the fire again then he languidly glanced at hamiltons sleeping visage and then he yawned  the accountant observed all this for although he appeared to be buried in the depths of slumber he was wide awake in reality and moreover intensely cold  the accountant however was slydeep as he would have said himselfand knew that harrys active habits would induce him to rise on awaking and rekindle the firean event which the accountant earnestly desired to see accomplished but which he as earnestly resolved should not be performed by him  indeed it was with this end in view that he had given vent to the terrific snore which had aroused his young companion a little sooner than would have otherwise been the case  my eye exclaimed harry in an undertone how precious cold it is  his eye making no reply to this remark he arose and going down on his hands and knees began to coax the charcoal into a flame  by dint of severe blowing he soon succeeded and heaping on a quantity of small twigs the fitful flame sprang up into a steady blaze  he then threw several heavy logs on the fire and in a very short space of time restored it almost to its original vigour  what an abominable row you are kicking up growled the accountant why you would waken the seven sleepers  oh mending the fire he added in an altered tone ah  ill excuse you my boy since thats what youre at  the accountant hereupon got up along with hamilton who was now also awake and the three spread their hands over the bright fire and revolved their bodies before it until they imbibed a satisfactory amount of heat  they were much too sleepy to converse however and contented themselves with a very brief inquiry as to the state of hamiltons heels which elicited the sleepy reply they feel quite well thank you  in a short time having become agreeably warm they gave a simultaneous yawn and lying down again fell into a sleep from which they did not awaken until the red winter sun shot its early rays over the arctic scenery  once more harry sprang up and let his hand fall heavily on hamiltons shoulder  thus rudely assailed that youth also sprang up giving a shout at the same time that brought the accountant to his feet in an instant and so as if by an electric spark the sleepers were simultaneously roused into a state of wideawake activity  how excessively hungry i feel isnt it strange said hamilton as he assisted in rekindling the fire while the accountant filled his pipe and harry stuffed the teakettle full of snow  strange cried harry as he placed the kettle on the firestrange to be hungry after a five miles walk and a night in the snow  i would rather say it was strange if you were not hungry  throw on that billet like a good fellow and spit those grouse while i cut some pemmican and prepare the tea  how are the heels now hamilton asked the accountant who divided his attention between his pipe and his snowshoes the lines of which required to be readjusted  they appear to be as well as if nothing had happened to them replied hamilton  ive been looking at them and there is no mark whatever they do not even feel tender  lucky for you old boy that they were taken in time else youd have had another story to tell  do you mean to say that peoples heels really freeze and fall off inquired the other with a look of incredulity  soft very soft and green murmured harry in a low voice while he continued his work of adding fresh snow to the kettle as the process of melting reduced its bulk  i mean to say replied the accountant tapping the ashes out of his pipe that not only heels but hands feet noses and ears frequently freeze and often fall off in this country as you will find by sad experience if you dont look after yourself a little better than you have done hitherto  one of the evil effects of the perpetual jesting that prevailed at york fort was that soft in other words straightforward unsuspecting youths had to undergo a long process of learningbyexperience first believing everything and then doubting everything ere they arrived at that degree of sophistication which enabled them to distinguish between truth and falsehood  having reached the doubting period in his training hamilton looked down and said nothing at least with his mouth though his eyes evidently remarked i dont believe you  in future years however the evidence of these same eyes convinced him that what the accountant said upon this occasion was but too true  breakfast was a repetition of the supper of the previous evening during its discussion they planned proceedings for the day  my notion is said the accountant interrupting the flow of words ever and anon to chew the morsel with which his mouth was filledmy notion is that as its a fine clear day we should travel five miles through the country parallel with north river  i know the ground and can guide you easily to the spots where there are lots of willows and therefore plenty of ptarmigan seeing that they feed on willow tops and the snow that fell last night will help us a little  how will the snow help us inquired hamilton  by covering up all the old tracks to be sure and showing only the new ones  well captain said harry as he raised a can of tea to his lips and nodded to hamilton as if drinking his health go on with your proposals for the day  five miles up the river to begin with then  then well pull up continued the accountant make a fire rest a bit and eat a mouthful of pemmican after which well strike across country for the southern woodcutters track and so home  and how much will that be  about fifteen miles  ha exclaimed harry pass the kettle please  thanksdo you think youre up to that hammy  i will try what i can do replied hamilton  if the snowshoes dont cause me to fall often i think i shall stand the fatigue very well  thats right said the accountant faint heart etcetera you know if you go on as youve begun youll be chosen to head the next expedition to the north pole  well replied hamilton goodhumouredly pray head the present expedition and let us be gone  right ejaculated the accountant rising  ill just put my odds and ends out of the reach of the foxes and then we shall be off  in a few minutes everything was placed in security guns loaded snowshoes put on and the winter camp deserted  at first the walking was fatiguing and poor hamilton more than once took a sudden and eccentric plunge but after getting beyond the wooded country they found the snow much more compact and their march therefore much more agreeable  on coming to the place where it was probable that they might fall in with ptarmigan hamilton became rather excited and apt to imagine that little lumps of snow which hung upon the bushes here and there were birds  there now he cried in an energetic and slightly positive tone as another of these masses of snow suddenly met his eager eyethats one im quite sure  the accountant and harry both stopped short on hearing this and looked in the direction indicated  fire away then hammy said the former endeavouring to suppress a smile  but do you think it really is one asked hamilton anxiously  well i dont see it exactly but then you know im nearsighted  dont give him a chance of escape cried harry seeing that his friend was undecided  if you really do see a bird youd better shoot it for theyve got a strong propensity to take wing when disturbed  thus admonished hamilton raised his gun and took aim  suddenly he lowered his piece again and looking round at harry said in a low whisper  oh i should like so much to shoot it while flying  would it not be better to set it up first  by no means answered the accountant  a bird in the hand etcetera  take him as you find himlook sharp hell be off in a second  again the gun was pointed and after some difficulty in taking aim fired  ah what a pity youve missed him shouted harry  but see hes not off yet how tame he is to be sure  give him the other barrel hammy  this piece of advice proved to be unnecessary  in his anxiety to get the bird hamilton had cocked both barrels and while gazing half in disappointment half in surprise at the supposed bird his finger unintentionally pressed the second trigger  in a moment the piece exploded  being accidentally aimed in the right direction it blew the lump of snow to atoms and at the same time hitting its owner on the chest with the butt knocked him over flat upon his back  what a gun it is to be sure said harry with a roguish laugh as he assisted the discomfited sportsman to rise it knocks over game with butt and muzzle at once  quite a rare instance of one butt knocking another down added the accountant  at this moment a large flock of ptarmigan startled by the double report rose with a loud whirring noise about a hundred yards in advance and after flying a short distance alighted  theres real game at last though cried the accountant as he hurried after the birds followed closely by his young friends  they soon reached the spot where the flock had alighted and after following up the tracks for a few yards further set them up again  as the birds rose the accountant fired and brought down two harry shot one and missed another hamilton being so nervously interested in the success of his comrades that he forgot to fire at all  how stupid of me he exclaimed while the others loaded their guns  never mind better luck next time said harry as they resumed their walk  i saw the flock settle down about half a mile in advance of us so step out  another short walk brought the sportsmen again within range  go to the front hammy said the accountant and take the first shot this time  hamilton obeyed  he had scarcely made ten steps in advance when a single bird that seemed to have been separated from the others ran suddenly out from under a bush and stood stockstill at a distance of a few yards with its neck stretched out and its black eye wide open as if in astonishment  now then you cant miss that  hamilton was quite taken aback by the suddenness of this necessity for instantaneous action  instead therefore of taking aim leisurely seeing that he had abundant time to do so he flew entirely to the opposite extremetook no aim at all and fired off both barrels at once without putting the gun to his shoulder  the result of this was that the affrighted bird flew away unharmed while harry and the accountant burst spontaneously into fits of laughter  how very provoking said the poor youth with a dejected look  never mindnever say dietry again said the accountant on recovering his gravity  having reloaded they continued the pursuit  dear me exclaimed harry suddenly here are three dead birdsi verily believe hamilton that you have killed them all at one shot by accident  can it be possible exclaimed his friend as with a look of amazement he regarded the birds  there was no doubt about the fact  there they lay plump and still warm with one or two drops of bright red blood upon their white plumage  ptarmigan are almost pure white so that it requires a practised eye to detect them even at a distance of a few yards and it would be almost impossible to hunt them without dogs but for the telltale snow in which their tracks are distinctly marked enabling the sportsman to follow them up with unerring certainty  when hamilton made his bad shot neither he nor his companions observed a group of ptarmigan not more than fifty yards before them their attention being riveted at the time on the solitary bird and the gun happening to be directed towards them when it was fired three were instantly and unwittingly placed hors de combat while the others ran away  this the survivors frequently do when very tame instead of taking wing thus it was that hamilton to his immense delight made such a successful shot without being aware of it  having bagged their game the party proceeded on their way  several large flocks of birds were raised and the gamebags nearly filled before reaching the spot where they intended to turn and bend their steps homewards  this induced them to give up the idea of going further and it was fortunate they came to this resolution for a storm was brewing which in the eagerness of pursuit after game they had not noticed  dark masses of leadencoloured clouds were gathering in the sky overhead and faint sighs of wind came ever and anon in fitful gusts from the northwest  hurrying forward as quickly as possible they now pursued their course in a direction which would enable them to cross the woodcutters track this they soon reached and finding it pretty well beaten were enabled to make more rapid progress  fortunately the wind was blowing on their backs otherwise they would have had to contend not only with its violence but also with the snowdrift which now whirled in bitter fury among the trees or scoured like driving clouds over the plain  under this aspect the flat country over which they travelled seemed the perfection of bleak desolation  their way however did not lie in a direct line  the track was somewhat tortuous and gradually edged towards the north until the wind blew nearly in their teeth  at this point too they came to the stretch of open ground which they had crossed at a point some miles further to the north ward in their night march  here the storm raged in all its fury and as they looked out upon the plain before quitting the shelter of the wood they paused to tighten their belts and readjust their snowshoe lines  the gale was so violent that the whole plain seemed tossed about like billows of the sea as the drift rose and fell curled eddied and dashed along so that it was impossible to see more than half a dozen yards in advance  heaven preserve us from ever being caught in an exposed place on such a night as this said the accountant as he surveyed the prospect before him  luckily the open country here is not more than a quarter of a mile broad and even that little bit will try our wind somewhat  hamilton and harry seemed by their looks to say we could easily face even a stiffer breeze than that if need be  what should we do inquired the former if the plain were five or six miles broad  do why we should have to camp in the woods till it blew over thats all replied the accountant but seeing that we are not reduced to such a necessity just now and that the day is drawing to a close let us face it at once  ill lead the way and see that you follow close at my heels  dont lose sight of me for a moment and if you do by chance give a shout dye hear  the two lads replied in the affirmative and then bracing themselves up as if for a great effort stepped vigorously out upon the plain and were instantly swallowed up in clouds of snow  for half an hour or more they battled slowly against the howling storm pressing forward for some minutes with heads down as if boring through it then turning their backs to the blast for a few seconds relief but always keeping as close to each other as possible  at length the woods were gained on entering which it was discovered that hamilton was missing  hollo wheres hamilton exclaimed harry i saw him beside me not five minutes ago  the accountant gave a loud shout but there was no reply  indeed nothing short of his own stentorian voice could have been heard at all amid the storm  theres nothing for it said harry but to search at once else hell wander about and get lost  saying this he began to retrace his steps just as a brief lull in the gale took place  hollo dont you hear a cry harry  at this moment there was another lull the drift fell and for an instant cleared away revealing the bewildered hamilton not twenty yards off standing like a pillar of snow in mute despair  profiting by the glimpse harry rushed forward caught him by the arm and led him into the partial shelter of the forest  nothing further befell them after this  their route lay in shelter all the way to the fort  poor hamilton it is true took one or two of his occasional plunges by the way but without any serious resultnot even to the extent of stuffing his nose ears neck mittens pockets gunbarrels and everything else with snow because these being quite full and hard packed already there was no room left for the addition of another particle    chapter twenty two  the winter packetharry hears from old friends and wishes that he was with them  letters from home  what a burst of sudden emotionwhat a riot of conflicting feelings of dread and joyexpectation and anxietywhat a flood of old memorieswhat stirring up of almost forgotten associations these three words create in the hearts of those who dwell in distant regions of this earth far far away from kith and kin from friends and acquaintances from the muchloved scenes of childhood and from home letters from home  how gratefully the sound falls upon ears that have been long unaccustomed to sounds and things connected with home and so long accustomed to wild savage sounds that these have at length lost their novelty and become everyday and commonplace while the first have gradually grown strange and unwonted  for many long months home and all connected with it have become a dream of other days and savageland a present reality  the mind has by degrees become absorbed by surrounding objectsobjects so utterly unassociated with or unsuggestive of any other land that it involuntarily ceases to think of the scenes of childhood with the same feelings that it once did  as time rolls on home assumes a misty undefined character as if it were not only distant in reality but were also slowly retreating farther and farther awaygrowing gradually faint and dreamlike though not less dear to the mental view  letters from home shouted mr wilson and the doctor and the skipper simultaneously as the sportsmen after dashing through the wild storm at last reached the fort and stumbled tumultuously into bachelors hall  whatwherehowyou dont mean it they exclaimed coming to a sudden stand like three pillars of snowclad astonishment  ay replied the doctor who affected to be quite cool upon all occasions and rather cooler than usual if the occasion was more than ordinarily excitingay we do mean it  old rogan has got the packet and is even now disembowelling it  more than that interrupted the skipper who sat smoking as usual by the stove with his hands in his breeches pocketsmore than that i saw him dissecting into the very marrow of the thing so if we dont storm the old admiral in his cabin hell go to sleep over these prosy yarns that the governorinchief writes to him and well have to whistle for our letters till midnight  the skippers remark was interrupted by the opening of the outer door and the entrance of the butler  mr rogan wishes to see you sir said that worthy to the accountant  ill be with him in a minute he replied as he threw off his capote and proceeded to unwind himself as quickly as his multitudinous haps would permit  by this time harry somerville and hamilton were busily occupied in a similar manner while a running fire of question and answer jesting remark and bantering reply was kept up between the young men from their various apartments and the hall  the doctor was cool as usual and impudent  he had a habit of walking up and down while he smoked and was thus enabled to look in upon the inmates of the several sleepingrooms and make his remarks in a quiet sarcastic manner the galling effect of which was heightened by his habit of pausing at the end of every two or three words to emit a few puffs of smoke  having exhausted a good deal of small talk in this way and having moreover finished his pipe the doctor went to the stove to refill and relight  what a deal of trouble you do take to make yourself comfortable said he to the skipper who sat with his chair tilted on its hind legs and a pillow at his back  no harm in that doctor replied the skipper with a smile  no harm certainly but it looks uncommonly lazylike  what does  why putting a pillow at your back to be sure  the doctor was a fullfleshed muscular man and owing to this fact it mattered little to him whether his chair happened to be an easy one or not  as the skipper sometimes remarked he carried padding always about with him he was therefore a little apt to sneer at the attempts of his brethren to render the illshaped woodenbottomed chairs with which the hall was ornamented bearable  well doctor said the skipper i cannot see how you make me out lazy  surely it is not an evidence of laziness my endeavouring to render these instruments of torture less tormenting  seeking to be comfortable if it does not inconvenience any one else is not laziness why what is comfort  the skipper began to wax philosophical at this point and took the pipe from his mouth as he gravely propounded the momentous question  what is comfort  if i go out to camp in the woods and after turning in find a sharp stump sticking into my ribs on one side and a pine root driving in the small of my back on the other side is that comfort  certainly not  and if i get up seize a hatchet level the stump cut away the root and spread pine brush over the place am i to be called lazy for doing so  or if i sit down on a chair and on trying to lean back to rest myself find that the stupid lubber who made it has so constructed it that four small hard points alone touch my persontwo being at the hipjoints and two at the shoulderblades and if to relieve such physical agony i jump up and clap a pillow at my back am i to be called lazy for doing that  what a glorious entry that would make in the log said the doctor in a low tone soliloquisingly as if he made the remark merely for his own satisfaction while he tapped the ashes out of his pipe  the skipper looked as if he meditated a sharp reply but his intentions whatever they might have been were interrupted by the opening of the door and the entrance of the accountant bearing under his arm a packet of letters  a general rush was made upon him and in a few minutes a dead silence reigned in the hall broken only at intervals by an exclamation of surprise or pathos as the inmates in the retirement of their separate apartments perused letters from friends in the interior of the country and friends at home letters that were oldsome of them bearing dates many months backand travelstained but new and fresh and cheering nevertheless to their owners as the clear bright sun in winter or the verdant leaves in spring  harry somervilles letters were numerous and long  he had several from friends in red river besides one or two from other parts of the indian country and oneit was very thick and heavythat bore the postmarks of britain  it was late that night ere the last candle was extinguished in the hall and it was late too before harry somerville ceased to peruse and reperuse the long letter from home and found time or inclination to devote to his other correspondents  among the rest was a letter from his old friend and companion charley kennedy which ran as follows    my dear harryit really seems more than an age since i saw you   your last epistle written in the perturbation of mind consequent upon   being doomed to spend another winter at york fort reached me only a   few days ago and filled me with pleasant recollections of other days   oh man how much i wish that you were with me in this beautiful   country  you are aware that i have been what they call roughing it   since you and i parted on the shores of lake winnipeg but my dear   fellow the idea that most people have of what that phrase means is a   very erroneous one indeed  roughing it i certainly have been   inasmuch as i have been living on rough fare associating with rough   men and sleeping on rough beds under the starry sky but i assure you   that all this is not half so rough upon the constitution as what they   call leading an easy life which is simply a life that makes a poor   fellow stagnate body and spirit till the one comes to be unable to   digest its food and the other incompetent to jump at so much as half   an idea  anything but an easy life to my mind  ah theres nothing   like roughing it harry my boy  why i am thriving on itgrowing   like a young walrus eating like a canadian voyageur and sleeping   like a top  this is a splendid country for sport and as our   bourgeois the gentleman in charge of an establishment is always   designated the bourgeois has taken it into his head that i am a good   hand at making friends with the indians he has sent me out on several   expeditions and afforded me some famous opportunities of seeing life   among the redskins  there is a talk just now of establishing a new   outpost in this district so if i succeed in persuading the governor   to let me accompany the party i shall have something interesting to   write about in my next letter  by the way i wrote to you a month   ago by two indians who said they were going to the missionary station   at norway house  did you ever get it  there is a hunter here just   now who goes by the name of jacques caradoc  he is a firstratercan   do anything in a wild way that lies within the power of mortal man   and is an inexhaustible anecdoteteller in a quiet way  he and i   have been out buffalohunting two or three times and it would have   done your heart good harry my dear boy to have seen us scouring   over the prairie together on two bigboned indian horsesregular   trained buffalorunners that didnt need the spur to urge nor the   rein to guide them when once they caught sight of the black cattle   and kept a sharp lookout for badgerholes just as if they had been   reasonable creatures  the first time i went out i had several rather   ugly falls owing to my inexperience  the fact is that if a man has   never run buffaloes before hes sure to get one or two upsets no   matter how good a horseman he may be  and that monster jacques   although hes the best fellow i ever met with for a hunting companion   always took occasion to grin at my mishaps and gravely to read me a   lecture to the effect that they were all owing to my own clumsiness or   stupidity which you will acknowledge was not calculated to restore   my equanimity    the very first run we had cost me the entire skin of my nose and   converted that feature into a superb roman for the next three weeks   it happened thus  jacques and i were riding over the prairie in   search of buffaloes  the place was interspersed with sundry knolls   covered with trees slips and belts of woodland with ponds scattered   among them and open sweeps of the plain here and there altogether a   delightful country to ride through  it was a clear early morning so   that our horses were fresh and full of spirit  they knew as well as   we ourselves did what we were out for and it was no easy matter to   restrain them  the one i rode was a great longlegged beast as like   as possible to that abominable kangaroo that nearly killed me at red   river as for jacques he was mounted on a firstrate charger  i   dont know how it is but somehow or other everything about jacques   or belonging to him or in the remotest degree connected with him is   always firstrate  he generally owns a firstrate horse and if he   happens by any unlucky chance to be compelled to mount a bad one it   immediately becomes another animal  he seems to infuse some of his   own wonderful spirit into it  well as jacques and i curvetted along   skirting the low bushes at the edge of a wood out burst a whole herd   of buffaloes  bang went jacquess gun almost before i had winked to   make sure that i saw rightly and down fell the fattest of them all   while the rest tossed up their tails heels and heads in one grand   whirl of indignant amazement and scoured away like the wind  in a   moment our horses were at full stretch after them on their own   account entirely and without any reference to us  when i recovered   my selfpossession a little i threw forward my gun and fired but   owing to my endeavouring to hold the reins at the same time i nearly   blew off one of my horses ears and only knocked up the dust about   six yards ahead of us  of course jacques could not let this pass   unnoticed  he was sitting quietly loading his gun as cool as a   cucumber while his horse was dashing forward at full stretch with   the reins hanging loosely on his neck    ah mister charles said he with the least possible grin on his   leathern visage that was not well done  you should never hold the   reins when you fire nor try to put the gun to your shoulder  it ant   needful  the beastll look arter itself if its a riglar   buffalorunner any ways holdin the reins is of no manner of use  i   once knowd a gentleman that came out here to see the buffalohuntin   he was a good enough shot in his way an a firstrate rider  but he   was full o queer notions he would load his gun with the ramrod in   the riglar way instead o doin as we do tumblin in a drop powder   spittin a ball out your mouth down the muzzle and hittin the stock   on the pommel of the saddle to send it home  and he had them   miserable thingsthe somethin cussioncaps and used to fiddle   away with them while we were knockin over the cattle in all   directions  moreover he had a notion that it was altogether wrong to   let go his reins even for a moment and so what between the ramrod   and the cussioncaps and the reins he was worse than the greenest   clerk that ever came to the country  he gave it up in despair at   last after lamin two horses and finished off by runnin after a big   bull that turned on him all of a suddent crammed its head and horns   into the side of his horse and sent the poor fellow head over heels   on the green grass  he wasnt much the worse for it but his fine   doublebarrelled gun was twisted into a shape that would almost have   puzzled an injin to tell what it was  well harry all the time that   jacques was telling me this we were gaining on the buffaloes and at   last we got quite close to them and as luck would have it the very   thing that happened to the amateur sportsman happened to me  i went   madly after a big bull in spite of jacquess remonstrances and just   as i got alongside of him up went his tail a sure sign that his anger   was roused and round he came head to the front stiff as a rock my   poor chargers chest went right between his horns and as a matter of   course i continued the race upon nothing head first for a   distance of about thirty yards and brought up on the bridge of my   nose  my poor dear father used to say i was a bullheaded rascal   and upon my word i believe he was more literally correct than he   imagined for although i fell with a fearful crash head first on the   hard plain i rose up immediately and in a few minutes was able to   resume the chase again  my horse was equally fortunate for although   thus brought to a sudden stand while at full gallop he wheeled about   gave a contemptuous flourish with his heels and cantered after   jacques who soon caught him again  my head bothered me a good deal   for some time after this accident and swelled up till my eyes became   almost undistinguishable but a few weeks put me all right again  and   who do you think this man jacques is  youd never guess  hes the   trapper whom redfeather told us of long ago and whose wife was killed   by the indians  he and redfeather have met and are very fond of each   other  how often in the midst of these wild excursions have my   thoughts wandered to you harry  the fellows i meet with here are all   kindhearted merry companions but none like yourself  i sometimes   say to jacques when we become communicative to each other beside the   campfire that my earthly felicity would be perfect if i had harry   somerville here and then i think of kate my sweet loving sister   kate and feel that even although i had you with me there would   still be something wanting to make things perfect  talking of kate   by the way i have received a letter from her the first sheet of   which as it speaks of mutual red river friends i herewith enclose   pray keep it safe and return per first opportunity  weve loads of   furs here and plenty of deerstalking not to mention galloping on   horseback on the plains in summer and dogsledging in winter  alas   my poor friend i fear that it is rather selfish in me to write so   feelingly about my agreeable circumstances when i know you are slowly   dragging out your existence at that melancholy place york fort but   believe me i sympathise with you and i hope earnestly that you will   soon be appointed to more genial scenes  i have much very much to   tell you yet but am compelled to reserve it for a future epistle as   the packet which is to convey this is on the point of being closed    adieu my dear harry and wherever you may happen to pitch your tent   always bear in kindly remembrance your old friend charles kennedy  the letter was finished but harry did not cease to hold intercourse with his friend  with his head resting on his two hands and his elbows on the table he sat long silently gazing on the signature while his mind revelled in the past the present and the future  he bounded over the wilderness that lay between him and the beautiful plains of the saskatchewan  he seized charley round the neck and hugged and wrestled with him as in days of yore  he mounted an imaginary charger and swept across the plains along with him listened to anecdotes innumerable from jacques attacked thousands of buffaloes singled out scores of wild bulls pitched over horses heads and alighted precisely on the bridge of his nose always in close proximity to his old friend  gradually his mind returned to its prisonhouse and his eye fell on kates letter which he picked up and began to readit ran thus    my dear dear darling charleyi cannot tell you how much my heart   has yearned to see you or hear from you for many long long months   past  your last delightful letter which i treasure up as the most   precious object i possess has indeed explained to me how utterly   impossible it was to have written a day sooner than you did but that   does not comfort me a bit or make those weary packets more rapid and   frequent in their movements or the time that passes between the   periods of hearing from you less dreary and anxious  god bless and   protect you my darling in the midst of all the dangers that surround   you  but i did not intend to begin this letter by murmuring so pray   forgive me and i shall try to atone for it by giving you a minute   account of everybody here about whom you are interested  our beloved   father and mother i am thankful to say are quite well  papa has   taken more than ever to smoking since you went away  he is seldom out   of the summerhouse in the garden now where i very frequently go and   spend hours together in reading to and talking with him  he very   often speaks of you and i am certain that he misses you far more than   we expected although i think he cannot miss you nearly so much as i   do  for some weeks past indeed ever since we got your last letter   papa was engaged all the forenoon in some mysterious work for he used   to lock himself up in the summerhousea thing he never did before   one day i went there at my usual time and instead of having to wait   till he should unlock the door i found it already open and entered   the room which was so full of smoke that i could hardly see  i found   papa writing at a small table and the moment he heard my footstep he   jumped up with a fierce frown and shouted whos there in that   terrible voice that he used to speak in long ago when angry with his   men but which he has almost quite given up for some time past  he   never speaks to me as you know very well but in the kindest tones   so you may imagine what a dreadful fright i got for a moment but it   was only for a moment because the instant he saw that it was me his   dear face changed and he folded me in his arms saying ah kate   forgive me my darling  i did not know it was you and i thought i   had locked the door and was angry at being so unceremoniously   interrupted  he then told me he was just finishing a letter of   advice to you and going up to the table pushed the papers hurriedly   into a drawer  as he did so i guessed what had been his mysterious   occupation for he seemed to have covered quires of paper with the   closest writing  ah charley youre a lucky fellow to be able to   extort such long letters from our dear father  you know how difficult   he finds it to write even the shortest note and you remember his old   favourite expression i would rather skin a wild buffalo bull alive   than write a long letter  he deserves long ones in return charley   but i need not urge you on that scoreyou are an excellent   correspondent  mamma is able to go out every day now for a drive in   the prairie  she was confined to the house for nearly three weeks   last month with some sort of illness that the doctor did not seem to   understand and at one time i was much frightened and very very   anxious about her she became so weak  it would have made your heart   glad to have seen the tender way in which papa nursed her through the   illness  i had fancied that he was the very last man in the world to   make a sicknurse so bold and quick in his movements and with such a   loud gruff voicefor it is gruff although very sweet at the same   time  but the moment he began to tend mamma he spoke more softly even   than dear mr addison does and he began to walk about the house on   tiptoe and persevered so long in this latter that all his moccasins   began to be worn out at the toes while the heels remained quite   strong  i begged of him often not to take so much trouble as i was   naturally the proper nurse for mamma but he wouldnt hear of it and   insisted on carrying breakfast dinner and tea to her besides giving   her all her medicine  he was for ever making mistakes however much   to his own sorrow the darling man and i had to watch him pretty   closely for more than once he has been on the point of giving mamma a   glass of laudanum in mistake for a glass of port wine  i was a good   deal frightened for him at first as before he became accustomed to   the work he tumbled over the chairs and tripped on the carpets while   carrying trays with dinners and breakfasts till i thought he would   really injure himself at last and then he was so terribly angry with   himself at making such a noise and breaking the dishesi think he has   broken nearly an entire dinner and tea set of crockery  poor george   the cook has suffered most from these mishapsfor you know that dear   papa cannot get angry without letting a little of it out upon   somebody and whenever he broke a dish or let a tray fall he used to   rush into the kitchen shake his fist in georges face and ask him   in a fierce voice what he meant by it  but he always got better in a   few seconds and finished off by telling him never to mind that he   was a good servant on the whole and he wouldnt say any more about it   just now but he had better look sharp out and not do it again  i   must say in praise of george that on such occasions he looked very   sorry indeed and said he hoped that he would always do his best to   give him satisfaction  this was only proper in him for he ought to   be very thankful that our father restrains his anger so much for you   know he was rather violent once and youve no idea charley how   great a restraint he now lays on himself  he seems to me quite like a   lamb and i am beginning to feel somehow as if we had been mistaken   and that he never was a passionate man at all  i think it is partly   owing to dear mr addison who visits us very frequently now and papa   and he are often shut up together for many hours in the smokinghouse   i was sure that papa would soon come to like him for his religion is   so free from everything like severity or affected solemnity  the   cook and rosa and my dog that you named twist are all quite well   the last has grown into a very large and beautiful animal something   like the staghound in the picturebook we used to study together long   ago  he is exceedingly fond of me and i feel him to be quite a   protector  the cocks and hens the cow and the old mare are also in   perfect health so now having told you a good deal about ourselves i   will give you a short account of the doings in the colony    first of all your old friend mr kipples is still alive and well and   so are all our old companions in the school  one or two of the latter   have left and young naysmith has joined the companys service  betty   peters comes very often to see us and she always asks for you with   great earnestness  i think you have stolen the old womans heart   charley for she speaks of you with great affection  old mr seaforth   is still as vigorous as ever dashing about the settlement on a   highmettled steed just as if he were one of the youngest men in the   colony  he nearly poisoned himself poor man a month ago by taking   a dose of some kind of medicine by mistake  i did not hear what it   was but i am told that the treatment was rather severe  fortunately   the doctor happened to be at home when he was sent for else our old   friend would i fear have died  as it was the doctor cured him with   great difficulty  he first gave him an emetic then put mustard   blisters to the soles of his feet and afterwards lifted him into one   of his own carts without springs in which he drove him for a long   time over all the ploughed fields in the neighbourhood  if this is   not an exaggerated account mr seaforth is certainly made of sterner   stuff than most men  i was told a funny anecdote of him a few days   ago which i am sure you have never heard otherwise you would have   told it to me for there used to be no secrets between us charley   alas  i have no one to confide in or advise with now that you are   gone  you have often heard of the great flood not noahs one but   the flood that nearly swept away our settlement and did so much damage   before you and i were born  well you recollect that people used to   tell of the way in which the river rose after the breaking up of the   ice and how it soon overflowed all the low points sweeping off   everything in its course  old mr seaforths house stood at that time   on the little point just beyond the curve of the river at the foot   of which our own house stands and as the river continued to rise mr   seaforth went about actively securing his property  at first he only   thought of his boat and canoes which with the help of his son peter   and a canadian who happened at the time to be employed about the   place he dragged up and secured to an iron staple in the side of his   house  soon however he found that the danger was greater than at   first he imagined  the point became completely covered with water   which brought down great numbers of halfdrowned and quitedrowned   cattle pigs and poultry and stranded them at the garden fence so   that in a short time poor mr seaforth could scarcely move about his   overcrowded domains  on seeing this he drove his own cattle to the   highest land in his neighbourhood and hastened back to the house   intending to carry as much of the furniture as possible to the same   place  but during his short absence the river had risen so rapidly   that he was obliged to give up all thoughts of this and think only of   securing a few of his valuables  the bit of land round his dwelling   was so thickly covered with the poor cows sheep and other animals   that he could scarcely make his way to the house and you may fancy   his consternation on reaching it to find that the water was more than   kneedeep round the walls while a few of the cows and a whole herd of   pigs had burst open the door no doubt accidentally and coolly   entered the diningroom where they stood with drooping heads very   wet and apparently very miserable  the canadian was busy at the back   of the house loading the boat and canoe with everything he could lay   hands on and was not aware of the foreign invasion in front  mr   seaforth cared little for this however and began to collect all the   things he held most valuable and threw them to the man who stowed   them away in the boat  peter had been left in charge of the cattle   so they had to work hard  while thus employed the water continued to   rise with fearful rapidity and rushed against the house like a   millrace so that it soon became evident that the whole would ere   long be swept away  just as they finished loading the boat and   canoes the staple which held them gave way in a moment they were   swept into the middle of the river and carried out of sight  the   canadian was in the boat at the time the staple broke so that mr   seaforth was now left in a dwelling that bid fair to emulate noahs   ark in an hour or two without a chance of escape and with no better   company than five black oxen in the diningroom besides three sheep   that were now scarcely able to keep their heads above water and three   little pigs that were already drowned  the poor old man did his best   to push out the intruders but only succeeded in ejecting two sheep   and an ox  all the others positively refused to go so he was fain to   let them stay  by shutting the outer door he succeeded in keeping out   a great deal of water  then he waded into the parlour where he found   some more little pigs floating about and quite dead  two however   more adventurous than their comrades had saved their lives by   mounting first on a chair and then upon the table where they were   comfortably seated gazing languidly at their mother a very heavy fat   sow which sat with what seemed an expression of settled despair on   the sofa  in a fit of wrath mr seaforth seized the young pigs and   tossed them out of the window whereupon the old one jumped down and   half walking half swimming made her way to her companions in the   diningroom  the old gentleman now ascended to the garret where from   a small window he looked out upon the scene of devastation  his chief   anxiety was about the foundation of the house which being made of a   wooden framework like almost all the others in the colony would   certainly float if the water rose much higher  his fears were better   founded than the house  as he looked up the river which had by this   time overflowed all its banks and was spreading over the plains he   saw a fresh burst of water coming down which when it dashed against   his dwelling forced it about two yards from its foundation  suddenly   he remembered that there were a large anchor and chain in the kitchen   both of which he had brought there one day to serve as a sort of   anvil when he wanted to do some blacksmith work  hastening down he   fastened one end of the chain to the sofa and cast the anchor out of   the window  a few minutes afterwards another rush of water struck the   building which yielded to pressure and swung slowly down until the   anchor arrested its further progress  this was only for a few   seconds however  the chain was a slight one  it snapped and the   house swept majestically down the stream while its terrified   occupants cowered within it    for two days nothing was heard of old mr seaforth  indeed the   settlers had too much to do in saving themselves and their families to   think of others and it was not until the third day that people began   to inquire about him  his son peter had taken a canoe and made   diligent search in all directions but although he found the house   sticking on a shallow point neither his father nor the cat was on or   in it  at last he was brought to the island on which nearly half the   colony had collected by an indian who had passed the house and   brought him away in his canoe along with the old cat  is he not a   wonderful man to have come through so much in his old age and he is   still so active and hearty  mr swan of the mill is dead  he died of   fever last week  poor old mr cordon is also gone  his end was very   sad  about a month ago he ordered his horse and rode off intending   to visit fort garry  at the turn of the road just above grants   house the horse suddenly swerved and its rider was thrown to the   ground  he did not live more than half an hour after it  alas how   very sad to see a man after escaping all the countless dangers of a   long life in the woods and his you know was a very adventurous   one thus cut violently down in his old age  o charley how little   we know what is before us  how needful to have our peace made with   god through jesus christ so that we may be ready at any moment when   our father calls us away  there are many events of great interest   that have occurred here since you left  you will be glad to hear that   jane patterson is married to our excellent friend mr cameron who has   taken up a store near to us and intends to run a boat to york fort   next summer  there has been another marriage here which will cause   you astonishment at least if not pleasure  old mr peters has   married marie peltier  what could have possessed her to take such a   husband  i cannot understand it  just think of her charley a girl   of eighteen with a husband of seventyfive    at this point the writing which was very close and very small terminated  harry laid it down with a deep sigh wishing much that charley had thought it advisable to send him the second sheet also  as wishes and regrets on this point were equally unavailing he endeavoured to continue it in imagination and was soon as deeply absorbed in following kate through the wellremembered scenes of red river as he had been a short time before in roaming with her brother over the wide prairies of the saskatchewan  the increasing cold however soon warned him that the night was far spent  he rose and went to the stove but the fire had gone out and the almost irresistible frost of these regions was already cooling everything in bachelors hall down to the freezingpoint  all his companions had put out their candles and were busy doubtless dreaming of the friends whose letters had struck and reawakened the longdormant chords that used to echo to the tones and scenes of other days  with a slight shiver harry returned to his apartment and kneeled to thank god for protecting and preserving his absent friends and especially for sending him good news from a far land  the letter with the british postmarks on it was placed under his pillow  it occupied his waking and sleeping thoughts that night and it was the first thing he thought of and reread on the following morning and for many mornings afterwards  only those can fully estimate the value of such letters who live in distant lands where letters are fewvery very fewand far between    chapter twenty three  changesharry and hamilton find that variety is indeed charmingthe latter astonishes the former considerably  three months passed away but the snow still lay deep and white and undiminished around york fort  wintercold silent unyielding winterstill drew its white mantle closely round the lonely dwelling of the furtraders of the far north  icicles hung as they had done for months before from the eaves of every house from the tall black scaffold on which the great bell hung and from the still taller erection that had been put up as an outlook for the ship in summer  at the present time it commanded a bleak view of the frozen sea  snow covered every housetop and hung in ponderous masses from their edges as if it were about to fall but it never fellit hung there in the same position day after day unmelted unchanged  snow covered the whole land and the frozen river the swamps the seabeach and the sea itself as far as the eye could reach seemed like a pure white carpet  snow lined the upper edge of every paling filled up the keyhole of every door embanked about half of every window stuck in little knobs on the top of every picket and clung in masses on every drooping branch of the pine trees in the forest  frostsharp biting frostsolidified surrounded and pervaded everything  mercury was congealed by it vapour was condensed by it iron was cooled by it until it could scarcely be touched without as the men expressed it burning the fingers  the waterjugs in bachelors hall and the waterbuckets were frozen by it nearly to the bottom though there was a good stove there and the hall was not usually a cold place by any means  the breath of the inhabitants was congealed by it on the windowpanes until they had become coated with ice an inch thick  the breath of the men was rendered white and opaque by it as they panted and hurried to and fro about their ordinary avocations beating their gloved hands together and stamping their wellwrappedup feet on the hardbeaten snow to keep them warm  old robins nose seemed to be entirely shrivelled up into his face by it as he drove his oxcart to the river to fetch his daily supply of water the only things that were not affected by it were the fires which crackled and roared as if in laughter and twisted and leaped as if in uncontrollable glee at the bare idea of john frost acquiring by any artifice whatever the smallest possible influence over them  three months had elapsed but frost and snow instead of abating had gone on increasing and intensifying deepening and extending its work and riveting its chains  wintercold silent unyielding winterstill reigned at york fort as though it had made it a sine qua non of its existence at all that it should reign there for ever  but although everything was thus wintry and cold it was by no means cheerless or dreary  a bright sun shone in the blue heavens with an intenseness of brilliancy that was quite dazzling to the eyes that elated the spirits and caused man and beast to tread with a more elastic step than usual  although the sun looked down upon the scene with an unclouded face and found a mirror in every icicle and in every gem of hoarfrost with which the objects of nature were loaded there was however no perceptible heat in his rays  they fell on the white earth with all the brightness of midsummer but they fell powerless as moonbeams in the dead of winter  on the frozen river just in front of the gate of the fort a group of men and dogs were assembled  the dogs were four in number harnessed to a small flat sledge of the slender kind used by indians to drag their furs and provisions over the snow  the group of men was composed of mr rogan and the inmates of bachelors hall one or two men who happened to be engaged there at the time in cutting a new waterhole in the ice and an indian who to judge from his carefullyadjusted costume the snowshoes on his feet and the short whip in his hand was the driver of the sledge and was about to start on a journey  harry somerville and young hamilton were also wrapped up more carefully than usual  goodbye then goodbye said mr rogan advancing towards the indian who stood beside the leading dog ready to start  take care of our young friendstheyve not had much experience in travelling yet and dont overdrive your dogs  treat them well and theyll do more work  theyre like men in that respect  mr rogan shook the indian by the hand and the latter immediately flourished the whip and gave a shout which the dogs no sooner heard than they uttered a simultaneous yell sprang forward with a jerk and scampered up the river closely followed by their darkskinned driver  now lads farewell said the old gentleman turning with a kindly smile to our two friends who were shaking hands for the last time with their comrades  im sorry youre going to leave us my boys  youve done your duty well while here and i would willingly have kept you a little longer with me but our governor wills it otherwise  however i trust that youll be happy wherever you may be sent  dont forget to write to me  god bless you  farewell  mr rogan shook them heartily by the hand turned short round and walked slowly up to his house with an expression of sadness on his mild face while harry and hamilton having once more waved farewell to their friends marched up the river side by side in silence  they followed the track left by the dogsledge which guided them with unerring certainty although their indian leader and his team were out of sight in advance  a week previous to this time an indian arrived from the interior bearing a letter from headquarters which directed that messrs somerville and hamilton should be forthwith dispatched on snowshoes to norway house  as this establishment is about three hundred miles from the seacoast the order involved a journey of nearly two weeks duration through a country that was utterly destitute of inhabitants on receiving a command from mr rogan to prepare for an early start harry retired precipitately to his own room and there after cutting unheardof capers and giving vent to sudden incomprehensible shouts all indicative of the highest state of delight he condescended to tell his companions of his good fortune and set about preparations without delay  hamilton on the contrary gave his usual quiet smile on being informed of his destination and returning somewhat pensively to bachelors hall proceeded leisurely to make the necessary arrangements for departure  as the time drew on however a perpetual flush on his countenance and an unusual brilliancy about his eye showed that he was not quite insensible to the pleasures of a change and relished the idea more than he got credit for  the indian who had brought the letter was ordered to hold himself in readiness to retrace his steps and conduct the young men through the woods to norway house where they were to await further orders  a few days later the three travellers as already related set out on their journey  after walking a mile up the river they passed a point of land which shut out the fort from view  here they paused to take a last look and then pressed forward in silence the thoughts of each being busy with mingled recollections of their late home and anticipations of the future  after an hours sharp walking they came in sight of the guide and slackened their pace  well hamilton said harry throwing off his reverie with a deep sigh are you glad to leave york fort or sorry  glad undoubtedly replied hamilton but sorry to part from our old companions there  i had no idea harry that i loved them all so much i feel as if i should be glad were the order for us to leave them countermanded even now  thats the very thought said harry that was passing through my own brain when i spoke to you  yet somehow i think i should be uncommonly sorry after all if we were really sent back  theres a queer contradiction hammy were sorry and happy at the same time  if i were the skipper now i would found a philosophical argument upon it  which the skipper would carry on with untiring vigour said hamilton smiling and afterwards make an entry of in his log  but i think harry that to feel the emotion of sorrow and joy at the same time is not such a contradiction as it at first appears  perhaps not replied harry but it seems very contradictory to me and yet its an evident fact for im very sorry to leave them and im very happy to have you for my companion here  so am i so am i said the other heartily  i would rather travel with you harry than with any of our late companions although i like them all very much  the two friends had grown almost imperceptibly in each others esteem during their residence under the same roof more than either of them would have believed possible  the gay reckless hilarity of the one did not at first accord with the quiet gravity and as his comrades styled it softness of the other  but character is frequently misjudged at first sight and sometimes men who on a first acquaintance have felt repelled from each other have on coming to know each other better discovered traits and good qualities that ere long formed enduring bonds of sympathy and have learned to love those whom at first they felt disposed to dislike or despise  thus harry soon came to know that what he at first thought and along with his companions called softness in hamilton was in reality gentleness of disposition and thorough goodnature united in one who happened to be utterly unacquainted with the knowing ways of this peculiarly sharp and clever world while in the course of time new qualities showed themselves in a quiet unobtrusive way that won upon his affections and raised his esteem  on the other hand hamilton found that although harry was volatile and possessed of an irresistible tendency to fun and mischief he never by any chance gave way to anger or allowed malice to enter into his practical jokes  indeed he often observed him restrain his natural tendencies when they were at all likely to give pain though harry never dreamed that such efforts were known to any one but himself  besides this harry was peculiarly unselfish and when a man is possessed of this inestimable disposition he is not quite but very nearly perfect  after another pause during which the party had left the open river and directed their course through the woods where the depth of the snow obliged them to tread in each others footsteps harry resumed the conversation  you have not yet told me bythebye what old mr rogan said to you just before we started  did he give you any hint as to where you might be sent to after reaching norway house  no he merely said he knew that clerks were wanted both for mackenzie river and the saskatchewan districts but he did not know which i was destined for  hum exactly what he said to me with the slight addition that he strongly suspected that mackenzie river would be my doom  are you aware hammy my boy that the saskatchewan district is a sort of terrestrial paradise and mackenzie river equivalent to botany bay  i have heard as much during our conversations in bachelors hall but stop a bit harry these snowshoe lines of mine have got loosened with tearing through this deep snow and these shockingly thick bushes therethey are right now go on  i was going to say that i dontoh  this last exclamation was elicited from hamilton by a sharp blow caused by a branch which catching on part of harrys dress as he plodded on in front suddenly rebounded and struck him across the face  this is of common occurrence in travelling through the woods especially to those who from inexperience walk too closely on the heels of their companions  whats wrong now hammy inquired his friend looking over his shoulder  oh nothing worth mentioningrather a sharp blow from a branch thats all  well proceed youve interrupted yourself twice in what you were going to say  perhaps itll come out if you try it a third time  i was merely going to say that i dont much care where i am sent to so long as it is not to an outpost where i shall be all alone  all very well my friend but seeing that outposts are in comparison with principal forts about a hundred to one your chance of avoiding them is rather slight  however our youth and want of experience is in our favour as they like to send men who have seen some service to outposts  but i fear that with such brilliant characters as you and i hammy youth will only be an additional recommendation and inexperience wont last longhollo whats going on yonder  harry pointed as he spoke to an open spot in the woods about a quarter of a mile in advance where a dark object was seen lying on the snow writhing about now coiling into a lump and anon extending itself like a huge snake in agony  as the two friends looked a prolonged howl floated towards them  something wrong with the dogs i declare cried harry  no doubt of it replied his friend hurrying forward as they saw their indian guide rise from the ground and flourish his whip energetically while the howls rapidly increased  a few minutes brought them to the scene of action where they found the dogs engaged in a fight among themselves and the driver in a state of vehement passion alternately belabouring and trying to separate them dogs in these regions like the dogs of all other regions we suppose are very much addicted to fightinga propensity which becomes extremely unpleasant if indulged while the animals are in harness as they then become peculiarly savage probably from their being unable like an illassorted pair in wedlock to cut or break the ties that bind them moreover they twist the traces into such an ingeniously complicated mass that it renders disentanglement almost impossible even after exhaustion has reduced them to obedience  besides this they are so absorbed in worrying each other that for the time they are utterly regardless of their drivers lash or voice  this naturally makes the driver angry and sometimes irascible men practise shameful cruelties on the poor dogs  when the two friends came up they found the indian glaring at the animals as they fought and writhed in the snow with every lineament of his swarthy face distorted with passion and panting from his late exertions  suddenly he threw himself on the dogs again and lashed them furiously with the whip  finding that this had no effect he twined the lash round his hand and struck them violently over their heads and snouts with the handle then falling down on his knees he caught the most savage of the animals by the throat and seizing its nose between his teeth almost bit it off  the appalling yell that followed this cruel act seemed to subdue the dogs for they ceased to fight and crouched whining in the snow  with a bound like a tiger young hamilton sprang upon the guide and seizing him by the throat hurled him violently to the ground scoundrel he cried standing over the crestfallen indian with flushed face and flashing eyes how dare you thus treat the creatures of god  the young man would have spoken more but his indignation was so fierce that it could not find vent in words  for a moment he raised his fist as if he meditated dashing the indian again to the ground as he slowly arose then as if changing his mind he seized him by the back of the neck thrust him towards the panting dogs and stood in silence over him with the whip grasped firmly in his hand while he disentangled the traces  this accomplished hamilton ordered him in a voice of suppressed anger to go forwardan order which the cowed guide promptly obeyed and in a few minutes more the two friends were again alone  hamilton my boy exclaimed harry who up to this moment seemed to have been petrified you have perfectly amazed me  im utterly bewildered  indeed i fear that i have been very violent said hamilton blushing deeply  violent exclaimed his friend  why man ive completely mistaken your character  ii  i hope not harry said hamilton in a subdued tone i hope not believe me i am not naturally violent  i should be very sorry were you to think so  indeed i never felt thus before and now that it is over i am amazed at myself but surely youll admit that there was great provocation  such terrible cruelty to  my dear fellow you quite misunderstand me  im amazed at your pluck your energy  soft indeed we have been most egregiously mistaken provocation  i just think you had my only sorrow is that you didnt give him a little more  come come harry i see you would be as cruel to him as he was to the poor dog  but let us press forward it is already growing dark and we must not let the fellow out of sight ahead of us  allons donc cried harry and hastening their steps they travelled silently and rapidly among the stems of the trees while the shades of night gathered slowly round them  that night the three travellers encamped in the snow under the shelter of a spreading pine  the encampment was formed almost exactly in a similar manner to that in which they had slept on the night of their exploits at north river  they talked less however than on that occasion and slept more soundly  before retiring to rest and while harry was extended half asleep and half awake on his green blanket enjoying the delightful repose that follows a hard days march and a good supper hamilton drew near to the indian who sat sullenly smoking a little apart from the young men  sitting down beside him he administered a long rebuke in a low grave tone of voice  like rebukes generally it had the effect of making the visage of the indian still more sullen  but the young man did not appear to notice this he still continued to talk  as he went on the look grew less and less sullen until it faded entirely away and was succeeded by the grave quiet respectful expression peculiar to the face of the north american indian  day succeeded day night followed night and still found them plodding laboriously through the weary waste of snow or encamping under the trees of the forest  the two friends went through all the varied stages of experience which are included in what is called becoming used to the work which is sometimes a modified meaning of the expression used up  they started with a degree of vigour that one would have thought no amount of hard work could possibly abate  they became aware of the melancholy fact that fatigue unstrings the youngest and toughest sinews they pressed on however from stern necessity and found to their delight that young muscles recover their elasticity even in the midst of severe exertion  they still pressed on and discovered to their dismay that this recovery was only temporary and that the second state of exhaustion was infinitely worse than the first  still they pressed on and raised blisters on their feet and toes that caused them to limp woefully then they learned that blisters break and take a long time to heal and are much worse to walk upon during the healing process than they are at the commencementat which time they innocently fancied that nothing could be more dreadful  still they pressed on day after day and found to their satisfaction that such things can be endured and overcome that feet and toes can become hard like leather that muscles can grow tough as indiarubber and that spirits and energy can attain to a pitch of endurance which nothing within the compass of a days march can by any possibility overcome  they found also from experience that their conversation changed both in manner and subject as they progressed on their journey  at first they conversed frequently and on various topics chiefly on the probability of their being sent to pleasant places or the reverse  then they spoke less frequently and growled occasionally as they advanced in the painful process of training  after that as they began to get hardy they talked of the trees the snow the ice the tracks of wild animals they happened to cross and the objects of nature generally that came under their observation  then as their muscles hardened and their sinews grew tough and the days march at length became first a matter of indifference and ultimately an absolute pleasure they chatted cheerily on any and every subject or sang occasionally when the sun shone out and cast an appearance of warmth across their path  thus onward they pressed without halt or stay day after day through wood and brake over river and lake on ice and on snow for miles and miles together through the great uninhabited frozen wilderness    chapter twenty four  hopes and fearsan unexpected meetingphilosophical talk between the hunter and the parson  on arriving at norway house harry somerville and his friend hamilton found that they were to remain at that establishment during an indefinite period of time until it should please those in whose hands their ultimate destination lay to direct them how and where to proceed this was an unlookedfor trial of their patience but after the first exclamation of disappointment they made up their minds like wise men to think no more about it but bide their time and make the most of present circumstances  you see remarked hamilton as the two friends after having had an audience of the gentleman in charge of the establishment sauntered toward the rocks that overhang the margin of playgreen lakeyou see it is of no use to fret about what we cannot possibly help  nobody within three hundred miles of us knows where we are destined to spend next winter  perhaps orders may come in a couple of weeks perhaps in a couple of months but they will certainly come at last  anyhow it is of no use thinking about it so we had better forget it and make the best of things as we find them  ah exclaimed harry your advice is that we should by all means be happy and if we cant be happy be as happy as we can  is that it  just so  thats it exactly  ho  but then you see hammy youre a philosopher and im not and that makes all the difference  im not given to anticipating evil but i cannot help dreading that they will send me to some lonely swampy outoftheway hole where there will be no society no shooting no riding no work even to speak ofnothing in fact but the miserable satisfaction of being styled bourgeois by five or six men wretched outcasts like myself  come harry cried hamilton you are taking the very worst view of it  there certainly are plenty of such outposts in the country but you know very well that young fellows like you are seldom sent to such places  i dont know that interrupted harry  theres young mcandrew he was sent to an outpost up the mackenzie his second year in the service where he was all but starved and had to live for about two weeks on boiled parchment  then theres poor forrester he was shipped off to a placethe name of which i never could remembersomewhere between the headwaters of the athabasca lake and the north pole  to be sure he had good shooting im told but he had only four labouring men to enjoy it with and he has been there ten years now and he has more than once had to scrape the rocks of that detestable stuff called tripe de roche to keep himself alive  and then theres  very true interrupted hamilton  then theres your friend charles kennedy whom you so often talk about and many other young fellows we know who have been sent to the saskatchewan and to the columbia and to athabasca and to a host of other capital places where they have enough of societymale society at leastand good sport  the young men had climbed a rocky eminence which commanded a view of the lake on the one side and the fort with its background of woods on the other  here they sat down on a stone and continued for some time to admire the scene in silence  yes said harry resuming the thread of discourse you are right we have a good chance of seeing some pleasant parts of the country  but suspense is not pleasant  o man if they would only send me up the saskatchewan river  ive set my heart upon going there  im quite sure its the very best place in the whole country  youve told the truth that time master said a deep voice behind them  the young men turned quickly round  close beside them and leaning composedly on a long indian fowlingpiece stood a tall broadshouldered sunburned man apparently about forty years of age he was dressed in the usual leathern huntingcoat cloth leggings fur cap mittens and moccasins that constitute the winter garb of a hunter and had a grave firm but goodhumoured expression of countenance  youve told the truth that time master he repeated without moving from his place  the saskatchewan is to my mind the best place in the whole country and havin seen a considerable deal o places in my time i can speak from experience  indeed friend said harry im glad to hear you say so  come sit down beside us and lets hear something about it  thus invited the hunter seated himself on a stone and laid his gun on the hollow of his left arm  first of all friend continued harry do you belong to the fort here  no replied the man im stayin here just now but i dont belong to the place  where do you come from then and whats your name  why ive comed drect from the saskatchewan with a packet o letters im payin a visit to the missionary village yonderthe hunter pointed as he spoke across the lakeand when the ice breaks up i shall get a canoe and return again  and your name  why ive got four or five names  somehow or other people have given me a nickname wherever i ha chanced to go  but my true name and the one i hail by just now is jacques caradoc  jacques caradoc exclaimed harry starting with surprise  you knew a charley kennedy in the saskatchewan did you  that did i  as fine a lad as ever pulled a trigger  give us your hand friend exclaimed harry springing forward and seizing the hunters large hard fist in both hands  why man charley is my dearest friend and i had a letter from him some time ago in which he speaks of you and says youre one of the best fellows he ever met  you dont say so replied the hunter returning harrys grasp warmly while his eyes sparkled with pleasure and a quiet smile played at the corners of his mouth  yes i do said harry and im very nearly as glad to meet with you friend jacques as i would be to meet with him  but come its cold work talking here  lets go to my room theres a fire in the stove come along hammy and taking his new friend by the arm he hurried him along to his quarters in the fort  just as they were passing under the fort gate a large mass of snow became detached from a housetop and fell heavily at their feet passing within an inch of hamiltons nose  the young man started back with an exclamation and became very red in the face  hollo cried harry laughing got a fright hammy  that went so close to your chin that it almost saved you the trouble of shaving  yes i got a little fright from the suddenness of it said hamilton quietly  what do you think of my friend there said harry to jacques in a low voice pointing to hamilton who walked on in advance  ive not seen much of him master replied the hunter  had i been asked the same question about the same lad twenty years agone i should ha said he was soft and perhaps chickenhearted  but ive learned from experience to judge better than i used to do  i niver thinks o formin an opinion o any one till ive seen them called to sudden action  its astonishin how some fainthearted men will come to face a danger and put on an awful look o courage if they only get warnin but take them by surprisethats the way to try them  well jacques that is the very reason why i ask your opinion of hamilton  he was pretty well taken by surprise that time i think  true master but that kind o start dont prove much  howsever i dont think hes easy upset  he does look uncommon soft and his face grew red when the snow fell but his eyebrow and his under lip showed that it wasnt from fear  during that afternoon and the greater part of that night the three friends continued in close conversationharry sitting in front of the stove with his hands in his pockets on a chair tilted as usual on its hind legs and pouring out volleys of questions which were pithily answered by the goodhumoured loquacious hunter who sat behind the stove resting his elbows on his knees and smoking his muchloved pipe while hamilton reclined on harrys bed and listened with eager avidity to anecdotes and stories which seemed like the narrators pipe to be inexhaustible  goodnight jacques goodnight said harry as the latter rose at last to depart im delighted to have had a talk with you  you must come back tomorrow  i want to hear more about your friend redfeather where did you say you left him  in the saskatchewan master  he said that he would wait there as hed heerd the missionary was comin up to pay the injins a visit  bythebye youre going over to the missionarys place tomorrow are you not  yes i am  ah then thatll do  ill go over with you  how far off is it  three miles or thereabouts  very good  call in here as you pass and my friend hamilton and i will accompany you  goodnight  jacques thrust his pipe into his bosom held out his horny hand and giving his young friends a hearty shake turned and strode from the room  on the following day jacques called according to promise and the three friends set off together to visit the indian village  this missionary station was under the management of a wesleyan clergyman pastor conway by name an excellent man of about fortyfive years of age with an energetic mind and body a bald head a mild expressive countenance and a robust constitution  he was admirably qualified for his position having a natural aptitude for every sort of work that man is usually called on to perform  his chief care was for the instruction of the indians whom he had induced to settle around him in the great and allimportant truths of christianity  he invented an alphabet and taught them to write and read their own language  he commenced the laborious task of translating the scriptures into the cree language and being an excellent musician he instructed his converts to sing in parts the psalms and wesleyan hymns many of which are exceedingly beautiful a school was also established and a church built under his superintendence so that the natives assembled in an orderly way in a commodious sanctuary every sabbath day to worship god while the children were instructed not only in the scriptures and made familiar with the narrative of the humiliation and exaltation of our blessed saviour but were also taught the elementary branches of a secular education  but good pastor conways energy did not stop here  nature had gifted him with that peculiar genius which is powerfully expressed in the term a jackofalltrades  he could turn his hand to anything and being as we have said an energetic man he did turn his hand to almost everything  if anything happened to get broken the pastor could either mend it himself or direct how it was to be done  if a house was to be built for a new family of red men who had never handled a saw or hammer in their lives and had lived up to that time in tents the pastor lent a hand to begin it drew out the plan not a very complicated thing certainly set them fairly at work and kept his eye on it until it was finished  in short the worthy pastor was everything to everybody that by all means he might gain some  under such management the village flourished as a matter of course although it did not increase very rapidly owing to the almost unconquerable aversion of north american indians to take up a settled habitation  it was to this little hamlet then that our three friends directed their steps  on arriving they found pastor conway in a sort of workshop giving directions to an indian who stood with a solderingiron in one hand and a sheet of tin in the other which he was about to apply to a curiouslooking halffinished machine that bore some resemblance to a canoe  ah my friend jacques he exclaimed as the hunter approached him the very man i wished to see  but i beg pardon gentlemenstrangers i perceive  you are heartily welcome  it is seldom that i have the pleasure of seeing new friends in my wild dwelling  pray come with me to my house  pastor conway shook hands with harry and hamilton with a degree of warmth that evinced the sincerity of his words  the young men thanked him and accepted the invitation  as they turned to quit the workshop the pastor observed jacquess eye fixed with a puzzled expression of countenance on his canoe  you have never seen anything like that before i dare say said he with a smile  no sir i never did see such a queer machine afore  it is a tin canoe with which i hope to pass through many miles of country this spring on my way to visit a tribe of northern indians and it was about this very thing that i wanted to see you my friend  jacques made no reply but cast a look savouring very slightly of contempt on the unfinished canoe as they turned and went away  the pastors dwelling stood at one end of the village a view of which it commanded from the back windows while those in front overlooked the lake  it was pleasantly situated and pleasantly tenanted for the pastors wife was a cheerful active little lady likeminded with himself and delighted to receive and entertain strangers  to her care mr conway consigned the young men after spending a short time in conversation with them and then requesting his wife to show them through the village he took jacques by the arm and sauntered out  come with me jacques he began i have somewhat to say to you  i had not time to broach the subject when i met you at the companys fort and have been anxious to see you ever since  you tell me that you have met with my friend redfeather  yes sir i spent a week or two with him last fall  i found him stayin with his tribe and we started to come down here together  ah that is the very point exclaimed the pastor that i wished to inquire about  i firmly believe that god has opened that indians eyes to see the truth and i fully expected from what he said when we last met that he would have made up his mind to come and stay here  as to what the almighty has done to him said jacques in a reverential tone of voice i dont pretend to know he did for sartin speak and act too in a way that i never seed an injin do before  but about his comin here sir you were quite right he did mean to come and ive no doubt will come yet  what prevented him coming with you as you tell me he intended inquired the pastor  well you see sir he and i and his squaw as i said set off to come here together but when we got the length o edmonton house we heerd that you were comin up to pay a visit to the tribe to which redfeather belongs and so seein that it was o no use to come down hereaway just to turn about an go up agin he stopped there to wait for you for he knew you would want him to interpret  ay interrupted the pastor thats true  i have two reasons for wishing to have him here  the primary one is that he may get good to his immortal soul  and then he understands english so well that i want him to become my interpreter for although i understand the cree language pretty well now i find it exceedingly difficult to explain the doctrines of the bible to my people in it  but pardon me i interrupted you  i was only going to say resumed jacques that i made up my mind to stay with him but they wanted a man to bring the winter packet here so as they pressed me very hard an i had nothin particular to do i greed and came though i would rather ha stopped for redfeather an i ha struck up a friendship togithera thing that i would niver ha thought it possble for me to do with a red injin  and why not with a red indian friend inquired the pastor while a shade of sadness passed over his mild features as if unpleasant thoughts had been roused by the hunters speech  well its not easy to say why rejoined the other  ive no particlar objection to the redskins  theres only one man among them that i bears a grudge agin and even that one id rayther avoid than otherwise  but you should forgive him jacques  the bible tells us not only to bear our enemies no grudge but to love them and to do them good  the hunters brow darkened  thats impossible sir he said i couldnt do him a good turn if i was to try ever so hard  he may bless his stars that i dont want to do him mischief but to love him its jist impossble  with man it is impossible but with god all things are possible said the pastor solemnly  jacquess naturally philosophic though untutored mind saw the force of this  he felt that god who had formed his soul his body and the wonderfully complicated machinery and objects of nature which were patent to his observant and reflective mind wherever he went must of necessity be equally able to alter influence and remould them all according to his will  commonsense was sufficient to teach him this and the bold hunter exhibited no ordinary amount of commonsense in admitting the fact at once although in the case under discussion the loving of his enemy it seemed utterly impossible to his feelings and experience  the frown therefore passed from his brow while he said respectfully what you say sir is true i believe though i cant feel it  but i spose the reason i niver felt much drawn to the redskins is that all the time i lived in the settlements i was used to hear them called and treated as thievin dogs an when i comd among them i didnt see much to alter my opinion  here an there i have found one or two honest injins an redfeather is as true as steel but the most o them are no better than they should be  i spose i dont think much o them just because they are redskins  ah jacques you will excuse me if i say that there is not much sense in that reason  an indian cannot help being a red man any more than you can help being a white one so that he ought not to be despised on that account  besides god made him what he is and to despise the work of god or to undervalue it is to despise god himself  you may indeed despise or rather abhor the sins that red men are guilty of but if you despise them on this ground you must much more despise white men for they are guilty of greater iniquities than indians are they have more knowledge and are therefore more inexcusable when they sin and any one who has travelled much must be aware that in regard to general wickedness white men are at least quite as bad as indians  depend upon it jacques that there will be indians found in heaven at the last day as well as white men  god is no respecter of persons  i niver thought much on that subject afore sir returned the hunter what you say seems reasonable enough  im sure an sartin any way that if theres a redskin in heaven at all redfeather will be there an i only hope that i may be there too to keep him company  i hope so my friend said the pastor earnestly i hope so too with all my heart  and if you will accept of this little book it will show you how to get there  the missionary drew a small plainlybound copy of the bible from his pocket as he spoke and presented it to jacques who received it with a smile and thanked him saying at the same time that he was not much up to booklarnin but he would read it with pleasure  now jacques said the pastor after a little further conversation on the subject of the bible in which he endeavoured to impress upon him the absolute necessity of being acquainted with the blessed truths which it containsnow jacques about my visit to the indians  i intend if the almighty spares me to embark in yon tin canoe that you found me engaged with and with six men to work it proceed to the country of the knisteneux indians visit their chief camp and preach to them there as long as the weather will permit  when the season is pretty well advanced and winter threatens to cut off my retreat i shall reembark in my canoe and return home  by this means i hope to be able to sow the good seed of christian truth in the hearts of men who as they will not come to this settlement have no chance of being brought under the power of the gospel by any other means  jacques gave one of his quiet smiles on hearing this  right sir right he said with some energy i have always thought although i niver made bold to say it before that there was not enough o this sort o thing  it has always seemed to me a kind o madness excuse my plainness o speech sir in you pastors thinkin to make the redskins come an settle round you like so many squaws and dig up an grub at the ground when its quite clear that their natur and the natur o things about them meant them to be hunters  an surely since the almighty made them hunters he intended them to be hunters an wont refuse to make them christians on that account  a redskins natur is a huntin natur an nothin on arthll ever make it anything else  there is much truth in what you observe friend rejoined the pastor but you are not altogether right  their nature may be changed although certainly nothing on earth will change it  look at that frozen lake  he pointed to the wide field of thick snowcovered ice that stretched out for miles like a sheet of white marble before them could anything on earth break up or sink or melt that  nothin replied jacques laconically  but the warm beams of yon glorious sun can do it continued the pastor pointing upwards as he spoke and do it effectually too so that although you can scarcely observe the process it nevertheless turns the hard thick solid ice into limpid water at last  so is it in regard to man  nothing on earth can change his heart or alter his nature but our saviour who is called the sun of righteousness can when he shines into a mans soul it melts  the old man becomes a little child the wild savage a christian  but i agree with you in thinking that we have not been sufficiently alive to the necessity of seeking to convert the indians before trying to gather them round us  the one would follow as a natural consequence i think of the other and it is owing to this conviction that i intend as i have already said to make a journey in spring to visit those who will not or cannot come to visit me  and now what i want to ask is whether you will agree to accompany me as steersman and guide on my expedition  the hunter slowly shook his head  im afeard not sir i have already promised to take charge of a canoe for the company  i would much rather go with you but i must keep my word  certainly jacques certainly that settles the question  you cannot go with meunless the pastor paused as if in thought for a momentunless you can persuade them to let you off  well sir i can try returned jacques  do and i need not say how happy i shall be if you succeed  goodday friend goodbye  so saying the missionary shook hands with the hunter and returned to his house while jacques wended his way to the village in search of harry and hamilton    chapter twenty five  good news and romantic scenerybearhunting and its results  jacques failed in his attempt to break off his engagement with the furtraders  the gentleman in charge of norway house albeit a goodnatured estimable man was one who could not easily brook disappointment especially in matters that involved the interests of the hudsons bay company so jacques was obliged to hold to his compact and the pastor had to search for another guide  spring came and with it the awakening if we may use the expression of the country from the long lethargic sleep of winter  the sun burst forth with irresistible power and melted all before it  ice and snow quickly dissolved and set free the waters of swamp and river lake and sea to leap and sparkle in their newfound liberty  birds renewed their visits to the regions of the north frogs at last unfrozen opened their leathern jaws to croak and whistle in the marshes and men began their preparations for a summer campaign  at the commencement of the season an express arrived with letters from headquarters which among other matters of importance directed that messrs somerville and hamilton should be dispatched forthwith to the saskatchewan district where on reaching fort pitt they were to place themselves at the disposal of the gentleman in charge of the district it need scarcely be added that the young men were overjoyed on receiving this almost unhopedfor intelligence and that harry expressed his satisfaction in his usual hilarious manner asserting somewhat profanely in the excess of his glee that the governorinchief of ruperts land was a regular brick  hamilton agreed to all his friends remarks with a quiet smile accompanied by a slight chuckle and a somewhat desperate attempt at a caper which attempt bordering as it did on a region of buffoonery into which our quiet and gentlemanly friend had never dared hitherto to venture proved an awkward and utter failure  he felt this and blushed deeply  it was further arranged and agreed upon that the young men should accompany jacques caradoc in his canoe  having become sufficiently expert canoemen to handle their paddles well they scouted the idea of taking men with them and resolved to launch boldly forth at once as bonafide voyageurs  to this arrangement jacques after one or two trials to test their skill agreed and very shortly after the arrival of the express the trio set out on their voyage amid the cheers and adieus of the entire population of norway house who were assembled on the end of the wooden wharf to witness their departure and with whom they had managed during their short residence at that place to become special favourites  a month later the pastor of the indian village having procured a trusty guide embarked in his tin canoe with a crew of six men and followed in their track  in process of time spring merged into summera season chiefly characterised in those climes by intense heat and innumerable clouds of mosquitoes whose vicious and incessant attacks render life for the time being a burden  our three voyageurs meanwhile ascended the saskatchewan penetrating deeper each day into the heart of the north american continent  on arriving at fort pitt they were graciously permitted to rest for three days after which they were forwarded to another district where fresh efforts were being made to extend the furtrade into lands hitherto almost unvisited  this continuation of their travels was quite suited to the tastes and inclinations of harry and hamilton and was hailed by them as an additional reason for selfgratulation  as for jacques he cared little to what part of the world he chanced to be sent  to hunt to toil in rain and in sunshine in heat and in cold at the paddle or on the snowshoe was his vocation and it mattered little to the bold hunter whether he plied it upon the plains of the saskatchewan or among the woods of athabasca besides the companions of his travels were young active bold adventurous and therefore quite suited to his taste  redfeather too his best and dearest friend had been induced to return to his tribe for the purpose of mediating between some of the turbulent members of it and the white men who had gone to settle among them so that the prospect of again associating with his red friend was an additional element in his satisfaction  as charley kennedy was also in this district the hope of seeing him once more was a subject of such unbounded delight to harry somerville and so sympathetically to young hamilton that it was with difficulty they could realise the full amount of their good fortune or give adequate expression to their feelings  it is therefore probable that there never were three happier travellers than jacques harry and hamilton as they shouldered their guns and paddles shook hands with the inmates of fort pitt and with light steps and lighter hearts launched their canoe turned their bronzed faces once more to the summer sun and dipped their paddles again in the rippling waters of the saskatchewan river  as their bark was exceedingly small and burdened with but little lading they resolved to abandon the usual route and penetrate the wilderness through a maize of lakes and small rivers well known to their guide  by this arrangement they hoped to travel more speedily and avoid navigating a long sweep of the river by making a number of portages while at the same time the changeful nature of the route was likely to render it more interesting  from the fact of its being seldom traversed it was also more likely that they should find a supply of game for the journey  towards sunset one fine day about two weeks after their departure from fort pitt our voyageurs paddled their canoe round a wooded point of land that jutted out from and partially concealed the mouth of a large river down whose stream they had dropped leisurely during the last three days and swept out upon the bosom of a large lake  this was one of those sheets of water which glitter in hundreds on the green bosom of americas forests and are so numerous and comparatively insignificant as to be scarce distinguished by a name unless when they lie directly in the accustomed route of the furtraders  but although in comparison with the freshwater oceans of the far west this lake was unnoticed and almost unknown it would by no means have been regarded in such a light had it been transported to the plains of england  in regard to picturesque beauty it was perhaps unsurpassed  it might be about six miles wide and so long that the land at the farther end of it was faintly discernible on the horizon  wooded hills sloping gently down to the waters edge jutting promontories some rocky and barren others more or less covered with trees deep bays retreating in some places into the dark recesses of a savagelooking gorge in others into a distant meadowlike plain bordered with a stripe of yellow sand beautiful islands of various sizes scattered along the shores as if nestling there for security or standing barren and solitary in the centre of the lake like bulwarks of the wilderness some covered with luxuriant vegetation others bald and grotesque in outline and covered with gulls and other waterfowlthis was the scene that broke upon the view of the travellers as they rounded the point and ceasing to paddle gazed upon it long and in deep silence their hands raised to shade their eyes from the suns rays which sparkled in the water and fell here in bright spots and broken patches and there in yellow floods upon the rocks the trees the forest glades and plains around them  what a glorious scene murmured hamilton almost unconsciously  a perfect paradise said harry with a longdrawn sigh of satisfactionwhy jacques my friend its a matter of wonder to me that you a free man without relations or friends to curb you or attract you to other parts of the world should go boating and canoeing all over the country at the beck of the furtraders when you might come and pitch your tent here for ever  for ever echoed jacques  well i mean as long as you live in this world  ah master rejoined the guide in a sad tone of voice its just because i have neither kith nor kin nor friends to draw me to any particlar spot on arth that i dont care to settle down in this one beautiful though it be  true true muttered harry mans a gregarious animal theres no doubt of that  anon exclaimed jacques  i meant to say that man naturally loves company replied harry smiling  an yit ive seen some as didnt master though to be sure that was onnatral and theres not many o them by good luck  yes mans fond o seein the face o man  and woman too interrupted harryeh hamilton what say you    o woman in our hours of ease   uncertain coy and hard to please   when pain and anguish wring the brow   a ministering angel thou  alas hammy pain and anguish and everything else may wring our unfortunate brows here long enough before woman lovely woman will come to our aid  what a rare sight it would be now to see even an ordinary housemaid or cook out here  it would be good for sore eyes it seems to me a sort of horrible untruth to say that ive not seen a woman since i left red river and yet its a frightful fact for i dont count the coppercoloured nondescripts one meets with hereabouts to be women at all  i suppose they are but they dont look like it  dont be a goose harry said hamilton  certainly not my friend  if i were under the disagreeable necessity of being anything but what i am i should rather be something that is not in the habit of being shot replied the other paddling with renewed vigour in order to get rid of some of the superabundant spirits that the beautiful scene and brilliant weather acting on a young and ardent nature had called forth  some of these same redskins remarked the guide are not such bad sort o women for all their ill looks  ive knowd more than one that was a firstrate wife an a good mother though its true they had little edication beyond that o the woods  no doubt of it replied harry laughing gaily  how shall i keep the canoes head jacques  right away for the pint that lies jist between you an the sun  yes i give them all credit for being excellent wives and mothers after a fashion resumed harry  ive no wish to asperse the character of the poor indians but you must know jacques that theyre very different from the women that i allude to and of whom scott sung  his heroines were of a very different stamp and colour  did he sing of niggers inquired jacques simply  of niggers shouted harry looking over his shoulder at hamilton with a broad grin no jacques not exactly of niggers  hist exclaimed the guide with that peculiar subdued energy that at once indicates an unexpected discovery and enjoins caution while at the same moment by a deep powerful backstroke of his paddle he suddenly checked the rapid motion of the canoe  harry and his friend glanced quickly over their shoulders with a look of surprise  whats in the wind now whispered the former  stop paddling masters and look ahead at the rock yonder jist under the tall cliff  theres a bear asittin there an if we can only get to shore afore he sees us were sartin sure of him  as the guide spoke he slowly edged the canoe towards the shore while the young men gazed with eager looks in the direction indicated where they beheld what appeared to be the decayed stump of an old tree or a mass of brown rock  while they strained their eyes to see it more clearly the object altered its form and position  so it is they exclaimed simultaneously in a tone that was equivalent to the remark now we believe because we see it  in a few seconds the bow of the canoe touched the land so lightly as to be quite inaudible and harry stepping gently over the side drew it forward a couple of feet while his companions disembarked  now mister harry said the guide as he slung a powderhorn and shotbelt over his shoulder weve no need to circumvent the beast for hes circumvented hisself  how so inquired the other drawing the shot from his fowlingpiece and substituting in its place a leaden bullet  jacques led the way through the somewhat thinly scattered underwood as he replied you see mister harry the place where hes gone to sun hisself is jist at the foot o a sheer precipice which runs round ahead of him and juts out into the water so that hes got three ways to choose between  he must clamber up the precipice which will take him some time i guess if he can do it at all or he must take to the water which he dont like and wont do if he can help it or he must run out the way he went in but as we shall go to meet him by the same road hell have to break our ranks before he gains the woods an thatll be no easy job  the party soon reached the narrow pass between the lake and the near end of the cliff where they advanced with greater caution and peeping over the low bushes beheld bruin a large brown fellow sitting on his haunches and rocking himself slowly to and fro as he gazed abstractedly at the water  he was scarcely within good shot but the cover was sufficiently thick to admit of a nearer approach  now hamilton said harry in a low whisper take the first shot  i killed the last one so its your turn this time  hamilton hesitated but could make no reasonable objection to this although his unselfish nature prompted him to let his friend have the first chance  however jacques decided the matter by saying in a tone that savoured strongly of command although it was accompanied with a goodhumoured smile  go forard young man but you may as well put in the primin first  poor hamilton hastily rectified this oversight with a deep blush at the same time muttering that he never would make a hunter and then advanced cautiously through the bushes slowly followed at a short distance by his companions  on reaching a bush within seventy yards of the bear hamilton pushed the twigs aside with the muzzle of his gun his eye flashed and his courage mounted as he gazed at the truly formidable animal before him and he felt more of the hunters spirit within him at that moment than he would have believed possible a few minutes before  unfortunately a hunters spirit does not necessarily imply a hunters eye or hand  having with much care and long time brought his piece to bear exactly where he supposed the brutes heart should be he observed that the gun was on halfcock by nearly breaking the trigger in his convulsive efforts to fire  by the time that this error was rectified bruin who seemed to feel intuitively that some imminent danger threatened him rose and began to move about uneasily which so alarmed the young hunter lest he should lose his shot that he took a hasty aim fired and missed harry asserted afterwards that he even missed the cliff  on hearing the loud report which rolled in echoes along the precipice bruin started and looking round with an undecided air saw harry step quietly from the bushes and fire sending a ball into his flank  this decided him with a fierce growl of pain he scampered towards the water then changing his mind he wheeled round and dashed at the cliff up which he scrambled with wonderful speed  come mister hamilton load again quick  ill have to do the job myself i fear said jacques as he leaned quietly on his long gun and with a halfpitying smile watched the young man who madly essayed to recharge his piece more rapidly than it was possible for mortal man to do  meanwhile harry had reloaded and fired again but owing to the perturbation of his young spirits and the frantic efforts of the bear to escape he missed  another moment and the animal would actually have reached the top when jacques hastily fired and brought it tumbling down the precipice  owing to the position of the animal at the time he fired the wound was not mortal and foreseeing that bruin would now become the aggressor the hunter began rapidly to reload at the same time retreating with his companions who in their excitement had forgotten to recharge their pieces  on reaching level ground bruin rose shook himself gave a yell of anger on beholding his enemies and rushed at them  it was a fine sight to behold the bearing of jacques at this critical juncture  accustomed to bearhunting from his youth and utterly indifferent to consequences when danger became imminent he saw at a glance the probabilities of the case  he knew exactly how long it would take him to load his gun and regulated his pace so as not to interfere with that operation  his features wore their usual calm expression every motion of his hands was quick and sudden yet not hurried but performed in a way that led the beholder irresistibly to imagine that he could have done it even more rapidly if necessary  on reaching a ledge of rock that overhung the lake a few feet he paused and wheeled about click went the doghead just as the bear rose to grapple with him another moment and a bullet passed through the brutes heart while the bold hunter sprang lightly on one side to avoid the dash of the falling animal  as he did so young hamilton who had stood a little behind him with an uplifted axe ready to finish the work should jacquess fire prove ineffective received bruin in his arms and tumbled along with him over the rock headlong into the water from which however he speedily arose unhurt sputtering and coughing and dragging the dead bear to the shore  well done hammy shouted harry indulging in a prolonged peal of laughter when he ascertained that his friends adventure had cost him nothing more than a ducking that was the most amicable loving plunge i ever saw  better a cold bath in the arms of a dead bear than an embrace on dry land with a live one retorted hamilton as he wrung the water out of his dripping garments  most true o sagacious diver  but the sooner we get a fire made the better so come along  while the two friends hastened up to the woods to kindle a fire jacques drew his huntingknife and with doffed coat and upturned sleeves was soon busily employed in divesting the bear of his natural garment  the carcass being valueless in a country where game of a more palatable kind was plentiful they left behind as a feast to the wolves  after this was accomplished and the clothes dried they reembarked and resumed their journey plying the paddles energetically in silence as their adventure had occasioned a considerable loss of time  it was late and the stars had looked down for a full hour into the profound depths of the now dark lake ere the party reached the ground at the other side of the point on which jacques had resolved to encamp being somewhat wearied they spent but little time in discussing supper and partook of that meal with a degree of energy that implied a sense of duty as well as of pleasure  shortly after they were buried in repose under the scanty shelter of their canoe    chapter twenty six  an unexpected meeting and an unexpected deerhuntarrival at the outpostdisagreement with the nativesan enemy discovered and a murder  next morning they rose with the sun and therefore also with the birds and beasts  a wide traverse of the lake now lay before them  this they crossed in about two hours during which time they paddled unremittingly as the sky looked rather lowering and they were well aware of the danger of being caught in a storm in such an eggshell craft as an indian canoe  well put in here now mister harry exclaimed jacques as the canoe entered the mouth of one of those small rivulets which are called in scotland burns and in america creeks its like that your appetite is sharpened after a spell like that  keep her head a little more to the leftstraight for the pintso  its likely well get some fish here if we set the net  i say jacques is yon a cloud or a wreath of smoke above the trees in the creek inquired harry pointing with his paddle towards the object referred to  its smoke master ive seed it for some time and mayhap well find some injins there who can give us news of the traders at stoney creek  and pray how far do you think we may now be from that place inquired harry  forty miles more or less  as he spoke the canoe entered the shallow water of the creek and began to ascend the current of the stream which at its mouth was so sluggish as to be scarcely perceptible to the eye  not so however to the arms the light bark which while floating on the lake had glided buoyantly forward as if it were itself consenting to the motion had now become apparently imbued with a spirit of contradiction bounding convulsively forward at each stroke of the paddles and perceptibly losing speed at each interval  directing their course towards a flat rock on the left bank of the stream they ran the prow out of the water and leaped ashore  as they did so the unexpected figure of a man issued from the bushes and sauntered towards the spot  harry and hamilton advanced to meet him while jacques remained to unload the canoe  the stranger was habited in the usual dress of a hunter and carried a fowlingpiece over his right shoulder  in general appearance he looked like an indian but though the face was burned by exposure to a hue that nearly equalled the red skins of the natives a strong dash of pink in it and the mass of fair hair which encircled it proved that as harry paradoxically expressed it its owner was a white man  he was young considerably above the middle height and apparently athletic  his address and language on approaching the young men put the question of his being a white man beyond a doubt  goodmorning gentlemen he began  i presume that you are the party we have been expecting for some time past to reinforce our staff at stoney creek  is it not so  to this query young somerville who stood in advance of his friend made no reply but stepping hastily forward laid a hand on each of the strangers shoulders and gazed earnestly into his face exclaiming as he did so  do my eyes deceive me  is charley kennedy before meor his ghost  what eh exclaimed the individual thus addressed returning harrys gripe and stare with interest is it possible  noit cannotharry somerville my old dear unexpected friendand pouring out broken sentences abrupt ejaculations and incoherent questions to which neither vouchsafed replies the two friends gazed at and walked round each other shook hands partially embraced and committed sundry other extravagances utterly unconscious of or indifferent to the fact that hamilton was gazing at them openmouthed in a species of stupor and that jacques was standing by regarding them with a look of mingled amusement and satisfaction  the discovery of this latter personage was a source of renewed delight and astonishment to charley who was so much upset by the commotion of his spirits in consequence of this so to speak double shot that he became rambling and incoherent in his speech during the remainder of that day and gave vent to frequent and sudden bursts of smothered enthusiasm in which it would appear from the occasional muttering of the names of redfeather and jacques that he not only felicitated himself on his own good fortune but also anticipated renewed pleasure in witnessing the joyful meeting of these two worthies ere long  in fact this meeting did take place on the following day when redfeather returning from a successful hunt with part of a deer on his shoulders entered charleys tent in which the travellers had spent the previous day and night and discovered the guide gravely discussing a venison steak before the fire  it would be vain to attempt a description of all that the reunited friends said and did during the first twentyfour hours after their meeting how they talked of old times as they lay extended round the fire inside of charleys tent and recounted their adventures by flood and field since they last met how they sometimes diverged into questions of speculative philosophy as conversations will often diverge whether we wish it or not and broke short off to make sudden inquiries after old friends how this naturally led them to talk of new friends and new scenes until they began to forecast their eyes a little into the future and how on feeling that this was an uncongenial theme under present circumstances they reverted again to the past and by a peculiar train of conversationto retrace which were utterly impossiblethey invariably arrived at old times again  having in course of the evening pretty well exhausted their powers both mental and physical they went to sleep on it and resumed the colloquial melange in the morning  and now tell me charley what you are doing in this uninhabited part of the world so far from stoney creek said harry somerville as they assembled round the fire to breakfast  that is soon explained replied charley  my good friend and superior mr whyte having got himself comfortably housed at stoney creek thought it advisable to establish a sort of half outpost half fishingstation about twenty miles below the new fort and believing very justly that my talents lay a good deal in the way of fishing and shooting sent me to superintend it during the summer months  i am therefore at present monarch of that notable establishment which is not yet dignified with a name  hearing that there were plenty of deer about twenty miles below my palace i resolved the other day to gratify my love of sport and at the same time procure some venison for stoney creek accordingly i took redfeather with me andhere i am  very good said harry and can you give us the least idea of what they are going to do with my friend hamilton and me when they get us  cant say  one of you at any rate will be kept at the creek to assist mr whyte the other may perhaps be appointed to relieve me at the fishing for a time while i am sent off to push the trade in other quarters  but im only guessing  i dont know anything definitely for mr whyte is by no means communicative  an please master put in jacques when do you mean to let us off from this place  i guess the bourgeois wont be over pleased if we waste time here  well start this forenoon jacques  i and redfeather shall go along with you as i intended to take a run up to the creek about this time at any ratehave you the skins and dried meat packed redfeather  to this the indian replied in the affirmative and the others having finished breakfast the whole party rose to prepare for departure and set about loading their canoes forthwith  an hour later they were again cleaving the waters of the lake with this difference in arrangement that jacques was transferred to redfeathers canoe while charley kennedy took his place in the stern of that occupied by harry and hamilton  the establishment of which our friend charley pronounced himself absolute monarch and at which they arrived in the course of the same afternoon consisted of two small log houses or huts constructed in the rudest fashion and without any attempt whatever at architectural embellishment  it was pleasantly situated on a small bay whose northern extremity was sheltered from the arctic blast by a gentle rising ground clothed with wood  a miscellaneous collection of fishing apparatus lay scattered about in front of the buildings and two men in a canoe completed the picture  the said two men and an indian woman were the inhabitants of the place the king himself when present and his prime minister redfeather being the remainder of the population  pleasant little kingdom that of yours charley remarked harry somerville as they passed the station  very was the laconic reply  they had scarcely passed the place above a mile when a canoe containing a solitary indian was observed to shoot out from the shore and paddle hastily towards them  from this man they learned that a herd of deer was passing down towards the lake and would be on its banks in a few minutes  he had been waiting their arrival when the canoes came in sight and induced him to hurry out so as to give them warning having no time to lose the whole party now paddled swiftly for the shore and reached it just a few minutes before the branching antlers of the deer came in sight above the low bushes that skirted the wood harry somerville embarked in the bow of the strange indians canoe so as to lighten the other and enable all parties to have a fair chance after snuffing the breeze for a few seconds the foremost animal took the water and commenced swimming towards the opposite shore of the lake which at this particular spot was narrow  it was followed by seven others  after sufficient time was permitted to elapse to render their being cut off in an attempt to return quite certain the three canoes darted from the shelter of the overhanging bushes and sprang lightly over the water in pursuit  dont hurry and strike sure cried jacques to his young friends as they came up with the terrified deer that now swam for their lives  ay ay was the reply  in another moment they shot in among the struggling group  harry somerville stood up and seizing the indians spear prepared to strike while his companions directed their course towards others of the herd a few seconds sufficed to bring him up with it  leaning backwards a little so as to give additional force to the blow he struck the spear deep into the animals back  with a convulsive struggle it ceased to swim its head sank slowly and in another second it lay dead upon the water  without waiting a moment the indian immediately directed the canoe towards another deer while the remainder of the party now considerably separated from each other dispatched the whole herd by means of axes and knives  ha exclaimed jacques as they towed their booty to the shore thats a good stock o meat mister charles  it will help to furnish the larder for the winter pretty well  it was much wanted jacques weve a good many mouths to feed besides treating the indians now and then  and this fellow i think will claim the most of the hunt as his own  we should not have got the deer but for him  true true mister charles  they belong to the redskin by rights thats sartin  after this exploit another night was passed under the trees and at noon on the day following they ran their canoe alongside the wooden wharf at stoney creek  goodday to you gentlemen said mr whyte to harry and hamilton as they landed ive been looking out for you these two weeks past  glad youve come at last however  plenty to do and no time to lose  you have dispatches of course  ah thats right harry drew a sealed packet from his bosom and presented it with a bow thats right  i must peruse these at oncemr kennedy you will show these gentlemen their quarters  we dine in half an hour  so saying mr whyte thrust the packet into his pocket and without further remark strode towards his dwelling while charley as instructed led his friends to their new residencenot forgetting however to charge redfeather to see to the comfortable lodgment of jacques caradoc  now it strikes me remarked harry as he sat down on the edge of charleys bed and thrust his hands doggedly down into his pockets while hamilton tucked up his sleeves and assaulted a washhandbasin which stood on an unpainted wooden chair in a cornerit strikes me that if thats his usual style of behaviour old whyte is a pleasure that we didnt anticipate  dont judge from first impressions theyre often deceptive spluttered hamilton pausing in his ablutions to look at his friend through a mass of soapsudsan act which afterwards cost him a good deal of pain and a copious flow of unbidden tears  right exclaimed charley with an approving nod to hamiltonyou must not judge him prematurely harry  hes a goodhearted fellow at bottom and if he once takes a liking for you hell go through fire and water to serve you as i know from experience  which means to say three things replied the implacable harry first that for all his goodheartedness at bottom he never shows any of it at top and is therefore like unto truth which is said to lie at the bottom of a wellso deep in fact that it is never got out and so is of use to nobody secondly that he is possessed of that amount of affection which is common to all mankind to a great extent even to brutes which prompts a man to be reasonably attentive to his friends and thirdly that you master kennedy enjoy the peculiar privilege of being the friend of a twolegged polar bear  were i not certain that you jest retorted kennedy i would compel you to apologise to me for insulting my friend you rascal  but see heres the cook coming to tell us that dinner waits  if you dont wish to see the teeth of the polar bear id advise you to be smart  thus admonished harry sprang up plunged his hands and face in the basin and dried them broke charleys comb in attempting to pass it hastily through his hair used his fingers savagely as a substitute and overtook his companions just as they entered the messroom  the establishment of stoney creek was comprised within two acres of ground  it consisted of eight or nine housesthree of which however alone met the eye on approaching by the lake  the great house as it was termed on account of its relative proportion to the other buildings was a small edifice built substantially but roughly of unsquared logs partially whitewashed roofed with shingles and boasting six small windows in front with a large door between them  on its east side and at right angles to it was a similar edifice but smaller having two doors instead of one and four windows instead of six  this was the tradingshop and provisionstore  opposite to this was a twin building which contained the furs and a variety of miscellaneous stores  thus were formed three sides of a square from the centre of which rose a tall flagstaff  the buildings behind those just described were smaller and insignificantthe principal one being the house appropriated to the men the others were mere sheds and workshops  luxuriant forests ascended the slopes that rose behind and encircled this oasis on all sides excepting in front where the clear waters of the lake sparkled like a blue mirror  on the margin of this lake the new arrivals left to enjoy themselves as they best might for a day or two sauntered about and chatted to their hearts content of things past present and future  during these wanderings harry confessed that his opinion of mr whyte had somewhat changed that he believed a good deal of the first bad impression was attributable to his cool not to say impolite reception of them and that he thought things would go on much better with the indians if he would only try to let some of his good qualities be seen through his exterior  an expression of sadness passed over charleys face as his friend said this  you are right in the last particular he said with a sigh  mr whyte is so rough and overbearing that the indians are beginning to dislike him  some of the more clearsighted among them see that a good deal of this lies in mere manner and have penetration enough to observe that in all his dealings with them he is straightforward and liberal but there are a set of them who either dont see this or are so indignant at the rough speeches he often makes and the rough treatment he sometimes threatens that they wont forgive him but seem to be nursing their wrath  i sometimes wish he was sent to a district where the indians and traders are from habitual intercourse more accustomed to each others ways and so less likely to quarrel  have the indians then used any open threats asked harry  no not exactly but through an old man of the tribe who is well affected towards us i have learned that there is a party among them who seem bent on mischief  then we may expect a row some day or other  thats pleasantwhat think you hammy said harry turning to his friend  i think that it would be anything but pleasant he replied and i sincerely hope that we shall not have occasion for a row  youre not afraid of a fight are you hamilton asked charley  the peculiarly bland smile with which hamilton usually received any remark that savoured of banter overspread his features as charley spoke but he merely repliedno charley im not afraid  do you know any of the indians who are so anxious to vent their spleen on our worthy bourgeois asked harry as he seated himself on a rocky eminence commanding a view of the richlywooded slopes dotted with huge masses of rock that had fallen from the beetling cliffs behind the creek  yes i do replied charley and by the way one of themthe ringleaderis a man with whom you are acquainted at least by name youve heard of an indian called misconna  what exclaimed harry with a look of surprise you dont mean the blackguard mentioned by redfeather long ago when he told us his story on the shores of lake winnipegthe man who killed poor jacquess young wife  the same replied charley  and does jacques know he is here  he does but jacques is a strange unaccountable mortal  you remember that in the struggle described by redfeather the trapper and misconna had neither of them seen each other redfeather having felled the latter before the former reached the scene of actiona scene which he has since told me he witnessed at a distance while rushing to the rescue of his wifeso that misconna is utterly ignorant of the fact that the husband of his victim is now so near him indeed he does not know that she had a husband at all  on the other hand although jacques is aware that his bitterest enemy is within riflerange of him at this moment he does not know him by sight and this morning he came to me begging that i would send misconna on some expedition or other just to keep him out of his way  and do you intend to do so  i shall do my best replied charley but i cannot get him out of the way till tomorrow as there is to be a gathering of indians in the hall this very day to have a palaver with mr whyte about their grievances and misconna wouldnt miss that for a trifle  but jacques wont be likely to recognise him among so many and if he does i rely with confidence on his powers of restraint and forbearanceby the way he continued glancing upwards it is past noon and the indians will have begun to assemble so we had better hasten back as we shall be expected to help in keeping order  so saying he rose and the young men returned to the fort  on reaching it they found the hall crowded with natives who sat crosslegged around the walls or stood in groups conversing in low tones and to judge from the expression of their dark eyes and lowering brows they were in extremely bad humour  they became silent and more respectful however in their demeanour when the young men entered the apartment and walked up to the fireplace in which a small fire of wood burned on the hearth more as a convenient means of rekindling the pipes of the indians when they went out than as a means of heating the place  jacques and redfeather stood leaning against the wall near to it engaged in a whispered conversation  glancing round as he entered charley observed misconna sitting a little apart by himself and apparently buried in deep thought  he had scarcely perceived him and nodded to several of his particular friends among the crowd when a sidedoor opened and mr whyte with an angry expression on his countenance strode up to the fireplace planted himself before it with his legs apart and his hands behind him while he silently surveyed the group  so he began you have asked to speak with me well here i am  what have you to say  mr whyte addressed the indians in their native tongue having during a long residence in the country learned to speak it as fluently as english  for some moments there was silence  then an old chiefthe same who had officiated at the feast described in a former chapterrose and standing forth into the middle of the room made a long and grave oration in which besides a great deal that was bombastic much that was irrelevant and more that was utterly fabulous and nonsensical he recounted the sorrows of himself and his tribe concluding with a request that the great chief would take these things into considerationthe principal things being that they did not get anything in the shape of gratuities while it was notorious that the indians in other districts did and that they did not get enough of goods in advance on credit of their future hunts  mr whyte heard the old man to the end in silence then without altering his position he looked round on the assembly with a frown and said now listen to me i am a man of few words  i have told you over and over again and now repeat it that you shall get no gratuities until you prove yourselves worthy of them  i shall not increase your advances by so much as half an inch of tobacco till your last years debts are scored off and you begin to show more activity in hunting and less disposition to grumble  hitherto you have not brought in anything like the quantity of furs that the capabilities of the country led me to expect  you are lazy  until you become better hunters you shall have no redress from me  as he finished mr whyte made a step towards the door by which he had entered but was arrested by another chief who requested to be heard resuming his place and attitude mr whyte listened with an expression of dogged determination while guttural grunts of unequivocal dissatisfaction issued from the throats of several of the malcontents the indian proceeded to repeat a few of the remarks made by his predecessor but more concisely and wound up by explaining that the failure in the hunts of the previous year was owing to the will of the great manito and not by any means on account of the supposed laziness of himself or his tribe  that is false said mr whyte you know it is not true  as this was said a murmur of anger ran round the apartment which was interrupted by misconna who apparently unable to restrain his passion sprang into the middle of the room and confronting mr whyte made a short and pithy speech accompanied by violent gesticulation in which he insinuated that if redress was not granted the white men would bitterly repent it  during his speech the indians had risen to their feet and drawn closer together while jacques and the three young men drew near their superior  redfeather remained apart motionless and with his eyes fixed on the ground  and pray what dogwhat miserable thieving curare you who dare to address me thus cried mr whyte as he strode with flashing eyes up to the enraged indian  misconna clinched his teeth and his fingers worked convulsively about the handle of his knife as he exclaimed i am no dog  the palefaces are dogs  i am a great chief  my name is known among the braves of my tribe  it is misconna  as the name fell from his lips mr whyte and charley were suddenly dashed aside and jacques sprang towards the indian his face livid his eyeballs almost bursting from their sockets and his muscles rigid with passion  for an instant he regarded the savage intently as he shrank appalled before him then his colossal fist fell like lightning with the weight of a sledgehammer on misconnas forehead and drove him against the outer door which giving way before the violent shock burst from its fastenings and hinges and fell along with the savage with a loud crash to the ground  for an instant every one stood aghast at this precipitate termination to the discussion and then springing forward in a body with drawn knives the indians rushed upon the white men who in a close phalanx with such weapons as came first to hand stood to receive them  at this moment redfeather stepped forward unarmed between the belligerents and turning to the indians said  listen redfeather does not take the part of his white friends against his comrades  you know that he never failed you in the warpath and he would not fail you now if your cause were just  but the eyes of his comrades are shut  redfeather knows what they do not know  the white hunter pointing to jacques is a friend of redfeather  he is a friend of the knisteneux  he did not strike because you disputed with his bourgeois he struck because misconna is his mortal foe  but the story is long  redfeather will tell it at the council fire  he is right exclaimed jacques who had recovered his usual grave expression of countenance redfeather is right  i bear you no illwill injins and i shall explain the thing myself at your council fire  as jacques spoke the indians sheathed their knives and stood with frowning brows as if uncertain what to do  the unexpected interference of their comradeinarms coupled with his address and that of jacques had excited their curiosity  perhaps the undaunted deportment of their opponents who stood ready for the encounter with a look of stern determination contributed a little to allay their resentment  while the two parties stood thus confronting each other as if uncertain how to act a loud report was heard just outside the doorway  in another moment mr whyte fell heavily to the ground shot through the heart    chapter twenty seven  the chasethe fightretributionlow spirits and good news  the tragical end of the consultation related in the last chapter had the effect of immediately reconciling the disputants  with the exception of four or five of the most depraved and discontented among them the indians bore no particular illwill to the unfortunate principal of stoney creek and although a good deal disappointed to find that he was a stern unyielding trader they had in reality no intention of coming to a serious rupture with him much less of laying violent hands either upon master or men of the establishment  when therefore they beheld mr whyte weltering in his blood at their feet a sacrifice to the ungovernable passion of misconna who was by no means a favourite among his brethren their temporary anger was instantly dissipated and a feeling of deepest indignation roused in their bosoms against the miserable assassin who had perpetrated the base and cowardly murder  it was therefore with a yell of rage that several of the band immediately after the victim fell sprang into the woods in hot pursuit of him whom they now counted their enemy  they were joined by several men belonging to the fort who had hastened to the scene of action on hearing that the people in the hall were likely to come to blows  redfeather was the first who had bounded like a deer into the woods in pursuit of the fugitive  those who remained assisted charley and his friends to convey the body of mr whyte into an adjoining room where they placed him on a bed  he was quite dead the murderers aim having been terribly true  finding that he was past all human aid the young men returned to the hall which they entered just as redfeather glided quickly through the open doorway and approaching the group stood in silence beside them with his arms folded on his breast  you have something to tell redfeather said jacques in a subdued tone after regarding him a few seconds is the scoundrel caught  misconnas foot is swift replied the indian and the wood is thick it is wasting time to follow him through the bushes  what would you advise then exclaimed charley in a hurried voice i see that you have some plan to propose  the wood is thick answered redfeather but the lake and the river are open  let one party go by the lake and one party by the river  thats it thats it injin interrupted jacques energetically yer wits are always jumpin  by crossin over to duck river we can start at a point five or six miles above the lower fall an as its thereabouts he must cross well be time enough to catch him  if he tries the lake the other partyll fix him there an hell be soon poked up if he tries to hide in the bush  come then well all give chase at once cried charley feeling a temporary relief in the prospect of energetic action from the depressing effects of the calamity that had so suddenly befallen him in the loss of his chief and friend  little time was needed for preparation  jacques charley and harry proceeded by the river while redfeather and hamilton with a couple of men launched their canoe on the lake and set off in pursuit  crossing the country for about a mile jacques led his party to the point on the duck river to which he had previously referred  here they found two canoes into one of which the guide stepped with one of the men a canadian who had accompanied them while harry and charley embarked in the other  in a few minutes they were rapidly descending the stream  how do you mean to act jacques inquired charley as he paddled alongside of the guides canoe  is it not likely that misconna may have crossed the river already in which case we shall have no chance of catching him  niver fear returned jacques  he must have longer legs than most men if he gets to the flatrock fall before us an as thats the spot where hell natrally cross the river being the only straight line for the hills that escapes the bend o the bay to the south o stoney creek were pretty sartin to stop him there  true but that being as you you say the natural route dont you think it likely hell expect that it will be guarded and avoid it accordingly  he would do so mister charles if he thought we were here but there are two reasons agin this  he thinks that hes got the start o us an wont need to double by way o deceivin us and then he knows that the whole tribe is after him and consekintly wont take a long road when theres a short one if he can help it  but heres the rock look out mister charles  well have to run the fall which isnt very big just now and then hide in the bushes at the foot of it till the blackguard shows himself  keep well to the right an dont mind the big rock the rush o water takes you clear o that without trouble  with this concluding piece of advice he pointed to the fall which plunged over a ledge of rock about half a mile ahead of them and which was distinguishable by a small column of white spray that rose out of it  as charley beheld it his spirits rose and forgetting for a moment the circumstances that called him there he cried out  ill run it before you jacques  hurrah  give way harry and in spite of a remonstrance from the guide he shot the canoe ahead gave vent to another reckless shout and flew rather than glided down the stream  on seeing this the guide held back so as to give him sufficient time to take the plunge ere he followed  a few strokes brought charleys canoe to the brink of the fall and harry was just in the act of raising himself in the bow to observe the position of the rocks when a shout was heard on the bank close beside them  looking up they beheld an indian emerge from the forest fit an arrow to his bow and discharge it at them  the winged messenger was truly aimed it whizzed through the air and transfixed harry somervilles left shoulder just at the moment they swept over the fall  the arrow completely incapacitated harry from using his arm so that the canoe instead of being directed into the broad current took a sudden turn dashed in among a mass of broken rocks between which the water foamed with violence and upset  here the canoe stuck fast while its owners stood up to their waists in the water struggling to set it freean object which they were the more anxious to accomplish that its stern lay directly in the spot where jacques would infallibly descend  the next instant their fears were realised  the second canoe glided over the cataract dashed violently against the first and upset leaving jacques and his man in a similar predicament  by their aid however the canoes were more easily righted and embarking quickly they shot forth again just as the indian who had been obliged to make a detour in order to get within range of their position reappeared on the banks above and sent another shaft after themfortunately however without effect  this is unfortunate muttered jacques as the party landed and endeavoured to wring some of the water from their dripping clothes an the worst of it is that our guns are useless after sich a duckin an the varmint knows that an will be down on us in a twinklin  but we are four to one exclaimed harry  surely we dont need to fear much from a single enemy  humph ejaculated the guide as he examined the lock of his gun youve had little to do with injins thats plain  you may be sure hes not alone an the reptile has a bow with arrows enough to send us all on a pretty long journey  but weve the trees to dodge behind  if i only had one dry charge and the disconcerted guide gave a look half of perplexity half of contempt at the dripping gun  never mind cried charley we have our paddlesbut i forgot harry in all this confusion that you are wounded my poor fellow  we must have it examined before doing anything further  oh its nothing at alla mere scratch i think at least i feel very little pain  as he spoke the twang of a bow was heard and an arrow flew past jacquess ear  ah so soon exclaimed that worthy with a look of surprise as if he had unexpectedly met with an old friend  stepping behind a tree he motioned to his friends to do likewise an example which they followed somewhat hastily on beholding the indian who had wounded harry step from the cover of the underwood and deliberately let fly another arrow which passed through the hair of the canadian they had brought with them  from the several trees behind which they had leaped for shelter they now perceived that the indian with the bow was misconna and that he was accompanied by eight others who appeared however to be totally unarmedhaving probably been obliged to leave their weapons behind them owing to the abruptness of their flight  seeing that the white men were unable to use their guns the indians assembled in a group and from the hasty and violent gesticulations of some of the party especially of misconna it was evident that a speedy attack was intended  observing this jacques coolly left the shelter of his tree and going up to charley exclaimed now mister charles im goin to run away so youd better come along with me  that i certainly will not  why what do you mean inquired the other in astonishment  i mean that these stupid redskins cant make up their minds what to do an as ive no notion o stoppin here all day i want to make them do what will suit us best  you see if they scatter through the wood and attack us on all sides they may give us a deal o trouble and git away after all whereas if we run away theyll bolt after us in a body and then we can take them in hand all at once whichll be more comfortablelike an easier to manage  as jacques spoke they were joined by harry and the canadian and being observed by the indians thus grouped together another arrow was sent among them  now follow me said jacques turning round with a loud howl and running away  he was closely followed by the others  as the guide had predicted the indians no sooner observed this than they rushed after them in a body uttering horrible yells  now then stop here down with you  jacques instantly crouched behind a bush while each of the party did the same  in a moment the savages came shouting up supposing that the white men were still running on in advance  as the foremost a tall muscular fellow with the agility of a panther bounded over the bush behind which jacques was concealed he was met with a blow from the guides fist so powerfully delivered into the pit of his stomach that it sent him violently back into the bush where he lay insensible  this event of course put a check upon the headlong pursuit of the others who suddenly paused like a group of infuriated tigers unexpectedly balked of their prey  the hesitation however was but for a moment misconna who was in advance suddenly drew his bow again and let fly an arrow at jacques which the latter dexterously avoided and while his antagonist lowered his eyes for an instant to fit another arrow to the string the guide making use of his paddle as a sort of javelin threw it with such force and precision that it struck misconna directly between the eyes and felled him to the earth  in another instant the two parties rushed upon each other and a general melee ensued in which the white men being greatly superior to their adversaries in the use of their fists soon proved themselves more than a match for them all although inferior in numbers  charleys first antagonist making an abortive attempt to grapple with him received two rapid blows one on the chest and the other on the nose which knocked him over the bank into the river while his conqueror sprang upon another indian  harry having unfortunately selected the biggest savage of the band as his special property rushed upon him and dealt him a vigorous blow on the head with his paddle  the weapon however was made of light wood and instead of felling him to the ground broke into shivers  springing upon each other they immediately engaged in a fierce struggle in which poor harry learned when too late that his wounded shoulder was almost powerless  meanwhile the canadian having been assaulted by three indians at once floored one at the onset and immediately began an impromptu wardance round the other two dealing them occasionally a kick or a blow which would speedily have rendered them hors de combat had they not succeeded in closing upon him when all three fell heavily to the ground  jacques and charley having succeeded in overcoming their respective opponents immediately hastened to his rescue  in the meantime harry and his foe had struggled to a considerable distance from the others gradually edging towards the rivers bank  feeling faint from his wound the former at length sank under the weight of his powerful antagonist who endeavoured to thrust him over a kind of cliff which they had approached  he was on the point of accomplishing his purpose when charley and his friends perceived harrys imminent danger and rushed to the rescue  quickly though they ran however it seemed likely that they would be too late  harrys head already overhung the bank and the indian was endeavouring to loosen the gripe of the young mans hand from his throat preparatory to tossing him over when a wild cry rang through the forest followed by the reports of a doublebarrelled gun fired in quick succession immediately after young hamilton bounded like a deer down the slope seized the indian by the legs and tossed him over the cliff where he turned a complete somersault in his descent and fell with a sounding splash into the water  well done cleverly done lad cried jacques as he and the rest of the party came up and crowded round harry who lay in a state of partial stupor on the bank  at this moment redfeather hastily but silently approached his broad chest was heaving heavily and his expanded nostrils quivering with the exertions he had made to reach the scene of action in time to succour his friends  thank god said hamilton softly as he kneeled beside harry and supported his head while charley bathed his templesthank god that i have been in time  fortunately i was walking by the river considerably in advance of redfeather who was bringing up the canoe when i heard the sounds of the fray and hastened to your aid  at this moment harry opened his eyes and saying faintly that he felt better allowed himself to be raised to a sitting posture while his coat was removed and his wound examined  it was found to be a deep fleshwound in the shoulder from which a fragment of the broken arrow still protruded  its a wonder to me mister harry how ye held on to that big thief so long muttered jacques as he drew out the splinter and bandaged up the shoulder  having completed the surgical operation after a rough fashion they collected the defeated indians  those of them that were able to walk were bound together by the wrists and marched off to the fort under a guard which was strengthened by the arrival of several of the furtraders who had been in pursuit of the fugitives and were attracted to the spot by the shouts of the combatants  harry and such of the party as were more or less severely injured were placed in canoes and conveyed to stoney creek by the lake into which duck river runs at the distance of about half a mile from the spot on which the skirmish had taken place  misconna was among the latter  on arriving at stoney creek the canoe party found a large assemblage of the natives awaiting them on the wharf and no sooner did misconna land than they advanced to seize him  keep back friends cried jacques who perceived their intentions and stepped hastily between themcome here lads he continued turning to his companions surround misconna  he is our prisoner and must ha fair justice done him accordin to white law  they fell back in silence on observing the guides determined manner but as they hurried the wretched culprit towards the house one of the indians pressed close upon their rear and before any one could prevent him dashed his tomahawk into misconnas brain  seeing that the blow was mortal the traders ceased to offer any further opposition and the indians rushing upon his body bore it away amid shouts and yells of execration to their canoes to one of which the body was fastened by a rope and dragged through the water to a point of land that jutted out into the lake near at hand  here they lighted a fire and burned it to ashes    there seems to be a period in the history of every one when the fair aspect of this world is darkenedwhen everything whether past present or future assumes a hue of the deepest gloom a period when for the first time the sun which has shone in the mental firmament with more or less brilliancy from childhood upwards entirely disappears behind a cloud of thick darkness and leaves the soul in a state of deep melancholy a time when feelings somewhat akin to despair pervade us as we begin gradually to look upon the past as a bright happy vision out of which we have at last awakened to view the sad realities of the present and look forward with sinking hope to the future  various are the causes which produce this and diverse the effects of it on differently constituted minds but there are few we apprehend who have not passed through the cloud in one or other of its phases and who do not feel that this first period of prolonged sorrow is darker and heavier and worse to bear than many of the more truly grievous afflictions that sooner or later fall to the lot of most men  into a state of mind somewhat similar to that which we have endeavoured to describe our friend charley kennedy fell immediately after the events just narrated  the sudden and awful death of his friend mr whyte fell upon his young spirit unaccustomed as he was to scenes of bloodshed and violence with overwhelming power  from the depression however which naturally followed he would probably soon have rallied had not harry somervilles wound in the shoulder taken an unfavourable turn and obliged him to remain for many weeks in bed under the influence of a slow fever so that charley felt a desolation creeping over his soul that no effort he was capable of making could shake off  it is true he found both occupation and pleasure in attending upon his sick friend but as harrys illness rendered great quiet necessary and as hamilton had been sent to take charge of the fishingstation mentioned in a former chapter charley was obliged to indulge his gloomy reveries in silence  to add to his wretchedness he received a letter from kate about a week after mr whytes burial telling him of the death of his mother  meanwhile redfeather and jacquesboth of whom at their young masters earnest solicitation agreed to winter at stoney creekcultivated each others acquaintance sedulously  there were no books of any kind at the outpost excepting three biblesone belonging to charley and one to harry the third being that which had been presented to jacques by mr conway the missionary  this single volume however proved to be an ample library to jacques and his indian friend  neither of these sons of the forest was much accustomed to reading and neither of them would have for a moment entertained the idea of taking to literature as a pastime but redfeather loved the bible for the sake of the great truths which he discovered in its inspired pages though much of what he read was to him mysterious and utterly incomprehensible  jacques on the other hand read it or listened to his friend with that philosophic gravity of countenance and earnestness of purpose which he displayed in regard to everything and deep serious and protracted were the discussions they plunged into as night after night they sat on a log with the bible spread out before them and read by the light of the blazing fire in the mens house at stoney creek  their intercourse however was brought to an abrupt conclusion by the unexpected arrival one day of mr conway the missionary in his tin canoe  this gentlemans appearance was most welcome to all parties  it was like a bright ray of sunshine to charley to meet with one who could fully sympathise with him in his present sorrowful frame of mind  it was an event of some consequence to harry somerville inasmuch as it provided him with an amateur doctor who really understood somewhat of his physical complaint and was able to pour balm at once literally and spiritually into his wounds  it was an event productive of the liveliest satisfaction to redfeather who now felt assured that his tribe would have those mysteries explained which he only imperfectly understood himself and it was an event of much rejoicing to the indians themselves because their curiosity had been not a little roused by what they heard of the doings and sayings of the white missionary who lived on the borders of the great lake  the only person perhaps on whom mr conways arrival acted with other than a pleasing influence was jacques caradoc  this worthy although glad to meet with a man whom he felt inclined both to love and respect was by no means gratified to find that his friend redfeather had agreed to go with the missionary on his visit to the indian tribe and thereafter to accompany him to the settlement on playgreen lake  but with the stoicism that was natural to him jacques submitted to circumstances which he could not alter and contented himself with assuring redfeather that if he lived till next spring he would most certainly make tracks for the great lake and settle down at the missionarys station along with him  this promise was made at the end of the wharf of stoney creek the morning on which mr conway and his party embarked in their tin canoethe same tin canoe at which jacques had curled his nose contemptuously when he saw it in process of being constructed and at which he did not by any means curl it the less contemptuously now that he saw it finished  the little craft answered its purpose marvellously well however and bounded lightly away under the vigorous strokes of its crew leaving charley and jacques on the pier gazing wistfully after their friends and listening sadly to the echoes of their parting song as it floated more and more faintly over the lake  winter came but no ray of sunshine broke through the dark cloud that hung over stoney creek  harry somerville instead of becoming better grew worse and worse every day so that when charley dispatched the winter packet he represented the illness of his friend to the powers at headquarters as being of a nature that required serious and immediate attention and change of scene  but the word immediate bears a slightly different signification in the backwoods to what it does in the lands of railroads and steamboats  the letter containing this hint took many weeks to traverse the waste wilderness to its destination months passed before the reply was written and many weeks more elapsed ere its contents were perused by charley and his friend  when they did read it however the dark cloud that had hung over them so long burst at last a ray of sunshine streamed down brightly upon their hearts and never forsook them again although it did lose a little of its brilliancy after the first flash  it was on a rich dewy cheerful morning in early spring that the packet arrived and charley led harry who was slowly recovering his wonted health and spirits to their favourite rocky restingplace on the margin of the lake  here he placed the letter in his friends hand with a smile of genuine delight  it ran as follows    my dear siryour letter containing the account of mr somervilles   illness has been forwarded to me and i am instructed to inform you   that leave of absence for a short time has been granted to him  i   have had a conversation with the doctor here who advises me to   recommend that if your friend has no other summer residence in view   he should spend part of his time in red river settlement  in the   event of his agreeing to this i would suggest that he should leave   stoney creek with the first brigade in spring or by express canoe if   you think it advisable  i am etcetera  short but sweetuncommonly sweet said harry as a deep flush of joy crimsoned his pale cheeks while his own merry smile that had been absent for many a weary day returned once more to its old haunt and danced round its accustomed dimples like a repentant wanderer who has been long absent from and has at last returned to his native home  sweet indeed echoed charley  but thats not all heres another lump of sugar for you  so saying he pulled a letter from his pocket unfolded it slowly spread it out on his knee and looking up at his expectant friend winked  go on charley pray dont tantalise me  tantalise you  my dear fellow nothing is farther from my thoughts listen to this paragraph in my dear old fathers letter    so you see my dear charley that we have managed to get you   appointed to the charge of lower fort garry and as i hear that poor   harry somerville is to get leave of absence you had better bring him   along with you  i need not add that my house is at his service as   long as he may wish to remain in it  there what think ye of that my boy said charley as he folded the letter and returned it to his pocket  i think replied harry that your father is a dear old gentleman and i hope that youll only be half as good when you come to his time of life and i think im so happy today that ill be able to walk without the assistance of your arm tomorrow and i think we had better go beck to the house now for i feel oddly enough as tired as if i had had a long walk  ah charley my dear fellow that letter will prove to be the best doctor i have had yet  but now tell me what you intend to do  charley assisted his friend to rise and led him slowly back to the house as he replied  do my boy  thats soon said  ill make things square and straight at stoney creek  ill send for hamilton and make him interim commanderinchief  ill write two lettersone to the gentleman in charge of the district telling him of my movements the other containing a screed of formal instructions to the miserable mortal who shall succeed me here  ill take the best canoe in our store load it with provisions put you carefully in the middle of it stick jacques in the bow and myself in the stern and start two weeks hence neck and crop head over heels through thick and thin wet and dry over portage river fall and lake for red river settlement    chapter twenty eight  old friends and scenescoming events cast their shadows before  mr kennedy senior was seated in his own comfortable armchair before the fire in his own cheerful little parlour in his own snug house at red river with his own highly characteristic breakfast of buffalo steaks tea and pemmican before him and his own beautiful affectionate daughter kate presiding over the teapot and exercising unwarrantably despotic sway over a large grey cat whose sole happiness seemed to consist in subjecting mr kennedy to perpetual annoyance and whose main object in life was to catch its master and mistress off their guard that it might go quietly to the table the meatsafe or the pantry and theredeliberatelysteal  kate had grown very much since we saw her last  she was quite a woman now and well worthy of a minute description here but we never could describe a woman to our own satisfaction  we have frequently tried and failed so we substitute in place the remarks of kates friends and acquaintances about hera criterion on which to form a judgment that is a pretty correct one especially when the opinion pronounced happens to be favourable  her father said she was an angel and the only joy of his life  this latter expression we may remark was false for mr kennedy frequently said to kate confidentially that charley was a great happiness to him and we are quite sure that the pipe had something to do with the felicity of his existence  but the old gentleman said that kate was the only joy of his life and that is all we have to do with at present  several illtempered old ladies in the settlement said that miss kennedy was really a quiet modest girl testimony this considering the source whence it came that was quite conclusive  then old mr grant remarked to old mr kennedy over a confidential pipe that kate was certainly in his opinion the most modest and the prettiest girl in red river  her old school companions called her a darling  tom whyte said he never seed nothink like her nowhere  the clerks spoke of her in terms too glowing to remember and the last arrival among them the youngest with the slang of the old country fresh on his lips called her a stunner  even mrs grant got up one of her halfexpressed remarks about her which everybody would have supposed to be quizzical in its nature were it not for the frequent occurrence of the terms good girl innocent creature which seemed to contradict that idea  there were also one or two hapless swains who said nothing but what they did and looked was in itself unequivocal  they went quietly into a state of slow drivelling imbecility whenever they happened to meet with kate looked as if they had become shockingly unwell and were rather pleased than otherwise that their friends should think so too and upon all and every occasion in which kate was concerned conducted themselves with an amount of insane stupidity although sane enough at other times that nothing could account for save the idea that their admiration of her was inexpressible and that that was the most effective way in which they could express it  kate my darling said mr kennedy as he finished the last mouthful of tea wouldnt it be capital to get another letter from charley  yes dear papa it would indeed  but i am quite sure that the next time we shall hear from him will be when he arrives here and makes the house ring with his own dear voice  how so girl said the old trader with a smile  it may as well be remarked here that the above opening of conversation was by no means new it was stereotyped now  ever since charley had been appointed to the management of lower fort garry his father had been so engrossed by the idea and spoke of it to kate so frequently that he had got into a way of feeling as if the event so much desired would happen in a few days although he knew quite well that it could not in the course of ordinary or extraordinary circumstances occur in less than several months  however as time rolled on he began regularly every day or two to ask kate questions about charley that she could not by any possibility answer but which he knew from experience would lead her into a confabulation about his son which helped a little to allay his impatience  why you see father she replied it is three months since we got his last and you know there has been no opportunity of forwarding letters from stoney creek since it was dispatched  now the next opportunity that occurs  meeaow interrupted the cat which had just finished two pats of fresh butter without being detected and began rather recklessly to exult  hang that cat cried the old gentleman angrily itll be the death o me yet and seizing the first thing that came to hand which happened to be the loaf of bread discharged it with such violence and with so correct an aim that it knocked not only the cat but the teapot and sugarbowl also off the table  o dear papa exclaimed kate  really my dear cried mr kennedy half angry and half ashamed we must get rid of that brute immediately  it has scarcely been a week here and it has done more mischief already than a score of ordinary cats would have done in a twelvemonth  but then the mice papa  well butbutoh hang the mice  yes but how are we to catch them said kate  at this moment the cook who had heard the sound of breaking crockery and judged it expedient that he should be present opened the door  how now rascal exclaimed his master striding up to him  did i ring for you eh  no sir but  but eh but no more buts you scoundrel else ill  the motion of mr kennedys fist warned the cook to make a precipitate retreat which he did at the same moment that the cat resolved to run for its life  this caused them to meet in the doorway and making a compound entanglement with the mat they both fell into the passage with a loud crash  mr kennedy shut the door gently and returned to his chair patting kate on the head as he passed  now darling go on with what you were saying and dont mind the teapotlet it lie  well resumed kate with a smile i was saying that the next opportunity charley can have will be by the brigade in spring which we expect to arrive here you know a month hence but we wont get a letter by that as i feel convinced that he and harry will come by it themselves  and the express canoe katethe express canoe said mr kennedy with a contortion of the left side of his head that was intended for a wink you know they got leave to come by express kate  oh as to the express father i dont expect them to come by that as poor harry somerville has been so ill that they would never think of venturing to subject him to all the discomforts not to mention the dangers of a canoe voyage  i dont know that lassi dont know that said mr kennedy giving another contortion with his left cheek  in fact i shouldnt wonder if they arrived this very day and its well to be on the lookout so im off to the banks of the river kate  saying this the old gentleman threw on an old fur cap with the peak all awry thrust his left hand into his right glove put on the other with the back to the front and the thumb in the middle finger and bustled out of the house muttering as he went yes its well to be on the lookout for him  mr kennedy however was disappointed charley did not arrive that day nor the next nor the day after that  nevertheless the old gentlemans faith each day remained as firm as on the day previous that charley would arrive on that day for certain  about a week after this mr kennedy put on his hat and gloves as usual and sauntered down to the banks of the river where his perseverance was rewarded by the sight of a small canoe rapidly approaching the landingplace  from the costume of the three men who propelled it the cut of the canoe itself the precision and energy of its movements and several other minute points about it only apparent to the accustomed eye of a norwester he judged at once that this was a new arrival and not merely one of the canoes belonging to the settlers many of which might be seen passing up and down the river  as they drew near he fixed his eyes eagerly upon them  very odd he exclaimed while a shade of disappointment passed over his brow it ought to be him but its not like him too bigdifferent nose altogether  dont know any of the three  humphwell hes sure to come tomorrow at all events  having come to the conclusion that it was not charleys canoe he wheeled sulkily round and sauntered back towards his house intending to solace himself with a pipe  at that moment he heard a shout behind him and ere he could well turn round to see whence it came a young man bounded up the bank and seized him in his arms with a hug that threatened to dislocate his ribs  the old gentlemans first impulse was to bestow on his antagonist for he verily believed him to be such one of those vigorous touches with his clinched fist which in days of yore used to bring some of his disputes to a summary and effectual close but his intention changed when the youth spoke  father dear dear father said charley as he loosened his grasp and still holding him by both hands looked earnestly into his face with swimming eyes  old mr kennedy seemed to have lost his powers of speech  he gazed at his son for a few seconds in silence then suddenly threw his arms around him and engaged in a species of wrestle which he intended for an embrace  o charley my boy he exclaimed youve come at lastgod bless you lets look at you  quite changed six feet no not quite changedthe old nose black as an indian  o charley my dear boy  ive been waiting for you for months why did you keep me so long eh  hang it wheres my handkerchief  at this last exclamation mr kennedys feelings quite overcame him his full heart overflowed at his eyes so that when he tried to look at his son charley appeared partly magnified and partly broken up into fragments  fumbling in his pocket for the missing handkerchief which he did not find he suddenly seized his fur cap in a burst of exasperation and wiped his eyes with that immediately after forgetting that it was a cap he thrust it into his pocket  come dear father cried charley drawing the old mans arm through his let us go home  is kate there  ay ay cried mr kennedy waving his hand as he was dragged away and bestowing quite unwittingly a backhanded slap on the cheek to harry somerville which nearly felled that youth to the ground  ay ay kate to be sure darling  yes quite right charley a pipethats it my boy lets have a pipe  and thus uttering incoherent and broken sentences he disappeared through the doorway with his longlost and now recovered son  meanwhile harry and jacques continued to pace quietly before the house waiting patiently until the first ebullition of feeling at the meeting of charley with his father and sister should be over  in a few minutes charley ran out  hollo harry come in my boy forgive my forgetfulness but  my dear fellow interrupted harry what nonsense you are talking  of course you forgot me and everybody and everything on earth just now but have you seen kate  is  yes yes cried charley as he pushed his friend before him and dragged jacques after him into the parlourheres harry father jacquesyouve heard of jacques kate  harry my dear boy cried mr kennedy seizing his young friend by the hand how are you lad  better i hope  at that moment mr kennedys eye fell on jacques who stood in the doorway cap in hand with the usual quiet smile lighting up his countenance  what  jacquesjacques caradoc he cried in astonishment  the same sir you an i have knowd each other afore now in the way o trade answered the hunter as he grasped his old bourgeois by the hand and wrung it warmly  mr kennedy senior was so overwhelmed by the combination of exciting influences to which he was now subjected that he plunged his hand into his pocket for the handkerchief again and pulled out the fur hat instead which he flung angrily at the cat then using the sleeve of his coat as a substitute he proceeded to put a series of abrupt questions to jacques and charley simultaneously  in the meantime harry went up to kate and stared at her  we do not mean to say that he was intentionally rude to her  no  he went towards her intending to shake hands and renew acquaintance with his old companion but the moment he caught sight of her he was struck not only dumb but motionless  the odd part of it was that kate too was affected in precisely the same way and both of them exclaimed mentally can it be possible  their lips however gave no utterance to the question  at length kate recollected herself and blushing deeply held out her hand as she said  forgive me harmr somerville i was so surprised at your altered appearance i could scarcely believe that my old friend stood before me  harrys cheeks crimsoned as he seized her hand and said indeed ka amissthat is in fact ive been very ill and doubtless have changed somewhat but the very same thought struck me in regard to yourself you are soso  fortunately for harry who was gradually becoming more and more confused to the amusement of charley who had closely observed the meeting of his friend and sister mr kennedy came up  eh whats that  what did you say struck you harry my lad  you did father on his arrival replied charley with a broad grin and a very neat backhander it was  nonsense charley interrupted harry with a laughi was just saying sir that miss kennedy is so changed that i could hardly believe it to be herself  and i had just paid mr somerville the same compliment papa cried kate laughing and blushing simultaneously  mr kennedy thrust his hands into his pockets frowned portentously as he looked from the one to the other and said slowly miss kennedy mr somerville then turning to his son remarked thats something new charley lad that girl is miss kennedy and that youth there is mr somerville  charley laughed loudly at this sally especially when the old gentleman followed it up with a series of contortions of the left cheek meant for violent winking  right father right it wont do here  we dont know anybody but kate and harry in this house  harry laughed in his own genuine style at this  well kate be it with all my heart said he but really at first she seemed so unlike the kate of former days that i could not bring myself to call her so  humph said mr kennedy  but come boys with me to my smokingroom and lets have a talk over a pipe while kate looks after dinner giving charley another squeeze of the hand and harry a pat on the shoulder the old gentleman put on his cap with the peak behind and led the way to his glass divan in the garden  it is perhaps unnecessary for us to say that kate kennedy and harry somerville had within the last hour fallen deeply hopelessly utterly irrevocably and totally in love with each other  they did not merely fall up to the ears in love  to say that they fell over head and ears in it would be comparatively speaking to say nothing  in fact they did not fall into it at all  they went deliberately backwards took a long race sprang high into the air turned completely round and went down head first into the flood descending to a depth utterly beyond the power of any deepsea lead to fathom or of any human mind adequately to appreciate  up to that day kate had thought of harry as the hilarious youth who used to take every opportunity he could of escaping from the countingroom and hastening to spend the afternoon in rambling through the woods with her and charley  but the instant she saw him a man with a bright cheerful countenance on which rough living and exposure to frequent peril had stamped unmistakable lines of energy and decision and to which recent illness had imparted a captivating touch of sadnessthe moment she beheld this and the undeniable scrap of whisker that graced his cheeks and the slight shade that rested on his upper lip her heart leaped violently into her throat where it stuck hard and fast like a stranded ship on a leeshore  in like manner when harry beheld his former friend a woman with beaming eyes and clustering ringlets andthere we wont attempt itin fact surrounded by every nameless and nameable grace that makes woman exasperatingly delightful his heart performed the same eccentric movement and he felt that his fate was sealed that he had been sucked into a rapid which was too strong even for his expert and powerful arm to contend against and that he must drift with the current now nolens volens and run it as he best could  when kate retired to her sleepingapartment that night she endeavoured to comport herself in her usual manner but all her efforts failed  she sat down on her bed and remained motionless for half an hour then she started and sighed deeply then she smiled and opened her bible but forgot to read it then she rose hastily sighed again took off her gown hang it up on a peg and returning to the dressingtable sat down on her best bonnet then she cried a little at which point the candle suddenly went out so she gave a slight scream and at last went to bed in the dark  three hours afterwards harry somerville who had been enjoying a cigar and a chat with charley and his father rose and bidding his friends goodnight retired to his chamber where he flung himself down on a chair thrust his hands into his pockets stretched out his legs gazed abstractedly before him and exclaimedo kate my exquisite girl youve floored me quite flat  as he continued to sit in silence the gaze of affection gradually and slowly changed into a look of intense astonishment as he beheld the grey cat sitting comfortably on the table and regarding him with a look of complacent interest as if it thought harrys style of addressing it was highly satisfactorythough rather unusual  brute exclaimed harry springing from his seat and darting towards it  but the cat was too well accustomed to old mr kennedys sudden onsets to be easily taken by surprise  with a bound it reached the floor and took shelter under the bed whence it was not ejected until harry having first thrown his shoes soap clothesbrush and razorstrop at it besides two or three books and several miscellaneous articles of toilet at last opened the door a thing by the way that people would do well always to remember before endeavouring to expel a cat from an impregnable position and drew the bed into the middle of the room  then but not till then it fled with its back its tail its hair its eyesin short its entire bodybristling in rampant indignation  having dislodged the enemy harry replaced the bed threw off his coat and waistcoat untied his neckcloth sat down on his chair again and fell into a reverie from which after half an hour he started clasped his hands stamped his foot glared up at the ceiling slapped his thigh and exclaimed in the voice of a hen yes ill do it or die    chapter twenty nine  the first day at homea gallop in the prairie and its consequences  next morning as the quartette were at breakfast mr kennedy senior took occasion to propound to his son the plans he had laid down for them during the next week  in the first place charley my boy said he as well as a large mouthful of buffalo steak and potato would permit you must drive up to the fort and report yourself  harry and i will go with you and after we have paid our respects to old grant another cup of tea kate my darlingyou recollect him charley dont you  yes perfectly  well then after weve been to see him well drive down the river and call on our friends at the mill  then well look in on the thomsons and give a call in passing on old neverinhes always out so hell be pleased to hear we were there and it wont detain us then  but dear fatherexcuse my interrupting youharry and i are very anxious to spend our first day at home entirely with you and kate dont you think it would be more pleasant and then tomorrow  now charley this is too bad of you said mr kennedy with a look of affected indignation no sooner have you come back than youre at your old tricks opposing and thwarting your fathers wishes  indeed i do not wish to do so father replied charley with a smile but i thought that you would like my plan better yourself and that it would afford us an opportunity of having a good long satisfactory talk about all that concerns us past present and future  what a daring mind you have charley said harry to speak of cramming a satisfactory talk of the past the present and the future all into one day  harry will take another cup of tea kate said charley with an arch smile as he went on  besides father jacques tells me that he means to go off immediately to visit a number of his old voyageur friends in the settlement and i cannot part with him till we have had one more canter together over the prairies  i want to show him to kate for hes a great original  oh that will be charming cried kate  i should like of all things to be introduced to the bold hunteranother cup of tea mr sharry i mean  harry started on being thus unexpectedly addressed  yes if you pleasethat isthank youno my cups full already kate  well well broke in mr kennedy senior i see youre all leagued against me so i give in  but i shall not accompany you on your ride as my bones are a little stiffer than they used to be the old gentleman sighed heavily and riding far knocks me up but ive got business to attend to in my glass house which will occupy me till dinnertime  if the business you speak of began charley is not incompatible with a cigar i shall be happy to  why as to that the business itself has special reference to tobacco and in fact to nothing else so come along you young dog and the old gentlemans cheek went into violent convulsions as he rose put on his cap with the peak very much over one eye and went out in company with the young men  an hour afterwards four horses stood saddled and bridled in front of the house  three belonged to mr kennedy the fourth had been borrowed from a neighbour as a mount for jacques caradoc  in a few minutes more harry lifted kate into the saddle and having arranged her dress with a deal of unnecessary care mounted his nag  at the same moment charley and jacques vaulted into their saddles and the whole cavalcade galloped down the avenue that led to the prairie followed by the admiring gaze of mr kennedy senior who stood in the doorway of his mansion his hands in his vest pockets his head uncovered and his happy visage smiling through a cloud of smoke that issued from his lips  he seemed the very personification of jovial goodhumour and what one might suppose cupid would become were he permitted to grow old dress recklessly and take to smoking  the prairies were bright that morning and surpassingly beautiful  the grass looked greener than usual the dewdrops more brilliant as they sparkled on leaf and blade and branch in the rays of an unclouded sun the turf felt springy and the horses which were firstrate animals seemed to dance over it scarce crushing the wildflowers beneath their hoofs as they galloped lightly on imbued with the same joyous feeling that filled the hearts of their riders  the plains at this place were more picturesque than in other parts their uniformity being broken up by numerous clumps of small trees and wild shrubbery intermingled with lakes and ponds of all sizes which filled the hollows for miles aroundtemporary sheets of water these formed by the melting snow that told of winter now past and gone  additional animation and life was given to the scene by flocks of waterfowl whose busy cry and cackle in the water or whirring motion in the air gave such an idea of joyousness in the brute creation as could not but strike a chord of sympathy in the heart of man and create a feeling of gratitude to the maker of man and beast  although brilliant and warm the sun at least during the first part of their ride was by no means oppressive so that the equestrians stretched out at full gallop for many miles over the prairie round the lakes and through the bushes ere their steeds showed the smallest symptoms of warmth  during the ride kate took the lead with jacques on her left and harry on her right while charley brought up the rear and conversed in a loud key with all three  at length kate began to think it was just possible the horses might be growing wearied with the slapping pace and checked her steed but this was not an easy matter as the horse seemed to hold quite a contrary opinion and showed a desire not only to continue but to increase its gallopa propensity that induced harry to lend his aid by grasping the rein and compelling the animal to walk  thats a spirited horse kate said charley as they ambled along have you had him long  no replied kate our father purchased him just a week before your arrival thinking that you would likely want a charger now and then  i have only been on him once beforewould he make a good buffalorunner jacques  yes miss he would make an uncommon good runner answered the hunter as he regarded the animal with a critical glanceat least if he dont shy at a gunshot  i never tried his nerves in that way said kate with a smile perhaps he would shy at that  he has a good deal of spiritoh i do dislike a lazy horse and i do delight in a spirited one  kate gave her horse a smart cut with the whip half involuntarily as she spoke in a moment it reared almost perpendicularly and then bounded forward not however before jacquess quick eye had observed the danger and his everready hand arrested its course  have a care miss kate he said in a warning voice while he gazed in the face of the excited girl with a look of undisguised admiration  it dont do to wallop a skittish beast like that  never fear jacques she replied bending forward to pat her chargers arching neck see he is becoming quite gentle again  if he runs away kate we wont be able to catch you again for hes the best of the four i think said harry with an uneasy glance at the animals flashing eye and expanded nostrils  ay its as well to keep the whip off him said jacques  i knowd a young chap once in st louis who lost his sweetheart by usin his whip too freely  indeed cried kate with a merry laugh as they emerged from one of the numerous thickets and rode out upon the open plain at a foot pace how was that jacques  pray tell us the story  as to that theres little story about it replied the hunter  you see tim roughead took arter his name an was always doin some mischief or other which more than once nigh cost him his life for the young trappers that frequent st louis are not fellows to stand too much jokin i can tell ye  well tim fell in love with a gal there who had jilted about a dozen lads afore an bein an oncommon handsome strappin fellow she encouraged him a good deal  but tim had a suspicion that louise was rayther sweet on a young storekeepers clerk there so bein an offhand sort o critter he went right up to the gal and says to her says he come louise its o no use humbuggin with me any longer  if you like me you like me and if you dont like me you dont  theres only two ways about it  now jist say the word at once an lets have an end ont  if you agree ill squat with you in whativer bit o the states you like to name if not ill bid you goodbye this blessed mornin an make tracks right away for the rocky mountains afore sundown  ay or no lass which ist to be  poor louise was taken all aback by this but she knew well that tim was a man who never threatened in jest an moreover she wasnt quite sure o the young clerk so she agreed an tim went off to settle with her father about the weddin  well the day came an tim with a lot o his comrades mounted their horses and rode off to the brides house which was a mile or two up the river out of the town  just as they were startin tims horse gave a plunge that wellnigh pitched him over its head an tim came down on him with a cut o his heavy whip that sounded like a pistolshot  the beast was so mad at this that it gave a kind o squeal an another plunge that burst the girth tim brought the whip down on its flank again which made it shoot forward like an arrow out of a bow leavin poor tim on the ground  so slick did it fly away that it didnt even throw him on his back but let him fall sittinwise saddle and all plump on the spot where he sprang from  tim scratched his head an grinned like a halfworried rattlesnake as his comrades almost rolled off their saddles with laughin  but it was no laughin job for poor tims leg was doubled under him an broken across at the thigh  it was long before he was able to go about again and when he did recover he found that louise and the young clerk were spliced an away to kentucky  so you see what are the probable consequences kate if you use your whip so obstreperously again cried charley pressing his horse into a canter  just at that moment a rabbit sprang from under a bush and darted away before them  in an instant harry somerville gave a wild shout and set off in pursuit  whether it was the cry or the sudden flight of harrys horse we cannot tell but the next instant kates charger performed an indescribable flourish with its hind legs laid back its ears took the bit between its teeth and ran away  jacques was on its heels instantly and a few seconds afterwards charley and harry joined in the pursuit but their utmost efforts failed to do more than enable them to keep their ground  kates horse was making for a dense thicket into which it became evident they must certainly plunge  harry and her brother trembled when they looked at it and realised her danger even jacquess face showed some symptoms of perturbation for a moment as he glanced before him in indecision  the expression vanished however in a few seconds and his cheerful selfpossessed look returned as he cried out  pull the left rein hard miss kate try to edge up the slope  kate heard the advice and exerting all her strength succeeded in turning her horse a little to the left which caused him to ascend a gentle slope at the top of which part of the thicket lay  she was closely followed by harry and her brother who urged their steeds madly forward in the hope of catching her rein while jacques diverged a little to the right  by this manoeuvre the latter hoped to gain on the runaway as the ground along which he rode was comparatively level with a short but steep ascent at the end of it while that along which kate flew like the wind was a regular ascent that would prove very trying to her horse  at the margin of the thicket grew a row of high bushes towards which they now galloped with frightful speed  as kate came up to this natural fence she observed the trapper approaching on the other side of it  springing from his jaded steed without attempting to check its pace he leaped over the underwood like a stag just as the young girl cleared the bushes at a bound  grasping the reins and checking the horse violently with one hand he extended the other to kate who leaped unhesitatingly into his arms  at the same instant charley cleared the bushes and pulled sharply up while harrys horse unable owing to its speed to take the leap came crashing through them and dashed his rider with stunning violence to the ground  fortunately no bones were broken and a draught of clear water brought by jacques from a neighbouring pond speedily restored harrys shaken faculties  now kate said charley leading forward the horse which he had ridden i have changed saddles as you see this horse will suit you better and ill take the shine out of your charger on the way home  thank you charley said kate with a smile  ive quite recovered from my frightif indeed it is worth calling by that name but i fear that harry has  oh im all right cried harry advancing as he spoke to assist kate in mounting  i am ashamed to think that my wild cry was the cause of all this  in another minute they were again in their saddles and turning their faces homeward they swept over the plain at a steady gallop fearing lest their accident should be the means of making mr kennedy wait dinner for them  on arriving they found the old gentleman engaged in an animated discussion with the cook about laying the tablecloth which duty he had imposed on himself in kates absence  ah kate my love he cried as they entered come here lass and mount guard  ive almost broke my heart in trying to convince that thickheaded goose that he cant set the table properly  take it off my hands like a good girlcharley my boy youll be pleased to hear that your old friend redfeather is here  redfeather father exclaimed charley in surprise  yes he and the parson from the other end of lake winnipeg arrived an hour ago in a tin kettle and are now on their way to the upper fort  that is indeed pleasant news but i suspect that it will give much greater pleasure to our friend jacques who i believe would be glad to lay down his life for him simply to prove his affection  well well said the old gentleman knocking the ashes out of his pipe and refilling it so as to be ready for an afterdinner smoke redfeather has come and the parsons come too and i look upon it as quite miraculous that they have come considering the thing they came in  what theyve come for is more than i can tell but i suppose its connected with church affairsnow then kate whats come o the dinner kate  stir up that grampus of a cook  i half expect that he has boiled the cat for dinner in his wrath for it has been badgering him and me the whole morninghollo harry whats wrong  the last exclamation was in consequence of an expression of pain which crossed harrys face for a moment  nothing nothing replied harry  ive had a fall from my horse and bruised my arm a little  but ill see to it after dinner  that you shall not cried mr kennedy energetically dragging his young friend into his bedroom  off with your coat lad  lets see it at once  ay ay he continued examining harrys left arm which was very much discoloured and swelled from the elbow to the shoulder thats a severe thump my boy  but its nothing to speak of only youll have to submit to a sling for a day or two  thats annoying certainly but im thankful its no worse remarked harry as mr kennedy dressed the arm after his own fashion and then returned with him to the diningroom    chapter thirty  loveold mr kennedy puts his foot in it  one morning about two weeks after charleys arrival at red river harry somerville found himself alone in mr kennedys parlour  the old gentleman himself had just galloped away in the direction of the lower fort to visit charley who was now formally installed there kate was busy in the kitchen giving directions about dinner and jacques was away with redfeather visiting his numerous friends in the settlement so that for the first time since his arrival harry found himself at the hour of ten in the morning utterly lone and with nothing very definite to do  of course the two weeks that had elapsed were not without their signs and symptoms their minor accidents and incidents in regard to the subject that filled his thoughts  harry had fifty times been tossed alternately from the height of hope to the depth of despair from the extreme of felicity to the uttermost verge of sorrow and he began seriously to reflect when he remembered his desperate resolution on the first night of his arrival that if he did not do he certainly would die  this was quite a mistake however on harrys part  nobody ever did die of unrequited love  doubtless many people have hanged drowned and shot themselves because of it but generally speaking if the patient can be kept from maltreating himself long enough time will prove to be an infallible remedy  o youthful reader lay this to heart but pshaw why do i waste ink on so hopeless a task  every one we suppose resolves once in a way to die of love sodie away my young friends only make sure that you dont kill yourselves and ive no fear of the result  but to return  kate likewise was similarly affected  she behaved like a perfect maniacmentally that isand plunged herself metaphorically into such a succession of hot and cold baths that it was quite a marvel how her spiritual constitution could stand it  but we were wrong in saying that harry was alone in the parlour  the grey cat was there  on a chair before the fire it sat looking dishevelled and somewhat blase in consequence of the illtreatment and worry to which it was continually subjected  after looking out of the window for a short time harry rose and sitting down on a chair beside the cat patted its heada mark of attention it was evidently not averse to but which it received nevertheless with marked suspicion and some indications of being in a condition of armed neutrality  just then the door opened and kate entered  excuse me harry for leaving you alone she said but i had to attend to several household matters  do you feel inclined for a walk  i do indeed replied harry it is a charming day and i am exceedingly anxious to see the bower that you have spoken to me about once or twice and which charley told me of long before i came here  oh i shall take you to it with pleasure replied kate my dear father often goes there with me to smoke  if you will wait for two minutes ill put on my bonnet and she hastened to prepare herself for the walk leaving harry to caress the cat which he did so energetically when he thought of its young mistress that it instantly declared war and sprang from the chair with a remonstrative yell  on their way down to the bower which was situated in a picturesque retired spot on the rivers bank about a mile below the house harry and kate tried to converse on ordinary topics but without success and were at last almost reduced to silence  one subject alone filled their minds all others were flat  being sunk as it were in an ocean of love they no sooner opened their lips to speak than the waters rushed in as a natural consequence and nearly choked them  had they but opened their mouths wide and boldly they would have been pleasantly drowned together but as it was they lacked the requisite courage and were fain to content themselves with an occasional frantic struggle to the surface where they gasped a few words of uninteresting air and sank again instantly  on arriving at the bower however and sitting down harry plucked up heart and heaving a deep sigh said  kate there is a subject about which i have long desired to speak to you  long as he had been desiring it however kate thought it must have been nothing compared with the time that elapsed ere he said anything else so she bent over a flower which she held in her hand and said in a low voice indeed harry what is it  harry was desperate now  his usually flexible tongue was stiff as stone and dry as a bit of leather  he could no more give utterance to an intelligible idea than he could change himself into mr kennedys grey cata change that he would not have been unwilling to make at that moment  at last he seized his companions hand and exclaimed with a burst of emotion that quite startled her  kate kate  o dearest kate i love you  i adore you  i  at this point poor harrys powers of speech again failed so being utterly unable to express another idea he suddenly threw his arms round her and pressed her fervently to his bosom  kate was taken quite aback by this summary method of coming to the point  repulsing him energetically she exclaimed while she blushed crimson o harrymr somerville and burst into tears  poor harry stood before her for a moment his head hanging down and a deep blush of shame on his face  o kate said he in a deep tremulous voice forgive me dodo forgive me  i knew not what i said  i scarce knew what i did here he seized her hand  i know but one thing kate and tell it you i will if it should cost me my life  i love you kate to distraction and i wish you to be my wife  i have been rude very rude  can you forgive me kate  now this latter part of harrys speech was particularly comical the comicality of it lying in this that while he spoke he drew kate gradually towards him and at the very time when he gave utterance to the penitential remorse for his rudeness kate was infolded in a much more vigorous embrace than at the first and what is more remarkable still she laid her little head quietly on his shoulder as if she had quite changed her mind in regard to what was and what was not rude and rather enjoyed it than otherwise  while the lovers stood in this interesting position it became apparent to harrys olfactory nerves that the atmosphere was impregnated with tobacco smoke  looking hastily up he beheld an apparition that tended somewhat to increase the confusion of his faculties  in the opening of the bower stood mr kennedy senior in a state of inexpressible amazement  we say inexpressible advisedly because the extreme pitch of feeling which mr kennedy experienced at what he beheld before him cannot possibly be expressed by human visage  as far as the countenance of man could do it however we believe the old gentlemans came pretty near the mark on this occasion  his hands were in his coat pockets his body bent a little forward his head and neck outstretched a little beyond it his eyes almost starting from the sockets and certainly the most prominent feature in his face his teeth firmly clinched on his beloved pipe and his lips expelling a multitude of little clouds so vigorously that one might have taken him for a sort of selfacting intelligent steamgun that had resolved utterly to annihilate kate and harry at short range in the course of two minutes  when kate saw her father she uttered a slight scream covered her face with her hands rushed from the bower and disappeared in the wood  so young gentleman began mr kennedy in a slow deliberate tone of voice while he removed the pipe from his mouth clinched his fist and confronted harry youve been invited to my house as a guest sir and you seize the opportunity basely to insult my daughter  stay stay my dear sir interrupted harry laying his hand on the old mans shoulder and gazing earnestly into his face  oh do not even for a moment imagine that i could be so base as to trifle with the affections of your daughter  i may have been presumptuous hasty foolish mad if you will but not base  god forbid that i should treat her with disrespect even in thought  i love her mr kennedy as i never loved before  i have asked her to be my wife andshe  whew whistled old mr kennedy replacing his pipe between his teeth gazing abstractedly at the ground and emitting clouds innumerable after standing thus a few seconds he turned his back slowly upon harry and smiled outrageously once or twice winking at the same time after his own fashion at the river  turning abruptly round he regarded harry with a look of affected dignity and said pray sir what did my daughter say to your very peculiar proposal  she said yeah that isshe didnt exactly say anything but she indeed i  humph ejaculated the old gentleman deepening his frown as he regarded his young friend through the smoke  in short she said nothing i suppose but led you to infer perhaps that she would have said yes if i hadnt interrupted you  harry blushed and said nothing  now sir continued mr kennedy dont you think that it would have been a polite piece of attention on your part to have asked my permission before you addressed my daughter on such a subject eh  indeed said harry i acknowledge that i have been hasty but i must disclaim the charge of disrespect to you sir  i had no intention whatever of broaching the subject today but my feelings unhappily carried me away andandin fact  well well sir interrupted mr kennedy with a look of offended dignity your feelings ought to be kept more under control  but come sir to my house  i must talk further with you on this subject  i must read you a lesson sira lesson humph that you wont forget in a hurry  but my dear sir began harry  no more sirno more at present cried the old gentleman smoking violently as he pointed to the footpath that led to the house  lead the way sir ill follow  the footpath although wide enough to allow kate and harry to walk beside each other did not permit of two gentlemen doing so convenientlya circumstance which proved a great relief to mr kennedy inasmuch as it enabled him while walking behind his companion to wink convulsively smoke furiously and punch his own ribs severely by way of opening a few safetyvalves to his glee without which there is no saying what might have happened  he was nearly caught in these eccentricities more than once however as harry turned half round with the intention of again attempting to exculpate himselfattempts which were as often met by a sudden start a fierce frown a burst of smoke and a command to go on  on approaching the house the track became a broad road affording mr kennedy no excuse for walking in the rear so that he was under the necessity of laying violent restraint on his feelingsa restraint which it was evident could not last long  at that moment to his great relief his eye suddenly fell on the grey cat which happened to be reposing innocently on the doorstep  thats it theres the whole cause of it at last cried mr kennedy in a perfect paroxysm of excitement flinging his pipe violently at the unoffending victim as he rushed towards it  the pipe missed the cat but went with a sharp crash through the parlour window at which charley was seated while his father darted through the doorway along the passage and into the kitchen  here the cat having first capsized a pyramid of pans and kettles in its consternation took refuge in an absolutely unassailable position  seeing this mr kennedy violently discharged a pailful of water at the spot strode rapidly to his own apartment and locked himself in  dear me harry whats wrong my father seems unusually excited said charley in some astonishment as harry entered the room and flung himself on a chair with a look of chagrin  its difficult to say charley the fact is ive asked your sister kate to be my wife and your father seems to have gone mad with indignation  asked kate to be your wife cried charley starting up and regarding his friend with a look of amazement  yes i have replied harry with an air of offended dignity  i know very well that i am unworthy of her but i see no reason why you and your father should take such pains to make me feel it  unworthy of her my dear fellow exclaimed charley grasping his hand and wringing it violently no doubt you are and so is everybody but you shall have her for all that my boy  but tell me harry have you spoken to kate herself  yes i have  and does she agree  well i think i may say she does  have you told my father that she does  why as to that said harry with a perplexed smile he didnt need to be told he made himself pretty well aware of the facts of the case  ah  ill soon settle him cried charley  keep your mind easy old fellow ill very soon bring him round  with this assurance charley gave his friends hand another shake that nearly wrenched the arm from his shoulder and hastened out of the room in search of his refractory father    chapter thirty one  the course of true love curiously enough runs smooth for once and the curtain falls  time rolled on and with it the sunbeams of summer wentthe snowflakes of winter came  needles of ice began to shoot across the surface of red river and gradually narrowed its bed  crystalline trees formed upon the windowpanes  icicles depended from the eaves of the houses  snow fell in abundance on the plains liquid nature began rapidly to solidify and not many weeks after the first frost made its appearance everything was as the settlers expressed it hard and fast  mr kennedy senior was in his parlour with his back to a blazing wood fire that seemed large enough to roast an ox whole  he was standing moreover in a semipicturesque attitude with his right hand in his breeches pocket and his left arm round kates waist  kate was dressed in a gown that rivalled the snow itself in whiteness  one little gold clasp shone in her bosom it was the only ornament she wore  mr kennedy too had somewhat altered his style of costume  he wore a skyblue swallowtailed coat whose maker had flourished in london half a century before  it had a velvet collar about five inches deep fitted uncommonly tight to the figure and had a pair of bright brass buttons very close together situated half a foot above the wearers natural waist  besides this he had on a canarycoloured vest and a pair of white duck trousers in the fob of which evidently reposed an immense gold watch of the olden time with a bunch of seals that would have served very well as an anchor for a small boat  although the dress was on the whole slightly comical its owner with his full fat broad figaro looked remarkably well in it nevertheless  it was kates marriageday or rather marriageevening for the sun had set two hours ago and the moon was now sailing in the frosty sky its pale rays causing the whole country to shine with a clear cold silvery whiteness  the old gentleman had been for some time gazing in silent admiration on the fair brow and clustering ringlets of his daughter when it suddenly occurred to him that the company would arrive in half an hour and there were several things still to be attended to  hollo kate he exclaimed with a start were forgetting ourselves the candles are yet to light and lots of other things to do  saying this he began to bustle about the room in a state of considerable agitation  oh dont worry yourself dear father cried kate running after him and catching him by the hand  miss cookumwell and good mrs taddipopple are arranging everything about tea and supper in the kitchen and tom whyte has been kindly sent to us by mr grant with orders to make himself generally useful so he can light the candles in a few minutes and youve nothing to do but to kiss me and receive the company  kate pulled her father gently towards the fire again and replaced his arm round her waist  receive company  ah kate my love thats just what i know nothing about  if theyd let me receive them in my own way id do it well enough but that abominable mrs taddiwhats her namehas quite addled my brains and driven me distracted with trying to get me to understand what she calls etiquette  kate laughed and said she didnt care how he received them as she was quite sure that whichever way he did it he would do it pleasantly and well  at that moment the door opened and tom whyte entered  he was thinner if possible than he used to be and considerably stiffer and more upright  please sir said he with a motion that made you expect to hear his back creak it was intended for a bowplease sir can i do hanythink for yer  yes tom you can replied mr kennedy  light these candles my man and then go to the stable and see that everything there is arranged for putting up the horses  it will be pretty full tonight tom and will require some management  then let me seeah yes bring me my pipe tom my big meerschaumill sport that tonight in honour of you kate  please sir began tom with a slightly disconcerted air im afeard sir thatum  well tom what would you say  go on  the pipe sir said tom growing still more disconcertedsays i to cook says i cook wots been an done it dye think  dun know tom says he but its smashed thats sartin  i think the gray cat  what cried the old trader in a voice of thunder while a frown of the most portentous ferocity darkened his brow for an instant  it was only for an instant however  clearing his brow quickly he said with a smile but its your weddingday kate my darling  it wont do to blow up anybody today not even the catthere be off tom and see to things  look sharp  i hear sleighbells already  as he spoke tom vanished perpendicularly kate hastened to her room and the old gentleman himself went to the front door to receive his guests  the night was of that intensely calm and still character that invariably accompanies intense frost so that the merry jingle of the sleighbells that struck on mr kennedys listening ear continued to sound and grow louder as they drew near for a considerable time ere the visitors arrived  presently the dull soft tramp of horses hoofs was heard in the snow and a wellknown voice shouted out lustily now then mactavish keep to the left  doesnt the road take a turn there  mind the gap in the fence  thats old kennedys only fault  hed rather risk breaking his friends necks than mend his fences  all right here we are cried mactavish as the next instant two sleighs emerged out of the avenue into the moonlit space in front of the house and dashed up to the door amid an immense noise and clatter of bells harness hoofs snorting and salutations  ah grant my dear fellow cried mr kennedy springing to the sleigh and seizing his friend by the hand as he dragged him out  this is kind of you to come early  and mrs grant too  take care my dear madam step clear of the haps now thencleverly done as mrs grant tumbled into his arms in a confused heap  come along now theres a capital fire in heredont mind the horses mactavishfollow us my lad tom whyte will attend to them  uttering such disjointed remarks mr kennedy led mrs grant into the house and made her over to mrs taddipopple who hurried her away to an inner apartment while mr kennedy conducted her spouse along with mactavish and our friend the head clerk at fort garry into the parlour  harry my dear fellow i wish you joy cried mr grant as the former grasped his hand  lucky dog you are  wheres kate eh  not visible yet i suppose  no not till the parson comes interrupted mr kennedy convulsing his left cheekhollo charley where are you  ah bring the cigars charleysit down gentlemen make yourselves at homei say mrs tadditaddioh botherationpopple thats ityour name madam is a puzzlerbutwell need more chairs i think  fetch one or two like a dear  as he spoke the jingle of bells was heard outside and mr kennedy rushed to the door again  goodevening mr addison said he taking that gentleman warmly by the hand as he resigned the reins to tom whyte  i am delighted to see you sir look after the ministers mare tom glad to see you my dear sir  some of my friends have come already  this way mr addison  the worthy clergyman responded to mr kennedys greeting in his own hearty manner and followed him into the parlour where the guests now began to assemble rapidly  father cried charley catching his sire by the arm ive been looking for you everywhere but you dance about like a willothewisp do you know ive invited my friends jacques and redfeather to come tonight and also louis peltier the guide with whom i made my first trip  you recollect him father  ay that do i lad and happy shall i be to see three such worthy men under my roof as guests on this night  yes yes i know that father but i dont see them here  have they come yet  cant say boy  by the way pastor conway is also coming so well have a meeting between an episcopalian and a wesleyan  i sincerely trust that they wont fight  as he said this the old gentleman grinned and threw his cheek into convulsionsan expression which was suddenly changed into one of confusion when he observed that mr addison was standing close beside him and had heard the remark  dont blush my dear sir said mr addison with a quiet smile as he patted his friend on the shoulder  you have too much reason i am sorry to say for expecting that clergymen of different denominations should look coldly on each other  there is far too much of this indifference and distrust among those who labour in different parts of the lords vineyard  but i trust you will find that my sympathies extend a little beyond the circle of my own particular body  indeed mr conway is a particular friend of mine so i assure you we wont fight  right right cried mr kennedy giving the clergyman an energetic grasp of the hand i like to hear you speak that way  i must confess that i have been a good deal surprised to observe by what one reads in the oldcountry newspapers as well as by what one sees even hereaway in the backwood settlements how little interest clergymen show in the doings of those who dont happen to belong to their own particular sect just as if a soul saved through the means of an episcopalian was not of as much value as one saved by a wesleyan or a presbyterian or a dissenter  why sir it seems to me just as meanspirited and selfish as if one of our chief factors was so entirely taken up with the doings and success of his own particular district that he didnt care a gunflint for any other district in the companys service  there was at least one man listening to these remarks whose naturally logical and liberal mind fully agreed with them  this was jacques caradoc who had entered the room a few minutes before in company with his friend redfeather and louis peltier  right sir  thats fact straight up and down said he in an approving tone  ha  jacques my good fellow is that youredfeather my friend how are you said mr kennedy turning round and grasping a hand of eachsit down there louis beside mrs taddiehahpopplemr addison this is jacques caradoc the best and stoutest hunter between hudsons bay and oregon  jacques smiled and bowed modestly as mr addison shook his hand  the worthy hunter did indeed at that moment look as if he fully merited mr kennedys eulogium  instead of endeavouring to ape the gentleman as many men in his rank of life would have been likely to do on an occasion like this jacques had not altered his costume a hairbreadth from what it usually was excepting that some parts of it were quite new and all of it faultlessly clean  he wore the usual capote but it was his best one and had been washed for the occasion  the scarlet belt and blue leggings were also as bright in colour as if they had been put on for the first time and the moccasins which fitted closely to his wellformed feet were of the cleanest and brightest yellow leather ornamented as usual in front  the collar of his bluestriped shirt was folded back a little more carefully than usual exposing his sunburned and muscular throat  in fact he wanted nothing save the huntingknife the rifle and the powderhorn to constitute him a perfect specimen of a thorough backwoodsman  redfeather and louis were similarly costumed and a noble trio they looked as they sat modestly in a corner talking to each other in whispers and endeavouring as much as possible to curtail their colossal proportions  now harry said mr kennedy in a hoarse whisper at the same time winking vehemently were about ready lad  wheres kate eh shall we send for her  harry blushed and stammered out something that was wholly unintelligible but which nevertheless seemed to afford infinite delight to the old gentleman who chuckled and winked tremendously gave his soninlaw a facetious poke in the ribs and turning abruptly to miss cookumwell said to that lady now miss cookumpopple were all ready  they seem to have had enough tea and trash youd better be looking after kate i think  miss cookumwell smiled rose and left the room to obey mrs taddipopple followed to help and soon returned with kate whom they delivered up to her father at the door  mr kennedy led her to the upper end of the room harry somerville stood by her side as if by magic mr addison dropped opportunely before them as if from the clouds there was an extraordinary and abrupt pause in the hum of conversation and ere kate was well aware of what was about to happen she felt herself suddenly embraced by her husband from whom she was thereafter violently torn and all but smothered by her sympathising friends  poor kate she had gone through the ceremony almost mechanically recklessly we might be justified in saying for not having raised her eyes off the floor from its commencement to its close the man whom she accepted for better or for worse might have been jacques or redfeather for all that she knew  immediately after this there was heard the sound of a fiddle and an old canadian was led to the upper end of the room placed on a chair and hoisted by the powerful arms of jacques and louis upon a table  in this conspicuous position the old man seemed to be quite at his ease he spent a few minutes in bringing his instrument into perfect tune then looking round with a mild patronising glance to see that the dancers were ready he suddenly struck up a scotch reel with an amount of energy precision and spirit that might have shot a pang of jealousy through the heart of neil gow himself  the noise that instantly commenced and was kept up from that moment with but few intervals during the whole evening was of a kind that is never heard in fashionable drawingrooms  dancing in the backwood settlements is dancing  it is not walking it is not sailing it is not undulating it is not sliding no it is bonafide dancing  it is the performance of intricate evolutions with the feet and legs that makes one wink to look at performed in good time too and by people who look upon all their muscles as being useful machines not merely things of which a select few that cannot be dispensed with are brought into daily operation consequently the thing was done with an amount of vigour that was conducive to the health of performers and productive of satisfaction to the eyes of beholders  when the evening wore on apace however and jacquess modesty was so far overcome as to induce him to engage in a reel along with his friend louis peltier and two bouncing young ladies whose father had driven them twenty miles over the plains that day in order to attend the wedding of their dear friend and former playmate katewhen these four stood up we say and the fiddler played more energetically than ever and the stout backwoodsmen began to warm and grow vigorous until in the midst of their tremendous leaps and rapid but welltimed motions they looked like very giants amid their brethren then it was that harry as he felt kates little hand pressing his arm and observed her sparkling eyes gazing at the dancers in genuine admiration began at last firmly to believe that the whole thing was a dream and then it was that old mr kennedy rejoiced to think that the house had been built under his own special directions and he knew that it could not by any possibility be shaken to pieces  and well might harry imagine that he dreamed for besides the bewildering tendency of the almost toogoodtobetrue fact that kate was really mrs harry somerville the scene before him was a particularly odd and perplexing mixture of widely different elements suggestive of new and old associations  the company was miscellaneous there were retired old traders whose lives from boyhood had been spent in danger solitude wild scenes and adventures to which those of robinson crusoe are mere childs play  there were young girls the daughters of these men who had received good educations in the red river academy and a certain degree of polish which education always gives a very different polish indeed from that which the conventionalities and refinements of the old world bestow but not the less agreeable on that accountnay we might even venture to say all the more agreeable on that account  there were red indians and clergymenthere were one or two ladies of a doubtful age who had come out from the old country to live there having found it no easy matter poor things to live at home there were matrons whose absolute silence on every subject save yes or no showed that they had not been subjected to the refining influences of the academy but whose hearty smiles and laughs of genuine goodnature proved that the storing of the brain has after all very little to do with the best and deepest feelings of the heart  there were the tones of scotch reels soundingtones that brought scotland vividly before the very eyes and there were canadian hunters and halfbreed voyageurs whose moccasins were more accustomed to the turf of the woods than the boards of a drawingroom and whose speech and accents made scotland vanish away altogether from the memory  there were old people and young folk there were fat and lean short and long  there were songs tooballads of england pathetic songs of scotland alternating with the french ditties of canada and the sweet inexpressibly plaintive canoesongs of the voyageur  there were strong contrasts in dress also some wore the homespun trousers of the settlement a few the ornamented leggings of the hunter  capotes were thereloose flowing and picturesque and broadcloth tailcoats were there of the last century tightfitting angularin a word detestable verifying the truth of the proverb that extremes meet by showing that the cut which all the wisdom of tailors and scientific fops after centuries of study had laboriously wrought out and foisted upon the poor civilised world as perfectly sublime appeared in the eyes of backwoodsmen and indians utterly ridiculous  no wonder that harry under the circumstances became quietly insane and went about committing nothing but mistakes the whole evening  no wonder that he emulated his fatherinlaw in abusing the gray cat when he found it surreptitiously devouring part of the supper in an adjoining room and no wonder that when he rushed about vainly in search of mrs taddipopple to acquaint her with the cats wickedness he at last in desperation laid violent hands on miss cookumwell and addressed that excellent lady by the name of mrs poppletaddy  were we courageous enough to make the attempt we would endeavour to describe that joyful evening from beginning to end  we would tell you how the companys spirits rose higher and higher as each individual became more and more anxious to lend his or her aid in adding to the general hilarity how old mr kennedy nearly killed himself in his fruitless efforts to be everywhere speak to everybody and do everything at once how charley danced till he could scarcely speak and then talked till he could hardly dance and how the fiddler instead of growing wearied became gradually and continuously more powerful until it seemed as if fifty fiddles were playing at one and the same time  we would tell you how mr addison drew more than ever to mr conway and how the latter gentleman agreed to correspond regularly with the former thenceforth in order that their interest in the great work each had in hand for the same master might be increased and kept up how in a spirit of recklessness afterwards deeply repented of a bashful young man was induced to sing a song which in the present mirthful state of the company ought to have been a humorous song or a patriotic song or a good loud inspiriting song or anything in short but what it wasa slow dull sentimental song about wasting gradually away in a sort of melancholy decay on account of disappointed love or some such trash which was a false sentiment in itself and certainly did not derive any additional tinge of truthfulness from a thin weak voice that was afflicted with chronic flatness and edged all its notes were we courageous enough to go on we would further relate to you how during supper mr kennedy senior tried to make a speech and broke down amid uproarious applause how mr kennedy junior got up thereafterbeing urged thereto by his father who said with a convulsion of the cheek get me out of the scrape charley my boy and delivered an oration which did not display much power of concise elucidation but was replete nevertheless with consummate impudence how during this point in the proceedings the grey cat made a last desperate effort to purloin a cold chicken which it had watched anxiously the whole evening and was caught in the very act nearly strangled and flung out of the window where it alighted in safety on the snow and fled a wiser and we trust a better cat  we would recount all this to you reader and a great deal more besides but we fear to try your patience and we tremble violentlymuch more so indeed than you will believeat the bare idea of waxing prosy  suffice it to say that the party separated at an early houra good sober reasonable hour for such an occasionsomewhere before midnight the horses were harnessed the ladies were packed in the sleighs with furs so thick and plentiful as to defy the cold the gentlemen seized their reins and cracked their whips the horses snorted plunged and dashed away over the white plains in different directions while the merry sleighbells sounded fainter and fainter in the frosty air  in half an hour the stars twinkled down on the still cold scene and threw a pale light on the now silent dwelling of the old furtrader    ere dropping the curtain over a picture in which we have sought faithfully to portray the prominent features of those wild regions that lie to the north of the canadas and in which we have endeavoured to describe some of the peculiarities of a class of men whose histories seldom meet the public eye we feel tempted to add a few more touches to the sketch we would fain trace a little further the fortunes of one or two of the chief actors in our book  but this must not be  snowflakes and sunbeams came and went as in days gone by  time rolled on working many changes in its course and among others consigning harry somerville to an important post in red river colony to the unutterable joy of mr kennedy senior and of kate  after much consideration and frequent consultation with mr addison mr conway resolved to make another journey to preach the gospel of jesus christ to those indian tribes that inhabit the regions beyond athabasca and being a man of great energy he determined not to await the opening of the river navigation but to undertake the first part of his expedition on snowshoes  jacques agreed to go with him as guide and hunter redfeather as interpreter  it was a bright cold morning when he set out accompanied part of the way by charley kennedy and harry somerville whose hearts were heavy at the prospect of parting with the two men who had guided and protected them during their earliest experience of a voyageurs life when with hearts full to overflowing with romantic anticipations they first dashed joyously into the almost untrodden wilderness  during their career in the woods together the young men and the two hunters had become warmly attached to each other and now that they were about to partit might be for years perhaps for evera feeling of sadness crept over them which they could not shake off and which the promise given by mr conway to revisit red river on the following spring served but slightly to dispel  on arriving at the spot where they intended to bid their friends a last farewell the two young men held out their hands in silence  jacques grasped them warmly  mister charles mister harry said he in a deep earnest voice the almighty has guided us in safety for many a day when we travelled the woods together for which praised be his holy name  may he guide and bless you still and bring us together in this world again if in his wisdom he see fit  there was no answer save a deeplymurmured amen  in another moment the travellers resumed their march  on reaching the summit of a slight eminence where the prairies terminated and the woods began they paused to wave a last adieu then jacques putting himself at the head of the little party plunged into the forest and led them away towards the snowy regions of the far north  the end
