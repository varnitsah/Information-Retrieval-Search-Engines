london george bell and sons 1905 chiswick press charles whittingham and co tooks court chancery lane london     introduction   swift took up his permanent residence in the irish capital in 1714 the harley administration had fallen never to rise again harley himself was a prisoner in the tower and bolingbroke a voluntary exile in france and an open adherent of the pretender swift came to dublin to be met by the jeers of the populace the suspicion of the government officials and the polite indifference of his clerical colleagues he had time enough now in which to reflect and employ his brain powers for several years he kept himself altogether to his duties as dean of the cathedral of st patricks only venturing his pen in letters to dear friends in englandto pope atterbury lady howard his private relations with miss hester vanhomrigh came to a climax also during this period and his peculiar intimacy with stella johnson took the definite shape in which we now know it  he found himself in debt to his predecessor sterne for a large and comfortless house and for the cost of his own installation into his office the money he was to have received £1000 to defray these expenses from the last administration was now on its fall kept back from him swift had these encumbrances to pay off and he had his chapter to see to he did both in characteristic fashion by dint of almost penurious saving he accomplished the former and the latter he managed autocratically and with good sense his connection with oxford and bolingbroke had been of too intimate a nature for those in power to ignore him indeed his own letters to knightley chetwode1 show us that he was in great fear of arrest but there is now no doubt that the treasonable relations between harley and st john and the pretender were a great surprise to swift when they were discovered he himself had always been an ardent supporter of the protestant succession and his writings during his later period in ireland constantly emphasize this attitude of hisalmost too much so  the condition of ireland as swift found it in 1714 and as he had known of it even before that time was of a kind to rouse a temper like his to quick and indignant expression even as early as the spring of 1716 we find him unable to restrain himself and in his letter to atterbury of april 18th we catch the spirit which four years later showed itself in the proposal for the universal use of irish manufactures and the drapiers letters and culminated in 1729 in the terrible modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being a burthen to their parents to atterbury he wrote  i congratulate with england for joining with us here in the fellowship of slavery it is not so terrible a thing as you imagine we have long lived under it and whenever you are disposed to know how to behave yourself in your new condition you need go no further than me for a director but because we are resolved to go beyond you we have transmitted a bill to england to be returned here giving the government and six of the council power for three years to imprison whom they please for three months without any trial or examination and i expect to be among the first of those upon whom this law will be executed  writing to archdeacon walls2 may 5th 1715 of the people in power he said  they shall be deceived as far as my power reaches and shall not find me altogether so great a cully as they would willingly make me  at that time england was beginning to initiate a new method for what it called the proper government of ireland hitherto it had tried the plan of setting one party in the country against another but now a new party was called into being known as the english party this party had nothing to do with the irish national spirit and any man no matter how capable who held by such a national spirit was to be set aside there was to be no irish party or parties as suchthere was to be only the english party governing ireland in the interests of england it was the beginning of a government which led to the appointment of such a man as primate boulter who simply ruled ireland behind the lord lieutenant who was but a figurehead for and on behalf of the king of englands advisers irish institutions irish ideas irish traditions the irish church irish schools irish language and literature irish trade manufactures commerce agricultureall were to be subordinated to englands needs and englands demands at any cost almost these were to be made subservient to the interests of england so well was this plan carried out that ireland found itself being governed by a small english clique and its houses of parliament a mere tool in the cliques hands the parliament no longer represented the national will since it did really nothing but ratify what the english party asked for or what the kings ministers in england instructed should be made law  irish manufactures were ruined by legislation the commerce of ireland was destroyed by the same means her schools became practically penitentiaries to the catholic children who were compelled to receive a protestant instruction her agriculture was degraded to the degree that cattle could not be exported nor the wool sold or shipped from her own ports to other countries her towns swarmed with beggars and thieves forced there by the desolation which prevailed in the country districts where people starved by the wayside and where those who lived barely kept body and soul together to pay the rents of the absentee landlords  swift has himself in the pamphlets printed in the present volume given a fairly accurate and no exaggerated account of the miserable condition of his country at this time and his writings are amply corroborated by other men who might be considered less passionate and more temperate  the people had become degraded through the evil influence of a contemptuous and spendthrift landlord class who considered the tenant in no other light than as a rentpaying creature as roman catholics they found themselves the social inferiors of the ruling protestant classthe laws had placed them in that invidious position they were practically without any defence they were ignorant poor and halfstarved thriftless like their landlords they ate up in the autumn what harvests they gathered and begged for their winters support adultery and incest were common and bred a body of lawless creatures who herded together like wild beasts and became dangerous pests  swift knew all this he had time between the years 1714 and 1720 to find it out even if he had not known of it before but the condition was getting worse and his heart filled as he told pope in 1728 with a perfect rage and resentment at the mortifying sight of slavery folly and baseness about me among which i am forced to live  he commenced what might be called a campaign of attack in 1720 with the publication of his tract entitled a modest proposal for the universal use of irish manufactures as has been pointed out in the notes prefixed to the pamphlets in the present volume england had apparently gone to work systematically to ruin irish manufactures they seemed to threaten ruin to english industries at least so the people in england thought the pernicious legislation began in the reign of charles ii and continued in that of william iii the irish manufacturer was not permitted to export his products and found a precarious livelihood in a contraband trade swifts proposal is one of retaliation since england will not allow ireland to send out her goods let the people of ireland use them and let them join together and determine to use nothing from england everything that came from england should be burned except the people and the coal if england had the right to prevent the exportation of the goods made in ireland she had not the right to prevent the people of ireland from choosing what they should wear the temper of the pamphlet was mild in the extreme but the governing officials saw in it dangerous symptoms the pamphlet was stigmatized as libellous and seditious and the writer as attempting to disunite the two nations the printer was brought to trial and the pamphlet obtained a tremendous circulation although the jury acquitted the printer chief justice whitshed who had as swift puts it so quick an understanding that he resolved if possible to outdo his orders sent the jury back nine times to reconsider their verdict he even declared solemnly that the authors design was to bring in the pretender this cry of bringing in the pretender was raised on any and every occasion and has been well ridiculed by swift in his examination of certain abuses and corruptions in the city of dublin the end of whitsheds persecution could have been foretoldit fizzled out in a nolle prosequi  following on this interesting commencement came the lengthened agitation against woods halfpence to which we owe the remarkable series of writings known now as the drapiers letters these are fully discussed in the volume preceding this but swift found other channels in which to continue rousing the spirit of the people and refreshing it to further effort the mania for speculation which laws schemes had given birth to reached poor ireland also people thought there might be found a scheme on similar lines by which ireland might move to prosperity a bank project was initiated for the purpose of assisting small tradesmen but a scheme that in itself would have been excellent in a prosperous society could only end in failure in such a community as peopled ireland swift felt this and opposed the plan in his satirical tract the swearers bank the tract sufficed for no more was heard of the national bank after the house of commons rejected it  the thieves and roughs who infested dublin came in next for swifts attention in characteristic fashion he seized the occasion of the arrest and execution of one of their leaders to publish a pretended last speech and dying confession in which he threatened exposure and arrest to the remainder of the gang if they did not make themselves scarce the threat had its effect and the city found itself considerably safer as a consequence  how swift pounded out his rage and resentment against english misgovernment may be further read in the story of the injured lady and in the answer to that story the injured lady is ireland who tells her lover england of her attractions and upbraids him on his conduct towards her in the answer swift tells the lady what she ought to do and hardly minces matters let her show the right spirit he says to her and she will find there are many gentlemen who will support her and champion her cause  then came the plain pathetic and truthful recital of the short view of the state of irelanda pamphlet of but a few pages and yet terribly effective as an historical document it takes rank with the experiences of the clergymen skelton and jackson as well as the more dispassionate writings of contemporary historians it is frequently cited by lecky in his history of ireland  what swift had so far left undone either from political reasons or from motives of personal restraint he completed in what may without exaggeration be called his satirical masterpiecethe modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being a burthen to their parents nothing comparable to this piece of writing is to be found in any literature while the mere fact that it came into being must stand as one of the deadliest indictments against englands misrule governments and rulers have been satirized time and again but no similar condition of things has existed with a swift living at the time to observe and comment on them the tract itself must be read with a knowledge of the irish conditions then prevailing its temper is so calm and restrained that a reader unacquainted with the conditions might be misled and think that the author of gullivers travels was indulging himself in one of his grim jokes that it was not a joke its readers at the time well knew and many of them also knew how great was the indignation which raged in swifts heart to stir him to so unprecedented an expression of contempt he had as he himself said raged and stormed only to find himself stupefied in the modest proposal he changed his tune and         with raillery to nettle   set your thoughts upon their mettle  swift has been censured for the coldblooded cynicism of this piece of writing but these censurers have entirely misunderstood both his motive and his meaning we wonder how any one could take seriously a proposal for breeding children for food purposes and our wonder grows in reflecting on an inability to see through the thin veil of satire which barely hid an impeachment of a ruling nation by the mere statement of the proposal itself that a frenchman should so misunderstand it as a frenchman did may not surprise us but that any englishman should so take it argues an utter absence of humour and a total ignorance of irish conditions at the time the tract was written but history has justified swift and it is to his writings rather than to the many works written by more commonplace observers that we now turn for the true story of irelands wrongs and the real sources of her continued attitude of hostility towards englands government of her  it has been well noted by one of swifts biographers that for a thousand readers which the modest proposal has found there is perhaps only one who is acquainted with swifts answer to the craftsman it may be that the title is misleading or uninviting but there is no question that this tract may well stand by the side of the modest proposal both for force of argument and pungency of satire in its way and within the limits of its more restricted argument it is one of the ablest pieces of writing swift has given us on behalf of irish liberty  the title of irish patriot which swift obtained was not sought for by him it was given him mainly for the part he played and for the success he achieved in the woods patent agitation he was acclaimed the champion of the people because he had stopped the foolish manoeuvres of the walpole administration so to label him however would be to do him an injustice in truth he would have championed the cause of liberty and justice in any country in which he lived had he found liberty and justice wanting there the matter of the copper coinage patent was but a peg for him to hang arguments which applied almost everywhere it was not to the particular arguments but to the spirit which gave them life that we must look for the true value of swifts work and that spirithonest brave strong for the rightis even more abundantly displayed in the writings we have just considered they witness to his championship of liberty and justice to his impeachment of selfish officeholders and a shortsighted policy they gave him his position as the chief among the citizens of dublin to whom he spoke as counsel and adviser they proclaim him as the friend of the common people to whom he was more than the dean of st patricks he may have begun his work impelled by a hatred for whiggish principles but he undoubtedly accomplished it in the spirit of a broadminded and farseeing statesman the pressing needs of ireland were too urgent and crying for him to permit his personal dislike of the irish natives to divert him from his humanitarian efforts if he hated the beggar he was ready with his charity the times in which he lived were not times in which as he told the freemen of dublin to expect such an exalted degree of virtue from mortal men he was speaking to them of the impossibility of officeholders being independent of the government under which they held their offices blazing stars he said are much more frequently seen than such heroical virtues as the irish people were governed by such men he advised them strongly to choose a parliamentary representative from among themselves he insisted on the value of their collected voice their unanimity of effort a consciousness of their understanding of what they wished to bring about be independent is the text of all his writings to the people of ireland it is idle to appeal to englands clemency or englands justice it is vain to evolve social schemes and utopian dreams the remedy lay in their own hands if the people only realized it  violent zeal for truth swift noted in one of his thoughts on religion has a hundred to one odds to be either petulancy ambition or pride examining swifts writings on behalf of ireland by the criterion provided in this statement we must acquit him entirely of misusing any of these qualities if he were bitter or scornful he was certainly not petulant no one has written with more justice or coolness the temper is hot but it is the heat of a conscious and collected indignation if he wrote or spoke in a manner somewhat overbearing it was not because of ambition since he was now long past his youth and his mind had become settled in a fairly complacent acceptance of his position if he had pride and he undoubtedly had it was nowhere obtruded for personal aggrandizement but rather by way of emphasizing the dignity of citizenship and the value of selfrespect assuredly in these irish tracts swift was no violent zealot for truth indeed it is a high compliment to pay him to say that we wonder he restrained himself as he did  swift however had his weakness also and it lay as weaknesses generally lie very close to his strength swifts fault as a thinker was the outcome of his intellectualityhe was too purely intellectual he set little store on the emotional side of human nature his appeal was always to the reason he hated cant and any expression of emotion appealed to him as cant he could not bear to be seen saying his prayers his acts of charity were surreptitious and given in secret with an affectation of cynicism so that they might veil the motive which impelled them it may have been pride or a dislike to be considered sentimental but his attitude owed its spring to a genuine faith in his own thought if swift had one pride more than another it lay in a consciousness of his own superiority over his fellowmortals it was the pride of intellect and a belief that man showed himself best by following the judgements of the reason his disgust with people was born of their unreasonable selfishness their instinctive greed and rapacity their blind stupidity all which resulted for them in so much injustice had they been reasonable he would have argued they would have been better and happier the sentiments and the passions were impulsive and therefore unreasonable swift seemed to have no faith in their elevation to a higher intellectual plane and yet he often roused them by his very appeals to reason his eminently successful drapiers letters are a case in point yet we question if swift were not himself surprised at their effect he knew his power later when he threatened the archbishop of armagh but he no doubt credited the result to his own arguments and not to the passions he had aroused his sense of justice was the strongest and it was through that sense that the condition of the people of ireland appealed to him he forgot or he did not see that the very passion in himself was of prime importance since it was really to it that his own efforts were due the fine flower of imagination never blossomed in swift he was neither prophet nor poet but he was a great leader a splendid captain a logical statesman it is to this lack of imagination that we must look for the real root of his cynical humour and satirical temper a more imaginative man than swift with much less power would have better appreciated the weaknesses of humanity and made allowances for them he would never have held them up to ridicule and contempt but would rather have laid stress on those instincts of honour and nobility which the most ignorant and least reasoning possess in some degree  looking back on the work swift did and comparing its effect at the time with the current esteem in which he is held in the present day we shall find that his reputation has altogether changed in his own day and especially during his life in ireland his work was special and brought him a special repute he was a partys advocate and the peoples friend his literary output distinguished though it was was of secondary importance compared with the purpose for which it was accomplished he was the friend of harley the champion of the protestant church the irish patriot the enemy of whiggism the opponent of nonconformity today all these phrases mean little or nothing to those who know of swift as the author of a tale of a tub and gullivers travels swift is now accepted as a great satirist and admired for the wonderful knowledge he shows of the failings and weaknesses of human nature he is admired but never loved the particular occasions in his lifetime which urged him to rouse passions mean nothing to us they have lost the aroma of his just indignation and are become historical events what is left of him for us is the result of cold analysis and almost heartless contempt how different would it have been had swift allied his great gift as a writer to such a spirit as breathes in the sermon on the mount but to wish this is perhaps as foolish as to expect dates to grow on thistles we must accept what is given us and see that we at any rate steer clear of the dangers mapped out for us by the travellers of the past                                       the editor takes this opportunity to thank mr g ravenscroft dennis and mr w spencer jackson for much valuable assistance in the reading of

choosing a new speaker there  written in the year 1708          note        in the note prefixed to the reprint of swifts letter concerning      the sacramental test the circumstances under which this letter      to a member of parliament in ireland was written are explained      see vol iv pp 34 of present edition the godolphin ministry      was anxious to repeal the test act in ireland as a concession to      the presbyterians who had made themselves prominent by their      expressions of loyalty to william and the protestant succession in      this particular year also 1708 rumours of an invasion gave them      another opportunity to send in loyal addresses in reality      however the endeavour to try the repeal in ireland was in the      nature of a test and swift ridiculed the attempt as being like to      that of a discreet physician who first gives a new medicine to a      dog before he prescribes it to a human creature it seems that      swift had been consulted by somers on the question of the repeal      and had given his opinion very frankly the letter to archbishop      king revealing this contains some bitter remarks about a certain      lawyer of ireland the lawyer was speaker brodrick afterwards      lord midleton who was enthusiastic for the repeal the present      letter gives a very clear idea of what swift thought should be a      speakers duties both as the chairman of the house and as related      to this particular measure of the test                                            the text of the present reprint is based on the original manuscript      in swifts handwriting but as this was found to be somewhat      illegible it has been collated with the text given in vol viii      of the quarto edition of swifts collected works published in      1765       t s     a letter to a member of parliament in ireland upon the choosing a new speaker there   sir  you may easily believe i am not at all surprised at what you tell me since it is but a confirmation of my own conjecture that i sent you last week and made you my reproaches upon it at a venture it looks exceeding strange yet i believe it to be a great truth that in order to carry a point in your house the two following circumstances are of great advantage first to have an ill cause and secondly to be a minority for both these circumstances are extremely apt to unite men to make them assiduous in their attendance watchful of opportunities zealous for gaining over proselytes and often successful which is not to be wondered at when favour and interest are on the side of their opinion whereas on the contrary a majority with a good cause are negligent and supine they think it sufficient to declare themselves upon occasion in favour of their party but sailing against the tide of favour and preferment they are easily scattered and driven back in short they want a common principle to cement and motive to spirit them for the bare acting upon a principle from the dictates of a good conscience or prospect of serving the public will not go very far under the present dispositions of mankind this was amply verified last sessions of parliament upon occasion of the money bill the merits of which i shall not pretend to examine tis enough that upon the first news of its transmission hither in the form it afterwards appeared the members upon discourse with their friends seemed unanimous against it i mean those of both parties except a few who were looked upon as persons ready to go any lengths prescribed them by the court yet with only a weeks canvassing among a very few hands the bill passed after a full debate by a very great majority yet i believe you will hardly attempt persuading me or anybody else that one man in ten of those who changed their language were moved by reasons any way affecting the merits of the cause but merely through hope fear indolence or good manners nay i have been assured from good hands that there was still a number sufficient to make a majority against the bill if they had not apprehended the other side to be secure and therefore thought it imprudence by declaring themselves to disoblige the government to no purpose  reflecting upon this and forty other passages in the several houses of commons since the revolution makes me apt to think there is nothing a chief governor can be commanded to attempt here wherein he may not succeed with a very competent share of address and with such assistance as he will always find ready at his devotion and therefore i repeat what i said at first that i am not at all surprised at what you tell me for if there had been the least spark of public spirit left those who wished well to their country and its constitution in church and state should upon the first news of the late speakers promotion and you and i know it might have been done a great deal sooner have immediately gone together and consulted about the fittest person to succeed him but by all i can comprehend you have been so far from proceeding thus that it hardly ever came into any of your heads and the reason you give is the worst in the world that none offered themselves and you knew not whom to pitch upon it seems however the other party was more resolved or at least not so modest for you say your vote is engaged against your opinion and several gentlemen in my neighbourhood tell me the same story of themselves this i confess is of an unusual strain and a good many steps below any condescensions a court will i hope ever require from you i shall not trouble myself to inquire who is the person for whom you and others are engaged or whether there be more candidates from that side than one you tell me nothing of either and i never thought it worth the question to anybody else but in so weighty an affair and against your judgment i cannot look upon you as irrevocably determined therefore i desire you will give me leave to reason with you a little upon the subject lest your compliance or inadvertency should put you upon what you may have cause to repent as long as you live  you know very well the great business of the highflying whigs at this juncture is to endeavour a repeal of the test clause you know likewise that the moderate men both of high and low church profess to be wholly averse from this design as thinking it beneath the policy of common gardeners to cut down the only hedge that shelters from the north3 now i will put the case if the person to whom you have promised your vote be one of whom you have the least apprehension that he will promote or assent to the repealing of that clause whether it be decent or proper he should be the mouth of an assembly whereof a very great majority pretend to abhor his opinion can a body whose mouth and heart must go so contrary ways ever act with sincerity or hardly with consistence such a man is no proper vehicle to retain or convey the sense of the house which in so many points of the greatest moment will be directly contrary to his tis full as absurd as to prefer a man to a bishopric who denies revealed religion but it may possibly be a great deal worse what if the person you design to vote into that important post should not only be a declared enemy of the sacramental test but should prove to be a solicitor an encourager or even a penner of addresses to complain of it do you think it so indifferent a thing that a promise of course the effect of compliance importunity shame of refusing or any the like motive shall oblige you past the power of retracting  perhaps you will tell me as some have already had the weakness to do that it is of little importance to either party to have a speaker of their side his business being only to take the sense of the house and report it that you often at committees put an able speaker into the chair on purpose to prevent him from stopping a bill why if it were no more than this i believe i should hardly choose even among my footmen such a one to deliver a message whose interest and opinions led him to wish it might miscarry but i remember to have heard old colonel birch4 of herefordshire say that he was a very sorry speaker whose single vote was not better than fifty common ones i am sure it is reckoned in england the first great test of the prevalency of either party in the house sir thomas littleton5 thought that a house of commons with a stinking breath supposing the speaker to be the mouth would go near to infect everything within the walls and a great deal without it is the smallest part of an able speakers business what he performs in the house at least if he be in with the court when it is hard to say how many converts may be made in a circle of dinners or private cabals and you and i can easily call to mind a gentleman in that station in england who by his own arts and personal credit was able to draw over a majority and change the whole power of a prevailing side in a nice juncture of affairs and made a parliament expire in one party who had lived in another  i am far from an inclination to multiply party causes but surely the best of us can with very ill grace make that an objection who have not been so nice in matters of much less importance yet i have heard some persons of both sides gravely deliver themselves in this manner why should we make the choosing a speaker a party cause let us fix upon one who is well versed in the practices and methods of parliament and i believe there are too many who would talk at the same rate if the question were not only about abolishing the sacramental test but the sacrament itself  but suppose the principles of the most artful speaker could have no influence either to obtain or obstruct any point in parliament who can answer what effects such a choice may produce without doors tis obvious how small a matter serves to raise the spirits and hopes of the dissenters and their highflying advocates what lengths they run what conclusions they form and what hopes they entertain do they hear of a new friend in office that is encouragement enough to practise the city against the opinion of a majority into an address to the queen for repealing the sacramental test or issue out their orders to the next fanatic parson to furbish up his old sermons and preach and print new ones directly against episcopacy i would lay a good wager that if the choice of a new speaker succeeds exactly to their liking we shall see it soon followed by many new attempts either in the form of pamphlet sermon or address to the same or perhaps more dangerous purposes  supposing the speakers office to be only an employment of profit and honour and a step to a better since it is in your own gift will you not choose to bestow it upon some person whose principles the majority of you pretends to approve if it were only to be sure of a worthy man hereafter in a high station on the bench or at the bar  i confess if it were a thing possible to be compassed it would seem most reasonable to fill the chair with some person who would be entirely devoted to neither party but since there are so few of that character and those either unqualified or unfriended i cannot see how a majority will answer it to their reputation to be so ill provided of able persons that they must have recourse for a leader to their adversaries a proceeding of which i never met with above one example and even that succeeded but ill though it was recommended by an oracle which advised some city in greece to beg a general from their enemies who in scorn sent them either a fiddler or a poet i have forgot which but so much i remember that his conduct was such as they soon grew weary of him  you pretend to be heartily resolved against repealing the sacramental test yet at the same time give the only great employment you have to dispose of to a person who will take that test against his stomach by which word i understand many a mans conscience who earnestly wisheth it repealed and will endeavour it to the utmost of his power so that the first action after you meet will be a sort of contravention to that test and will anybody go further than your practice to judge of your principles  and now i am upon this subject i cannot conclude without saying something to a very popular argument against that sacramental test which may be apt to shake many of those who would otherwise wish well enough to it they say it was a new hardship put upon the dissenters without any provocation and it is plain could be no way necessary because we had peaceably lived together so long without it they add some other circumstances of the arts by which it was obtained and the person by whom it was inserted surely such people do not consider that the penal laws against dissenters were made wholly ineffectual by the connivance and mercy of the government so that all employments of the state lay as open to them as they did to the best and most legal subjects and what progress they would have made by the advantages of a late conjecture is obvious to imagine which i take to be a full answer to that objection  i remember upon the transmission of that bill with the test clause inserted the dissenters and their partisans among other topics spoke much of the good effects produced by the lenity of the government that the presbyterians were grown very inconsiderable in their number and quality and would daily come into the church if we did not fright them from it by new severities when the act was passed they presently changed their style and raised a clamour through both kingdoms of the great numbers of considerable gentry who were laid aside and could no longer serve their queen and country which hyperbolical way of reckoning when it came to be melted down into truth amounted to about fifteen country justices most of them of the lowest size for estate quality or understanding however this puts me in mind of a passage told me by a great man though i know not whether it be anywhere recorded that a complaint was made to the king and council in sweden of a prodigious swarm of scots who under the condition of pedlars infested that kingdom to such a degree as if not suddenly prevented might in time prove dangerous to the state by joining with any discontented party meanwhile the scots by their agents placed a good sum of money to engage the offices of the prime minister in their behalf who in order to their defence told the council he was assured they were but a few inconsiderable people that lived honestly and poorly and were not of any consequence their enemies offered to prove the contrary whereupon an order was made to take their number which was found to amount as i remember to about thirty thousand the affair was again brought before the council and great reproaches made the first minister for his ill computation who presently took the other handle said he had reason to believe the number yet greater than what was returned and then gravely offered to the kings consideration whether it were safe to render desperate so great a body of able men who had little to lose and whom any hard treatment would only serve to unite into a power capable of disturbing if not destroying the peace of the kingdom and so they were suffered to continue     a proposal  for the  universal use of irish manufacture          note        this pamphlet constitutes the opening of a campaign against his      political enemies in england on whom swift had it must be      presumed determined to take revenge when the fall of harleys      administration was complete and irrevocable swift returned to      ireland and for six years he lived the simple life of the dean of      st patricks unheard of except by a few of his more intimate      friends in england accustomed by years of intimacy with the      ministers of annes court and by his own temperament to act the      part of leader and adviser swifts compulsory silence must have      chafed and irritated him to a degree his opportunities for      advancement had passed with the passing of harley and bolingbroke      from power and he had given too ardent and enthusiastic a support      to these friends of his for walpole to look to him for a like      service moreover however strong may have been these personal      motives swifts detestation of walpoles irish policy must have      been deep and bitter even before he began to express himself on      the matter his sincerity cannot be doubted even if we make an      ample allowance for a private grudge against the great english      minister the condition of ireland at this time was such as to      arouse the warmest indignation from the most indifferent and      unprejudicedand it was a condition for which english misrule was      mainly responsible it cannot therefore be wondered at that swift      should be among the strenuous and persistent opponents of a policy      which spelled ruin to his country and his patriotism must be      recognized even if we accept the existence of a personal motive       the crass stupidity which characterized englands dealings with      ireland at this time would be hardly credible were it not on      record in the acts passed in the reigns of charles ii and william      iii and embodied in the resolutions of the english parliament      during walpoles term of power an impartial historian is forced to      the conclusion that england had determined to ruin the sister      nation already its social life was disreputable the people taxed      in various ways far beyond their means the agriculture at the      lowest state by the neglect and indifference of the landed      proprietors and the manufactures crippled by a series of      pernicious restrictions imposed by a selfish rival       swift in writing this proposal did not take advantage of any      special occasion as he did later in the matter of woods      halfpence his occasion must be found in the condition of the      country in the injustice to which she was subjected and in the      fact that the time had come when it would be wise and safe for him      to come out once more into the open       he began in his characteristic way all the evils that the laws      against the manufactures and agriculture of ireland brought into      existence are summarized in this proposal his business is not to      attack the laws directly but to attempt a method by which these      shall be nullified since the manufactures of ireland might not be      exported for sale let the people of ireland wear them themselves      and let them resolve and determine to wear them in preference to      those imported from england if england had the right to prevent      the importation to it of irish woollen goods it was surely only      just that the irish should exercise then right to wear their own      homemade clothes the tract was a reasonable and mild statement      yet such was the temper of the governing officials that a cry was      raised against it and the writer accused of attempting to disunite      the two kingdoms with consistent foolishness the printer was      brought to trial and although the jury acquitted him yet the lord      chief justice whitshed zealous for his employer more than for his      office refused to accept the verdict and attempted to force the      jury to a conviction in his letter to pope dated january 10th      172021 swift gives an account of this matter       i have written in this kingdom a discourse to persuade the      wretched people to wear their own manufactures instead of those      from england this treatise soon spread very fast being agreeable      to the sentiments of the whole nation except those gentlemen who      had employments or were expectants upon which a person in great      office here immediately took the alarm he sent in haste for the      chiefjustice and informed him of a seditious factious and      virulent pamphlet lately published with a design of setting the      two kingdoms at variance directing at the same time that the      printer should be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law the      chiefjustice has so quick an understanding that he resolved if      possible to outdo his orders the grand juries of the county and      city were effectually practised with to represent the said      pamphlet with all aggravating epithets for which they had thanks      sent them from england and their presentments published for      several weeks in all the newspapers the printer was seized and      forced to give great bail after his trial the jury brought him in      not guilty although they had been culled with the utmost industry      the chiefjustice sent them back nine times and kept them eleven      hours until being perfectly tired out they were forced to leave      the matter to the mercy of the judge by what they call a special      verdict during the trial the chiefjustice among other      singularities laid his hand on his breast and protested solemnly      that the authors design was to bring in the pretender although      there was not a single syllable of party in the whole treatise and      although it was known that the most eminent of those who professed      his own principles publicly disallowed his proceedings but the      cause being so very odious and unpopular the trial of the verdict      was deferred from one term to another until upon the duke of      graftons the lord lieutenants arrival his grace after mature      advice and permission from england was pleased to grant a noli      prosequi       this chief justice whitshed was the same who acted as judge on      hardings trial for printing the fourth drapier letter swift never      forgot him and took several occasions to satirize him bitterly                                            the text of the present edition is based on the dublin edition of      1720 and collated with the texts of faulkner 1735 and      miscellanies of same date       t s     a  proposal  for the universal use  of irish manufacture  in  cloaths and furniture of houses c  utterly  rejecting and renouncing  every thing wearable that comes from  england                                       dublin printed and sold by e waters in essexstreet at the corner of sycamorealley 1720     a proposal for the universal use of irish manufacture in clothes and furniture of houses c  utterly rejecting and renouncing every thing wearable that comes from england   it is the peculiar felicity and prudence of the people in this kingdom that whatever commodities or productions lie under the greatest discouragements from england those are what we are sure to be most industrious in cultivating and spreading agriculture which hath been the principal care of all wise nations and for the encouragement whereof there are so many statute laws in england we countenance so well that the landlords are everywhere by penal clauses absolutely prohibiting their tenants from ploughing not satisfied to confine them within certain limitations as it is the practice of the english one effect of which is already seen in the prodigious dearness of corn and the importation of it from london as the cheaper market6 and because people are the riches of a country and that our neighbours have done and are doing all that in them lie to make our wool a drug to us and a monopoly to them therefore the politic gentlemen of ireland have depopulated vast tracts of the best land for the feeding of sheep7  i could fill a volume as large as the history of the wise men of gotham with a catalogue only of some wonderful laws and customs we have observed within thirty years past8 tis true indeed our beneficial traffic of wool with france hath been our only support for several years past furnishing us all the little money we have to pay our rents and go to market but our merchants assure me this trade hath received a great damp by the present fluctuating condition of the coin in france and that most of their wine is paid for in specie without carrying thither any commodity from hence  however since we are so universally bent upon enlarging our flocks it may be worth enquiring what we shall do with our wool in case barnstaple9 should be overstocked and our french commerce should fail  i could wish the parliament had thought fit to have suspended their regulation of church matters and enlargements of the prerogative till a more convenient time because they did not appear very pressing at least to the persons principally concerned and instead of these great refinements in politics and divinity had amused themselves and their committees a little with the state of the nation for example what if the house of commons had thought fit to make a resolution nemine contradicente against wearing any cloth or stuff in their families which were not of the growth and manufacture of this kingdom what if they had extended it so far as utterly to exclude all silks velvets calicoes and the whole lexicon of female fopperies and declared that whoever acted otherwise should be deemed and reputed an enemy to the nation10 what if they had sent up such a resolution to be agreed to by the house of lords and by their own practice and encouragement spread the execution of it in their several countries what if we should agree to make burying in woollen a fashion as our neighbours have made it a law what if the ladies would be content with irish stuffs for the furniture of their houses for gowns and petticoats to themselves and their daughters upon the whole and to crown all the rest let a firm resolution be taken by male and female never to appear with one single shred that comes from england and let all the people say amen  i hope and believe nothing could please his majesty better than to hear that his loyal subjects of both sexes in this kingdom celebrated his birthday now approaching universally clad in their own manufacture is there virtue enough left in this deluded people to save them from the brink of ruin if the mens opinions may be taken the ladies will look as handsome in stuffs as brocades and since all will be equal there may be room enough to employ their wit and fancy in choosing and matching of patterns and colours i heard the late archbishop of tuam mention a pleasant observation of somebodys that ireland would never be happy till a law were made for burning everything that came from england except their people and their coals nor am i even yet for lessening the number of those exceptions11       non tanti mitra est non tanti judicis ostrum  but i should rejoice to see a staylace from england be thought scandalous and become a topic for censure at visits and teatables  if the unthinking shopkeepers in this town had not been utterly destitute of common sense they would have made some proposal to the parliament with a petition to the purpose i have mentioned promising to improve the cloths and stuffs of the nation into all possible degrees of fineness and colours and engaging not to play the knave according to their custom by exacting and imposing upon the nobility and gentry either as to the prices or the goodness for i remember in london upon a general mourning the rascally mercers and woollendrapers would in fourandtwenty hours raise their cloths and silks to above a double price and if the mourning continued long then come whining with petitions to the court that they were ready to starve and their fineries lay upon their hands  i could wish our shopkeepers would immediately think on this proposal addressing it to all persons of quality and others but first be sure to get somebody who can write sense to put it into form  i think it needless to exhort the clergy to follow this good example because in a little time those among them who are so unfortunate to have had their birth and education in this country will think themselves abundantly happy when they can afford irish crape and an athlone hat and as to the others i shall not presume to direct them i have indeed seen the present archbishop of dublin clad from head to foot in our own manufacture and yet under the rose be it spoken his grace deserves as good a gown as any prelate in christendom12  i have not courage enough to offer one syllable on this subject to their honours of the army neither have i sufficiently considered the great importance of scarlet and gold lace  the fable in ovid of arachne and pallas is to this purpose the goddess had heard of one arachne a young virgin very famous for spinning and weaving they both met upon a trial of skill and pallas finding herself almost equalled in her own art stung with rage and envy knocked her rival down turned her into a spider enjoining her to spin and weave for ever out of her own bowels and in a very narrow compass i confess that from a boy i always pitied poor arachne and could never heartily love the goddess on account of so cruel and unjust a sentence which however is fully executed upon us by england with further additions of rigour and severity for the greatest part of our bowels and vitals are extracted without allowing us the liberty of spinning and weaving them  the scripture tells us that oppression makes a wise man mad therefore consequently speaking the reason why some men are not mad is because they are not wise however it were to be wished that oppression would in time teach a little wisdom to fools  i was much delighted with a person who hath a great estate in this kingdom upon his complaints to me how grievously poor england suffers by impositions from ireland that we convey our own wool to france in spite of all the harpies at the customhouse that mr shuttleworth and others on the cheshire coasts are such fools to sell us their bark at a good price for tanning our own hides into leather with other enormities of the like weight and kind to which i will venture to add some more that the mayoralty of this city is always executed by an inhabitant and often by a native which might as well be done by a deputy with a moderate salary whereby poor england lose at least one thousand pounds a year upon the balance that the governing of this kingdom costs the lord lieutenant two thousand four hundred pounds a year13 so much net loss to poor england that the people of ireland presume to dig for coals in their own grounds and the farmers in the county of wicklow send their turf to the very market of dublin to the great discouragement of the coal trade at mostyn and whitehaven that the revenues of the postoffice here so righteously belonging to the english treasury as arising chiefly from our own commerce with each other should be remitted to london clogged with that grievous burthen of exchange and the pensions paid out of the irish revenues to english favourites should lie under the same disadvantage to the great loss of the grantees when a divine is sent over to a bishopric here with the hopes of fiveandtwenty hundred pounds a year upon his arrival he finds alas a dreadful discount of ten or twelve per cent a judge or a commissioner of the revenue has the same cause of complaintlastly  the ballad upon cotter is vehemently suspected to be irish manufacture and yet is allowed to be sung in our open streets under the very nose of the government14 these are a few among the many hardships we put upon that poor kingdom of england for which i am confident every honest man wishes a remedy and i hear there is a project on foot for transporting our best wheaten straw by sea and land carriage to dunstable and obliging us by a law to take off yearly so many ton of straw hats for the use of our women which will be a great encouragement to the manufacture of that industrious town  i should be glad to learn among the divines whether a law to bind men without their own consent be obligatory in foro conscientiae because i find scripture sanderson and suarez are wholly silent in the matter the oracle of reason the great law of nature and general opinion of civilians wherever they treat of limited governments are indeed decisive enough  it is wonderful to observe the bias among our people in favour of things persons and wares of all kinds that come from england the printer tells his hawkers that he has got an excellent new song just brought from london i have somewhat of a tendency that way myself and upon hearing a coxcomb from thence displaying himself with great volubility upon the park the playhouse the opera the gaming ordinaries it was apt to beget in me a kind of veneration for his parts and accomplishments tis not many years since i remember a person who by his style and literature seems to have been corrector of a hedgepress in some blind alley about little britain proceed gradually to be an author at least a translator of a lower rate though somewhat of a larger bulk than any that now flourishes in grub street and upon the strength of this foundation come over here erect himself up into an orator and politician and lead a kingdom after him15 this i am told was the very motive that prevailed on the author of a play called love in a hollow tree to do us the honour of a visit presuming with very good reason that he was a writer of a superior class16 i know another who for thirty years past hath been the common standard of stupidity in england where he was never heard a minute in any assembly or by any party with common christian treatment yet upon his arrival hither could put on a face of importance and authority talked more than six without either gracefulness propriety or meaning and at the same time be admired and followed as the pattern of eloquence and wisdom  nothing hath humbled me so much or shewn a greater disposition to a contemptuous treatment of ireland in some chief governors17 than that high style of several speeches from the throne delivered as usual after the royal assent in some periods of the two last reigns such high exaggerations of the prodigious condescensions in the prince to pass those good laws would have but an odd sound at westminster neither do i apprehend how any good law can pass wherein the kings interest is not as much concerned as that of the people i remember after a speech on the like occasion delivered by my lord wharton i think it was his last he desired mr addison to ask my opinion of it my answer was that his excellency had very honestly forfeited his head on account of one paragraph wherein he asserted by plain consequence a dispensing power in the queen his lordship owned it was true but swore the words were put into his mouth by direct orders from court from whence it is clear that some ministers in those times were apt from their high elevation to look down upon this kingdom as if it had been one of their colonies of outcasts in america and i observed a little of the same turn of spirit in some great men from whom i expected better although to do them justice it proved no point of difficulty to make them correct their idea whereof the whole nation quickly found the benefitbut that is forgotten how the style hath since run i am wholly a stranger having never seen a speech since the last of the queen  i would now expostulate a little with our country landlords who by unmeasurable screwing and racking their tenants all over the kingdom have already reduced the miserable people to a worse condition than the peasants in france or the vassals in germany and poland so that the whole species of what we call substantial farmers will in a very few years be utterly at an end18 it was pleasant to observe these gentlemen labouring with all their might for preventing the bishops from letting their revenues at a moderate half value whereby the whole order would in an age have been reduced to manifest beggary at the very instant when they were everywhere canting their own lands upon short leases and sacrificing their oldest tenants for a penny an acre advance19 i know not how it comes to pass and yet perhaps i know well enough that slaves have a natural disposition to be tyrants and that when my betters give me a kick i am apt to revenge it with six upon my footman although perhaps he may be an honest and diligent fellow i have heard great divines affirm that nothing is so likely to call down an universal judgment from heaven upon a nation as universal oppression and whether this be not already verified in part their worships the landlords are now at full leisure to consider whoever travels this country and observes the face of nature or the faces and habits and dwellings of the natives will hardly think himself in a land where either law religion or common humanity is professed20  i cannot forbear saying one word upon a thing they call a bank which i hear is projecting in this town21 i never saw the proposals nor understand any one particular of their scheme what i wish for at present is only a sufficient provision of hemp and caps and bells to distribute according to the several degrees of honesty and prudence in some persons i hear only of a monstrous sum already named and if others do not soon hear of it too and hear of it with a vengeance then am i a gentleman of less sagacity than myself and very few besides take me to be and the jest will be still the better if it be true as judicious persons have assured me that one half of this money will be real and the other half only gasconnade22 the matter will be likewise much mended if the merchants continue to carry off our gold and our goldsmiths to melt down our heavy silver     an essay  on  english bubbles  by thomas hope esq          note        the excitement and even fury which were prevalent in england and      france during the years 1719 and 1720 over laws south sea schemes      afforded swift an opportunity for the play of his satire by way of      criticism on projects which appeared to him to be of the same      character news from france on the mississippi scheme which in      1719 was at the height of its stockjobbing success gave glorious      accounts of fortunes made in a night and of thousands who had      become rich and were living in unheard of luxury schemes were      floated on every possible kind of ventures and so plentiful was      the paper money that nothing was too absurd for speculators all      these schemes which soon came to nought went later by the name      of bubbles and this essay of swifts touches the matter with his      usual satire       the time chosen for the proposal for the establishment of a      national bank in ireland was not a happy one it was made in 1720      when the bubbles had burst and found thousands ruined and      pauperized swift always an enemy to schemes of any kind classed      that of the bank with the rest of the bubbles and although the      plan itself was a real effort to relieve ireland and might have      effected its purpose the terror of the bubbles was sufficient to      wreck it       it required very little from swift to insure its rejection and      rejected it was by the irish legislature before whose      consideration it was brought                                            some doubt seems to obtain as to the authenticity of this essay on      english bubbles which in the words of sir walter scott may be      considered as introductory to the other tracts on the bank      project this essay however appears in the edition of 1720 of      the swearers bank and although it is not included in the      miscellanies of 1722 it is accepted by faulkner in his collected      edition of swifts works the present text is based on that      prefixed to the edition of the swearers bank 1720       t s     an essay on english bubbles  by thomas hope esq       to the right reverend right honourable and right worshipful and      to the reverend honourable and worshipful c company of      stockjobbers whether honest or dishonest pious or impious wise      or otherwise male or female young or old one with another who      have suffered depredation by the late bubbles greeting   having received the following scheme from dublin i give you the earliest notice how you may retrieve the decus et tutamen23 which you have sacrificed by permits in bubbles this project is founded on a parliamentary security besides the devil is in it if it can fail since a dignitary of the church24 is at the head ont therefore you who have subscribed to the stocking insurance and are out at the heels may soon appear tight about the legs you who encouraged the hemp manufacture may leave the halter to rogues and prevent the odium of felo de se medicinal virtues are here to be had without the expense and hazard of a dispensary you may sleep without dreaming of bottles at your tail and a lookingglass shall not affright you and since the glass bubble proved as brittle as its ware and broke together with itself the hopes of its proprietors they may make themselves whole by subscribing to our new fund  here indeed may be made three very grave objections by incredulous interested priests ambitious citizens and scrupulous statesmen the stocking manufactory gentlemen dont know how swearing can bring em to any probability of covering their legs anew unless it be by the means of a pair of stocks that the hempsnared men apprehend that such an encouragement for oaths can tend to no other advancement promotion and exaltation of their persons than that of the gallows the late old ordinary paul25 having grown grey in the habit of making this accurate observation in every months sessionpaper that swearing had as great a hand in the suspension of every living soul under his cure as sabbathbreaking itself and that the glassbubblemen cannot for their lives with the best pair of spectacles that is the only thing left neat and whole out of all their wares see how they shall make anything out of this his oathproject supposing he should even confirm by one its goodness an oath being as they say as brittle as glass and only made to be broken  but those incredulous priests shall not go without an answer that will i am sure induce them to place a great confidence in the benefit arising from christians who damn themselves every hour of the day for while they speak of the vainness and fickleness of oaths as an objection against our project they little consider that this fickleness and vainness is the common practice among all the people of this sublunary world and that consequently instead of being an objection against the project is a concluding argument of the constancy and solidity of their sure gain by it a neverfailing argument as he tells us among the brethren of his cloth  the ambitious citizens who from being plunged deep in the wealthy whirlpool of the southsea are in hopes of rising to such seats of fortune and dignity as would best suit with their mounting and aspiring hopes may imagine that this new fund in the sister nation may prove a rival to theirs and by drawing off a multitude of subscribers will if it makes a flood in ireland cause an ebb in england but it may be answered that though our author avers that this fund will vie with the southsea yet it will not clash with it on the contrary the subscribers to this must wish the increase of the southsea so far from being its rival because the multitude of people raised by it who were plainspeakers as they were plaindealers before must learn to swear in order to become their clothes and to be gentlemen à la mode while those that are ruined i mean jobd by it will dismiss the patience of their old pattern swear at their condition and curse their maker in their distress and so the increase of that english fund will be demonstratively an ample augmentation of the irish one so far will it be from being rivalled by it so that each of them may subscribe to a fund they have their own security for augmenting  the scrupulous statesmen for we know that statesmen are usually very scrupulous may object against having this project secured by votes in parliament by reason as they may deem it in their great wisdom an impious project and that therefore so illustrious an assembly as the irish parliament ought by no means according to the opinion of a christian statesman to be concerned in supporting an impious thing in the world the way that some may take to prove it impious is because it will tend highly to the interest of swearingbut this i take to be plain downright sophistry and playing upon words if this be called the swearing project or the oathact the increase of swearing will be very much for the benefit and interest of swearing ie to the subscribers in the fund to be raised by this fruitful swearingact if it should be so called but not to the swearers themselves who are to pay for it so that it will be according to this distinction piously indeed an act for a benefit to mankind from swearing not impiously a benefit in swearing so that i think that argument entirely answered and defeated far be it from the dean to have entered into so unchristian a project as this had been so considered but then these politicians being generally as the world knows mighty tender of conscience may raise these new doubts fears and scruples viz that it will however cause the subscribers to wish in their minds for many oaths to fly about which is a heinous crime and to lay stratagems to try the patience of men of all sorts to put them upon the swearing strain in order to bring grist to their own mill which is a crime still more enormous and that therefore for fear of these evil consequences the passing of such an act is not consistent with the really extraordinary and tender conscience of a true modern politician but in answer to this i think i can plead the strongest plea in nature and that is called precedent i think which i take thus from the southsea one man by the very nature of that subscription must naturally pray for the temporal damnation of another man in his fortune in order for gaining his own salvation in it yea even though he knows the other mans temporal damnation would be the cause of his eternal by his swearing and despairing neither do i think this in casuistry and sin because the swearing undone man is a free agent and can choose whether he will swear or no anybodys wishes whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding and in politics i am sure it is even a machiavellian holy maxim that some men should be ruined for the good of others thus i think i have answered all the objections that can be brought against this projects coming to perfection and proved it to be convenient for the state of interest to the protestant church and consonant with christianity nay with the very scruples of modern squeamish statesmen  to conclude the laudable author of this project squares the measures of it so much according to the scripture rule it may reasonably be presumed that all good christians in england will come as fast into the subscriptions for his encouragement as they have already done throughout the kingdom of ireland for what greater proof could this author give of his christianity than for bringing about this swearingact charitably to part with his coat and sit starving in a very thin waistcoat in his garret to do the corporal virtues of feeding and clothing the poor and raising them from the cottage to the palace by punishing the vices of the rich what more could have been done even in the primitive times                                                   thomas hope    from my house in st faiths parish       london august 10 1720  psfor the benefit of the author application may be made to me at the tiltyard coffeehouse whitehall     the swearers bank          note        the plan for the establishment of a national bank in dublin was      first put forward in 1720 in the form of a petition presented to      the king by the earl of abercorn viscount boyne sir ralph gore      and others it was proposed to raise a fund of £500000 for the      purpose of loaning money to merchants at a comparatively low rate      of interest the king approved of the petition and directed that a      charter of incorporation for such a bank should pass the great seal      of ireland when the matter came up for discussion in the irish      houses of legislature both the lords and commons rejected the      proposal on the ground that no safe foundation for such an      establishment could be found see note post       during and after the discussion on this project in the legislature      a pamphlet controversy arose in which two able writers      distinguished themselvesmr henry maxwell and mr hercules      rowley the former was in favour of the bank while mr rowley was      against it       mr maxwell argued soundly from the ground on which all banking      institutions were founded mr rowley however pointed out that      the condition of ireland dependent as that country was on      englands whims and interfered with as she always had been by      english selfishness in her commercial and industrial enterprises      would not be bettered were the bank to prove even a great success      for should the bank be found in any way to touch the trade of      england it might be taken for granted that its charter would be      repealed and ireland find itself in a worse state than it was      before       the pamphlets written by these gentlemen bear the following titles           1 reasons offerd for erecting a bank in ireland in a letter to          hercules rowley esq by henry maxwell esq        dublin 1721           2 an answer to a book intitled reasons offered for erecting a          bank in ireland in a letter to henry maxwell esq by hercules          rowley esq dublin 1721           3 mr maxwells second letter to mr rowley wherein the          objections against the bank are answered            dublin 1721           4 an answer to mr maxwells second letter to mr rowley          concerning the bank by hercules rowley esq        dublin 1721                                            sir walter scott in his edition of swifts works reprints these      pamphlets the text of the present edition of the swearers bank      is based on that published in london in 1720       t s     the  swearersbank  or  parliamentary security  for  establishing a new bank  in  ireland  wherein  the medicinal use of oaths is considered  with  the best in christendom a tale                                       written by dean swift                                       si populus vult decipi decipiatur                                       to which is prefixed  an essay upon english bubbles  by thomas hope esq                                       dublin  printed by thomas hume next door to the walshshead in smockalley 1720 reprinted at london by j roberts in warwicklane     the swearers bank   to believe everything that is said by a certain set of men and to doubt of nothing they relate though ever so improbable is a maxim that has contributed as much for the time to the support of irish banks as it ever did to the popish religion and they are not only beholden to the latter for their foundation but they have the happiness to have the same patron saint for ignorance the reputed mother of the devotion of the one seems to bear the same affectionate relation to the credit of the other  to subscribe to banks without knowing the scheme or design of them is not unlike to some gentlemens signing addresses without knowing the contents of them to engage in a bank that has neither act of parliament charter nor lands to support it is like sending a ship to sea without bottom to expect a coach and six by the former would be as ridiculous as to hope a return by the latter  it was well known some time ago that our banks would be included in the bubblebill and it was believed those chimeras would necessarily vanish with the first easterly wind that should inform the town of the royal assent  it was very mortifying to several gentlemen who dreamed of nothing but easy chariots on the arrival of the fatal packet to slip out of them into their walking shoes but should those banks as it is vainly imagined be so fortunate as to obtain a charter and purchase lands yet on any run on them in a time of invasion there would be so many starving proprietors reviving their old pretensions to land and a bellyful that the subscribers would be unwilling upon any call to part with their money not knowing what might happen so that in a rebellion where the success was doubtful the bank would infallibly break26  since so many gentlemen of this town have had the courage without any security to appear in the same paper with a million or two it is hoped when they are made sensible of their safety that they will be prevailed to trust themselves in a neat skin of parchment with a single one  to encourage them the undertaker proposes the erecting a bank on parliamentary security and such security as no revolution or change of times can affect  to take away all jealousy of any private view of the undertaker he assures the world that he is now in a garret in a very thin waistcoat studying the public good having given an undeniable pledge of his love to his country by pawning his coat in order to defray the expense of the press  it is very well known that by an act of parliament to prevent profane swearing the person so offending on oath made before a magistrate forfeits a shilling which may be levied with little difficulty  it is almost unnecessary to mention that this is become a petvice among us and though age renders us unfit for other vices yet this where it takes hold never leaves us but with our speech  so vast a revenue might be raised by the execution of this act that i have often wondered in such a scarcity of funds that methods have not been taken to make it serviceable to the public  i dare venture to say if this act was well executed in england the revenue of it applied to the navy would make the english fleet a terror to all europe  it is computed by geographers that there are two millions in this kingdom of ireland of which number there may be said to be a million of swearing souls  it is thought there may be five thousand gentlemen every gentleman taking one with another may afford to swear an oath every day which will yearly produce one million eight hundred twentyfive thousand oaths which number of shillings makes the yearly sum of ninetyone thousand two hundred and fifty pounds  the farmers of this kingdom who are computed to be ten thousand are able to spend yearly five hundred thousand oaths which gives twentyfive thousand pounds and it is conjectured that from the bulk of the people twenty or fiveandtwenty thousand pounds may be yearly collected  these computations are very modest since it is evident that there is a much greater consumption of oaths in this kingdom and consequently a much greater sum might be yearly raised  that it may be collected with ease and regularity it is proposed to settle informers in great towns in proportion to the number of inhabitants and to have ridingofficers in the country and since nothing brings a greater contempt on any profession than poverty it is determined to settle very handsome salaries on the gentlemen that are employed by the bank that they may by a generosity of living reconcile men to an office that has lain under so much scandal of late as to be undertaken by none but curates clerks of meetinghouses and broken tradesmen  it is resolved that none shall be preferred to those employments but persons that are notorious for being constant churchmen and frequent communicants whose piety will be a sufficient security for their honest and industrious execution of their office  it is very probable that twenty thousand pounds will be necessary to defray all expenses of servants salaries c however there will be the clear yearly sum of one hundred thousand pounds which may very justly claim a million subscription  it is determined to lay out the remaining unapplied profits which will be very considerable towards the erecting and maintaining charity schools a design so beneficial to the public and especially to the protestant interest of this kingdom has met with so much encouragement from several great patriots in england that they have engaged to procure an act to secure the sole benefit of informing on this swearing act to the agents and servants of this new bank several of my friends pretend to demonstrate that this bank will in time vie with the south sea company they insist that the army dispend as many oaths yearly as will produce one hundred thousand pounds net  there are computed to be one hundred pretty fellows in this town that swear fifty oaths a head daily some of them would think it hard to be stinted to an hundred this very branch would produce a vast sum yearly  the fairs of this kingdom will bring in a vast revenue the oaths of a little connaught one as well as they could be numbered by two persons amounted to three thousand it is true that it would be impossible to turn all of them into ready money for a shilling is so great a duty on swearing that if it was carefully exacted the common people might as well pretend to drink wine as to swear and an oath would be as rare among them as a clean shirt  a servant that i employed to accompany the militia their last muster day had scored down in the compass of eight hours three hundred oaths but as the putting the act in execution on those days would only fill the stocks with porters and pawnshops with muskets and swords and as it would be matter of great joy to papists and disaffected persons to see our militia swear themselves out of their guns and swords it is resolved that no advantage shall be taken of any militiamans swearing while he is under arms nor shall any advantage be taken of any mans swearing in the four courts provided he is at hearing in the exchequer or has just paid off an attorneys bill  the medicinal use of oaths is what the undertaker would by no means discourage especially where it is necessary to help the lungs to throw off any distilling humour on certificate of a course of swearing prescribed by any physician a permit will be given to the patient by the proper officer of the bank paying no more but sixpence it is expected that a scheme of so much advantage to the public will meet with more encouragement than their chimerical banks and the undertaker hopes that as he has spent a considerable fortune in bringing this scheme to bear he may have the satisfaction to see it take place for the public good though he should have the fate of most projectors to be undone  it is resolved that no compositions shall be made nor licences granted for swearing under a notion of applying the money to pious uses a practice so scandalous as is fit only for the see of rome where the money arising from whoring licences is applied ad propagandam fidem and to the shame of smockalley and of all protestant whores especially those who live under the light of the gospelministry be it spoken a whore in rome never lies down but she hopes it will be the means of converting some poor heathen or heretic  the swearing revenues of the town of cork will be given for ever by the bank to the support of poor clergymens widows and those of ringsend will be allowed to the maintenance of sailors bastards  the undertaker designs in a few days to appoint time and place for taking subscriptions the subscribers must come prepared to pay down one fourth on subscribing   postscript  the jews of rotterdam have offered to farm the revenues of dublin at twenty thousand pounds per ann several eminent quakers are also willing to take them at that rent but the undertaker has rejected their proposals being resolved to deal with none but christians  application may be made to him about them any day at pats coffeehouse where attendance will be given     a letter  to the  king at arms  from a reputed esquire27 one of the subscribers to the bank     november 18 1721  sir  in a late printed paper28 containing some notes and queries upon that list of the subscribers names which was published by order of the commissioners for receiving of subscriptions i find some hints and innuendoes that would seem to insinuate as if i and some others were only reputed esquires and our case is referred to you in your kingly capacity i desire you will please to let me know the lowest price of a real esquires coat of arms and if we can agree i will give my bond to pay you out of the first interest i receive for my subscription because things are a little low with me at present by throwing my whole fortune into the bank having subscribed for five hundred pounds sterling  i hope you will not question my pretensions to this title when i let you know that my godfather was a justice of peace and i myself have been often a keeper of it my father was a leader and commander of horse in which post he rode before the greatest lords of the land29 and in long marches he alone presided over the baggage advancing directly before it my mother kept open house in dublin where several hundreds were supported with meat and drink bought at her own charge or with her personal credit until some envious brewers and butchers forced her to retire30  as to myself i have been for several years a footofficer and it was my charge to guard the carriages behind which i was commanded to stick close that they might not be attacked in the rear i have had the honour to be a favourite of several fine ladies who each of them at different times gave me such coloured knots and public marks of distinction that every one knew which of them it was to whom i paid my address they would not go into their coach without me nor willingly drink unless i gave them the glass with my own hand they allowed me to call them my mistresses and owned that title publicly i have been told that the true ancient employment of a squire was to carry a knights shield painted with his colours and coat of arms this is what i have witnesses to produce that i have often done not indeed in a shield like my predecessors but that which is full as good i have carried the colours of a knight upon my coat31 i have likewise borne the kings arms in my hand as a mark of authority32 and hung them painted before my dwellinghouse as a mark of my calling33 so that i may truly say his majestys arms have been my supporters i have been a strict and constant follower of men of quality i have diligently pursued the steps of several squires and am able to behave myself as well as the best of them whenever there shall be occasion  i desire it may be no disadvantage to me that by the new act of parliament going to pass for preserving the game i am not yet qualified to keep a greyhound if this should be the test of squirehood it will go hard with a great number of my fraternity as well as myself who must all be unsquired because a greyhound will not be allowed to keep us company and it is well known i have been a companion to his betters what has a greyhound to do with a squireship might i not be a real squire although there was no such thing as a greyhound in the world pray tell me sir are greyhounds to be from henceforth the supporters of every squires coat of arms although i cannot keep a greyhound may not a greyhound help to keep me may not i have an order from the governors of the bank to keep a greyhound with a non obstante to the act of parliament as well as they have created a bank against the votes of the two houses but however this difficulty will soon be overcome i am promised 125l a year for subscribing 500l and of this 500l i am to pay in only 25l ready money the governors will trust me for the rest and pay themselves out of the interest by 25l per cent so that i intend to receive only 40l ayear to qualify me for keeping my family and a greyhound and let the remaining 85l go on till it makes 500l then 1000l then 10000l then 100000l then a million and so forwards this i think is much better betwixt you and me than keeping fairs and buying and selling bullocks by which i find from experience that little is to be gotten in these hard times i am                             sir                             your friend and                                 servant to command                                          a b esquire  postscript i hope you will favourably represent my case to the publisher of the paper abovementioned  direct your letter for a b esquire at  in  and pray get some parliamentman to frank it for it will cost a groat postage to this place     the  last speech and dying words  of  ebenezer elliston  who was executed the second day of may 1722  published at his desire for the common good        n b about the time that this speech was written the town was      much pestered with streetrobbers who in a barbarous manner would      seize on gentlemen and take them into remote corners and after      they had robbed them would leave them bound and gagged it is      remarkable that this speech had so good an effect that there have      been very few robberies of that kind committed since34          note        burke spoke of swifts tracts of a public nature relating to      ireland as those in which the dean appears in the best light      because they do honour to his heart as well as his head furnishing      some additional proofs that though he was very free in his abuse      of the inhabitants of that country as well natives as foreigners      he had their interest sincerely at heart and perfectly understood      it       the following tract on the last words and dying speech of ebenezer      elliston admirably illustrates burkes remark       the city of dublin at the time swift wrote was on a par with some      of the lower districts of new york city about twenty years ago      which were dangerous in the extreme to traverse after dark robbers      in gangs would waylay pedestrians and leave them often badly      maltreated and maimed these thieves and roughs became so      impudent and brazen in their business that the condition of the      city was a disgrace to the municipal government to put down the      nuisance swift took a characteristic method ebenezer elliston had      about this time been executed for street robbery although given a      good education by his parents he forsook his trade of a silk      weaver and became a gambler and burglar he was well known to the      other gangs which infested dublin but his death did not act as a      deterrent swift in composing ellistons pretended dying speech      gave it the flavour and character of authenticity in order to      impose on the members of other gangs and so successful was he in      his intention that the speech was accepted as the real expression      of their late companion by the rest and had a most salutary effect      scott says it was received as genuine by the banditti who had been      companions of his depredations who were the more easily persuaded      of its authenticity as it contained none of the cant usual in the      dying speeches composed for malefactors by the ordinary or the      balladmakers the threat which it held out of a list deposited      with a secure hand containing their names crimes and place of      rendezvous operated for a long time in preventing a repetition of      their villanies which had previously been so common                                            the text of the present edition is based on that given by faulkner      in the fourth volume of his edition of swift printed in dublin in      1735       t s     the last speech and dying words of ebenezer elliston   i am now going to suffer the just punishment for my crimes prescribed by the law of god and my country i know it is the constant custom that those who come to this place should have speeches made for them and cried about in their own hearing as they are carried to execution and truly they are such speeches that although our fraternity be an ignorant illiterate people they would make a man ashamed to have such nonsense and false english charged upon him even when he is going to the gallows they contain a pretended account of our birth and family of the fact for which we are to die of our sincere repentance and a declaration of our religion35 i cannot expect to avoid the same treatment with my predecessors however having had an education one or two degrees better than those of my rank and profession36 i have been considering ever since my commitment what it might be proper for me to deliver upon this occasion  and first i cannot say from the bottom of my heart that i am truly sorry for the offence i have given to god and the world but i am very much so for the bad success of my villainies in bringing me to this untimely end for it is plainly evident that after having some time ago obtained a pardon from the crown i again took up my old trade my evil habits were so rooted in me and i was grown so unfit for any other kind of employment and therefore although in compliance with my friends i resolve to go to the gallows after the usual manner kneeling with a book in my hand and my eyes lift up yet i shall feel no more devotion in my heart than i have observed in some of my comrades who have been drunk among common whores the very night before their execution i can say further from my own knowledge that two of my fraternity after they had been hanged and wonderfully came to life and made their escapes as it sometimes happens proved afterwards the wickedest rogues i ever knew and so continued until they were hanged again for good and all and yet they had the impudence at both times they went to the gallows to smite their breasts and lift up their eyes to heaven all the way  secondly from the knowledge i have of my own wicked dispositions and that of my comrades i give it as my opinion that nothing can be more unfortunate to the public than the mercy of the government in ever pardoning or transporting us unless when we betray one another as we never fail to do if we are sure to be well paid and then a pardon may do good by the same rule that it is better to have but one fox in a farm than three or four but we generally make a shift to return after being transported and are ten times greater rogues than before and much more cunning besides i know it by experience that some hopes we have of finding mercy when we are tried or after we are condemned is always a great encouragement to us  thirdly nothing is more dangerous to idle young fellows than the company of those odious common whores we frequent and of which this town is full these wretches put us upon all mischief to feed their lusts and extravagancies they are ten times more bloody and cruel than men their advice is always not to spare if we are pursued they get drunk with us and are common to us all and yet if they can get anything by it are sure to be our betrayers  now as i am a dying man i have done something which may be of good use to the public i have left with an honest man and indeed the only honest man i was ever acquainted with the names of all my wicked brethren the present places of their abode with a short account of the chief crimes they have committed in many of which i have been their accomplice and heard the rest from their own mouths i have likewise set down the names of those we call our setters of the wicked houses we frequent and of those who receive and buy our stolen goods i have solemnly charged this honest man and have received his promise upon oath that whenever he hears of any rogue to be tried for robbing or housebreaking he will look into his list and if he finds the name there of the thief concerned to send the whole paper to the government of this i here give my companions fair and public warning and hope they will take it  in the paper above mentioned which i left with my friend i have also set down the names of several gentlemen who have been robbed in dublin streets for three years past i have told the circumstances of those robberies and shewn plainly that nothing but the want of common courage was the cause of their misfortunes i have therefore desired my friend that whenever any gentlemen happens to be robbed in the streets he will get that relation printed and published with the first letters of those gentlemens names who by their own want of bravery are likely to be the cause of all the mischief of that kind which may happen for the future  i cannot leave the world without a short description of that kind of life which i have led for some years past and is exactly the same with the rest of our wicked brethren  although we are generally so corrupted from our childhood as to have no sense of goodness yet something heavy always hangs about us i know not what it is that we are never easy till we are half drunk among our whores and companions nor sleep sound unless we drink longer than we can stand if we go abroad in the day a wise man would easily find us to be rogues by our faces we have such a suspicious fearful and constrained countenance often turning back and slinking through narrow lanes and alleys i have never failed of knowing a brother thief by his looks though i never saw him before every man among us keeps his particular whore who is however common to us all when we have a mind to change when we have got a booty if it be in money we divide it equally among our companions and soon squander it away on our vices in those houses that receive us for the master and mistress and the very tapster go snacks and besides make us pay treble reckonings if our plunder be plate watches rings snuffboxes and the like we have customers in all quarters of the town to take them off i have seen a tankard worth fifteen pounds sold to a fellow in  street for twenty shillings and a gold watch for thirty i have set down his name and that of several others in the paper already mentioned we have setters watching in corners and by dead walls to give us notice when a gentleman goes by especially if he be anything in drink i believe in my conscience that if an account were made of a thousand pounds in stolen goods considering the low rates we sell them at the bribes we must give for concealment the extortions of alehousereckonings and other necessary charges there would not remain fifty pounds clear to be divided among the robbers and out of this we must find clothes for our whores besides treating them from morning to night who in requital reward us with nothing but treachery and the pox for when our money is gone they are every moment threatening to inform against us if we will not go out to look for more if anything in this world be like hell as i have heard it described by our clergy the truest picture of it must be in the backroom of one of our alehouses at midnight where a crew of robbers and their whores are met together after a booty and are beginning to grow drunk from which time until they are past their senses is such a continued horrible noise of cursing blasphemy lewdness scurrility and brutish behaviour such roaring and confusion such a clatter of mugs and pots at each others heads that bedlam in comparison is a sober and orderly place at last they all tumble from their stools and benches and sleep away the rest of the night and generally the landlord or his wife or some other whore who has a stronger head than the rest picks their pockets before they wake the misfortune is that we can never be easy till we are drunk and our drunkenness constantly exposes us to be more easily betrayed and taken  this is a short picture of the life i have led which is more miserable than that of the poorest labourer who works for four pence a day and yet custom is so strong that i am confident if i could make my escape at the foot of the gallows i should be following the same course this very evening so that upon the whole we ought to be looked upon as the common enemies of mankind whose interest it is to root us out likes wolves and other mischievous vermin against which no fair play is required  if i have done service to men in what i have said i shall hope i have done service to god and that will be better than a silly speech made for me full of whining and canting which i utterly despise and have never been used to yet such a one i expect to have my ears tormented with as i am passing along the streets  good people fare ye well bad as i am i leave many worse behind me i hope you shall see me die like a man the death of a dog                                                             e e     the truth  of some  maxims in state and government  examined  with reference to ireland          note        these maxims written in the year 1724 may be taken as swifts      opening of his campaign against the oppressive legislation of      england which had brought ireland to the degraded and      povertystricken condition it existed in at the time he wrote      burke characterizes these maxims as a collection of state      paradoxes abounding with great sense and penetration the      subjects they touch on are dealt with in greater detail in the      tracts which follow in this volume and the reader is referred to      them and the notes for the causes which had brought ireland in so      low a state                                            the text of the present edition is based on that given by deane      swift in the eighth volume of the edition of 1765       t s     maxims controlled37 in ireland   there are certain maxims of state founded upon long observation and experience drawn from the constant practice of the wisest nations and from the very principles of government nor ever controlled by any writer upon politics yet all these maxims do necessarily presuppose a kingdom or commonwealth to have the same natural rights common to the rest of mankind who have entered into civil society for if we could conceive a nation where each of the inhabitants had but one eye one leg and one hand it is plain that before you could institute them into a republic an allowance must be made for those material defects wherein they differed from other mortals or imagine a legislator forming a system for the government of bedlam and proceeding upon the maxim that man is a sociable animal should draw them out of their cells and form them into corporations or general assemblies the consequence might probably be that they would fall foul on each other or burn the house over their own heads  of the like nature are innumerable errors committed by crude and short thinkers who reason upon general topics without the least allowance for the most important circumstances which quite alter the nature of the case  this hath been the fate of those small dealers who are every day publishing their thoughts either on paper or in their assemblies for improving the trade of ireland and referring us to the practice and example of england holland france or other nations  i shall therefore examine certain maxims of government which generally pass for uncontrolled in the world and consider how far they will suit with the present condition of this kingdom  first it is affirmed by wise men that the dearness of things necessary for life in a fruitful country is a certain sign of wealth and great commerce for when such necessaries are dear it must absolutely follow that money is cheap and plentiful  but this is manifestly false in ireland for the following reason some years ago the species of money here did probably amount to six or seven hundred thousand pounds38 and i have good cause to believe that our remittances then did not much exceed the cash brought in to us but the prodigious discouragements we have since received in every branch of our trade by the frequent enforcements and rigorous execution of the navigationact39 the tyranny of under customhouse officers the yearly addition of absentees the payments to regiments abroad to civil and military officers residing in england the unexpected sudden demands of great sums from the treasury and some other drains of perhaps as great consequence40 we now see ourselves reduced to a state since we have no friends of being pitied by our enemies at least if our enemies were of such a kind as to be capable of any regard towards us except of hatred and contempt  forty years are now passed since the revolution when the contention of the british empire was most unfortunately for us and altogether against the usual course of such mighty changes in government decided in the least important nation but with such ravages and ruin executed on both sides as to leave the kingdom a desert which in some sort it still continues neither did the long rebellions in 1641 make half such a destruction of houses plantations and personal wealth in both kingdoms as two years campaigns did in ours by fighting englands battles  by slow degrees and by the gentle treatment we received under two auspicious reigns41 we grew able to live without running in debt our absentees were but few we had great indulgence in trade a considerable share in employments of church and state and while the short leases continued which were let some years after the war ended tenants paid their rents with ease and cheerfulness to the great regret of their landlords who had taken up a spirit of oppression that is not easily removed and although in these short leases the rent was gradually to increase after short periods yet as soon as the terms elapsed the land was let to the highest bidder most commonly without the least effectual clause for building or planting yet by many advantages which this island then possessed and hath since utterly lost the rents of lands still grew higher upon every lease that expired till they have arrived at the present exorbitance when the frog overswelling himself burst at last  with the price of land of necessity rose that of corn and cattle and all other commodities that farmers deal in hence likewise obviously the rates of all goods and manufactures among shopkeepers the wages of servants and hire of labourers but although our miseries came on fast with neither trade nor money left yet neither will the landlord abate in his rent nor can the tenant abate in the price of what that rent must be paid with nor any shopkeeper tradesman or labourer live at lower expense for food and clothing than he did before  i have been the larger upon this first head because the same observations will clear up and strengthen a good deal of what i shall affirm upon the rest  the second maxim of those who reason upon trade and government is to assert that low interest is a certain sign of great plenty of money in a nation for which as in many other articles they produce the examples of holland and england but with relation to ireland this maxim is likewise entirely false  there are two reasons for the lowness of interest in any country first that which is usually alleged the great plenty of species and this is obvious the second is the want of trade which seldom falls under common observation although it be equally true for where trade is altogether discouraged there are few borrowers in those countries where men can employ a large stock the young merchant whose fortune may be four or five hundred pounds will venture to borrow as much more and can afford a reasonable interest neither is it easy at this day to find many of those whose business reaches to employ even so inconsiderable a sum except among the importers of wine who as they have most part of the present trade in these parts of ireland in their hands so they are the most exorbitant exacting fraudulent dealers that ever trafficked in any nation and are making all possible speed to ruin both themselves and the nation  from this defect of gentlemens not knowing how to dispose of their ready money ariseth the high purchase of lands which in all other countries is reckoned a sign of wealth for the frugal squires who live below their incomes have no other way to dispose of their savings but by mortgage or purchase by which the rates of land must naturally increase and if this trade continues long under the uncertainty of rents the landed men of ready money will find it more for their advantage to send their cash to england and place it in the funds which i myself am determined to do the first considerable sum i shall be master of  it hath likewise been a maxim among politicians that the great increase of buildings in the metropolis argues a flourishing state but this i confess hath been controlled from the example of london where by the long and annual parliamentary session such a number of senators with their families friends adherents and expectants draw such prodigious numbers to that city that the old hospitable custom of lords and gentlemen living in their ancient seats among their tenants is almost lost in england is laughed out of doors insomuch that in the middle of summer a legal house of lords and commons might be brought in a few hours to london from their country villas within twelve miles round  the case in ireland is yet somewhat worse for the absentees of great estates who if they lived at home would have many rich retainers in their neighbourhoods have learned to rack their lands and shorten their leases as much as any residing squire and the few remaining of these latter having some vain hope of employments for themselves or their children and discouraged by the beggarliness and thievery of their own miserable farmers and cottagers or seduced by the vanity of their wives on pretence of their childrens education whereof the fruits are so apparent together with that most wonderful and yet more unaccountable zeal for a seat in their assembly though at some years purchase of their whole estates these and some other motives better let pass have drawn such a concourse to this beggarly city that the dealers of the several branches of building have found out all the commodious and inviting places for erecting new houses while fifteen hundred of the old ones which is a seventh part of the whole city are said to be left uninhabited and falling to ruin their method is the same with that which was first introduced by dr barebone at london who died a bankrupt42 the mason the bricklayer the carpenter the slater and the glazier take a lot of ground club to build one or more houses unite their credit their stock and their money and when their work is finished sell it to the best advantage they can but as it often happens and more every day that their fund will not answer half their design they are forced to undersell it at the first story and are all reduced to beggary insomuch that i know a certain fanatic brewer who is reported to have some hundreds of houses in this town is said to have purchased the greater part of them at half value from ruined undertakers hath intelligence of all new houses where the finishing is at a stand takes advantage of the builders distress and by the advantage of ready money gets fifty per cent at least for his bargain  it is another undisputed maxim in government that people are the riches of a nation which is so universally granted that it will be hardly pardonable to bring it in doubt and i will grant it to be so far true even in this island that if we had the african custom or privilege of selling our useless bodies for slaves to foreigners it would be the most useful branch of our trade by ridding us of a most unsupportable burthen and bringing us money in the stead but in our present situation at least five children in six who are born lie a dead weight upon us for want of employment and a very skilful computer assured me that above one half of the souls in this kingdom supported themselves by begging and thievery whereof two thirds would be able to get their bread in any other country upon earth43 trade is the only incitement to labour where that fails the poorer native must either beg steal or starve or be forced to quit his country this hath made me often wish for some years past that instead of discouraging our people from seeking foreign soil the public would rather pay for transporting all our unnecessary mortals whether papists or protestants to america as drawbacks are sometimes allowed for exporting commodities where a nation is overstocked i confess myself to be touched with a very sensible pleasure when i hear of a mortality in any country parish or village where the wretches are forced to pay for a filthy cabin and two ridges of potatoes treble the worth brought up to steal or beg for want of work to whom death would be the best thing to be wished for on account both of themselves and the public44  among all taxes imposed by the legislature those upon luxury are universally allowed to be the most equitable and beneficial to the subject and the commonest reasoner on government might fill a volume with arguments on the subject yet here again by the singular fate of ireland this maxim is utterly false and the putting it in practice may have such pernicious a consequence as i certainly believe the thoughts of the proposers were not able to reach  the miseries we suffer by our absentees are of a far more extensive nature than seems to be commonly understood i must vindicate myself to the reader so far as to declare solemnly that what i shall say of those lords and squires doth not arise from the least regard i have for their understandings their virtues or their persons for although i have not the honour of the least acquaintance with any one among them my ambition not soaring so high yet i am too good a witness of the situation they have been in for thirty years past the veneration paid them by the people the high esteem they are in among the prime nobility and gentry the particular marks of favour and distinction they receive from the court the weight and consequence of their interest added to their great zeal and application for preventing any hardships their country might suffer from england wisely considering that their own fortunes and honours were embarked in the same bottom     the  blunders deficiencies distresses  and misfortunes of quilca  proposed to contain one and twenty volumes in quarto  begun april 20 1724 to be continued weekly if due encouragement be given          note        swifts friends in ireland were not many he had no high opinion of      the people with whom he was compelled to live but among those who      displeased him least to use the phrase he employed in writing to      pope was a kindly and warmhearted scholar named sheridan      sheridan must have taken swifts fancy since they spent much time      together and wrote each other verses and nonsense rhymes he had      failed in his attempt to keep up a school in dublin and refused      the headmastership of the school of armagh which lord primate      lindsay had offered him through swifts efforts swift however      obtained for him from carteret one of the chaplaincies of the      lordlieutenant and a small living near cork unfortunately      sheridan was struck off from the list of chaplains on the      information of one richard tighe who reported that sheridan on the      anniversary of the accession of the house of hanover had preached      from the text sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof poor      sheridan had been totally unconscious of committing any      indiscretion but he could not deny the fact       it was at quilca a small county village near kells that sheridan      was accustomed to spend his vacations with his family at a small      house he owned there swift used often to use this house at      sheridans desire and spent many days there in quiet enjoyment      with mrs dingley and esther johnson the place and his life there      he has attempted to describe in the following piece but the      description may also stand as scott observes as no bad      supplement to swifts account of ireland                                            the text here given is based on that printed in the

and published towards the end of the year 1728      summarizes the disadvantages under which ireland suffered at the      time and reenforces the contention that these were mainly due to      englands jealousy and stupid indifference swift however does      not lose sight of the fact that the people of ireland also were      somewhat to blame though in a much less degree       in dublin where tracts of this nature had now become almost      commonplace and where official interference in their publication      had been found unwise and even dangerous the issue of the short      view was effected without any official comment in england      however where it was reprinted by mist the journalist it was      otherwise its publication brought down a prosecution on mist who      no doubt numbered this with the many others which were visited      upon him it is an important tract to which many historians of      ireland have often referred                                            the text of the present edition is based on that of the first      edition and compared with that given by sir walter scott       t s     a short view  of  the state of ireland   i am assured that it hath for some time been practised as a method of making mens court when they are asked about the rate of lands the abilities of tenants the state of trade and manufacture in this kingdom and how their rents are paid to answer that in their neighbourhood all things are in a flourishing condition the rent and purchase of land every day increasing and if a gentleman happens to be a little more sincere in his representations besides being looked on as not well affected he is sure to have a dozen contradictors at his elbow i think it is no manner of secret why these questions are so cordially asked or so obligingly answered  but since with regard to the affairs of this kingdom i have been using all endeavours to subdue my indignation to which indeed i am not provoked by any personal interest being not the owner of one spot of ground in the whole island i shall only enumerate by rules generally known and never contradicted what are the true causes of any countrys flourishing and growing rich and then examine what effects arise from those causes in the kingdom of ireland  the first cause of a kingdoms thriving is the fruitfulness of the soil to produce the necessaries and conveniences of life not only sufficient for the inhabitants but for exportation into other countries  the second is the industry of the people in working up all their native commodities to the last degree of manufacture  the third is the conveniency of safe ports and havens to carry out their own goods as much manufactured and bring in those of others as little manufactured as the nature of mutual commerce will allow  the fourth is that the natives should as much as possible export and import their goods in vessels of their own timber made in their own country  the fifth is the liberty of a free trade in all foreign countries which will permit them except those who are in war with their own prince or state  the sixth is by being governed only by laws made with their own consent for otherwise they are not a free people and therefore all appeals for justice or applications for favour or preferment to another country are so many grievous impoverishments  the seventh is by improvement of land encouragement of agriculture and thereby increasing the number of their people without which any country however blessed by nature must continue poor  the eighth is the residence of the princes or chief administrators of the civil power  the ninth is the concourse of foreigners for education curiosity or pleasure or as to a general mart of trade  the tenth is by disposing all offices of honour profit or trust only to the natives or at least with very few exceptions where strangers have long inhabited the country and are supposed to understand and regard the interest of it as their own  the eleventh is when the rents of lands and profits of employments are spent in the country which produced them and not in another the former of which will certainly happen where the love of our native country prevails  the twelfth is by the public revenues being all spent and employed at home except on the occasions of a foreign war  the thirteenth is where the people are not obliged unless they find it for their own interest or conveniency to receive any monies except of their own coinage by a public mint after the manner of all civilized nations  the fourteenth is a disposition of the people of a country to wear their own manufactures and import as few incitements to luxury either in clothes furniture food or drink as they possibly can live conveniently without  there are many other causes of a nations thriving which i cannot at present recollect but without advantage from at least some of these after turning my thoughts a long time i am not able to discover from whence our wealth proceeds and therefore would gladly be better informed in the mean time i will here examine what share falls to ireland of these causes or of the effects and consequences  it is not my intention to complain but barely to relate facts and the matter is not of small importance for it is allowed that a man who lives in a solitary house far from help is not wise in endeavouring to acquire in the neighbourhood the reputation of being rich because those who come for gold will go off with pewter and brass rather than return empty and in the common practice of the world those who possess most wealth make the least parade which they leave to others who have nothing else to bear them out in shewing their faces on the exchange  as to the first cause of a nations riches being the fertility of the soil as well as temperature of climate we have no reason to complain for although the quantity of unprofitable land in this kingdom reckoning bog and rock and barren mountain be double in proportion to what it is in england yet the native productions which both kingdoms deal in are very near on equality in point of goodness and might with the same encouragement be as well manufactured i except mines and minerals in some of which however we are only defective in point of skill and industry  in the second which is the industry of the people our misfortune is not altogether owing to our own fault but to a million of discouragements  the conveniency of ports and havens which nature bestowed us so liberally is of no more use to us than a beautiful prospect to a man shut up in a dungeon  as to shipping of its own this kingdom is so utterly unprovided that of all the excellent timber cut down within these fifty or sixty years it can hardly be said that the nation hath received the benefit of one valuable house to dwell in or one ship to trade with  ireland is the only kingdom i ever heard or read of either in ancient or modern story which was denied the liberty of exporting their native commodities and manufactures wherever they pleased except to countries at war with their own prince or state yet this by the superiority of mere power is refused us in the most momentous parts of commerce49 besides an act of navigation to which we never consented pinned down upon us and rigorously executed50 and a thousand other unexampled circumstances as grievous as they are invidious to mention to go unto the rest  it is too well known that we are forced to obey some laws we never consented to which is a condition i must not call by its true uncontroverted name for fear of my lord chief justice whitsheds ghost with his libertas et natale solum written as a motto on his coach as it stood at the door of the court while he was perjuring himself to betray both51 thus we are in the condition of patients who have physic sent them by doctors at a distance strangers to their constitution and the nature of their disease and thus we are forced to pay five hundred per cent to divide our properties in all which we have likewise the honour to be distinguished from the whole race of mankind  as to improvement of land those few who attempt that or planting through covetousness or want of skill generally leave things worse than they were neither succeeding in trees nor hedges and by running into the fancy of grazing after the manner of the scythians are every day depopulating the country  we are so far from having a king to reside among us that even the viceroy is generally absent fourfifths of his time in the government  no strangers from other countries make this a part of their travels where they can expect to see nothing but scenes of misery and desolation52  those who have the misfortune to be born here have the least title to any considerable employment to which they are seldom preferred but upon a political consideration  one third part of the rents of ireland is spent in england which with the profit of employments pensions appeals journeys of pleasure or health education at the inns of court and both universities remittances at pleasure the pay of all superior officers in the army and other incidents will amount to a full half of the income of the whole kingdom all clear profit to england  we are denied the liberty of coining gold silver or even copper in the isle of man they coin their own silver every petty prince vassal to the emperor can coin what money he pleaseth53 and in this as in most of the articles already mentioned we are an exception to all other states or monarchies that were ever known in the world  as to the last or fourteenth article we take special care to act diametrically contrary to it in the whole course of our lives both sexes but especially the women despise and abhor to wear any of their own manufactures even those which are better made than in other countries particularly a sort of silk plaid through which the workmen are forced to run a sort of gold thread that it may pass for indian even ale and potatoes in great quantity are imported from england as well as corn and our foreign trade is little more than importation of french wine for which i am told we pay ready money  now if all this be true upon which i could easily enlarge i would be glad to know by what secret method it is that we grow a rich and flourishing people without liberty trade manufactures inhabitants money or the privilege of coining without industry labour or improvement of lands and with more than half of the rent and profits of the whole kingdom annually exported for which we receive not a single farthing and to make up all this nothing worth mentioning except the linen of the north a trade casual corrupted and at mercy and some butter from cork if we do flourish it must be against every law of nature and reason like the thorn at glastonbury that blossoms in the midst of winter  let the worthy commissioners who come from england ride round the kingdom and observe the face of nature or the face of the natives the improvement of the land the thriving numerous plantations the noble woods the abundance and vicinity of country seats the commodious farmers houses and barns the towns and villages where everybody is busy and thriving with all kind of manufactures the shops full of goods wrought to perfection and filled with customers the comfortable diet and dress and dwellings of the people the vast numbers of ships in our harbours and docks and shipwrights in our seaport towns the roads crowded with carriers laden with rich manufactures the perpetual concourse to and fro of pompous equipages  with what envy and admiration would these gentlemen return from so delightful a progress what glorious reports would they make when they went back to england  but my heart is too heavy to continue this journey54 longer for it is manifest that whatever stranger took such a journey would be apt to think himself travelling in lapland or ysland55 rather than in a country so favoured by nature as ours both in fruitfulness of soil and temperature of climate the miserable dress and diet and dwelling of the people the general desolation in most parts of the kingdom the old seats of the nobility and gentry all in ruins and no new ones in their stead the families of farmers who pay great rents living in filth and nastiness upon buttermilk and potatoes without a shoe or stocking to their feet or a house so convenient as an english hogsty to receive them56 these indeed may be comfortable sights to an english spectator who comes for a short time only to learn the language and returns back to his own country whither he finds all our wealth transmitted    nostrâ miseriâ magnus es  there is not one argument used to prove the riches of ireland which is not a logical demonstration of its poverty the rise of our rents is squeezed out of the very blood and vitals and clothes and dwellings of the tenants who live worse than english beggars the lowness of interest in all other countries a sign of wealth is in us a proof of misery there being no trade to employ any borrower hence alone comes the dearness of land since the savers have no other way to lay out their money hence the dearness of necessaries for life because the tenants cannot afford to pay such extravagant rates for land which they must take or go abegging without raising the price of cattle and of corn although they should live upon chaff hence our increase of buildings in this city because workmen have nothing to do but employ one another and one half of them are infallibly undone hence the daily increase of bankers who may be a necessary evil in a trading country but so ruinous in ours who for their private advantage have sent away all our silver and one third of our gold so that within three years past the running cash of the nation which was about five hundred thousand pounds is now less than two and must daily diminish unless we have liberty to coin as well as that important kingdom the isle of man and the meanest prince in the german empire as i before observed57  i have sometimes thought that this paradox of the kingdom growing rich is chiefly owing to those worthy gentlemen the bankers who except some customhouse officers birds of passage oppressive thrifty squires and a few others that shall be nameless are the only thriving people among us and i have often wished that a law were enacted to hang up half a dozen bankers every year and thereby interpose at least some short delay to the further ruin of ireland  ye are idle ye are idle answered pharaoh to the israelites when they complained to his majesty that they were forced to make bricks without straw  england enjoys every one of these advantages for enriching a nation which i have above enumerated and into the bargain a good million returned to them every year without labour or hazard or one farthing value received on our side but how long we shall be able to continue the payment i am not under the least concern one thing i know that when the hen is starved to death there will be no more golden eggs  i think it a little unhospitable and others may call it a subtile piece of malice that because there may be a dozen families in this town able to entertain their english friends in a generous manner at their tables their guests upon their return to england shall report that we wallow in riches and luxury  yet i confess i have known an hospital where all the household officers grew rich while the poor for whose sake it was built were almost starving for want of food and raiment  to conclude if ireland be a rich and flourishing kingdom its wealth and prosperity must be owing to certain causes that are yet concealed from the whole race of mankind and the effects are equally invisible we need not wonder at strangers when they deliver such paradoxes but a native and inhabitant of this kingdom who gives the same verdict must be either ignorant to stupidity or a manpleaser at the expense of all honour conscience and truth     the story  of the  injured lady  written by herself  and  the answer to the  injured lady          note        under the guises of a gentleman and two ladies swift represents      england scotland and irelandengland being the gentleman and      scotland and ireland the two mistresses for whom he is affecting an      honourable love the injured lady is ireland who represents her      rival scotland as unworthy of her lovers attention she      expatiates on her own attractions and upbraids him also on his      treatment of her this affords swift an opportunity for some      searching and telling criticism on englands conduct towards      ireland the fiction is admirably maintained throughout the story       in the answer to the injured lady which follows the story      swift takes it upon himself to give her proper advice for her      future conduct towards her lover in this advice he reiterates what      he has always been saying to the people of ireland but formulates      it in the language affected by the lady herself he tells her that      she should look to it that her family and tenants have no      dependence upon the said gentleman farther than by the old      agreement the act of henry vii which obliges you to have the      same steward and to regulate your household by such methods as you      should both agree to that she shall be free to carry her goods to      any market she pleases that she shall compel the servants to whom      she pays wages to remain at home and that if she make an agreement      with a tenant it shall not be in his power to break it if she      will only show a proper spirit he assures her that there are      gentlemen who would be glad of an occasion to support her in her      resentment                                            the text of both the tracts here given is based on that of the      earliest edition i could find namely that of 1746 collated with      that given by faulkner       t s     the  story  of the  injured lady   being a true picture of scotch perfidy irish poverty and english partiality

paternosterrow mdccxlvi  price one shilling     sir  being ruined by the inconstancy and unkindness of a lover i hope a true and plain relation of my misfortunes may be of use and warning to credulous maids never to put too much trust in deceitful men  a gentleman58 in the neighbourhood had two mistresses another and myself59 and he pretended honourable love to us both our three houses stood pretty near one another his was parted from mine by a river60 and from my rivals by an old broken wall61 but before i enter into the particulars of this gentlemans hard usage of me i will give a very just impartial character of my rival and myself  as to her person she is tall and lean and very ill shaped she hath bad features and a worse complexion she hath a stinking breath and twenty ill smells about her besides which are yet more insufferable by her natural sluttishness for she is always lousy and never without the itch as to other qualities she hath no reputation either for virtue honesty truth or manners and it is no wonder considering what her education hath been scolding and cursing are her common conversation to sum up all she is poor and beggarly and gets a sorry maintenance by pilfering wherever she comes as for this gentleman who is now so fond of her she still beareth him an invincible hatred revileth him to his face and raileth at him in all companies her house is frequented by a company of rogues and thieves and pickpockets whom she encourageth to rob his henroosts steal his corn and cattle and do him all manner of mischief62 she hath been known to come at the head of these rascals and beat her lover until he was sore from head to foot and then force him to pay for the trouble she was at once attended with a crew of ragamuffins she broke into his house turned all things topsyturvy and then set it on fire at the same time she told so many lies among his servants that it set them all by the ears and his poor steward was knocked on the head63 for which i think and so doth all the country that she ought to be answerable to conclude her character she is of a different religion being a presbyterian of the most rank and virulent kind and consequently having an inveterate hatred to the church yet i am sure i have been always told that in marriage there ought to be an union of minds as well as of persons  i will now give my own character and shall do it in few words and with modesty and truth  i was reckoned to be as handsome as any in our neighbourhood until i became pale and thin with grief and ill usage i am still fair enough and have i think no very ill feature about me they that see me now will hardly allow me ever to have had any great share of beauty for besides being so much altered i go always mobbed and in an undress as well out of neglect as indeed for want of clothes to appear in i might add to all this that i was born to a good estate although it now turneth to little account under the oppressions i endure and hath been the true cause of all my misfortunes64  some years ago this gentleman taking a fancy either to my person or fortune made his addresses to me which being then young and foolish i too readily admitted he seemed to use me with so much tenderness and his conversation was so very engaging that all my constancy and virtue were too soon overcome and to dwell no longer upon a theme that causeth such bitter reflections i must confess with shame that i was undone by the common arts practised upon all easy credulous virgins half by force and half by consent after solemn vows and protestations of marriage when he had once got possession he soon began to play the usual part of a too fortunate lover affecting on all occasions to shew his authority and to act like a conqueror first he found fault with the government of my family which i grant was none of the best consisting of ignorant illiterate creatures for at that time i knew but little of the world in compliance to him therefore i agreed to fall into his ways and methods of living i consented that his steward65 should govern my house and have liberty to employ an understeward66 who should receive his directions my lover proceeded further turning away several old servants and tenants and supplying me with others from his own house these grew so domineering and unreasonable that there was no quiet and i heard of nothing but perpetual quarrels which although i could not possibly help yet my lover laid all the blame and punishment upon me and upon every falling out still turned away more of my people and supplied me in their stead with a number of fellows and dependents of his own whom he had no other way to provide for67 overcome by love and to avoid noise and contention i yielded to all his usurpations and finding it in vain to resist i thought it my best policy to make my court to my new servants and draw them to my interests i fed them from my own table with the best i had put my new tenants on the choice parts of my land and treated them all so kindly that they began to love me as well as their master in process of time all my old servants were gone and i had not a creature about me nor above one or two tenants but what were of his choosing yet i had the good luck by gentle usage to bring over the greatest part of them to my side when my lover observed this he began to alter his language and to those who enquired about me he would answer that i was an old dependant upon his family whom he had placed on some concerns of his own and he began to use me accordingly neglecting by degrees all common civility in his behaviour i shall never forget the speech he made me one morning which he delivered with all the gravity in the world he put me in the mind of the vast obligations i lay under to him in sending me so many of his people for my own good and to teach me manners that it had cost him ten times more than i was worth to maintain me that it had been much better for him if i had been damned or burnt or sunk to the bottom of the sea that it was but reasonable i should strain myself as far as i was able to reimburse him some of his charges that from henceforward he expected his word should be a law to me in all things that i must maintain a parishwatch against thieves and robbers and give salaries to an overseer a constable and others all of his own choosing whom he would send from time to time to be spies upon me that to enable me the better in supporting these expenses my tenants shall be obliged to carry all their goods cross the river to his townmarket and pay toll on both sides and then sell them at half value68 but because we were a nasty sort of people and that he could not endure to touch anything we had a hand in and likewise because he wanted work to employ his own folks therefore we must send all our goods to his market just in their naturals69 the milk immediately from the cow without making it into cheese or butter the corn in the ear the grass as it is mowed the wool as it cometh from the sheeps back and bring the fruit upon the branch that he might not be obliged to eat it after our filthy hands that if a tenant carried but a piece of bread and cheese to eat by the way or an inch of worsted to mend his stockings he should forfeit his whole parcel and because a company of rogues usually plied on the river between us who often robbed my tenants of their goods and boats he ordered a waterman of his to guard them whose manner was to be out of the way until the poor wretches were plundered then to overtake the thieves and seize all as lawful prize to his master and himself it would be endless to repeat a hundred other hardships he hath put upon me but it is a general rule that whenever he imagines the smallest advantage will redound to one of his footboys by any new oppression of me and my whole family and estate he never disputeth it a moment all this hath rendered me so very insignificant and contemptible at home that some servants to whom i pay the greatest wages and many tenants who have the most beneficial leases are gone over to live with him yet i am bound to continue their wages and pay their rents70 by which means one third part of my whole income is spent on his estate and above another third by his tolls and markets and my poor tenants are so sunk and impoverished that instead of maintaining me suitably to my quality they can hardly find me clothes to keep me warm or provide the common necessaries of life for themselves  matters being in this posture between me and my lover i received intelligence that he had been for some time making very pressing overtures of marriage to my rival until there happened some misunderstandings between them she gave him ill words and threatened to break off all commerce with him he on the other side having either acquired courage by his triumphs over me or supposing her as tame a fool as i thought at first to carry it with a high hand but hearing at the same time that she had thoughts of making some private proposals to join with me against him and doubting with very good reason that i would readily accept them he seemed very much disconcerted71 this i thought was a proper occasion to shew some great example of generosity and love and so without further consideration i sent him word that hearing there was likely to be a quarrel between him and my rival notwithstanding all that had passed and without binding him to any conditions in my own favour i would stand by him against her and all the world while i had a penny in my purse or a petticoat to pawn this message was subscribed by all my chief tenants and proved so powerful that my rival immediately grew more tractable upon it the result of which was that there is now a treaty of marriage concluded between them72 the wedding clothes are bought and nothing remaineth but to perform the ceremony which is put off for some days because they design it to be a public wedding and to reward my love constancy and generosity he hath bestowed on me the office of being sempstress to his grooms and footmen which i am forced to accept or starve73 yet in the midst of this my situation i cannot but have some pity for this deluded man to cast himself away on an infamous creature who whatever she pretendeth i can prove would at this very minute rather be a whore to a certain great man that shall be nameless if she might have her will74 for my part i think and so doth all the country too that the man is possessed at least none of us are able to imagine what he can possibly see in her unless she hath bewitched him or given him some powder  i am sure i never sought his alliance and you can bear me witness that i might have had other matches nay if i were lightly disposed i could still perhaps have offers that some who hold their heads higher would be glad to accept75 but alas i never had any such wicked thought all i now desire is only to enjoy a little quiet to be free from the persecutions of this unreasonable man and that he will let me manage my own little fortune to the best advantage for which i will undertake to pay him a considerable pension every year much more considerable than what he now gets by his oppressions for he must needs find himself a loser at last when he hath drained me and my tenants so dry that we shall not have a penny for him or ourselves there is one imposition of his i had almost forgot which i think unsufferable and will appeal to you or any reasonable person whether it be so or not i told you before that by an old compact we agreed to have the same steward at which time i consented likewise to regulate my family and estate by the same method with him which he then shewed me writ down in form and i approved of76 now the turn he thinks fit to give this compact of ours is very extraordinary for he pretends that whatever orders he shall think fit to prescribe for the future in his family he may if he will compel mine to observe them without asking my advice or hearing my reasons so that i must not make a lease without his consent or give any directions for the wellgoverning of my family but what he countermands whenever he pleaseth this leaveth me at such confusion and uncertainty that my servants know not when to obey me and my tenants although many of them be very well inclined seem quite at a loss  but i am too tedious upon this melancholy subject which however i hope you will forgive since the happiness of my whole life dependeth upon it i desire you will think a while and give your best advice what measures i shall take with prudence justice courage and honour to protect my liberty and fortune against the hardships and severities i lie under from that unkind inconstant man     the answer to the injured lady   madam  i have received your ladyships letter and carefully considered every part of it and shall give you my opinion how you ought to proceed for your own security but first i must beg leave to tell your ladyship that you were guilty of an unpardonable weakness tother day in making that offer to your lover of standing by him in any quarrel he might have with your rival you know very well that she began to apprehend he had designs of using her as he had done you and common prudence might have directed you rather to have entered into some measures with her for joining against him until he might at least be brought to some reasonable terms but your invincible hatred to that lady hath carried your resentments so high as to be the cause of your ruin yet if you please to consider this aversion of yours began a good while before she became your rival and was taken up by you and your family in a sort of compliment to your lover who formerly had a great abhorrence for her it is true since that time you have suffered very much by her encroachments upon your estate77 but she never pretended to govern or direct you and now you have drawn a new enemy upon yourself for i think you may count upon all the ill offices she can possibly do you by her credit with her husband whereas if instead of openly declaring against her without any provocation you had but sat still awhile and said nothing that gentleman would have lessened his severity to you out of perfect fear this weakness of yours you call generosity but i doubt there was more in the matter in short madam i have good reasons to think you were betrayed to it by the pernicious counsels of some about you for to my certain knowledge several of your tenants and servants to whom you have been very kind are as arrant rascals as any in the country i cannot but observe what a mighty difference there is in one particular between your ladyship and your rival having yielded up your person you thought nothing else worth defending and therefore you will not now insist upon those very conditions for which you yielded at first but your ladyship cannot be ignorant that some years since your rival did the same thing and upon no conditions at all nay this gentleman kept her as a miss and yet made her pay for her diet and lodging78 but it being at a time when he had no steward and his family out of order she stole away and hath now got the trick very well known among the women of the town to grant a man the favour over night and the next day have the impudence to deny it to his face but it is too late to reproach you with any former oversights which cannot now be rectified i know the matters of fact as you relate them are true and fairly represented my advice therefore is this get your tenants together as soon as you conveniently can and make them agree to the following resolutions  first that your family and tenants have no dependence upon the said gentleman further than by the old agreement which obligeth you to have the same steward and to regulate your household by such methods as you should both agree to79  secondly that you will not carry your goods to the market of his town unless you please nor be hindered from carrying them anywhere else80  thirdly that the servants you pay wages to shall live at home or forfeit their places81  fourthly that whatever lease you make to a tenant it shall not be in his power to break it82  if he will agree to these articles i advise you to contribute as largely as you can to all charges of parish and county  i can assure you several of that gentlemans ablest tenants and servants are against his severe usage of you and would be glad of an occasion to convince the rest of their error if you will not be wanting to yourself  if the gentleman refuses these just and reasonable offers pray let me know it and perhaps i may think of something else that will be more effectual    i am     madam       your ladyships etc     an  answer to a paper  called  a memorial  of the  poor inhabitants tradesmen and labourers of the kingdom of ireland  written in the year 1728          note        this is perhaps as trenchant and fine a piece of writing as is to      be found in any of those pamphlets swift wrote for the alleviation      of the miserable condition of ireland the author of the memorial      to which swift made this passionate reply was sir john browne and      the purport of his writing may be easily gathered from swifts      animadversions                                            the text here given is based on that printed by faulkner in 1735 in      the fourth volume of his collected edition of swifts works scott      reprints brownes memorial and his reply to the present answer      but they are of little importance and in no way assist us in our      appreciation of swifts work the date of swifts answer is given      by faulkner as march 25th 1728 which year scott misprints 1738      evidently a printers error though the arrangement of the order of      the pamphlets in his edition leaves much to be desired       t s     an answer to a paper called  a memorial  of the  poor inhabitants tradesmen and labourers of the kingdom of ireland   i received a paper from you wherever you are printed without any name of author or printer and sent i suppose to me among others without any particular distinction it contains a complaint of the dearness of corn and some schemes of making it cheaper which i cannot approve of  but pray permit me before i go further to give you a short history of the steps by which we arrived at this hopeful situation  it was indeed the shameful practice of too many irish farmers to wear out their ground with ploughing while either through poverty laziness or ignorance they neither took care to manure it as they ought nor gave time to any part of the land to recover itself and when their leases are near expiring being assured that their landlords would not renew they ploughed even the meadows and made such a havock that many landlords were considerable sufferers by it  this gave birth to that abominable race of graziers who upon expiration of the farmers leases were ready to engross great quantities of land and the gentlemen having been before often ill paid and their land worn out of heart were too easily tempted when a rich grazier made him an offer to take all his land and give his security for payment thus a vast tract of land where twenty or thirty farmers lived together with their cottagers and labourers in their several cabins became all desolate and easily managed by one or two herdsmen and their boys whereby the mastergrazier with little trouble seized to himself the livelihood of a hundred people  it must be confessed that the farmers were justly punished for their knavery brutality and folly but neither are the squires and landlords to be excused for to them is owing the depopulating of the country the vast number of beggars and the ruin of those few sorry improvements we had  that farmers should be limited in ploughing is very reasonable and practised in england and might have easily been done here by penal clauses in their leases but to deprive them in a manner altogether from tilling their lands was a most stupid want of thinking  had the farmers been confined to plough a certain quantity of land with a penalty of ten pounds an acre for whatever they exceeded and farther limited for the three or four last years of their leases all this evil had been prevented the nation would have saved a million of money and been more populous by above two hundred thousand souls  for a people denied the benefit of trade to manage their lands in such a manner as to produce nothing but what they are forbidden to trade with83 or only such things as they can neither export nor manufacture to advantage is an absurdity that a wild indian would be ashamed of especially when we add that we are content to purchase this hopeful commerce by sending to foreign markets for our daily bread  the graziers employment is to feed great flocks of sheep or black cattle or both with regard to sheep as folly is usually accompanied with perverseness so it is here there is something so monstrous to deal in a commodity further than for our own use which we are not allowed to export manufactured nor even unmanufactured but to one certain country and only to some few ports in that country84 there is i say something so sottish that it wants a name in our language to express it by and the good of it is that the more sheep we have the fewer human creatures are left to wear the wool or eat the flesh ajax was mad when he mistook a flock of sheep for his enemies but we shall never be sober until we have the same way of thinking  the other part of the graziers business is what we call blackcattle producing hides tallow and beef for exportation all which are good and useful commodities if rightly managed but it seems the greatest part of the hides are sent out raw for want of bark to tan them and that want will daily grow stronger for i doubt the new project of tanning without it is at an end our beef i am afraid still continues scandalous in foreign markets for the old reasons but our tallow for anything i know may be good however to bestow the whole kingdom on beef and mutton and thereby drive out half the people who should eat their share and force the rest to send sometimes as far as egypt for bread to eat with it is a most peculiar and distinguished piece of public economy of which i have no comprehension  i know very well that our ancestors the scythians and their posterity our kinsmen the tartars lived upon the blood and milk and raw flesh of their cattle without one grain of corn but i confess myself so degenerate that i am not easy without bread to my victuals  what amazed me for a week or two was to see in this prodigious plenty of cattle and dearth of human creatures and want of bread as well as money to buy it that all kind of fleshmeat should be monstrously dear beyond what was ever known in this kingdom i thought it a defect in the laws that there was not some regulation in the price of flesh as well as bread but i imagine myself to have guessed out the reason in short i am apt to think that the whole kingdom is overstocked with cattle both black and white and as it is observed that the poor irish have a vanity to be rather owners of two lean cows than one fat although with double the charge of grazing and but half the quantity of milk so i conceive it much more difficult at present to find a fat bullock or wether than it would be if half of both were fairly knocked on the head for i am assured that the district in the several markets called carrion row is as reasonable as the poor can desire only the circumstance of money to purchase it and of trade or labour to purchase that money are indeed wholly wanting  now sir to return more particularly to you and your memorial  a hundred thousand barrels of wheat you say should be imported hither and ten thousand pounds premium to the importers have you looked into the purse of the nation i am no commissioner of the treasury but am well assured that the whole running cash would not supply you with a sum to purchase so much corn which only at twenty shillings a barrel will be a hundred thousand pounds and ten thousand more for the premiums but you will traffic for your corn with other goods and where are those goods if you had them they are all engaged to pay the rents of absentees and other occasions in london besides a huge balance of trade this year against us will foreigners take our bankers papers i suppose they will value it at little more than so much a quire where are these rich farmers and engrossers of corn in so bad a year and so little sowing  you are in pain of two shillings premium and forget the twenty shillings for the price find me out the latter and i will engage for the former  your scheme for a tax for raising such a sum is all visionary and owing to a great want of knowledge in the miserable state of this nation tea coffee sugar spices wine and foreign clothes are the particulars you mention upon which this tax should be raised i will allow the two first because they are unwholesome and the last because i should be glad if they were all burned but i beg you will leave us our wine to make us a while forget our misery or give your tenants leave to plough for barley but i will tell you a secret which i learned many years ago from the commissioners of the customs in london they said when any commodity appeared to be taxed above a moderate rate the consequence was to lessen that branch of the revenue by one half and one of those gentlemen pleasantly told me that the mistake of parliaments on such occasions was owing to an error of computing two and two to make four whereas in the business of laying impositions two and two never made more than one which happens by lessening the import and the strong temptation of running such goods as paid high duties at least in this kingdom although the women are as vain and extravagant as their lovers or their husbands can deserve and the men are fond enough of wine yet the number of both who can afford such expenses is so small that the major part must refuse gratifying themselves and the duties will rather be lessened than increased but allowing no force in this argument yet so preternatural a sum as one hundred and ten thousand pounds raised all on a sudden for there is no dallying with hunger is just in proportion with raising a million and a half in england which as things now stand would probably bring that opulent kingdom under some difficulties  you are concerned how strange and surprising it would be in foreign parts to hear that the poor were starving in a rich country c are you in earnest is ireland the rich country you mean or are you insulting our poverty were you ever out of ireland or were you ever in it till of late you may probably have a good employment and are saving all you can to purchase a good estate in england but by talking so familiarly of one hundred and ten thousand pounds by a tax upon a few commodities it is plain you are either naturally or affectedly ignorant of our present condition or else you would know and allow that such a sum is not to be raised here without a general excise since in proportion to our wealth we pay already in taxes more than england ever did in the height of the war and when you have brought over your corn who will be the buyers most certainly not the poor who will not be able to purchase the twentieth part of it  sir upon the whole your paper is a very crude piece liable to more objections than there are lines but i think your meaning is good and so far you are pardonable  if you will propose a general contribution in supporting the poor in potatoes and buttermilk till the new corn comes in perhaps you may succeed better because the thing at least is possible and i think if our brethren in england would contribute upon this emergency out of the million they gain from us every year they would do a piece of justice as well as charity in the mean time go and preach to your own tenants to fall to the plough as fast as they can and prevail with your neighbouring squires to do the same with theirs or else die with the guilt of having driven away half the inhabitants and starving the rest for as to your scheme of raising one hundred and ten thousand pounds it is as vain as that of rabelais which was to squeeze out wind from the posteriors of a dead ass  but why all this concern for the poor we want them not as the country is now managed they may follow thousands of their leaders and seek their bread abroad where the plough has no work one family can do the business of fifty and you may send away the other fortynine an admirable piece of husbandry never known or practised by the wisest nations who erroneously thought people to be the riches of a country  if so wretched a state of things would allow it methinks i could have a malicious pleasure after all the warning i have in vain given the public at my own peril for several years past to see the consequences and events answering in every particular i pretend to no sagacity what i writ was little more than what i had discoursed to several persons who were generally of my opinion and it was obvious to every common understanding that such effects must needs follow from such causesa fair issue of things begun upon party rage while some sacrificed the public to fury and others to ambition while a spirit of faction and oppression reigned in every part of the country where gentlemen instead of consulting the ease of their tenants or cultivating their lands were worrying one another upon points of whig and tory of high church and low church which no more concerned them than the long and famous controversy of strops for razors while agriculture was wholly discouraged and consequently half the farmers and labourers and poorer tradesmen forced to beggary or banishment wisdom crieth in the streets because i have called on ye i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but ye have set at nought all my counsels and would none of my reproof i also will laugh at your calamity and mock when your fear cometh  i have now done with your memorial and freely excuse your mistakes since you appear to write as a stranger and as of a country which is left at liberty to enjoy the benefits of nature and to make the best of those advantages which god hath given it in soil climate and situation  but having lately sent out a paper entitled a short view of the state of ireland and hearing of an objection that some people think i have treated the memory of the late lord chief justice whitshed with an appearance of severity since i may not probably have another opportunity of explaining myself in that particular i choose to do it here laying it therefore down for a postulatum which i suppose will be universally granted that no little creature of so mean a birth and genius had ever the honour to be a greater enemy to his country and to all kinds of virtue than he i answer thus whether there be two different goddesses called fame as some authors contend or only one goddess sounding two different trumpets it is certain that people distinguished for their villainy have as good a title for a blast from the proper trumpet as those who are most renowned for their virtues have from the other and have equal reason to complain if it be refused them and accordingly the names of the most celebrated profligates have been faithfully transmitted down to posterity and although the person here understood acted his part in an obscure corner of the world yet his talents might have shone with lustre enough in the noblest scene  as to my naming a person dead the plain honest reason is the best he was armed with power guilt and will to do mischief even where he was not provoked as appeared by his prosecuting two printers85 one to death and both to ruin who had neither offended god nor the king nor him nor the public  what an encouragement to vice is this if an ill man be alive and in power we dare not attack him and if he be weary of the world or of his own villainies he has nothing to do but die and then his reputation is safe for these excellent casuists know just latin enough to have heard a most foolish precept that de mortuis nil nisi bonum so that if socrates and anytus his accuser had happened to die together the charity of survivors must either have obliged them to hold their peace or to fix the same character on both the only crime of charging the dead is when the least doubt remains whether the accusation be true but when men are openly abandoned and lost to all shame they have no reason to think it hard if their memory be reproached whoever reports or otherwise publisheth any thing which it is possible may be false that man is a slanderer hic niger est hunc tu romane caveto even the least misrepresentation or aggravation of facts deserves the same censure in some degree but in this case i am quite deceived if my error hath not been on the side of extenuation  i have now present before me the idea of some persons i know not in what part of the world who spend every moment of their lives and every turn of their thoughts while they are awake and probably of their dreams while they sleep in the most detestable actions and designs who delight in mischief scandal and obloquy with the hatred and contempt of all mankind against them but chiefly of those among their own party and their own family such whose odious qualities rival each other for perfection avarice brutality faction pride malice treachery noise impudence dullness ignorance vanity and revenge contending every moment for superiority in their breasts such creatures are not to be reformed neither is it prudence or safety to attempt a reformation yet although their memories will rot there may be some benefit for their survivors to smell it while it is rotting                                     i am sir                                      your humble servant                                                       a b    dublin        march 25th 1728     answer  to several letters from unknown  persons86  written in the year 1729     answer to several letters from unknown persons87   gentlemen  i am inclined to think that i received a letter from you two last summer directed to dublin while i was in the country whither it was sent me and i ordered an answer to it to be printed but it seems it had little effect and i suppose this will have not much more but the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed and gentlemen i am to tell you another thing that the world is so regardless of what we write for the public good that after we have delivered our thoughts without any prospect of advantage or of reputation which latter is not to be had but by subscribing our names we cannot prevail upon a printer to be at the charge of sending it into the world unless we will be at all or half the expense and although we are willing enough to bestow our labours we think it unreasonable to be out of pocket because it probably may not consist with the situation of our affairs  i do very much approve your good intentions and in a great measure your manner of declaring them and i do imagine you intended that the world should not only know your sentiments but my answer which i shall impartially give  that great prelate to whose care you directed your letter sent it to me this morning88 and i begin my answer tonight not knowing what interruption i may meet with  i have ordered your letter to be printed as it ought to be along with my answer because i conceive it will be more acceptable and informing to the kingdom  i shall therefore now go on to answer your letter in all manner of sincerity  although your letter be directed to me yet i take myself to be only an imaginary person for although i conjecture i had formerly one from you yet i never answered it otherwise than in print neither was i at a loss to know the reasons why so many people of this kingdom were transporting themselves to america and if this encouragement were owing to a pamphlet written giving an account of the country of pennsylvania to tempt people to go thither i do declare that those who were tempted by such a narrative to such a journey were fools and the author a most impudent knave at least if it be the same pamphlet i saw when it first came out which is above 25 years ago dedicated to will penn whom by a mistake you call sir william penn and styling him by authority of the scripture most noble governor for i was very well acquainted with penn and did some years after talk with him upon that pamphlet and the impudence of the author who spoke so many things in praise of the soil and climate which penn himself did absolutely contradict for he did assure me that his country wanted the shelter of mountains which left it open to the northern winds from hudsons bay and the frozen sea which destroyed all plantations of trees and was even pernicious to all common vegetables but indeed new york virginia and other parts less northward or more defended by mountains are described as excellent countries but upon what conditions of advantage foreigners go thither i am yet to seek89  what evils do our people avoid by running from hence is easier to be determined they conceive themselves to live under the tyranny of most cruel exacting landlords who have no view further than increasing their rentrolls secondly you complain of the want of trade whereof you seem not to know the reason thirdly you lament most justly the money spent by absentees in england fourthly you complain that your linen manufacture declines fifthly that your tithecollectors oppress you sixthly that your children have no hopes of preferment in the church the revenue or the army to which you might have added the law and all civil employments whatsoever seventhly you are undone for silver and want all other money  i could easily add some other motives which to men of spirit who desire and expect and think they deserve the common privileges of human nature would be of more force than any you have yet named to drive them out of this kingdom but as these speculations may probably not much affect the brains of your people i shall choose to let them pass unmentioned yet i cannot but observe that my very good and virtuous friend his excellency burnet o fili nec tali indigne parente90 hath not hitherto been able to persuade his vassals by his oratory in the style of a command to settle a revenue on his viceroyal person91 i have been likewise assured that in one of those colonies on the continent which nature hath so far favoured as by the industry of the inhabitants to produce a great quantity of excellent rice the stubbornness of the people who having been told that the world is wide took it into their heads that they might sell their own rice at whatever foreign markets they pleased and seem by their practice very unwilling to quit that opinion  but to return to my subject i must confess to you both that if one reason of your peoples deserting us be the despair of things growing better in their own country i have not one syllable to answer because that would be to hope for what is impossible and so i have been telling the public these ten years for there are three events which must precede any such blessing first a liberty of trade secondly a share of preferments in all kinds to the british natives and thirdly a return of those absentees who take almost one half of the kingdoms revenues as to the first there is nothing left us but despair and for the third it will never happen till the kingdom hath no money to send them for which in my own particular i should not be sorry  the exaction of landlords hath indeed been a grievance of above twenty years standing but as to what you object about the severe clauses relating to improvement the fault lies wholly on the other side for the landlords either by their ignorance or greediness of making large rentrolls have performed this matter so ill as we see by experience that there is not one tenant in five hundred who hath made any improvement worth mentioning for which i appeal to any man who rides through the kingdom where little is to be found among the tenants but beggary and desolation the cabins of the scotch themselves in ulster being as dirty and miserable as those of the wildest irish whereas good firm penal clauses for improvement with a tolerable easy rent and a reasonable period of time would in twenty years have increased the rents of ireland at least a third part in the intrinsic value  i am glad to hear you speak with some decency of the clergy and to impute the exactions you lament to the managers or farmers of the tithes but you entirely mistake the fact for i defy the most wicked and most powerful clergymen in the kingdom to oppress the meanest farmer in the parish and i likewise defy the same clergyman to prevent himself from being cheated by the same farmer whenever that farmer shall be disposed to be knavish or peevish for although the ulster tithingteller is more advantageous to the clergy than any other in the kingdom yet the minister can demand no more than his tenth and where the corn much exceeds the small tithes as except in some districts i am told it always doth he is at the mercy of every stubborn farmer especially of those whose sect as well as interest incline them to opposition however i take it that your people bent for america do not shew the best part of their prudence in making this one part of their complaint yet they are so far wise as not to make the payment of tithes a scruple of conscience which is too gross for any protestant dissenter except a quaker to pretend but do your people indeed think that if tithes were abolished or delivered into the hands of the landlord after the blessed manner in the scotch spiritual economy that the tenant would sit easier in his rent under the same person who must be lord of the soil and of the tithe together  i am ready enough to grant that the oppression of landlords the utter ruin of trade with its necessary consequence the want of money half the revenues of the kingdom spent abroad the continued dearth of three years and the strong delusion in your people by false allurement from america may be the chief motives of their eagerness after such an expedition but there is likewise another temptation which is not of inconsiderable weight which is their itch of living in a country where their sect is predominant and where their eyes and consciences would not be offended by the stumblingblock of ceremonies habits and spiritual titles92  but i was surprised to find that those calamities whereof we are innocent have been sufficient to drive many families out of their country who had no reason to complain of oppressive landlords for while i was last year in the northern parts a person of quality whose estate was let above 20 years ago and then at a very reasonable rent some for leases of lives and some perpetuities did in a few months purchase eleven of those leases at a very inconsiderable price although they were two years ago reckoned to pay but half value from whence it is manifest that our present miserable condition and the dismal prospect of worse with other reasons above assigned are sufficient to put men upon trying this desperate experiment of changing the scene they are in although landlords should by a miracle become less inhuman  there is hardly a scheme proposed for improving the trade of this kingdom which doth not manifestly shew the stupidity and ignorance of the proposer and i laugh with contempt at those weak wise heads who proceed upon general maxims or advise us to follow the examples of holland and england these empirics talk by rote without understanding the constitution of the kingdom as if a physician knowing that exercise contributed much to health should prescribe to his patient under a severe fit of the gout to walk ten miles every morning the directions for ireland are very short and plain to encourage agriculture and home consumption and utterly discard all importations which are not absolutely necessary for health or life and how few necessities conveniences or even comforts of life are denied us by nature or not to be attained by labour and industry are those detestable extravagancies of flanders lace english cloths of our own wool and other goods italian or indian silks tea coffee chocolate chinaware and that profusion of wines by the knavery of merchants growing dearer every season with a hundred unnecessary fopperies better known to others than me are these i say fit for us any more than for the beggar who could not eat his veal without oranges is it not the highest indignity to human nature that men should be such poltroons as to suffer the kingdom and themselves to be undone by the vanity the folly the pride and wantonness of their wives93 who under their present corruptions seem to be a kind of animal suffered for our sins to be sent into the world for the destruction of families societies and kingdoms and whose whole study seems directed to be as expensive as they possibly can in every useless article of living who by long practice can reconcile the most pernicious foreign drugs to their health and pleasure provided they are but expensive as starlings grow fat with henbane who contract a robustness by mere practice of sloth and luxury who can play deep several hours after midnight sleep beyond noon revel upon indian poisons and spend the revenue of a moderate family to adorn a nauseous unwholesome living carcase let those few who are not concerned in any part of this accusation suppose it unsaid let the rest take it among them gracious god in his mercy look down upon a nation so shamefully besotted  if i am possessed of an hundred pounds a year and by some misfortune it sinks to fifty without a possibility of ever being retrieved does it remain a question in such an exigency what i am to do must not i retrench onehalf in every article of expense or retire to some cheap distant part of the country where necessaries are at half value  is there any mortal who can shew me under the circumstances we stand with our neighbours under their inclinations towards us under laws never to be repealed under the desolation caused by absentees under many other circumstances not to be mentioned that this kingdom can ever be a nation of trade or subsist by any other method than that of a reduced family by the utmost parsimony in the manner i have already prescribed  i am tired with letters from many unreasonable wellmeaning people who are daily pressing me to deliver my thoughts in this deplorable juncture which upon many others i have so often done in vain what will it import that half a score people in a coffeehouse may happen to read this paper and even the majority of those few differ in every sentiment from me if the farmer be not allowed to sow his corn if half the little money among us be sent to pay rents to irish absentees and the rest for foreign luxury and dress for the women what will our charitable dispositions avail when there is nothing left to be given when contrary to all custom and example all necessaries of life are so exorbitant when money of all kinds was never known to be so scarce so that gentlemen of no contemptible estates are forced to retrench in every article except what relates to their wives without being able to shew any bounty to the poor     an answer  to several letters sent me from  unknown hands94  written in the year 1729   i am very well pleased with the good opinion you express of me and wish it were any way in my power to answer your expectations for the service of my country i have carefully read your several schemes and proposals which you think should be offered to the parliament in answer i will assure you that in another place i have known very good proposals rejected with contempt by public assemblies merely because they were offered from without doors and yours perhaps might have the same fate especially if handed into the public by me who am not acquainted with three members nor have the least interest with one my printers have been twice prosecuted to my great expense on account of discourses i writ for the public service without the least reflection on parties or persons and the success i had in those of the drapier was not owing to my abilities but to a lucky juncture when the fuel was ready for the first hand that would be at the pains of kindling it it is true both those envenomed prosecutions were the workmanship of a judge who is now gone to his own place95 but let that be as it will i am determined henceforth never to be the instrument of leaving an innocent man at the mercy of that bench  it is certain there are several particulars relating to this kingdom i have mentioned a few of them in one of my drapiers letters96 which it were heartily to be wished that the parliament would take under their consideration such as will nowise interfere with england otherwise than to its advantage  the first i shall mention is touched at in a letter which i received from one of you gentlemen about the highways which indeed are almost everywhere scandalously neglected i know a very rich man in this city a true lover and saver of his money who being possessed of some adjacent lands hath been at great charge in repairing effectually the roads that lead to them and has assured me that his lands are thereby advanced four or five shillings an acre by which he gets treble interest but generally speaking all over the kingdom the roads are deplorable and what is more particularly barbarous there is no sort of provision made for travellers on foot no not near this city except in a very few places and in a most wretched manner whereas the english are so particularly careful in this point that you may travel there an hundred miles with less inconvenience than one mile here but since this may be thought too great a reformation i shall only speak of roads for horses carriages and cattle97  ireland is i think computed to be onethird smaller than england yet by some natural disadvantages it would not bear quite the same proportion in value with the same encouragement however it hath so happened for many years past that it never arrived to above oneeleventh part in point of riches and of late by the continual decrease of trade and increase of absentees with other circumstances not here to be mentioned hardly to a fifteenth part at least if my calculations be right which i doubt are a little too favourable on our side  now supposing daylabour to be cheaper by one half here than in england and our roads by the nature of our carriages and the desolation of our country to be not worn and beaten above oneeighth part so much as those of england which is a very moderate computation i do not see why the mending of them would be a greater burthen to this kingdom than to that  there have been i believe twenty acts of parliament in six or seven years of the late king for mending long tracts of impassable ways in several counties of england by erecting turnpikes and receiving passagemoney in a manner that everybody knows if what i have advanced be true it would be hard to give a reason against the same practice here since the necessity is as great the advantage in proportion perhaps much greater the materials of stone and gravel as easy to be found and the workmanship at least twice as cheap besides the work may be done gradually with allowances for the poverty of the nation by so many perch a year but with a special care to encourage skill and diligence and to prevent fraud in the undertakers to which we are too liable and which are not always confined to those of the meaner sort but against these no doubt the wisdom of the nation may and will provide  another evil which in my opinion deserves the public care is the ill management of the bogs the neglect whereof is a much greater mischief to this kingdom than most people seem to be aware of  it is allowed indeed by those who are esteemed most skilful in such matters that the red swelling mossy bog whereof we have so many large tracts in this island is not by any means to be fully reduced but the skirts which are covered with a green coat easily may being not an accretion or annual growth of moss like the other  now the landlords are generally too careless that they suffer their tenants to cut their turf in these skirts as well as the bog adjoined whereby there is yearly lost a considerable quantity of land throughout the kingdom never to be recovered  but this is not the greatest part of the mischief for the main bog although perhaps not reducible to natural soil yet by continuing large deep straight canals through the middle cleaned at proper times as low as the channel or gravel would become a secure summerpasture the margins might with great profit and ornament be filled with quickens birch and other trees proper for such a soil and the canals be convenient for watercarriage of the turf which is now drawn upon sledcars with great expense difficulty and loss of time by reason of the many turfpits scattered irregularly through the bog wherein great numbers of cattle are yearly drowned and it hath been i confess to me a matter of the greatest vexation as well as wonder to think how any landlord could be so absurd as to suffer such havoc to be made  all the acts for encouraging plantations of foresttrees are i am told extremely defective98 which with great submission must have been owing to a defect of skill in the contrivers of them in this climate by the continual blowing of the westsouthwest wind hardly any tree of value will come to perfection that is not planted in groves except very rarely and where there is much landshelter i have not indeed read all the acts but from enquiry i cannot learn that the planting in groves is enjoined and as to the effects of these laws i have not seen the least in many hundred miles riding except about a very few gentlemens houses and even those with very little skill or success in all the rest the hedges generally miscarry as well as the larger slender twigs planted upon the tops of ditches merely for want of common skill and care  i do not believe that a greater and quicker profit could be made than by planting large groves of ash a few feet asunder which in seven years would make the best kind of hoppoles and grow in the same or less time to a second crop from their roots  it would likewise be of great use and beauty in our desert scenes to oblige all tenants and cottagers to plant ash or elm before their cabins and round their potatogardens where cattle either do not or ought not to come to destroy them  the common objections against all this drawn from the laziness the perverseness or thievish disposition of the poor native irish might be easily answered by shewing the true reasons for such accusations and how easily those people may be brought to a less savage manner of life but my printers have already suffered too much for my speculations however supposing the size of a natives understanding just equal to that of a dog or horse i have often seen those two animals to be civilized by rewards at least as much as by punishments  it would be a noble achievement to abolish the irish language in this kingdom so far at least as to oblige all the natives to speak only english on every occasion of business in shops markets fairs and other places of dealing yet i am wholly deceived if this might not be effectually done in less than half an age and at a very trifling expense for such i look upon a tax to be of only six thousand pounds a year to accomplish so great a work99 this would in a great measure civilize the most barbarous among them reconcile them to our customs and manner of living and reduce great numbers to the national religion whatever kind may then happen to be established the method is plain and simple and although i am too desponding to produce it yet i could heartily wish some public thoughts were employed to reduce this uncultivated people from that idle savage beastly thievish manner of life in which they continue sunk to a degree that it is almost impossible for a country gentleman to find a servant of human capacity or the least tincture of natural honesty or who does not live among his own tenants in continual fear of having his plantations destroyed his cattle stolen and his goods pilfered  the love affection or vanity of living in england continuing to carry thither so many wealthy families the consequences thereof together with the utter loss of all trade except what is detrimental which hath forced such great numbers of weavers and others to seek their bread in foreign countries the unhappy practice of stocking such vast quantities of land with sheep and other cattle which reduceth twenty families to one these events i say have exceedingly depopulated this kingdom for several years past i should heartily wish therefore under this miserable dearth of money that those who are most concerned would think it advisable to save a hundred thousand pounds a year which is now sent out of this kingdom to feed us with corn there is not an older or more uncontroverted maxim in the politics of all wise nations than that of encouraging agriculture and therefore to what kind of wisdom a practice so directly contrary among us may be reduced i am by no means a judge if labour and people make the true riches of a nation what must be the issue where one part of the people are forced away and the other part have nothing to do  if it should be thought proper by wiser heads that his majesty might be applied to in a national way for giving the kingdom leave to coin halfpence for its own use i believe no good subject will be under the least apprehension that such a request could meet with refusal or the least delay perhaps we are the only kingdom upon earth or that ever was or will be upon earth which did not enjoy that common right of civil society under the proper inspection of its prince or legislature to coin money of all usual metals for its own occasions every petty prince in germany vassal to the emperor enjoys this privilege and i have seen in this kingdom several silver pieces with the inscription of civitas waterford droghedagh and other towns     a letter  to the archbishop of dublin  concerning the weavers  written in the year 1729          note        the archbishop to whom swift wrote was dr william king for many      years his friend king was a fine patriot and had stood out      strongly against the imposition of woods halfpence in this      letter so characteristic of swifts attitude towards the condition      of ireland he aims at a practical and immediate relief the causes      for this condition discussed so ably by molesworth prior and dobbs      in their various treatises are too academic for him his proposal      for the universal use of irish manufacture well illustrates the      kind of practical reform swift insisted on yet the insistence was      more because of the spirit of independence such a course demanded      to swift there was no hope for ireland without a radical change in      the spirit of its people the change meant the assertion of      manliness independence and strength of character how to attain      these and how to make the people aware of their power were always      swifts aims all his tracts are assertions of and dilations on      these themes if the people were but to insist on wearing their own      manufactures since they were prohibited from exporting them they      would keep their money in the kingdom likewise if they were to      deny themselves the indulgence in luxuries they would not have to      send out their money to the countries from which these luxuries      were obtained there were methods ready at hand but the practice      in them would result in the cultivation of that respect for      themselves without which a nation is worse than a pauper and lower      than a slave                                            the text of this edition is based on the original manuscript and      collated with that of scotts second edition of swifts collected      works       t s     a letter to the archbishop of dublin concerning the weavers   my lord  the corporation of weavers in the woollen manufacture who have so often attended your grace and called upon me with their schemes and proposals were with me on thursday last when he who spoke for the rest and in the name of his absent brethren said it was the opinion of the whole body that if somewhat were written at this time by an able hand to persuade the people of the kingdom to wear their own woollen manufactures it might be of good use to the nation in general and preserve many hundreds of their trade from starving to which i answered that it was hard for any man of common spirit to turn his thoughts to such speculations without discovering a resentment which people are too delicate to bear for i will not deny to your grace that i cannot reflect on the singular condition of this country different from all others upon the face of the earth without some emotion and without often examining as i pass the streets whether those animals which come in my way with two legs and human faces clad and erect be of the same species with what i have seen very like them in england as to the outward shape but differing in their notions natures and intellectuals more than any two kinds of brutes in a forest which any men of common prudence would immediately discover by persuading them to define what they mean by law liberty property courage reason loyalty or religion  one thing my lord i am very confident of that if god almighty for our sins would most justly send us a pestilence whoever should dare to discover his grief in public for such a visitation would certainly be censured for disaffection to the government for i solemnly profess that i do not know one calamity we have undergone this many years whereof any man whose opinions were not in fashion dared to lament without being openly charged with that imputation and this is the harder because although a mother when she hath corrected her child may sometimes force it to kiss the rod yet she will never give that power to the footboy or the scullion  my lord there are two things for the people of this kingdom to consider first their present evil condition and secondly what can be done in some degree to remedy it  i shall not enter into a particular description of our present misery it hath been already done in several papers and very fully in one entitled a short view of the state of ireland it will be enough to mention the entire want of trade the navigation act executed with the utmost rigour the remission of a million every year to england the ruinous importation of foreign luxury and vanity the oppression of landlords and discouragement of agriculture  now all these evils are without the possibility of a cure except that of importations and to fence against ruinous folly will be always in our power in spite of the discouragements mortifications contempt hatred and oppression we can lie under but our trade will never mend the navigation act never be softened our absentees never return our endless foreign payments never be lessened or our landlords ever be less exacting  all other schemes for preserving this kingdom from utter ruin are idle and visionary consequently drawn from wrong reasoning and from general topics which for the same causes that they may be true in all nations are certainly false in ours as i have told the public often enough but with as little effect as what i shall say at present is likely to produce  i am weary of so many abortive projects for the advancement of trade of so many crude proposals in letters sent me from unknown hands of so many contradictory speculations about raising or sinking the value of gold and silver i am not in the least sorry to hear of the great numbers going to america though very much so for the causes that drive them from us since the uncontrolled maxim that people are the riches of a nation is no maxim here under our circumstances we have neither manufactures to employ them about nor food to support them  if a private gentlemans income be sunk irretrievably for ever from a hundred pounds to fifty and that he hath no other method to supply the deficiency i desire to know my lord whether such a person hath any other course to take than to sink half his expenses in every article of economy to save himself from ruin and the gaol is not this more than doubly the case of ireland where the want of money the irrecoverable ruin of trade with the other evils above mentioned and many more too well known and felt and too numerous or invidious to relate have been gradually sinking us for above a dozen years past to a degree that we are at least by two thirds in a worse condition than was ever known since the revolution therefore instead of dreams and projects for the advancing of trade we have nothing left but to find out some expedient whereby we may reduce our expenses to our incomes  yet this procedure allowed so necessary in all private families and in its own nature so easy to be put in practice may meet with strong opposition by the cowardly slavish indulgence of the men to the intolerable pride arrogance vanity and luxury of the women who strictly adhering to the rules of modern education seem to employ their whole stock of invention in contriving new arts of profusion faster than the most parsimonious husband can afford and to compass this work the more effectually their universal maxim is to despise and detest everything of the growth and manufacture of their own country and most to value whatever comes from the very remotest parts of the globe and i am convinced that if the virtuosi could once find out a world in the moon with a passage to it our women would wear nothing but what came directly from thence100  the prime cost of wine yearly imported to ireland is valued at thirty thousand pounds and the tea including coffee and chocolate at five times that sum the lace silks calicoes and all other unnecessary ornaments for women including english cloths and stuffs added to the former articles make up to compute grossly about four hundred thousand pounds  now if we should allow the thirty thousand pounds for wine wherein the women have their share and which is all we have to comfort us and deduct seventy thousand pounds more for overreckoning there would still remain three hundred thousand pounds annually spent for unwholesome drugs and unnecessary finery which prodigious sum would be wholly saved and many thousands of our miserable shopkeepers and manufacturers comfortably supported  let speculative people busy their brains as much as they please there is no other way to prevent this kingdom from sinking for ever than by utterly renouncing all foreign dress and luxury  it is absolutely so in fact that every husband of any fortune in the kingdom is nourishing a poisonous devouring serpent in his bosom with all the mischief but with none of its wisdom  if all the women were clad with the growth of their own country they might still vie with each other in the cause of foppery and still have room left to vie with each other and equally shew their wit and judgment in deciding upon the variety of irish stuffs and if they could be contented with their native wholesome slops for breakfast we should hear no more of their spleen hysterics colics palpitations and asthmas they might still be allowed to ruin each other and their husbands at play because the money lost would only circulate among ourselves  my lord i freely own it a wild imagination that any words will cure the sottishness of men or the vanity of women but the kingdom is in a fair way of producing the most effectual remedy when there will not be money left for the common course of buying and selling the very necessaries of life in our markets unless we absolutely change the whole method of our proceedings  this corporation of weavers in woollen and silks who have so frequently offered proposals both to your grace and to me are the hottest and coldest generation of men that i have known about a month ago they attended your grace when i had the honour to be with you and designed me then the same favour they desired you would recommend to your clergy to wear gowns of irish stuffs which might probably spread the example among all their brethren in the kingdom and perhaps among the lawyers and gentlemen of the university and among the citizens of those corporations who appear in gowns on solemn occasions i then mentioned a kind of stuff not above eightpence a yard which i heard had been contrived by some of the trade and was very convenient i desired they would prepare some of that or any sort of black stuff on a certain day when your grace would appoint as many clergymen as could readily be found to meet at your palace and there give their opinions and that your graces visitations approaching you could then have the best opportunity of seeing what could be done in a matter of such consequence as they seemed to think to the woollen manufacture but instead of attending as was expected they came to me a fortnight after with a new proposal that something should be writ by an acceptable and able hand to promote in general the wearing of home manufactures and their civilities would seem to fix that work upon me i asked whether they had prepared the stuffs as they had promised and your grace expected but they had not made the least step in the matter nor as it appears thought of it more  i did some years ago propose to the masters and principal dealers in the home manufactures of silk and wool that they should meet together and after mature consideration publish advertisements to the following purpose101 that in order to encourage the wearing of irish manufactures in silk and woollen they gave notice to the nobility and gentry of the kingdom that they the undersigned would enter into bonds for themselves and for each other to sell the several sorts of stuffs cloths and silks made to the best perfection they were able for certain fixed prices and in such a manner that if a child were sent to any of their shops the buyer might be secure of the value and goodness and measure of the ware and lest this might be thought to look like a monopoly any other member of the trade might be admitted upon such conditions as should be agreed on and if any person whatsoever should complain that he was ill used in the value or goodness of what he bought the matter should be examined the person injured be fully satisfied by the whole corporation without delay and the dishonest seller be struck out of the society unless it appeared evidently that the failure proceeded only from mistake  the mortal danger is that if these dealers could prevail by the goodness and cheapness of their cloths and stuffs to give a turn to the principal people of ireland in favour of their goods they would relapse into the knavish practice peculiar to this kingdom which is apt to run through all trades even so low as a common aleseller who as soon as he gets a vogue for his liquor and outsells his neighbour thinks his credit will put off the worst he can buy till his customers will come no more thus i have known at london in a general mourning the drapers dye black all their old damaged goods and sell them at double rates and then complain and petition the court that they are ready to starve by the continuance of the mourning  therefore i say those principal weavers who would enter in such a compact as i have mentioned must give sufficient security against all such practices for if once the women can persuade their husbands that foreign goods besides the finery will be as cheap and do more service our last state will be worse than the first  i do not here pretend to digest perfectly the method by which these principal shopkeepers shall proceed in such a proposal but my meaning is clear enough and cannot reasonably be objected against  we have seen what a destructive loss the kingdom received by the detestable fraud of the merchants or northern weavers or both notwithstanding all the care of the governers at that board the whole trade with spain for our linen when we had an offer of commerce with the spaniards to the value as i am told of three hundred thousand pounds a year but while we deal like pedlars we shall practise like pedlars and sacrifice all honesty to the present urging advantage  what i have said may serve as an answer to the desire made me by the corporation of weavers that i would offer my notions to the public as to anything further let them apply themselves to the parliament in their next session let them prevail in the house of commons to grant one very reasonable request and i shall think there is still some spirit left in the nation when i read a vote to this purpose resolved nemine contradicente that this house will for the future wear no clothes but such as are made of irish growth or of irish manufacture nor will permit their wives or children to wear any other and that they will to the utmost endeavour to prevail with their friends relations dependants and tenants to follow their example and if at the same time they could banish tea and coffee and chinaware out of their families and force their wives to chat their scandal over an infusion of sage or other wholesome domestic vegetables we might possibly be able to subsist and pay our absentees pensioners generals civil officers appeals colliers temporary travellers students schoolboys splenetic visitors of bath tunbridge and epsom with all other smaller drains by sending our crude unwrought goods to england and receiving from thence and all other countries nothing but what is fully manufactured and keep a few potatoes and oatmeal for our own subsistence  i have been for a dozen years past wisely prognosticating the present condition of this kingdom which any human creature of common sense could foretell with as little sagacity as myself my meaning is that a consumptive body must needs die which hath spent all its spirits and received no nourishment yet i am often tempted to pity when i hear the poor farmer and cottager lamenting the hardness of the times and imputing them either to one or two ill seasons which better climates than ours are more exposed to or to the scarcity of silver which to a nation of liberty would be only a slight and temporary inconveniency to be removed at a months warning  ap 1729     observations  occasioned by reading a paper entitled the  case of the woollen manufactures  of dublin etc102   the paper called the case of the woollen manufactures c is very well drawn up the reasonings of the authors are just the facts true and the consequences natural but his censure of those seven vile citizens who import such a quantity of silk stuffs and woollen cloth from england is an hundred times gentler than enemies to their country deserve because i think no punishment in this world can be great enough for them without immediate repentance and amendment but after all the writer of that paper hath very lightly touched one point of the greatest importance and very poorly answered the main objection that the clothiers are defective both in the quality and quantity of their goods  for my own part when i consider the several societies of handicraftsmen in all kinds as well as shopkeepers in this city after eighteen years experience of their dealings i am at a loss to know in which of these societies the most or least honesty is to be found for instance when any trade comes first into my head upon examination i determine it exceeds all others in fraud but after i have considered them all round as far as my knowledge or experience reacheth i am at a loss to determine and to save trouble i put them all upon a par this i chiefly apply to those societies of men who get their livelihood by the labour of their hands for as to shopkeepers i cannot deny that i have found some few honest men among them taking the word honest in the largest and most charitable sense but as to handicraftsmen although i shall endeavour to believe it possible to find a fair dealer among their clans yet i confess it hath never been once my good fortune to employ one single workman who did not cheat me at all times to the utmost of his power in the materials the work and the price one universal maxim i have constantly observed among them that they would rather gain a shilling by cheating you than twenty in the honest way of dealing although they were sure to lose your custom as well as that of others whom you might probably recommend to them  this i must own is the natural consequence of poverty and oppression these wretched people catch at any thing to save them a minute longer from drowning thus ireland is the poorest of all civilized countries in europe with every natural advantage to make it one of the richest  as to the grand objection which this writer slubbers over in so careless a manner because indeed it was impossible to find a satisfactory answer i mean the knavery of our woollen manufacturers in general i shall relate some facts which i had more opportunities to observe than usually fall in the way of men who are not of the trade for some years the masters and wardens with many of their principal workmen and shopkeepers came often to the deanery to relate their grievances and to desire my advice as well as my assistance what reasons might move them to this proceeding i leave to public conjecture the truth is that the woollen manufacture of this kingdom sate always nearest my heart but the greatest difficulty lay in these perpetual differences between the shopkeepers and workmen they employed ten or a dozen of these latter often came to the deanery with their complaints which i often repeated to the shopkeepers as that they brought their prices too low for a poor weaver to get his bread by and instead of ready money for their labour on saturdays they gave them only such a quantity of cloth or stuff at the highest rate which the poor men were often forced to sell onethird below the rate to supply their urgent necessities on the other side the shopkeepers complained of idleness and want of skill or care or honesty in their workmen and probably their accusations on both sides were just  whenever the weavers in a body came to me for advice i gave it freely that they should contrive some way to bring their goods into reputation and give up that abominable principle of endeavouring to thrive by imposing bad ware at high prices to their customers whereby no shopkeeper can reasonably expect to thrive for besides the dread of gods anger which is a motive of small force among them they may be sure that no buyer of common sense will return to the same shop where he was once or twice defrauded that gentlemen and ladies when they found nothing but deceit in the sale of irish cloths and stuffs would act as they ought to do both in prudence and resentment in going to those very bad citizens the writer mentions and purchase english goods  i went farther and proposed that ten or a dozen of the most substantial woollendrapers should join in publishing an advertisement signed with their names to the following purposethat for the better encouragement of all gentlemen c the persons undernamed did bind themselves mutually to sell their several cloths and stuffs naming each kind at the lowest rate right merchantable goods of such a breadth which they would warrant to be good according to the several prices and that if a child of ten years old were sent with money and directions what cloth or stuff to buy he should not be wronged in any one article and that whoever should think himself illused in any of the said shops he should have his money again from the seller or upon his refusal from the rest of the said subscribers who if they found the buyer discontented with the cloth or stuff should be obliged to refund the money and if the seller refused to repay them and take his goods again should publicly advertise that they would answer for none of his goods any more this would be to establish credit upon which all trade dependeth  i proposed this scheme several times to the corporation of weavers as well as to the manufacturers when they came to apply for my advice at the deaneryhouse i likewise went to the shops of several woollendrapers upon the same errand but always in vain for they perpetually gave me the deaf ear and avoided entering into discourse upon that proposal i suppose because they thought it was in vain and that the spirit of fraud had gotten too deep and universal a possession to be driven out by any arguments from interest reason or conscience     the  present miserable state  of  ireland          note        the following tract was taken by sir walter scott from a little      miscellaneous 12mo volume of pamphlets communicated by mr      hartsonge relating chiefly to irish affairs the property at one      time of thomas kingsbury esq son of dr kingsbury who attended      swift in his last illness the present editor came across a      similar volume while on a visit of research in dublin among the      collection of books which belonged to the late sir w gilbert and      which were being catalogued for auction by the bookseller mr      odonoghue the little 12mo contained this tract which had as sir      w scott points out a portrait of swift at the end on the recto      of the last leaf       according to sir w scott the friend in dublin to whom the letter      is supposed to be addressed was sir robert walpole if scott be      correct and there seems little reason to doubt his conjecture the      tract must have been written in the second half of the year 1726      in the early part of that year swift had an interview with walpole      our knowledge of what transpired at that interview is obtained from      swifts letter of april 28th 1726 to lord peterborough from      swifts letter to dr stopford of july 20th 1726 from popes      letter to swift of september 3rd 1726 and from swifts letter to      lady betty germaine of january 8th 17323 from these letters we      learn that swift was really invited by walpole to meet him swifts      visit to england concerned itself mainly with the publication of      gullivers travels but sir henry craik thinks that swift had      other thoughts as regards politics says this biographer he      was encouraged to hope that without loss either of honour or      consistency it was open to him to make terms with the new powers      in the end the result proved that he either overestimated his own      capacity of surrendering his independence or underestimated the      terms that would be exacted this remark would leave it open for a      reader to conclude that swift would at a certain price have been      ready to join walpole and his party but the letters referred to do      not in the least warrant such a conclusion swifts thought was for      ireland and had he been successful with walpole in his pleading      for irelands cause that minister might have found an ally in      swift but the price to be paid was not to the man from swifts      letter to peterborough we are at once introduced to irelands case      and his point of view on this was so opposed to walpoles      preconceived notions of how best to govern ireland as well as of      his settled plans that swift found as he put it that walpole      had conceived opinions  which i could not reconcile to the      notions i had of liberty not at all of his own liberty but of      that of the liberty of a nation for as he says giving now the      quotation in full i had no other design in desiring to see sir      robert walpole than to represent the affairs of ireland to him in      a true light not only without any view to myself but to any party      whatsoever  i failed very much in my design for i saw that he      had conceived opinions from the example and practices of the      present and some former governors which i could not reconcile to      the notions i had of liberty the part given here in italics is      omitted by sir h craik in his quotation       swift saw walpole twiceonce at walpoles invitation at a dinner      at chelsea and a second time at his own wish expressed through      lord peterborough at the first meeting nothing of politics could      be broached as the encounter was a public one the second meeting      was private and resulted in nothing the letter to peterborough was      written by swift the day after he had seen walpole and      peterborough was requested to show it to that minister the letter      is so pertinent to the subjectmatter of this volume that it is      printed here                                                     april 28th 1726             swift to the earl of peterborough       my lord       your lordship having at my request obtained for me an hour from      sir robert walpole i accordingly attended him yesterday at eight      oclock in the morning and had somewhat more than an hours      conversation with him your lordship was this day pleased to      inquire what passed between that great minister and me to which i      gave you some general answers from whence you said you could      comprehend little or nothing       i had no other design in desiring to see sir robert walpole than      to represent the affairs of ireland to him in a true light not      only without any view to myself but to any party whatsoever and      because i understood the affairs of that kingdom tolerably well      and observed the representations he had received were such as i      could not agree to my principal design was to set him right not      only for the service of ireland but likewise of england and of      his own administration       i failed very much in my design for i saw he had conceived      opinions from the example and practices of the present and some      former governors which i could not reconcile to the notions i had      of liberty a possession always understood by the british nation to      be the inheritance of a human creature       sir robert walpole was pleased to enlarge very much upon the      subject of ireland in a manner so alien from what i conceived to      be the rights and privileges of a subject of england that i did      not think proper to debate the matter with him so much as i      otherwise might because i found it would be in vain i shall      therefore without entering into dispute make bold to mention to      your lordship some few grievances of that kingdom as it consists      of a people who beside a natural right of enjoying the privileges      of subjects have also a claim of merit from their extraordinary      loyalty to the present king and his family       first that all persons born in ireland are called and treated as      irishmen although their fathers and grandfathers were born in      england and their predecessors having been conquerors of ireland      it is humbly considered they ought to be on as good a foot as any      subjects of britain according to the practice of all other      nations and particularly of the greeks and romans       secondly that they are denied the natural liberty of exporting      their manufactures to any country which is not engaged in a war      with england       thirdly that whereas there is a university in ireland founded by      queen elizabeth where youth are instructed with a much stricter      discipline than either in oxford or cambridge it lies under the      greatest discouragements by filling all the principal employments      civil and ecclesiastical with persons from england who have      neither interest property acquaintance nor alliance in that      kingdom contrary to the practice of all other states in europe      which are governed by viceroys at least what hath never been used      without the utmost discontents of the people       fourthly that several of the bishops sent over to ireland having      been clergymen of obscure condition and without other distinction      than that of chaplains to the governors do frequently invite over      their old acquaintances or kindred to whom they bestow the best      preferment in their gift the like may be said of the judges who      take with them one or two dependants to whom they give their      countenance and who consequently without other merit grow      immediately into the chief business of their courts the same      practice is followed by all others in civil employments if they      have a cousin a valet or footman in their family born in      england       fifthly that all civil employments granted in reversion are      given to persons who reside in england       the people of ireland who are certainly the most loyal subjects      in the world cannot but conceive that most of these hardships have      been the consequence of some unfortunate representations at least      in former times and the whole body of the gentry feel the effects      in a very sensible part being utterly destitute of all means to      make provision for their younger sons either in the church the      law the revenue or of late in the army and in the desperate      condition of trade it is equally vain to think of making them      merchants all they have left is at the expiration of leases to      rack their tenants which they have done to such a degree that      there is not one farmer in a hundred through the kingdom who can      afford shoes or stockings to his children or to eat flesh or      drink anything better than sour milk or water twice in a year so      that the whole country except the scottish plantation in the      north is a scene of misery and desolation hardly to be matched on      this side of lapland       the rents of ireland are computed to about a million and a half      whereof one half million at least is spent by lords and gentlemen      residing in england and by some other articles too long to      mention       about three hundred thousand pounds more are returned thither on      other accounts and upon the whole those who are the best versed      in that kind of knowledge agree that england gains annually by      ireland a million at least which even i could make appear beyond      all doubt       but as this mighty profit would probably increase with tolerable      treatment to half a million more so it must of necessity sink      under the hardships that kingdom lies at present       and whereas sir robert walpole was pleased to take notice how      little the king gets by ireland it ought perhaps to be      considered that the revenues and taxes i think amount to above      four hundred thousand pounds ayear and reckoning the riches of      ireland compared with england to be as one to twelve the kings      revenues there would be equal to more than five millions here      which considering the bad payment of rents from such miserable      creatures as most of the tenants in ireland are will be allowed to      be as much as such a kingdom can bear       the current coin of ireland is reckoned at most but at five      hundred thousand pounds so that above fourfifths are paid every      year into the exchequer       i think it manifest that whatever circumstances could possibly      contribute to make a country poor and despicable are all united      with respect to ireland the nation controlled by laws to which      they do not consent disowned by their brethren and countrymen      refused the liberty not only of trading with their own      manufactures but even their native commodities forced to seek for      justice many hundred miles by sea and land rendered in a manner      incapable of serving their king and country in any employment of      honour trust or profit and all this without the least demerit      while the governors sent over thither can possibly have no      affection to the people further than what is instilled into them      by their own justice and love of mankind which do not always      operate and whatever they please to represent hither is never      called in question       whether the representatives of such a people thus distressed and      laid in the dust when they meet in a parliament can do the public      business with that cheerfulness which might be expected from      freeborn subjects would be a question in any other country except      that unfortunate island the english inhabitants whereof have given      more and greater examples of their loyalty and dutifulness than      can be shown in any other part of the world       what part of these grievances may be thought proper to be      redressed by so wise and great a minister as sir robert walpole he      perhaps will please to consider especially because they have been      all brought upon that kingdom since the revolution which however      is a blessing annually celebrated there with the greatest zeal and      sincerity       i most humbly entreat your lordship to give this paper to sir      robert walpole and desire him to read it which he may do in a few      minutes i am with the greatest respect my lord                                   your lordships                                        most obedient and humble servant                                                           jon swift       scott thinks that had swift been anxious for personal favours from      walpole he could easily have obtained them but the minister did      not choose to gain his adherence at the expense of sacrificing the      system which had hitherto guided england in her conduct towards the      sister kingdom and the patriot of ireland was not to be won at a      cheaper rate than the emancipation of his country       the original pamphlet bears neither date nor printers name       t s     the present miserable state of ireland   sir  by the last packets i had the favour of yours and am surprised that you should apply to a person so ill qualified as i am for a full and impartial account of the state of our trade i have always lived as retired as possible i have carefully avoided the perplexed honour of cityoffices i have never minded anybodys business but my own upon all which accounts and several others you might easily have found among my fellowcitizens persons more capable to resolve the weighty questions you put to me than i can pretend to be  but being entirely at leisure even at this season of the year when i used to have scarce time sufficient to perform the necessary offices of life i will endeavour to comply with your requests cautioning you not implicitly to rely upon what i say excepting what belongs to that branch of trade in which i am more immediately concerned  the irish trade is at present in the most deplorable condition that can be imagined to remedy it the causes of its languishment must be inquired into but as those causes you may assure yourself will not be removed you may look upon it as a thing past hopes of recovery  the first and greatest shock our trade received was from an act passed in the reign of king william in the parliament of england prohibiting the exportation of wool manufactured in ireland an act as the event plainly shews fuller of greediness than good policy an act as beneficial to france and spain as it has been destructive to england and ireland103 at the passing of this fatal act the condition of our trade was glorious and flourishing though no way interfering with the english we made no broadcloths above 6s per yard coarse druggets bays and shalloons worsted damasks strong draught works slight halfworks and gaudy stuffs were the only product of our looms these were partly consumed by the meanest of our people and partly sent to the northern nations from which we had in exchange timber iron hemp flax pitch tar and hard dollars at the time the current money of ireland was foreign silver a man could hardly receive 100l without finding the coin of all the northern powers and every prince of the empire among it this money was returned into england for fine cloths silks c for our own wear for rents for coals for hardware and all other english manufactures and in a great measure supplied the london merchants with foreign silver for exportation  the repeated clamours of the english weavers produced this act so destructive to themselves and us they looked with envious eyes upon our prosperity and complained of being undersold by us in those commodities which they themselves did not deal in at their instances the act was passed and we lost our profitable northern trade have they got it no surely you have found they have ever since declined in the trade they so happily possessed you shall find if i am rightly informed towns without one loom in them which subsisted entirely upon the woollen manufactory before the passing of this unhappy bill and i will try if i can give the true reasons for the decay of their trade and our calamities  three parts in four of the inhabitants of that district of the town where i dwell were english manufacturers whom either misfortunes in trade little petty debts contracted through idleness or the pressures of a numerous family had driven into our cheap country these were employed in working up our coarse wool while the finest was sent into england several of these had taken the children of the native irish apprentices to them who being humbled by the forfeiture of upward of three millions by the revolution were obliged to stoop to a mechanic industry upon the passing of this bill we were obliged to dismiss thousands of these people from our service those who had settled their affairs returned home and overstocked england with workmen those whose debts were unsatisfied went to france spain and the netherlands where they met with good encouragement whereby the natives having got a firm footing in the trade being acute fellows soon became as good workmen as any we have and supply the foreign manufactories with a constant recruit of artisans our island lying much more under pasture than any in europe the foreigners notwithstanding all the restrictions the english parliament has bound us up with are furnished with the greatest quantity of our choicest wool i need not tell you sir that a customhouse oath is held as little sacred here as in england or that it is common for masters of vessels to swear themselves bound for one of the english wool ports and unload in france or spain by this means the trade in those parts is in a great measure destroyed and we were obliged to try our hands at finer works having only our home consumption to depend upon and i can assure you we have in several kinds of narrow goods even exceeded the english and i believe we shall in a few years more be able to equal them in broad cloths but this you may depend upon that scarce the tenth part of english goods are now imported of what used to be before the famous act  the only manufactured wares we are allowed to export are linen cloth and linen yarn which are marketable only in england the rest of our commodities are wool restrained to england and raw hides skins tallow beef and butter now these are things for which the northern nations have no occasion we are therefore obliged instead of carrying woollen goods to their markets and bringing home money to purchase their commodities  in france spain and portugal our wares are more valuable though it must be owned our fraudulent trade in wool is the best branch of our commerce from hence we get wines brandy and fruit very cheap and in great perfection so that though england has constrained us to be poor they have given us leave to be merry from these countries we bring home moydores pistoles and louisdores without which we should scarce have a penny to turn upon  to england we are allowed to send nothing but linen cloth yarn raw hides skins tallow and wool from thence we have coals for which we always pay ready money india goods english woollen and silks tobacco hardware earthenware salt and several other commodities our exportations to england are very much overbalanced by our importations so that the course of exchange is generally too high and people choose rather to make their remittances to england in specie than by a bill and our nation is perpetually drained of its little running cash  another cause of the decay of trade scarcity of money and swelling of exchange is the unnatural affectation of our gentry to reside in and about london104 their rents are remitted to them and spent there the countryman wants employment from them the country shopkeeper wants their custom for this reason he cant pay his dublin correspondent readily nor take off a great quantity of his wares therefore the dublin merchant cant employ the artisan nor keep up his credit in foreign markets  i have discoursed some of these gentlemen persons esteemed for good sense and demanded a reason for this their so unaccountable proceedingexpensive to them for the present ruinous to their country and destructive to the future value of their estatesand find all their answers summed up under three heads curiosity pleasure and loyalty to king george the two first excuses deserve no answer let us try the validity of the third would not loyalty be much better expressed by gentlemen staying in their respective countries influencing their dependents by their examples saving their own wealth and letting their neighbours profit by their necessary expenses thereby keeping them from misery and its unavoidable consequence discontent or is it better to flock to london be lost in a crowd kiss the kings hand and take a view of the royal family the seeing of the royal house may animate their zeal for it but other advantages i know not what employment have any of our gentlemen got by their attendance at court to make up to them their expenses why about forty of them have been created peers and a little less than a hundred of them baronets and knights for these excellent advantages thousands of our gentry have squeezed their tenants impoverished the trader and impaired their own fortunes  another great calamity is the exorbitant raising of the rents of lands upon the determination of all leases made before the year 1690 a gentleman thinks he has but indifferently improved his estate if he has only doubled his rentroll farms are screwed up to a rackrent leases granted but for a small term of years tenants tied down to hard conditions and discouraged from cultivating the lands they occupy to the best advantage by the certainty they have of the rent being raised on the expiration of their lease proportionably to the improvements they shall make thus is honest industry restrained the farmer is a slave to his landlord tis well if he can cover his family with a coarse homespun frieze the artisan has little dealings with him yet he is obliged to take his provisions from him at an extravagant price otherwise the farmer cannot pay his rent  the proprietors of lands keep great part of them in their own hands for sheeppasture and there are thousands of poor wretches who think themselves blessed if they can obtain a hut worse than the squires dogkennel and an acre of ground for a potatoplantation on condition of being as very slaves as any in america what can be more deplorable than to behold wretches starving in the midst of plenty  we are apt to charge the irish with laziness because we seldom find them employed but then we dont consider they have nothing to do sir william temple in his excellent remarks on the united provinces inquires why holland which has the fewest and worst ports and commodities of any nation in europe should abound in trade and ireland which has the most and best of both should have none this great man attributes this surprising accident to the natural aversion man has for labour who will not be persuaded to toil and fatigue himself for the superfluities of life throughout the week when he may provide himself with all necessary subsistence by the labour of a day or two but with due submission to sir williams profound judgment the want of trade with us is rather owing to the cruel restraints we lie under than to any disqualification whatsoever in our inhabitants  i have not sir for these thirty years past since i was concerned in trade the greatest part of which time distresses have been flowing in upon us ever observed them to swell so suddenly to such a height as they have done within these few months our present calamities are not to be represented you can have no notion of them without beholding them numbers of miserable objects crowd our doors begging us to take their wares at any price to prevent their families from immediate starving we cannot part with our money to them both because we know not when we shall have vent for their goods and as there are no debts paid we are afraid of reducing ourselves to their lamentable circumstances the dismal time of trade we had during marrs troubles in scotland are looked upon as happy days when compared with the present105  i need not tell you sir that this griping want this dismal poverty this additional woe must be put to the accursed stocks which have desolated our country more effectually than england stockjobbing was a kind of traffic we were utterly unacquainted with we went late to the south sea market and bore a great share in the losses of it without having tasted any of its profits  if many in england have been ruined by stocks some have been advanced the english have a free and open trade to repair their losses but above all a wise vigilant and uncorrupted parliament and ministry strenuously endeavouring to restore public trade to its former happy state whilst we having lost the greatest part of our cash without any probability of its returning must despair of retrieving our losses by trade and have before our eyes the dismal prospect of universal poverty and desolation  i believe sir you are by this time heartily tired with this indigested letter and are firmly persuaded of the truth of what i said in the beginning of it that you had much better have imposed this task on some of our citizens of greater abilities but perhaps sir such a letter as this may be for the singularity of it entertaining to you who correspond with the politest and most learned men in europe but i am satisfied you will excuse its want of exactness and perspicuity when you consider my education my being unaccustomed to writings of this nature and above all those calamitous objects which constantly surround us sufficient to disturb the cleanest imagination and the soundest judgment  whatever cause i have given you by this letter to think worse of my sense and judgment i fancy i have given you a manifest proof that i am sir                                 your most obedient humble servant                                                                j s     the substance  of what was said by  the dean of st patricks  to  the lord mayor and some of the aldermen  when his lordship came to present the said  dean with his freedom in a gold box          note        it was only proper and fitting that the citizens and freemen of the      city of dublin should express their sense of the high appreciation      in which they held the writer of the drapiers letters and the      man who had fought and was still fighting for an alleviation of the      grievances under which their country suffered the dublin      corporation in 1729 presented swift with the freedom of the city      an honour rarely bestowed and only on men in high position and      power to swift the honour was welcome it was a public act of      justification of what he had done and it came gratefully to the      man who had at one time been abused and reviled by the people of      the very city which was now honouring him furthermore such a      confirmation of his acts set the seal of public authority which was      desirable even if not necessary to a man of swifts temper he      could save himself much trouble by merely pointing to the gold box      which was presented to him with the freedom even in this last      moment however of public recognition he was not allowed to      receive it without a snarl from one of the crowd of the many      slanderers who found it safer to backbite him lord allen may have      been wrong in his head or illadvised or foolishly overzealous      but his illtempered upbraiding of the dublin corporation for what      he called their treasonable extravagance in thus honouring swift      whom he deemed an enemy of the king was the act of a fool swift      was not the man to let the occasion slip by without advantage in      the substance of what he said to the lord mayor and aldermen of      dublin in accepting their gift he replied to the charges made by      lord allen and also issued a special advertisement by way of      defence against what the lord had thought fit to say                                            both these pieces are here reprinted the first from a broadside in      the british museum and the second from a manuscript copy in the      forster collection at south kensington       t s     the substance of what was said by the dean of st patricks  to the lord mayor and some of the aldermen when his lordship came to present the said dean with his freedom in a gold box   when his lordship had said a few words and presented the instrument the dean gently put it back and desired first to be heard he said he was much obliged to his lordship and the city for the honour they were going to do him and which as he was informed they had long intended him that it was true this honour was mingled with a little mortification by the delay which attended it but which however he did not impute to his lordship or the city and that the mortification was the less because he would willingly hope the delay was founded on a mistakefor which opinion he would tell his reason  he said it was well known that some time ago a person with a title106 was pleased in two great assemblies to rattle bitterly somebody without a name under the injurious appellations of a tory a jacobite an enemy to king george and a libeller of the government which character the dean said that many people thought was applied to him but he was unwilling to be of that opinion because the person who had delivered those abusive words had for several years caressed and courted and solicited his friendship more than any man in either kingdom had ever doneby inviting him to his house in town and countryby coming to the deanery often and calling or sending almost every day when the dean was sickwith many other particulars of the same nature which continued even to a day or two of the time when the said person made those invectives in the council and house of lords therefore that the dean would by no means think those scurrilous words could be intended against him because such a proceeding would overthrow all the principles of honour justice religion truth and even common humanity therefore the dean will endeavour to believe that the said person had some other object in his thoughts and it was only the uncharitable custom of the world that applied this character to him however that he would insist on this argument no longer but one thing he would affirm and declare without assigning any name or making any exception that whoever either did or does or shall hereafter at any time charge him with the character of a jacobite an enemy to king george or a libeller of the government the said accusation was is and will be false malicious slanderous and altogether groundless and he would take the freedom to tell his lordship and the rest that stood by that he had done more service to the hanover title and more disservice to the pretenders cause than forty thousand of those noisy railing malicious empty zealots to whom nature hath denied any talent that could be of use to god or their country and left them only the gift of reviling and spitting their venom against all who differ from them in their destructive principles both in church and state that he confessed it was sometimes his misfortune to dislike some things in public proceedings in both kingdoms wherein he had often the honour to agree with wise and good men but this did by no means affect either his loyalty to his prince or love to his country but on the contrary he protested that such dislikes never arose in him from any other principles than the duty he owed to the king and his affection to the kingdom that he had been acquainted with courts and ministers long enough and knew too well that the best ministers might mistake in points of great importance and that he had the honour to know many more able and at least full as honest as any can be at present  the dean further said that since he had been so falsely represented he thought it became him to give some account of himself for about twenty years if it were only to justify his lordship and the city for the honour they were going to do him he related briefly how merely by his own personal credit without other assistance and in two journeys at his own expense he had procured a grant of the firstfruits to the clergy in the late queens time for which he thought he deserved some gentle treatment from his brethren107 that during all the administration of the said ministry he had been a constant advocate for those who are called the whigsand kept many of them in their employments both in england and hereand some who were afterwards the first to lift up their heels against him he reflected a little upon the severe treatment he had met with upon his return to ireland after her majestys death and for some years after that being forced to live retired he could think of no better way to do public service than by employing all the little money he could save and lending it without interest in small sums to poor industrious tradesmen without examining their party or their faith and god had so far pleased to bless his endeavours that his managers tell him he hath recovered above two hundred families in this city from ruin and placed most of them in a comfortable way of life  the dean related how much he had suffered in his purse and with what hazard to his liberty by a most iniquitous judge108 who to gratify his ambition and rage of party had condemned an innocent book written with no worse a design than to persuade the people of this kingdom to wear their own manufactures109 how the said judge had endeavoured to get a jury to his mind but they proved so honest that he was forced to keep them eleven hours and send them back nine times until at last they were compelled to leave the printer110 to the mercy of the court and the dean was forced to procure a noli prosequi from a noble person then secretary of state who had been his old friend  the dean then freely confessed himself to be the author of those books called the drapiers letters spoke gently of the proclamation offering three hundred pounds to discover the writer111 he said that although a certain person was pleased to mention those books in a slight manner at a public assembly yet he the dean had learned to believe that there were ten thousand to one in the kingdom who differed from that person and the people of england who had ever heard of the matter as well as in france were all of the same opinion  the dean mentioned several other particulars some of which those from whom i had the account could not recollect and others although of great consequence perhaps his enemies would not allow him  the dean concluded with acknowledging to have expressed his wishes that an inscription might have been graven on the box shewing some reason why the city thought fit to do him that honour which was much out of the common forms to a person in a private stationthose distinctions being usually made only to chief governors or persons in very high employments     advertisement by dr swift  in his  defence against joshua lord allen  feb 18 1729     advertisement by dr swift in his defence against joshua lord allen112   whereas dr jonathan swift dean of st patricks dublin hath been credibly informed that on friday the 13th of this instant february a certain person did in a public place and in the hearing of a great number apply himself to the right honourable the lord mayor of this city and some of his brethren in the following reproachful manner my lord you and your city can squander away the public money in giving a gold box to a fellow who hath libelled the government or words to that effect  now if the said words or words to the like effect were intended against him the said dean and as a reflection on the right hon the lord mayor aldermen and commons for their decreeing unanimously and in full assembly the freedom of this city to the said dean in an honourable manner on account of an opinion they had conceived of some services done by him the said dean to this city and to the kingdom in generalthe said dean doth declare that the said words or words to the like effect are insolent false scandalous malicious and in a particular manner perfidious the said person who is reported to have spoken the said or the like words having for some years past and even within some few days professed a great friendship for the said dean and what is hardly credible sending a common friend of the dean and himself not many hours after the said or the like words had been spoken to renew his profession of friendship to the said dean but concealing the oratory whereof the said dean had no account till the following day and then told it to all his friends     a  letter  on  mr mcullas project about halfpence  and a new one proposed  written in 1729          note        the matter of this tract explains itself mcullas project was to      put in circulation notes stamped on copper to supply the deficiency      in copper coins which wood attempted swift apparently took a      mild tone towards mcullas plan but thought that mculla would      make too much out of it for himself he made a counter proposal      which is fully entered into here nothing came either of mcullas      proposal or swifts countersuggestion                                            the present text is based on that given in the eighth volume of the      edition of 1765 and compared with that of faulkners edition of      1772 faulkners edition differs in many details from that given by      scott the first sheet only of the original autograph manuscript is      in the forster collection at south kensington       t s     a letter on mr mcullas project about halfpence and a new one proposed    sir  you desire to know my opinion concerning mr mcullas project of circulating notes stamped on copper that shall pass for the value of halfpence and pence i have some knowledge of the man and about a month ago he brought me his book with a couple of his halfpenny notes but i was then out of order and he could not be admitted since that time i called at his house where i discoursed the whole affair with him as thoroughly as i could i am altogether a stranger to his character he talked to me in the usual style with a great profession of zeal for the public good which is the common cant of all projectors in their bills from a first minister of state down to a corncutter but i stopped him short as i would have done a better man because it is too gross a pretence to pass at any time and especially in this age where we all know one another so well yet whoever proposeth any scheme which may prove to be a public benefit i shall not quarrel if it prove likewise very beneficial to the contriver it is certain that next to the want of silver our greatest distress in point of coin is the want of small change which may be some poor relief for the defect of the former since the crown will not please to take that work upon them here as they do in england one thing in mr mcullas book is certainly right that no law hinders me from giving a payable note upon leather wood copper brass iron or any other material except gold and silver as well as upon paper the question is whether i can sue him on a copper bond when there is neither his hand nor seal nor witnesses to prove it to supply this he hath proposed that the materials upon which his note is written shall be in some degree of value equal to the debt but that is one principal matter to be enquired into his scheme is this  he gives you a piece of copper for a halfpenny or penny stamped with a promissory note to pay you twentypence for every pound of the said copper notes whenever you shall return them eight and forty of the halfpenny pieces are to weigh a pound and he sells you that pound coined and stamped for two shillings by which he clearly gains a little more than sixteen per cent that is to say twopence in every shilling this will certainly arise to a great sum if he should circulate as large a quantity of his notes as the kingdom under the great dearth of silver may very probably require enough indeed to make any irish tradesmans fortune which however i should not repine at in the least if we could be sure of his fairdealing  it was obvious for me to raise the common objection why mr mculla would not give security to pay the whole sum to any man who returned him his copper notes as my lord dartmouth and colonel moor were by their patents obliged to do113 to which he gave some answers plausible enough first he conceived that his coins were much nearer to the intrinsic value than any of those coined by patents the bulk and goodness of the metal fully equalling the best english halfpence made by the crown that he apprehended the illwill of envious and designing people who if they found him to have a great vent for his notes since he wanted the protection of a patent might make a run upon him which he could not be able to support and lastly that his copper as is already said being equal in value and bulk to the english halfpence he did not apprehend they should ever be returned unless a combination proceeding from spite and envy might be formed against him  but there are some points in his proposals which i cannot well answer for nor do i know whether he would be able to do it himself the first is whether the copper he gives us will be as good as what the crown provided for the english halfpence and farthings and secondly whether he will always continue to give us as good and thirdly when he will think fit to stop his hand and give us no more for i should be as sorry to lie at the mercy of mr mculla as of mr wood  there is another difficulty of the last importance it is known enough that the crown is supposed to be neither gainer nor loser by the coinage of any metal for they subtract or ought to subtract no more from the intrinsic value than what will just pay all the charges of the mint and how much that will amount to is the question by what i could gather from mr mculla good copper is worth fourteenpence per pound by this computation if he sells his copper notes for two shillings the pound and will pay twentypence back then the expense of coinage for one pound of copper must be sixpence which is thirty per cent the world should be particularly satisfied on this article before he vends his notes for the discount of thirty per cent is prodigious and vastly more than i can conceive it ought to be for if we add to that proportion the sixteen per cent which he avows to keep for his own profit there will be a discount of about fortysix per cent or to reckon i think a fairer way whoever buys a pound of mr mcullas coin at two shillings per pound carries home only the real value of fourteenpence which is a pound of copper and thus he is a loser of 41l 13s 4d per cent114 but however this high discount of thirty per cent will be no objection against mcullas proposals because if the charge of coinage will honestly amount to so much and we suppose his copper notes may be returned upon him he will be the greater sufferer of the two because the buyer can lose but fourpence in the pound and mculla must lose sixpence which was the charge of the coinage115  upon the whole there are some points which must be settled to the general satisfaction before we can safely take mr mcullas copper notes for value received and how he will give that satisfaction is not within my knowledge or conjecture the first point is that we shall be always sure of receiving good copper equal in bulk and fineness to the best english halfpence  the second point is to know what allowance he makes to himself either out of the weight or mixture of his copper or both for the charge of his coinage as to the weight the matter is easy by his own scheme for as i have said before he proposes fortyeight to weigh a pound which he gives you for two shillings and receives it by the pound at twentypence so that supposing pure copper to be fourteenpence a pound he makes you pay thirty per cent for the labour of coining as i have already observed besides sixteen per cent when he sells it but if to this he adds any alloy to debase the metal although it be not above ten per cent then mr mcullas promissory notes will as to the intrinsic value of the metal be above fortyseven per cent discount  for subtracting ten per cent off sixty pounds worth of copper it will to avoid fractions be about five and a half per cent in the whole 100l which added to                        41 13 4                        5 10 0                          will be per cent   47  3 4  that we are under great distress for change and that mr mcullas copper notes on supposition of the metal being pure is less liable to objection than the project of wood may be granted but such a discount where we are not sure even of our twentypence a pound appears hitherto a dead weight on his scheme  since i writ this calling to mind that i had some copper halfpence by me i weighed them with those of mr mculla and observed as follows  first i weighed mr mcullas halfpenny against an english one of king charles ii which outweighed mr mcullas a fourth part or twentyfive per cent  i likewise weighed an irish patrick and david halfpenny which outweighed mr mcullas twelve and a half per cent it had a very fair and deep impression and milled very skilfully round  i found that even a common halfpenny wellpreserved weighed equal to mr mcullas and even some of woods halfpence were near equal in weight to his therefore if it be true that he does not think woods copper to have been faulty he may probably give us no better  i have laid these loose thoughts together with little order to give you and others who may read them an opportunity of digesting them better i am no enemy to mr mcullas project but i would have it put upon a better foot i own that this halfpenny of king charles ii which i weighed against mr mcullas was of the fairest kind i had seen however it is plain the crown could afford it without being a loser116 but it is probable that the officers of the mint were then more honest than they have since thought fit to be for i confess not to have met those of any other year so weighty or in appearance of so good metal among all the copper coins of the three last reigns yet these however did much outweigh those of mr mculla for i have tried the experiment on a hundred of them i have indeed seen accidentally one or two very light but it must certainly have been done by chance or rather i suppose them to be counterfeits be that as it will it is allowed on all hands that good copper was never known to be cheaper than it is at present i am ignorant of the price further than by his informing me that it is only fourteenpence a pound by which i observe he charges the coinage at thirty per cent and therefore i cannot but think his demands are exorbitant but to say the truth the dearness or cheapness of the metal do not properly enter into the question what we desire is that it should be of the best kind and as weighty as can be afforded that the profit of the contriver should be reduced from sixteen to eight per cent and the charge of coinage if possible from thirty to ten or fifteen at most  mr mculla must also give good security that he will coin only a determinate sum not exceeding twenty thousand pounds by which although he should deal with all uprightness imaginable and make his coin as good as that i weighed of king charles ii he will at sixteen per cent gain three thousand two hundred pounds a very good additional job to a private tradesmans fortune  i must advise him also to employ better workmen and make his impressions deeper and plainer by which a rising rim may be left about the edge of his coin to preserve the letter from wearing out too soon he hath no wardens nor masters or other officers of the mint to suck up his profit and therefore can afford to coin cheaper than the crown if he will but find good materials proper implements and skilful workmen  whether this project will succeed in mr mcullas hands which if it be honestly executed i should be glad to see one thing i am confident of that it might be easily brought to perfection by a society of nine or ten honest gentlemen of fortune who wish well to their country and would be content to be neither gainers nor losers further than the bare interest of their money and mr mculla as being the first starter of the scheme might be considered and rewarded by such a society whereof although i am not a man of fortune i should think it an honour and happiness to be one even with borrowed money upon the best security i could give and first i am confident without any skill but by general reason that the charge of coining copper would be very much less than thirty per cent secondly i believe ten thousand pounds in halfpence and farthings would be sufficient for the whole kingdom even under our great and most unnecessary distress for the want of silver and that without such a distress half the sum would suffice for i compute and reason thus the city of dublin by a gross computation contains ten thousand families and i am told by shopkeepers that if silver were as plenty as usual two shillings in copper would be sufficient in the course of business for each family but in consideration of the want of silver i would allow five shillings to each family which would amount to 2500l and to help this i would recommend a currency of all the genuine undefaced harphalfpence which are left of lord dartmouths and moors patents under king charles ii and the small patrick and david for farthings to the rest of the kingdom i would assign the 750l remaining reckoning dublin to answer onefourth of the kingdom as london is judged to answer if i mistake not onethird of england i mean in the view of money only  to compute our want of small change by the number of souls in the kingdom besides being perplexed is i think by no means just they have been reckoned at a million and a half whereof a million at least are beggars in all circumstances except that of wandering about for alms and that circumstance may arrive soon enough when it will be time to add another ten thousand pounds in copper but without doubt the families of ireland who lie chiefly under the difficulties of wanting small change cannot be above forty or fifty thousand which the sum of ten thousand pounds with the addition of the fairest old halfpence would tolerably supply for if we give too great a loose to any projector to pour in upon us what he pleases the kingdom will be how shall i express it under our present circumstances more than undone  and hence appears in a very strong light the villainy of wood who proposed the coinage of one hundred and eight thousand pounds in copper for the use of ireland whereby every family in the kingdom would be loaden with ten or a dozen shillings although wood might not transgress the bounds of his patent and although no counterfeits either at home or abroad were added to the number the contrary to both which would indubitably have arrived so ill informed are great men on the other side who talk of a million with as little ceremony as we do of halfacrown  but to return to the proposal i have made suppose ten gentlemen lovers of their country should raise 200l apiece and from the time the money is deposited as they shall agree should begin to charge it with seven per cent for their own use that they should as soon as possible provide a mint and good workmen and buy copper sufficient for coining two thousand pounds subtracting a fifth part of the interest of ten thousand pounds for the charges of the tools and fitting up a place for a mint the other four parts of the same interest to be subtracted equally out of the four remaining coinages of 2000l each with a just allowance for other necessary incidents let the charge of coinage be fairly reckoned and the kingdom informed of it as well as of the price of copper let the coin be as well and deeply stamped as it ought let the metal be as pure as can consist to have it rightly coined wherein i am wholly ignorant and the bulk as large as that of king charles ii and let this club of ten gentlemen give their joint security to receive all the coins they issue out for seven or ten years and return gold and silver without any defalcation  let the same club or company when they have issued out the first two thousand pounds go on the second year if they find a demand and that their scheme hath answered to their own intention as well as to the satisfaction of the public and if they find seven per cent not sufficient let them subtract eight beyond which i would not have them go and when they have in five years coined ten thousand pounds let them give public notice that they will proceed no further but shut up their mint and dismiss their workmen unless the real universal unsolicited declaration of the nobility and gentry of the kingdom shall signify a desire that they shall go on for a certain sum farther  this company may enter into certain regulations among themselves one of which should be to keep nothing concealed and duly to give an account to the world of their whole methods of acting  give me leave to compute wholly at random what charge the kingdom will be at by the loss of intrinsic value in the coinage of 10000l in copper under the management of such a society of gentlemen  first it is plain that instead of somewhat more than sixteen per cent as demanded by mr mculla this society desires but eight per cent  secondly whereas mr mculla charges the expense of coinage at thirty per cent i hope and believe this society will be able to perform it at ten  thirdly whereas it doth not appear that mr mculla can give any security for the goodness of his copper because not one in ten thousand have the skill to distinguish the society will be all engaged that theirs shall be of the best standard  fourthly that whereas mr mcullas halfpence are onefourth part lighter than that kind coined in the time of king charles ii these gentlemen will oblige themselves to the public to give their coin of the same weight and goodness with those halfpence unless they shall find they cannot afford it and in that case they shall beforehand inform the public show their reasons and signify how large they can make them without being losers and so give over or pursue their scheme as they find the opinion of the world to be however i do not doubt but they can afford them as large and of as good metal as the best english halfpence that have been coined in the three last reigns which very much outweighed those of mr mculla and this advantage will arise in proportion by lessening the charge of coinage from thirty per cent to ten or fifteen or twenty at most but i confess myself in the dark on that article only i think it impossible it should amount to any proportion near thirty per cent otherwise the coiners of those counterfeit halfpence called raps117 would have little encouragement to follow their trade  but the indubitable advantages by having the management in such a society would be the paying eight per cent instead of sixteen the being sure of the goodness and just weight of the coin and the period to be put to any further coinage than what was absolutely necessary to supply the wants and desires of the kingdom and all this under the security of ten gentlemen of credit and fortune who would be ready to give the best security and satisfaction that they had no design to turn the scheme into a job  as to any mistakes i have made in computation they are of little moment and i shall not descend so low as to justify them against any caviller  the strongest objection against what i offer and which perhaps may make it appear visionary is the difficulty to find half a score gentlemen who out of a public spirit will be at the trouble for no more profit than one per cent above the legal interest to be overseers of a mint for five years and perhaps without any justice raise the clamour of the people against them besides it is most certain that many a squire is as fond of a job and as dexterous to make the best of it as mr mculla himself or any of his level  however i do not doubt but there may be ten such persons in this town if they had only some visible mark to know them at sight yet i just foresee another inconveniency that knavish men are fitter to deal with others of their own denomination while those who are honest and bestintentioned may be the instruments of as much mischief to the public for want of cunning as the greatest knaves and more because of the charitable opinion which they are apt to have of others therefore how to join the prudence of the serpent with the innocency of the dove in this affair is the most difficult point it is not so hard to find an honest man as to make this honest man active and vigilant and skilful which i doubt will require a spur of profit greater than my scheme will afford him unless he will be contented with the honour of serving his country and the reward of a good conscience  after reviewing what i had written i see very well that i have not given any allowance for the first charge of preparing all things necessary for coining which i am told will amount to about 200l besides 20l per annum for five years rent of a house to work in i can only say that this making in all 300l it will be an addition of no more than three per cent out of 10000l  but the great advantages to the public by having the coinage placed in the hands of ten gentlemen such as i have already described if such are to be found are these  first they propose no other gain to themselves than one per cent above the legal interest for the money they advance which will hardly afford them coffee when they meet at their minthouse  secondly they bind themselves to make their coins of as good copper as the best english halfpence and as well coined and of equal weight and do likewise bind themselves to charge the public with not one farthing for the expense of coinage more than it shall really stand them in  thirdly they will for a limited term of seven or ten years as shall be thought proper upon mature consideration pay gold and silver without any defalcation for all their own coin that shall be returned upon their hands  fourthly they will take care that the coins shall have a deep impression leaving a rising rim on both sides to prevent being defaced in a long time and the edges shall be milled  i suppose they need not be very apprehensive of counterfeits which it will be difficult to make so as not to be discovered for it is plain that those bad halfpence called raps are so easily distinguished even from the most worn genuine halfpenny that nobody will now take them for a farthing although under the great present want of change  i shall here subjoin some computations relating to mr mcullas copper notes they were sent to me by a person well skilled in such calculations and therefore i refer them to the reader118  mr mculla charges good copper at fourteenpence per pound but i know not whether he means avoirdupois or troy weight    avoirdupois is sixteen ounces to a pound                    6960 grains   a pound troy weight                                         5760 grains     mr mcullas copper is fourteenpence per pound avoirdupois   two of mr mcullas penny notes one with another weigh     524 grains   by which computation two shillings of his notes which he     sells for one pound weight will weigh                     6288 grains   but one pound avoirdupois weighs as above                  6960 grains     this difference makes 10 per cent     to mr mcullas profit in point of weight     the old patrick and david halfpenny weighs                  149 grains     mr mcullas halfpenny weighs                              131 grains                                                                                                          the difference is       18    which is equal to 1012 per cent   the english halfpenny of king charles ii weighs              167 grains   mcullas halfpenny weighs                                    131 grains                                                                                                              the difference      36    which difference allowed a fifth part is 20 per cent   another computation  mr mculla allows his pound of copper coinage included to be worth twentypence for which he demands two shillings    his coinage he computes at sixpence per pound weight therefore     he laying out only twentypence and gaining fourpence     he makes per cent profit                                        20   the sixpence per pound weight allowed for coinage     makes per cent                                                   30   the want of weight in his halfpenny compared as above     is per cent                                                      10   by all which viz coinage profit and want of weight     the public loses per cent                                      60  if mr mcullas coins will not pass and he refuses to receive them back the owner cannot sell them at above twelvepence per pound weight whereby with the defect of weight of 10 per cent he will lose 60 per cent  the scheme of the society raised as high as it can possibly be will be only thus    for interest of their money per cent                               8   for coinage instead of 10 suppose at most per cent               20   for l300 laid out for tools a mint and houserent     charge 3 per cent upon the coinage of l10000                 3                                                                         charges in all upon interest coinage c per cent               31  which with all the advantages abovementioned of the goodness of the metal the largeness of the coin the deepness and fairness of the impression the assurance of the society confining itself to such a sum as they undertake or as the kingdom shall approve and lastly their paying in gold or silver for all their coin returned upon their hands without any defalcation would be of mighty benefit to the kingdom and with a little steadiness and activity could i doubt not be easily compassed  i would not in this scheme recommend the method of promissory notes after mr mcullas manner but as i have seen in old irish coins the words civitas dvblin on one side with the year of our lord and the irish harp on the reverse     a proposal  that  all the ladies and women of ireland  should appear constantly in  irish manufactures          note        the arguments advanced in this tract are practically repetitions of      those already given in previous pieces swift laid much stress on      the people buying and wearing goods made in ireland since in that      way the money would remain in the country in this little tract he      winds up with a special appeal to the women of ireland                                            the present text is based on that of the quarto edition vol      viii of 1765 and compared with faulkners of 1772       t s     a proposal that all the ladies and women of ireland should appear constantly in irish manufactures   there was a treatise written about nine years ago to persuade the people of ireland to wear their own manufactures119 this treatise was allowed to have not one syllable in it of party or disaffection but was wholly founded upon the growing poverty of the nation occasioned by the utter want of trade in every branch except that ruinous importation of all foreign extravagancies from other countries this treatise was presented by the grand jury of the city and county of dublin as a scandalous seditious and factious pamphlet i forget who was the foreman of the city grand jury but the foreman for the county was one doctor seal register to the archbishop of dublin wherein he differed much from the sentiments of his lord120 the printer121 was tried before the late mr whitshed that famous lord chiefjustice who on the bench laying his hand on his heart declared upon his salvation that the author was a jacobite and had a design to beget a quarrel between the two nations122 in the midst of this prosecution about fifteen hundred weavers were forced to beg their bread and had a general contribution made for their relief which just served to make them drunk for a week and then they were forced to turn rogues or strolling beggars or to leave the kingdom  the duke of grafton123 who was then lieutenant being perfectly ashamed of so infamous and unpopular a proceeding obtained from england a noli prosequi for the printer yet the grand jury had solemn thanks given them from the secretary of state  i mention this passage perhaps too much forgotten to shew how dangerous it hath been for the best meaning person to write one syllable in the defence of his country or discover the miserable condition it is in  and to prove this truth i will produce one instance more wholly omitting the famous case of the drapier and the proclamation against him as well as the perverseness of another jury against the same mr whitshed who was violently bent to act the second part in another scene124  about two years ago there was a small paper printed which was called a short view of the state of ireland relating the several causes whereby any country may grow rich and applying them to ireland125 whitshed was dead and consequently the printer was not troubled mist the famous journalist happened to reprint this paper in london for which his pressfolks were prosecuted for almost a twelvemonth and for aught i know are not yet discharged126  this is our case insomuch that although i am often without money in my pocket i dare not own it in some company for fear of being thought disaffected  but since i am determined to take care that the author of this paper shall not be discovered following herein the most prudent practice of the drapier i will venture to affirm that the three seasons wherein our corn hath miscarried did no more contribute to our present misery than one spoonful of water thrown upon a rat already drowned would contribute to his death and that the present plentiful harvest although it should be followed by a dozen ensuing would no more restore us than it would the rat aforesaid to put him near the fire which might indeed warm his fur coat but never bring him back to life  the short of the matter is this the distresses of the kingdom are operating more and more every day by very large degrees and so have been doing for above a dozen years past  if you demand from whence these distresses have arisen i desire to ask the following question  if twothirds of any kingdoms revenue be exported to another country without one farthing of value in return and if the said kingdom be forbidden the most profitable branches of trade wherein to employ the other third and only allowed to traffic in importing those commodities which are most ruinous to itself127 how shall that kingdom stand  if this question were formed into the first proposition of an hypothetical syllogism i defy the man born in ireland who is now in the fairest way of getting a collectorship or a cornets post to give a good reason for denying it  let me put another case suppose a gentlemans estate of two hundred pounds a year should sink to one hundred by some accident whether by an earthquake or inundation it matters not and suppose the said gentleman utterly hopeless and unqualified ever to retrieve the loss how is he otherwise to proceed in his future economy than by reducing it on every article to one half less unless he will be content to fly his country or rot in jail this is a representation of irelands condition only with one fault that it is a little too favourable neither am i able to propose a full remedy for this that shall ever be granted but only a small prolongation of life until god shall miraculously dispose the hearts of our neighbours our kinsmen our fellowprotestants fellowsubjects and fellow rational creatures to permit us to starve without running further in debt i am informed that our national debt and god knows how we wretches came by that fashionable thing a national debt is about two hundred and fifty thousand pounds which is at least onethird of the whole kingdoms rents after our absentees and other foreign drains are paid and about fifty thousand pounds more than all the cash  it seems there are several schemes for raising a fund to pay the interest of this formidable sum not the principal for this is allowed impossible the necessity of raising such a fund is strongly and regularly pleaded from the late deficiencies in the duties and customs and is it the fault of ireland that these funds are deficient if they depend on trade can it possibly be otherwise while we have neither liberty to trade nor money to trade with neither hands to work nor business to employ them if we had our diseases are visible enough both in their causes and effects and the cures are well known but impossible to be applied  if my steward comes and tells me that my rents are sunk so low that they are very little more than sufficient to pay my servants their wages have i any other course left than to cashier four in six of my rascally footmen and a number of other varlets in my family of whose insolence the whole neighbourhood complains and i should think it extremely severe in any law to force me to maintain a household of fifty servants and fix their wages before i had offered my rentroll upon oath to the legislators  to return from digressing i am told one scheme for raising a fund to pay the interest of our national debt is by a further duty of forty shillings a tun upon wine some gentlemen would carry this matter much further by raising it to twelve pounds which in a manner would amount to a prohibition thus weakly arguing from the practice of england  i have often taken notice both in print and in discourse that there is no topic so fallacious either in talk or in writing as to argue how we ought to act in ireland from the example of england holland france or any other country whose inhabitants are allowed the common rights and liberties of humankind i could undertake to name six or seven of the most uncontrolled maxims in government which are utterly false in this kingdom  as to the additional duty on wine i think any person may deliver his opinion upon it until it shall have passed into a law and till then i declare mine to be positively against it  first because there is no nation yet known in either hemisphere where the people of all conditions are more in want of some cordial to keep up their spirits than in this of ours i am not in jest and if the fact will not be allowed me i shall not argue it  secondly it is too well and generally known that this tax of forty shillings additional on every tun of wine which will be double at least to the home consumer will increase equally every new session of parliament until perhaps it comes to twelve pounds  thirdly because as the merchants inform me and as i have known many the like instances in england this additional tax will more probably lessen this branch of the revenue than increase it and therefore sir john stanley a commissioner of the customs in england used to say that the house of commons were generally mistaken in matters of trade by an erroneous opinion that two and two make four thus if you should lay an additional duty of one penny a pound on raisins or sugar the revenue instead of rising would certainly sink and the consequence would only be to lessen the number of plumpuddings and ruin the confectioner  fourthly i am likewise assured by merchants that upon this additional forty shillings the french will at least equally raise their duties upon all commodities we export thither  fifthly if an original extract of the exports and imports be true we have been gainers upon the balance by our trade with france for several years past and although our gain amounts to no great sum we ought to be satisfied since we are no losers with the only consolation we are capable of receiving  lastly the worst consequence is behind if we raise the duty on wine to a considerable height we lose the only hold we have of keeping among us the few gentlemen of any tolerable estates i am confident there is hardly a gentleman of eight hundred pounds a year and upwards in this kingdom who would balance half an hour to consider whether he should live here or in england if a family could be as cheaply maintained in the one as the other as to eatables they are as cheap in many fine counties of england as in some very indifferent ones here or if there be any difference that vein of thrift and prudence in economy which passes there without reproach and chiefly in london itself would amply make up the difference but the article of french wine is hardly tolerable in any degree of plenty to a middling fortune and this is it which by growing habitual wholly turns the scale with those few landed men disengaged from employments who content themselves to live hospitably with plenty of good wine in their own country rather than in penury and obscurity in another with bad or with none at all  having therefore as far as in me lies abolished this additional duty upon wine for i am not under the least concern about paying the interest of the national debt but leave it as in loyalty bound wholly to the wisdom of the honourable house of commons i come now to consider by what methods we may be able to put off and delay our utter undoing as long as it is possible  i never have discoursed with any reasonable man upon this subject who did not allow that there was no remedy left us but to lessen the importation of all unnecessary commodities as much as it was possible and likewise either to persuade our absentees to spend their money at home which is impossible or tax them at five shillings in the pound during their absence with such allowances upon necessary occasions as it shall be thought convenient or by permitting us a free trade which is denied to no other nation upon earth the three last methods are treated by mr prior in his most useful treatise added to his list of absentees128  it is to gratify the vanity and pride and luxury of the women and of the young fops who admire them that we owe this insupportable grievance of bringing in the instruments of our ruin there is annually brought over to this kingdom near ninety thousand pounds worth of silk whereof the greater part is manufactured thirty thousand pounds more is expended in muslin holland cambric and calico what the price of lace amounts to is not easy to be collected from the customhouse book being a kind of goods that takes up little room and is easily run but considering the prodigious price of a womans headdress at ten twelve twenty pounds a yard must be very great the tea rated at seven shillings per pound comes to near twelve thousand pounds but considering it as the common luxury of every chambermaid sempstress and tradesmans wife both in town and country however they come by it must needs cost the kingdom double that sum coffee is somewhere above seven thousand pounds i have seen no account of the chocolate and some other indian or american goods the drapery imported is about fourandtwenty thousand pounds the whole amounts with one or two other particulars to one hundred and fifty thousand pounds the lavishing of all which money is just as prudent and necessary as to see a man in an embroidered coat begging out of newgate in an old shoe  i allow that the thrown and raw silk is less pernicious because we have some share in the manufacture but we are not now in circumstances to trifle it costs us above forty thousand pounds ayear and if the ladies till better times will not be content to go in their own country shifts i wish they may go in rags  let them vie with each other in the fineness of their native linen their beauty and gentleness will as well appear as if they were covered over with diamonds and brocade  i believe no man is so weak as to hope or expect that such a reformation can be brought about by a law but a thorough hearty unanimous vote in both houses of parliament might perhaps answer as well every senator noble or plebeian giving his honour that neither himself nor any of his family would in their dress or furniture of their houses make use of anything except what was of the growth and manufacture of this kingdom and that they would use the utmost of their power influence and credit to prevail on their tenants dependants and friends to follow their example     a  modest proposal  for preventing the children of poor people  from being a burthen to their parents  or country and for making them beneficial  to the public          note        perhaps in no literature is there to be found a piece of writing in      any sense comparable to this modest proposal written      apparently in a light and comic vein it might deceive the casual      reader into the belief that swift had achieved a joke it has the      air of a smiling and indifferent raconteur amusing an      afterdinner table in truth however this piece of writing is a      terrible indictment made by an advocate speaking against the result      of a tyranny of power which through wicked stupidity or complacent      indifference had afflicted a people almost to extinction the      restraint of the writer evinced in this tract is the more      remarkable when we remember that he was irelands foremost      patriot that he had been her champion for liberty and      independence and that an indignation filled him at all times      lacerating his heart against the cruelty and oppression and      wretchedness of humanity generally here he sits down and writes      as calmly as if composing an ordinary sermon and proposes in cold      blood to alleviate the poverty of the irish people by the sale of      their children as table food for the rich he even goes into      calculations as to cost of breeding and shows how a mother might      earn eight shillings a year on each child by disposing of its      carcass for ten shillings of the million and a half people who      inhabit the country he assumes that there are 200000 who beget      children of these about 30000 are able to provide for their      offspring but the balance of 170000 must inevitably become a      burden what is to become of them many schemes have been proposed      to meet their case but not one of them has answered trade and      agriculture gave them no opportunity since the trade of the      country was almost at a standstill and land was now either too      dear to keep or too poor to cultivate at the time of swifts      writing ireland had passed through three frightful years of famine      corn had become so dear that riots occurred at the ports where what      corn remained was being exported the land as swift wrote to pope      august 11th 1729 was in every place strewn with beggars the      poor labourer had work been found for him was too weak in body to      undertake it thousands had already died of starvation and the      diseases consequent on hunger those that managed to exist did so      in filth and dying every day as swift wrote on another occasion      and rotting by cold and famine and filth and vermin       no there was only one way out of the difficulty and that was to      have these poor people breed children which they could profitably      dispose of for food let them fatten their offspring as best they      could and sell them dead or alive for cooking the irony of the      proposition may sound appalling to us in this century but swift      was not exaggerating the distress of his day even primate boulter      who was certainly the last man to overstate an irish case sent      such reports as gave the english government anxiety to swift it      was no time for polite speeches and calm proposals he had already      given them in abundance now was the time for something merry and      with laughter         i may storm and rage in vain        it but stupifies your brain        but with raillery to nettle        set your thoughts upon their mettle       it was in this spirit that the modest proposal was written swift      concludes with a final touch by telling us that he has nothing to      gain personally by his suggestion since his youngest child is      nine and his wife past childbearing                                            the text of the present edition is that of the original issue      collated with that given by faulkner       t s     a modest  proposal  for preventing the  children  of  poor people  from being a burthen to  their parents or country  and  for making them beneficial to the  publick                                       by dr swift                                       dublin printed by s harding  london reprinted and sold by j roberts in warwicklane and the pamphletshops  mdccxxix     a modest proposal  for preventing the children of poor people from being a burthen to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the public   it is a melancholy object to those who walk through this great town or travel in the country when they see the streets the roads and cabindoors crowded with beggars of the female sex followed by three four or six children all in rags and importuning every passenger for an alms these mothers instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood are forced to employ all their time in strolling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who as they grow up either turn thieves for want of work or leave their dear native country to fight for the pretender in spain129 or sell themselves to the barbadoes  i think it is agreed by all parties that this prodigious number of children in the arms or on the backs or at the heels of their mothers and frequently of their fathers is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom a very great additional grievance and therefore whoever could find out a fair cheap and easy method of making these children sound useful members of the commonwealth would deserve so well of the public as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation  but my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children of professed beggars it is of a much greater extent and shall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age who are born of parents in effect as little able to support them as those who demand our charity in the streets  as to my own part having turned my thoughts for many years upon this important subject and maturely weighed the several schemes of other projectors i have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation it is true a child just dropped from its dam may be supported by her milk for a solar year with little other nourishment at most not above the value of two shillings which the mother may certainly get or the value in scraps by her lawful occupation of begging and it is exactly at one year old that i propose to provide for them in such a manner as instead of being a charge upon their parents or the parish or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives they shall on the contrary contribute to the feeding and partly to the clothing of many thousands  there as likewise another great advantage in my scheme that it will prevent those voluntary abortions and that horrid practice of women murdering their bastard children alas too frequent among us sacrificing the poor innocent babes i doubt more to avoid the expense than the shame which would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast  the number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a half130 of these i calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple whose wives are breeders from which number i subtract thirty thousand couples who are able to maintain their own children although i apprehend there cannot be so many under the present distresses of the kingdom but this being granted there will remain an hundred and seventy thousand breeders i again subtract fifty thousand for those women who miscarry or whose children die by accident or disease within the year there only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents annually born the question therefore is how this number shall be reared and provided for which as i have already said under the present situation of affairs is utterly impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed for we can neither employ them in handicraft or agriculture we neither build houses i mean in the country nor cultivate land they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old except where they are of towardly parts although i confess they learn the rudiments much earlier during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as probationers as i have been informed by a principal gentleman in the county of cavan who protested to me that he never knew above one or two instances under the age of six even in a part of the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art  i am assured by our merchants that a boy or a girl before twelve years old is no saleable commodity and even when they come to this age they will not yield above three pounds or three pounds and halfacrown at most on the exchange which cannot turn to account either to the parents or the kingdom the charge of nutriment and rags having been at least four times that value  i shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts which i hope will not be liable to the least objection  i have been assured by a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london131 that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout  i do therefore humbly offer it to public consideration that of the hundred and twenty thousand children already computed twenty thousand may be reserved for breed whereof only one fourth part to be males which is more than we allow to sheep blackcattle or swine and my reason is that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage a circumstance not much regarded by our savages therefore one male will be sufficient to serve four females that the remaining hundred thousand may at a year old be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month so as to render them plump and fat for a good table a child will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends and when the family dines alone the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish and seasoned with a little pepper or salt will be very good boiled on the fourth day especially in winter  i have reckoned upon a medium that a child just born will weigh 12 pounds and in a solar year if tolerably nursed increaseth to 28 pounds  i grant this food will be somewhat dear and therefore very proper for landlords who as they have already devoured most of the parents seem to have the best title to the children  infants flesh will be in season throughout the year but more plentiful in march and a little before and after for we are told by a grave author an eminent french physician that fish being a prolific diet there are more children born in roman catholic countries about nine months after lent than at any other season therefore reckoning a year after lent the markets will be more glutted than usual because the number of popish infants is at least three to one in this kingdom and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage by lessening the number of papists among us  i have already computed the charge of nursing a beggars child in which list i reckon all cottagers labourers and fourfifths of the farmers to be about two shillings per annum rags included and i believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good fat child which as i have said will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat when he hath only some particular friend or his own family to dine with him thus the squire will learn to be a good landlord and grow popular among his tenants the mother will have eight shillings net profit and be fit for work till she produces another child  those who are more thrifty as i must confess the times require may flay the carcass the skin of which artificially dressed will make admirable gloves for ladies and summer boots for fine gentlemen  as to our city of dublin shambles may be appointed for this purpose in the most convenient parts of it and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting although i rather recommend buying the children alive and dressing them hot from the knife as we do roasting pigs  a very worthy person a true lover of his country and whose virtues i highly esteem was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter to offer a refinement upon my scheme he said that many gentlemen of this kingdom having of late destroyed their deer he conceived that the want of venison might be well supplied by the bodies of young lads and maidens not exceeding fourteen years of age nor under twelve so great a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for want of work and service and these to be disposed of by their parents if alive or otherwise by their nearest relations but with due deference to so excellent a friend and so deserving a patriot i cannot be altogether in his sentiments for as to the males my american acquaintance assured me from frequent experience that their flesh was generally tough and lean like that of our schoolboys by continual exercise and their taste disagreeable and to fatten them would not answer the charge then as to the females it would i think with humble submission be a loss to the public because they soon would become breeders themselves and besides it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice although indeed very unjustly as a little bordering upon cruelty which i confess hath always been with me the strongest objection against any project however so well intended  but in order to justify my friend he confessed that this expedient was put into his head by the famous psalmanazar132 a native of the island formosa who came from thence to london above twenty years ago and in conversation told my friend that in his country when any young person happened to be put to death the executioner sold the carcass to persons of quality as a prime dainty and that in his time the body of a plump girl of fifteen who was crucified for an attempt to poison the emperor was sold to his imperial majestys prime minister of state and other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet at four hundred crowns neither indeed can i deny that if the same use were made of several plump young girls in this town who without one single groat to their fortunes cannot stir abroad without a chair and appear at the playhouse and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will pay for the kingdom would not be the worse  some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people who are aged diseased or maimed and i have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken to ease the nation of so grievous an encumbrance but i am not in the least pain upon that matter because it is very well known that they are every day dying and rotting by cold and famine and filth and vermin as fast as can be reasonably expected and as to the younger labourers they are now in almost as hopeful a condition they cannot get work and consequently pine away for want of nourishment to a degree that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour they have not strength to perform it and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come  i have too long digressed and therefore shall return to my subject i think the advantages by the proposal which i have made are obvious and many as well as of the highest importance  for first as i have already observed it would greatly lessen the number of papists with whom we are yearly overrun being the principal breeders of the nation as well as our most dangerous enemies and who stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the pretender hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good protestants who have chosen rather to leave their country than stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate133  secondly the poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own which by law may be made liable to distress and help to pay their landlords rent their corn and cattle being already seized and money a thing unknown  thirdly whereas the maintenance of an hundred thousand children from two years old and upwards cannot be computed at less than ten shillings a piece per annum the nations stock will be thereby increased fifty thousand pounds per annum besides the profit of a new dish introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom who have any refinement in taste and the money will circulate among ourselves the goods being entirely of our own growth and manufacture  fourthly the constant breeders besides the gain of eight shillings sterling per annum by the sale of their children will be rid of the charge of maintaining them after the first year  fifthly this food would likewise bring great custom to taverns where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts for dressing it to perfection and consequently have their houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen who justly value themselves upon their knowledge in good eating and a skilful cook who understands how to oblige his guests will contrive to make it as expensive as they please  sixthly this would be a great inducement to marriage which all wise nations have either encouraged by rewards or enforced by laws and penalties it would increase the care and tenderness of mothers toward their children when they were sure of a settlement for life to the poor babes provided in some sort by the public to their annual profit instead of expense we should see an honest emulation among the married women which of them could bring the fattest child to the market men would become as fond of their wives during the time of their pregnancy as they are now of their mares in foal their cows in calf or sows when they are ready to farrow nor offer to beat or kick them as it is too frequent a practice for fear of a miscarriage  many other advantages might be enumerated for instance the addition of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrelled beef the propagation of swines flesh and improvement in the art of making good bacon so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs too frequent at our tables which are no way comparable in taste or magnificence to a wellgrown fat yearling child which roasted whole will make a considerable figure at a lord mayors feast or any other public entertainment but this and many others i omit being studious of brevity  supposing that one thousand families in this city would be constant customers for infants flesh besides others who might have it at merrymeetings particularly weddings and christenings i compute that dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses and the rest of the kingdom where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper the remaining eighty thousand  i can think of no one objection that will possibly be raised against this proposal unless it should be urged that the number of people will be thereby much lessened in the kingdom this i freely own and was indeed one principal design in offering it to the world i desire the reader will observe that i calculate my remedy for this one individual kingdom of ireland and for no other that ever was is or i think ever can be upon earth therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound of using neither clothes nor household furniture except what is of our own growth and manufacture of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury of curing the expensiveness of pride vanity idleness and gaming in our women of introducing a vein of parsimony prudence and temperance of learning to love our country wherein we differ even from laplanders and the inhabitants of topinamboo134 of quitting our animosities and factions nor act any longer like the jews who were murdering one another at the very moment their city was taken of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing135 of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy toward their tenants lastly of putting a spirit of honesty industry and skill into our shopkeepers who if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price the measure and the goodness nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing though often and earnestly invited to it136  therefore i repeat let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients till he hath at least some glimpse of hope that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them in practice  but as to myself having been wearied out for many years with offering vain idle visionary thoughts and at length utterly despairing of success i fortunately fell upon this proposal which as it is wholly new so it hath something solid and real of no expense and little trouble full in our own power and whereby we can incur no danger in disobliging england for this kind of commodity will not bear exportation137 the flesh being of too tender a consistence to admit a long continuance in salt although perhaps i could name a country which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it  after all i am not so violently bent upon my own opinion as to reject any offer proposed by wise men which shall be found equally innocent cheap easy and effectual but before something of that kind shall be advanced in contradiction to my scheme and offering a better i desire the author or authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points first as things now stand how they will be able to find food and raiment for an hundred thousand useless mouths and backs and secondly there being a round million of creatures in human figure throughout this kingdom whose whole subsistence put into a common stock would leave them in debt two millions of pounds sterling adding those who are beggars by profession to the bulk of farmers cottagers and labourers with their wives and children who are beggars in effect i desire those politicians who dislike my overture and may perhaps be so bold to attempt an answer that they will first ask the parents of these mortals whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness to have been sold for food at a year old in the manner i prescribe and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes as they have since gone through by the oppression of landlords the impossibility of paying rent without money or trade the want of common sustenance with neither house nor clothes to cover them from the inclemencies of the weather and the most inevitable prospect of entailing the like or greater miseries upon their breed for ever  i profess in the sincerity of my heart that i have not the least personal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work having no other motive than the public good of my country by advancing our trade providing for infants relieving the poor and giving some pleasure to the rich i have no children by which i can propose to get a single penny the youngest being nine years old and my wife past childbearing     answer to the craftsman          note        this answer forms an excellent continuation of the modest      proposal it is in an entirely different vein but is in its own      way an admirable example of swifts strength in handling a public      question the english government had been offering every facility      to french officers for recruiting their army from ireland the      craftsman made some strong remarks on this and primate boulter      in his letter to the duke of newcastle under date october 14th      1730 told his grace that after consulting with the lords      justices on the subject he found that they apprehend there will be      greater difficulties in this affair than at first offered he      enters into the difficulties to be overcome in order to act in      consonance with the wishes of his majesty and promises that      effectual care shall be taken that none of the officers who are      come hither suffer on this account letter pp 2627 vol ii      dublin edit 1770 swift uses the matter for his own purposes and      ironically welcomes this chance for the depopulation of ireland      when our island is a desert we will send all our raw material to      england and receive from her all our manufactured articles a      leather coinage will be all we want separated as we shall then      be from all human kind we shall have lost all but we may be left      in peace and we shall have no more to tempt the plunderer scott      styles this answer a masterpiece                                            the text of this edition is based on that given by faulkner in the      ninth volume of his edition of swift issued in 1772       t s     answer to the craftsman138    sir  i detest reading your papers because i am not of your principles and because i cannot endure to be convinced yet i was prevailed on to peruse your craftsman of december the 12th wherein i discover you to be as great an enemy of this country as you are of your own you are pleased to reflect on a project i proposed of making the children of irish parents to be useful to the public instead of being burdensome139 and you venture to assert that your own scheme is more charitable of not permitting our popish natives to be listed in the service of any foreign prince  perhaps sir you may not have heard of any kingdom so unhappy as this both in their imports and exports we import a sort of goods of no intrinsic value which costeth us above forty thousand pounds a year to dress and scour and polish them which altogether do not yield one penny advantage140 and we annually export above seven hundred thousand pounds a year in another kind of goods for which we receive not one single farthing in return even the money paid for the letters sent in transacting this commerce being all returned to england but now when there is a most lucky opportunity offered to begin a trade whereby this nation will save many thousand pounds a year and england be a prodigious gainer you are pleased without a call officiously and maliciously to interpose with very frivolous arguments  it is well known that about sixty years ago the exportation of live cattle from hence to england was a great benefit to both kingdoms until that branch of traffic was stopped by an act of parliament on your side whereof you have had sufficient reason to repent141 upon which account when another act passed your parliament forbidding the exportation of live men to any foreign country you were so wise to put in a clause allowing it to be done by his majestys permission under his sign manual142 for which among other great benefits granted to ireland we are infinitely obliged to the british legislature yet this very grace and favour you mr danvers whom we never disobliged are endeavouring to prevent which i will take upon me to say is a manifest mark of your disaffection to his majesty a want of duty to the ministry and a wicked design of oppressing this kingdom and a traitorous attempt to lessen the trade and manufacture of england  our truest and best ally the most christian king143 hath obtained his majestys licence pursuant to law to export from hence some thousand bodies of healthy young living men to supply his irish regiments the king of spain as you assert yourself hath desired the same civility and seemeth to have at least as good a claim supposing then that these two potentates will only desire leave to carry off six thousand men between them to france and spain then by computing the maintenance of a tall hungry irishman in food and clothes to be only at five pounds a head here will be thirty thousand pounds per annum saved clear to the nation for they can find no other employment at home beside begging robbing or stealing but if thirty forty or fifty thousand which we could gladly spare were sent on the same errand what an immense benefit must it be to us and if the two princes in whose service they were should happen to be at war with each other how soon would those recruits be destroyed then what a number of friends would the pretender lose and what a number of popish enemies all true protestants get rid of add to this that then by such a practice the lands of ireland that want hands for tillage must be employed in grazing which would sink the price of wool raw hides butter and tallow so that the english might have them at their own rates and in return send us wheat to make our bread barley to brew our drink and oats for our houses without any labour of our own  upon this occasion i desire humbly to offer a scheme which in my opinion would best answer the true interests of both kingdoms for although i bear a most tender filial affection to england my dear native country yet i cannot deny but this noble island hath a great share in my love and esteem nor can i express how much i desire to see it flourish in trade and opulence even beyond its present happy condition  the profitable land of this kingdom is i think usually computed at seventeen millions of acres all which i propose to be wholly turned to grazing now it is found by experience that one grazier and his family can manage two thousand acres thus sixteen millions eight hundred thousand acres may be managed by eight thousand four hundred families and the fraction of two hundred thousand acres will be more than sufficient for cabins outhouses and potatoegardens because it is to be understood that corn of all sorts must be sent to us from england  these eight thousand four hundred families may be divided among the four provinces according to the number of houses in each province and making the equal allowance of eight to a family the number of inhabitants will amount to sixtyseven thousand two hundred souls to these we are to add a standing army of twenty thousand english which together with their trulls their bastards and their horseboys will by a gross computation very near double the count and be very sufficient for the defence and grazing of the kingdom as well as to enrich our neighbours expel popery and keep out the pretender and lest the army should be at a loss for business i think it would be very prudent to employ them in collecting the public taxes for paying themselves and the civil list  i advise that all the owners of these lands should live constantly in england in order to learn politeness and qualify themselves for employments but for fear of increasing the natives in this island that an annual draught according to the number born every year be exported to whatever prince will bear the carriage or transplanted to the english dominions on the american continent as a screen between his majestys english subjects and the savage indians  i advise likewise that no commodity whatsoever of this nations growth should be sent to any other country except england under the penalty of high treason and that all the said commodities shall be sent in their natural state the hides raw the wool uncombed the flax in the stub excepting only fish butter tallow and whatever else will be spoiled in the carriage on the contrary that no goods whatsoever shall be exported hither except from england under the same penalty that england should be forced at their own rates to send us over clothes ready made as well as shirts and smocks to the soldiers and their trulls all iron wooden and earthen ware and whatever furniture may be necessary for the cabins of graziers with a sufficient quantity of gin and other spirits for those who can afford to be drunk on holidays  as to the civil and ecclesiastical administration which i have not yet fully considered i can say little only with regard to the latter it is plain that the article of paying tithe for supporting speculative opinions in religion which is so insupportable a burden to all true protestants and to most churchmen will be very much lessened by this expedient because dry cattle pay nothing to the spiritual hireling any more than imported corn so that the industrious shepherd and cowherd may sit every man under his own blackberrybush and on his own potatobed whereby this happy island will become a new arcadia  i do likewise propose that no money shall be used in ireland except what is made of leather which likewise shall be coined in england and imported and that the taxes shall be levied out of the commodities we export to england and there turned into money for his majestys use and the rents to landlords discharged in the same manner this will be no manner of grievance for we already see it very practicable to live without money and shall be more convinced of it every day but whether paper shall still continue to supply that defect or whether we shall hang up all those who profess the trade of bankers which latter i am rather inclined to must be left to the consideration of wiser politicians  that which maketh me more zealously bent upon this scheme is my desire of living in amity with our neighbouring brethren for we have already tried all other means without effect to that blessed end and by the course of measures taken for some years past it should seem that we are all agreed in the point  this expedient will be of great advantage to both kingdoms upon several accounts for as to england they have a just claim to the balance of trade on their side with the whole world and therefore our ancestors and we who conquered this kingdom for them ought in duty and gratitude to let them have the whole benefit of that conquest to themselves especially when the conquest was amicably made without bloodshed by a stipulation between the irish princes and henry ii by which they paid him indeed not equal homage with what the electors of germany do to the emperor but very near the same that he did to the king of france for his french dominions  in consequence of this claim from england that kingdom may very reasonably demand the benefit of all our commodities in their natural growth to be manufactured by their people and a sufficient quantity of them for our use to be returned hither fully manufactured  this on the other side will be of great benefit to our inhabitants the graziers when time and labour will be too much taken up in manuring their ground feeding their cattle shearing their sheep and sending over their oxen fit for slaughter to which employments they are turned by nature as descended from the scythians whose diet they are still so fond of so virgil describeth it    et lac concretum cum sanguine bibit equino  which in english is bonnyclabber144 mingled with the blood of horses as they formerly did until about the beginning of the last century luxury under the form of politeness began to creep in they changed the blood of horses for that of their black cattle and by consequence became less warlike than their ancestors  although i proposed that the army should be collectors of the public revenues yet i did not thereby intend that those taxes should be paid in gold or silver but in kind as all other rent for the custom of tenants making their payments in money is a new thing in the world little known in former ages nor generally practised in any nation at present except this island and the southern parts of britain but to my great satisfaction i foresee better times the ancient manner beginneth to be now practised in many parts of connaught as well as in the county of cork where the squires turn tenants to themselves divide so many cattle to their slaves who are to provide such a quantity of butter hides or tallow still keeping up their number of cattle and carry the goods to cork or other port towns and then sell them to the merchants by which invention there is no such thing as a ruined farmer to be seen but the people live with comfort on potatoes and bonnyclabber neither of which are vendible commodities abroad     a  vindication  of  his excellency john lord carteret          note        john carteret earl granville succeeded to the carteret      barony at the early age of five years he was the son of george      the first baron carteret and was born in 1690 he was educated at      westminster school and christ church oxford from which latter      place as swift puts it he carried away more greek latin and      philosophy than properly became a person of his rank in the house      of lords carteret was known as a strong adherent of the protestant      succession and joined the sunderland party on the split of the      whigs in 1717 as ambassador extraordinary to the court of sweden      he was eminently successful being the instrument by which in      1720 peace was established between sweden prussia and hanover      later he served in a similar capacity with earl stanhope and sir      robert sutton at the congress of cambray       in 1721 he was appointed secretary of state of the southern      province but although a member of the walpole administration he      intrigued with the king against walpole and attempted to form a      party in opposition to that minister he ingratiated himself in the      kings favour by means of his knowledge of the german language for      george knew no english and obtained the support of carleton      roxburghe cadogan and the countess of darlington walpole      however was too strong for him he managed to get carteret to      ireland as lord lieutenant and the duke of newcastle took up the      office held by him in england the condition of ireland at this      time was such as to cause grave anxiety to the english government      carteret was sent ostensibly to a post of great importance though      in reality to be out of walpoles way for an account of      carterets government during the agitation against woods      halfpence the reader is referred to the sixth volume of the      present edition       during the kings absence from england in 1723 carteret had been      one of the lords justices of the country and in 1725 when george      was again away he was again appointed to this office george      however died on his way to hanover but on the accession of      george ii carteret continued to hold high office he was      reappointed to the irish lord lieutenancy in 1727 and it was      during this second term that he was criticised for the conduct      swift vindicates in the following tract       the dean had a great admiration both for the scholarship and temper      of carteret the admiration was mutual for carteret often      consulted with swift on important matters and though he dared not      appoint the drapier to any position of importance he took occasion      to assist the drapiers friends at the time of the proclamation      against the drapiers fourth letter the dean writes scott      visited the castle and having waited for some time without seeing      the lord lieutenant wrote upon one of the windows of the chamber      of audience these lines         my very good lord tis a very hard task        for a man to wait here who has nothing to ask       under which carteret wrote the following happy reply         my very good dean there are few who come here        but have something to ask or something to fear       to carterets politic government of ireland was mainly due the      peaceful condition which prevailed amidst all the agitation roused      by bad management and wretchedness in a letter to swift written      many years later march 1737 carteret writes the people ask me      how i governed ireland i say that i pleased dr swift and swift      confessed in a letter to gay november 19th 1730 that carteret      had a genteeler manner of binding the chains of the kingdom than      most of his predecessors it was to carteret that swift made his      wellknown remark on an occasion of a visit what in gods name      do you do here get back to your own country and send us our      boobies again       swift was well aware that carteret had not the power to make the      changes in ireland necessary for its wellbeing such changes could      come only from the government in england and as this was      implacable carteret was but an instrument in its hands swift was      therefore compelled to rest content with obtaining what favours he      could for those friends of his who he knew deserved advancement      and he allowed no occasion to slip by without soliciting in their      behalf       richard tighe who had managed to injure sheridan in his      chaplaincy with a number of the more violent members of the whigs      in ireland took up carterets conduct attempted by means of      their interpretation of the lord lieutenants promotions to injure      him with the government and accused him of advancing individuals      who were enemies of the government swift took up the charge in his      usual ironical manner and wrote the vindication which follows       carteret it may be added here was dismissed from his office in      1730 and joined pulteney in a bitter struggle against walpole      which culminated in his famous resolution presented to the house      of lords desiring that the king should remove walpole from his      presence and counsels for ever carteret failed but walpole was      compelled to resign in 1742 the rest of carterets career bears no      relation to irish affairs                                            the present text is founded on that of the original london edition      printed in 1730 collated with the dublin edition of the same date      they differ in many minor details from that given by scott in 1824       t s     a  vindication  of his  excellency  the  lord ct  from the  charge  of favouring none but  tories highchurchmen and  jacobites                                       by the reverend dr st                                       london  printed for t warner at the blackboy in paternosterrow mdccxxx  price 6d     a vindication of his excellency john lord carteret   in order to treat this important subject with the greatest fairness and impartiality perhaps it may be convenient to give some account of his excellency in whose life and character there are certain particulars which might give a very just suspicion of some truth in the accusation he lies under  he is descended from two noble ancient and most loyal families the carterets and the granvilles too much distinguishd i confess for what they acted and what they sufferd in defending the former constitution in church and state under king charles the martyr i mean that very prince on account of whose martyrdom a form of prayer with fasting was enjoined by act of parliament to be used on the 30th day of january every year to implore the mercies of god that the guilt of that sacred and innocent blood might not be visited on us or our posterity as we may read at large in our common prayer books which day hath been solemnly kept even within the memory of many men now alive  his excellency the present lord was educated in the university of oxford145 from whence with a singularity scarce to be justified he carried away more greek latin and philosophy than properly became a person of his rank indeed much more of each than most of those who are forced to live by their learning will be at the unnecessary pains to load their heads with  this was the rock he split on upon his first appearance in the world and just got clear of his guardians for as soon as he came to town some bishops and clergymen and other persons most eminent for learning and parts got him among them from whom though he were fortunately dragged by a lady and the court yet he could never wipe off the stain nor wash out the tincture of his university acquirements and dispositions  to this another misfortune was added that it pleased god to endow him with great natural talents memory judgment comprehension eloquence and wit and to finish the work all these were fortified even in his youth with the advantages received by such employments as are best fitted both to exercise and polish the gifts of nature and education having been ambassador in several courts when his age would hardly allow him to take a degree and made principal secretary of state at a period when according to custom he ought to have been busied in losing his money at a chocolatehouse or in other amusements equally laudable and epidemic among persons of honour  i cannot omit another weak side in his excellency for it is known and can be proved upon him that greek and latin books might be found every day in his dressingroom if it were carefully searched and there is reason to suspect that some of the said books have been privately conveyed to him by tory hands i am likewise assured that he hath been taken in the very fact of reading the said books even in the midst of a session to the great neglect of public affairs146  i own there may be some grounds for this charge because i have it from good hands that when his excellency is at dinner with one or two scholars at his elbows he grows a most unsupportable and unintelligible companion to all the fine gentlemen round the table  i cannot deny that his excellency lies under another great disadvantage for with all the accomplishments abovementioned adding that of a most comely and graceful person and during the prime of youth spirits and vigor he hath in a most unexemplary manner led a regular domestic life discovers a great esteem and friendship and love for his lady as well as a true affection for his children and when he is disposed to admit an entertaining evening companion he doth not always enough reflect whether the person may possibly in former days have lain under the imputation of a tory nor at such times do the natural or affected fears of popery and the pretender make any part of the conversation i presume because neither homer plato aristotle nor cicero have made any mention of them  these i freely acknowledge to be his excellencys failings yet i think it is agreed by philosophers and divines that some allowance ought to be given to human infirmity and the prejudices of a wrong education  i am well aware how much my sentiments differ from the orthodox opinion of one or two principal patriots at the head of whom i name with honour pistorides147 for these have decided the matter directly against me by declaring that no person who was ever known to lie under the suspicion of one single tory principle or who had been once seen at a great mans levee in the worst of times148 should be allowed to come within the verge of the castle much less to bow in the antechamber appear at the assemblies or dance at a birthnight however i dare assert that this maxim hath been often controlled and that on the contrary a considerable number of early penitents have been received into grace who are now an ornament happiness and support to the nation  neither do i find any murmuring on some other points of greater importance where this favourite maxim is not so strictly observed  to instance only in one i have not heard that any care hath hitherto been taken to discover whether madam violante149 be a whig or tory in her principles or even that she hath ever been offered the oaths to the government on the contrary i am told that she openly professes herself to be a highflyer and it is not improbable by her outlandish name she may also be a papist in her heart yet we see this illustrious and dangerous female openly caressed by principal persons of both parties who contribute to support her in a splendid manner without the least apprehensions from a grand jury or even from squire hartley hutcheson himself that zealous prosecutor of hawkers and libels150 and as hobbes wisely observes so much money being equivalent to so much power it may deserve considering with what safety such an instrument of power ought to be trusted in the hands of an alien who hath not given any legal security for her good affection to the government  i confess there is one evil which i could wish our friends would think proper to redress there are many whigs in this kingdom of the oldfashioned stamp of whom we might make very good use they bear the same loyalty with us to the hanoverian family in the person of king george ii the same abhorrence of the pretender with the consequent of popery and slavery and the same indulgence to tender consciences but having nothing to ask for themselves and consequently the more leisure to think for the public they are often apt to entertain fears and melancholy prospects concerning the state of their country the decay of trade the want of money the miserable condition of the people with other topics of like nature all which do equally concern both whig and tory who if they have anything to lose must be equally sufferers perhaps one or two of these melancholy gentlemen will sometimes venture to publish their thoughts in print now i can by no means approve our usual custom of cursing and railing at this species of thinkers under the names of tories jacobites papists libellers rebels and the like  this was the utter ruin of that poor angry bustling wellmeaning mortal pistorides who lies equally under the contempt of both parties with no other difference than a mixture of pity on one side and of aversion on the other  how hath he been pelted pestered and pounded by one single wag who promiseth never to forsake him living or dead151  i was much pleased with the humour of a surgeon in this town who having in his own apprehension received some great injustice from the earl of galway152 and despairing of revenge as well as relief declared to all his friends that he had set apart a hundred guineas to purchase the earls carcase from the sexton whenever it should die to make a skeleton of the bones stuff the hide and shew them for threepence and thus get vengeance for the injuries he had suffered by the owner  of the like spirit too often is that implacable race of wits against whom there is no defence but innocence and philosophy neither of which is likely to be at hand and therefore the wounded have nowhere to fly for a cure but to downright stupidity a crazed head or a profligate contempt of guilt and shame  i am therefore sorry for that other miserable creature traulus153 who although of somewhat a different species yet seems very far to outdo even the genius of pistorides in that miscarrying talent of railing without consistency or discretion against the most innocent persons according to the present situation of his gall and spleen i do not blame an honest gentleman for the bitterest invectives against one to whom he professeth the greatest friendship provided he acts in the dark so as not to be discovered but in the midst of caresses visits and invitations to run into the streets or to as public a place and without the least pretended excitement sputter out the basest and falsest accusations then to wipe his mouth come up smiling to his friend shake him by the hand and tell him in a whisper it was all for his service this proceeding i am bold to think a great failure in prudence and i am afraid lest such a practitioner with a body so open so foul and so full of sores may fall under the resentment of an incensed political surgeon who is not in much renown for his mercy upon great provocation who without waiting for his death will flay and dissect him alive and to the view of mankind lay open all the disordered cells of his brain the venom of his tongue the corruption of his heart and spots and flatuses of his spleenand all this for threepence154  in such a case what a scene would be laid open and to drop my metaphor what a character of our mistaking friend might an angry enemy draw and expose particularizing that unnatural conjunction of vices and follies so inconsistent with each other in the same breast furious and fawning scurrilous and flattering cowardly and provoking insolent and abject most profligately false with the strongest professions of sincerity positive and variable tyrannical and slavish  i apprehend that if all this should be set out to the world by an angry whig of the old stamp the unavoidable consequence must be a confinement of our friend for some months more to his garret and thereby depriving the public for so long a time and in so important a juncture of his useful talents in their service while he is fed like a wild beast through a hole but i hope with a special regard to the quantity and quality of his nourishment  in vain would his excusers endeavour to palliate his enormities by imputing them to madness155 because it is well known that madness only operates by inflaming and enlarging the good or evil dispositions of the mind for the curators of bedlam assure us that some lunatics are persons of honour truth benevolence and many other virtues which appear in their highest ravings although after a wild incoherent manner while others on the contrary discover in every word and action the utmost baseness and depravity of human minds which infallibly they possessed in the same degree although perhaps under a better regulation before their entrance into that academy  but it may be objected that there is an argument of much force to excuse the overflowings of that zeal which our friend shews or means for our cause and it must be confessed that the easy and smooth fluency of his elocution bestowed on him by nature and cultivated by continual practice added to the comeliness of his person the harmony of his voice the gracefulness of his manner and the decency of his dress are temptations too strong for such a genius to resist upon any public occasion of making them appear with universal applause and if good men are sometimes accused of loving their jest better than their friend surely to gain the reputation of the first orator in the kingdom no man of spirit would scruple to lose all the friends he had in the world  it is usual for masters to make their boys declaim on both sides of an argument and as some kinds of assemblies are called the schools of politics i confess nothing can better improve political schoolboys than the art of making plausible or implausible harangues against the very opinion for which they resolve to determine  so cardinal perron after having spoke for an hour to the admiration of all his hearers to prove the existence of god told some of his intimates that he could have spoken another hour and much better to prove the contrary  i have placed this reasoning in the strongest light that i think it will bear and have nothing to answer but that allowing it as much weight as the reader shall please it hath constantly met with ill success in the mouth of our friend whether for want of good luck or good management i suspend my judgment  to return from this long digression if persons in high stations have been allowed to choose mistresses without regard even to difference in religion yet never incurred the least reflection on their loyalty or their protestantism shall the chief governor of a great kingdom be censured for choosing a companion who may formerly have been suspected for differing from the orthodox in some speculative opinions of persons and things which cannot affect the fundamental principles of a sound whig  but let me suppose a very possible case here is a person sent to govern ireland whose unfortunate weak side it happens to be for several reasons abovementioned that he hath encouraged the attendance of one or two gentlemen distinguished for their taste their wit and their learning who have taken the oaths to his majesty and pray heartily for him yet because they may perhaps be stigmatized as quondam tories by pistorides and his gang his excellency must be forced to banish them under the pain and peril of displeasing the zealots of his own party and thereby be put into a worse condition than every common goodfellow who may be a sincere protestant and a loyal subject and yet rather choose to drink fine ale at the popes head than muddy at the kings  let me then return to my supposition it is certain the highflown loyalists in the present sense of the word have their thoughts and studies and tongues so entirely diverted by political schemes that the zeal of their principles hath eaten up their understandings neither have they time from their employments their hopes and their hourly labours for acquiring new additions of merit to amuse themselves with philological converse or speculations which are utterly ruinous to all schemes of rising in the world what must then a great man do whose ill stars have fatally perverted him to a love and taste and possession of literature politeness and good sense our thoroughsped republic of whigs which contains the bulk of all hopers pretenders expecters and professors are beyond all doubt most highly useful to princes to governors to great ministers and to their country but at the same time and by necessary consequence the most disagreeable companions to all who have that unfortunate turn of mind peculiar to his excellency and perhaps to five or six more in a nation  i do not deny it possible that an original or proselyte favourer of the times might have been born to those useless talents which in former ages qualified a man to be a poet or a philosopher all i contend for is that where the true genius of party once enters it sweeps the house clean and leaves room for many other spirits to take joint possession till the last state of that man is exceedingly better than the first  i allow it a great error in his excellency that he adheres so obstinately to his old unfashionable academic education yet so perverse is human nature that the usual remedies for this evil in others have produced a contrary effect in him to a degree that i am credibly informed he will as i have already hinted in the middle of a session quote passages out of plato and pindar at his own table to some booklearned companion without blushing even when persons of great stations are by  i will venture one step further which is freely to confess that this mistaken method of educating youth in the knowledge of ancient learning and language is too apt to spoil their politics and principles because the doctrine and examples of the books they read teach them lessons directly contrary in every point to the present practice of the world and accordingly hobbes most judiciously observes that the writings of the greeks and romans made young men imbibe opinions against absolute power in a prince or even in a first minister and to embrace notions of liberty and property  it hath been therefore a great felicity to these kingdoms that the heirs to titles and large estates have a weakness in their eyes a tenderness in their constitutions are not able to bear the pain and indignity of whipping and as the mother rightly expresses it could never take to their book yet are well enough qualified to sign a receipt for half a years rent to put their names rightly spelt to a warrant and to read pamphlets against religion and highflying whereby they fill their niches and carry themselves through the world with that dignity which best becomes a senator and a squire156  i could heartily wish his excellency would be more condescending to the genius of the kingdom he governs to the condition of the times and to the nature of the station he fills yet if it be true what i have read in old english storybooks that one agesilaus no matter to the bulk of my readers whether i spell the names right or wrong was caught by the parson of the parish riding on a hobbyhorse with his children that socrates a heathen philosopher was found dancing by himself at fourscore that a king called cæsar augustus or some such name used to play with boys whereof some might possibly be sons of tories and that two great men called scipio and lælius i forget their christian names and whether they were poets or generals often played at duck and drake with smooth stones on a river now i say if these facts be true and the book where i found them is in print i cannot imagine why our most zealous patriots may not a little indulge his excellency in an infirmity which is not morally evil provided he gives no public scandal which is by all means to be avoided i say why he may not be indulged twice a week to converse with one or two particular persons and let him and them con over their old exploded readings together after mornings spent in hearing and prescribing ways and means from and to his most obedient politicians for the welfare of the kingdom although the said particular person or persons may not have made so public a declaration of their political faith in all its parts as the business of the nation requires still submitting my opinion to that happy majority which i am confident is always in the right by whom the liberty of the subject hath been so frequently so strenuously and so successfully asserted who by their wise counsels have made commerce to flourish money to abound inhabitants to increase the value of lands and rents to rise and the whole island put on a new face of plenty and prosperity  but in order to clear his excellency more fully from this accusation of shewing his favours to highflyers tories and jacobites it will be necessary to come to particulars  the first person of a tory denomination to whom his excellency gave any marks of his favour was doctor thomas sheridan157 it is to be observed that this happened so early in his excellencys government as it may be justly supposed he had not been informed of that gentlemans character upon so dangerous an article the doctor being well known and distinguished for his skill and success in the education of youth beyond most of his profession for many years past was recommended to his excellency on the score of his learning and particularly for his knowledge in the greek tongue whereof it seems his excellency is a great admirer although for what reasons i could never imagine however it is agreed on all hands that his lordship was too easily prevailed on by the doctors request or indeed rather from the bias of his own nature to hear a tragedy acted in that unknown language by the doctors lads158 which was written by some heathen author but whether it contained any tory or highchurch principles must be left to the consciences of the boys the doctor and his excellency the only witnesses in this case whose testimonies can be depended upon  it seems his excellency a thing never to be sufficiently wondered at was so pleased with his entertainment that some time after he gave the doctor a church living to the value of almost one hundred pounds a year and made him one of his chaplains from an antiquated notion that good schoolmasters ought to be encouraged in every nation professing civility and religion yet his excellency did not venture to make this bold step without strong recommendations from persons of undoubted principles fitted to the times who thought themselves bound in justice honour and gratitude to do the doctor a good office in return for the care he had taken of their children or those of their friends159 yet the catastrophe was terrible for the doctor in the height of his felicity and gratitude going down to take possession of his parish and furnished with a few ledsermons whereof as it is to be supposed the number was very small having never served a cure in the church he stopped at cork to attend on his bishop and going to church on the sunday following was according to the usual civility of country clergymen invited by the minister of the parish to supply the pulpit it happened to be the first of august160 and the first of august happened that year to light upon a sunday and it happened that the doctors text was in these words sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof and lastly it happened that some one person of the congregation whose loyalty made him watchful upon every appearance of danger to his majestys person and government when service was over gave the alarm notice was immediately sent up to town and by the zeal of one man161 of no large dimensions of body or mind such a clamour was raised that we in dublin could apprehend no less than an invasion by the pretender who must be landed in the south the result was that the doctor must be struck out of the chaplains list and appear no more at the castle yet whether he were then or be at this day a whig or a tory i think is a secret only it is manifest that he is a zealous hanoverian at least in poetry162 and a great adorer of the present royal family through all its branches his friends likewise assert that he had preached this same sermon often under the same text that not having observed the words till he was in the pulpit and had opened his notes as he is a person a little abstracted he wanted presence of mind to change them and that in the whole sermon there was not a syllable relating to government or party or to the subject of the day  in this incident there seems to have been an union of events that will probably never happen again to the end of the world or at least like the grand conjunction in the heavens which i think they say can arrive but once in twenty thousand years  the second gentleman if i am right in my chronology who under the suspicion of a tory received some favour from his excellency is mr james stopford163 very strongly recommended by the most eminent whig in england on the account of his learning and virtue and other accomplishments he had passed the greatest part of his youth in close study or in travelling and was neither not at home or not at leisure to trouble his thoughts about party which i allow to be a great omission though i cannot honestly place him in the list of tories and therefore think his excellency may be fairly acquitted for making him vicar of finglass worth about one hundred and fifty pounds a year  the third is doctor patrick delany164 this divine lies under some disadvantage having in his youth received many civilities from a certain person then in a very high station here165 for which reason i doubt the doctor never drank his confusion since and what makes the matter desperate it is now too late unless our inquisitors will be content with drinking confusion to his memory the aforesaid eminent person who was a judge of all merit but party distinguished the doctor among other juniors in our university for his learning virtue discretion and good sense but the doctor was then in too good a situation at his college to hope or endeavour at a better establishment from one who had no power to give it him  upon the present lordlieutenants coming over the doctor was named to his excellency by a friend166 among other clergy of distinction as persons whose characters it was proper his excellency should know and by the truth of which the giver would be content to stand or fall in his excellencys opinion since not one of those persons were in particular friendship with the gentleman who gave in their names by this and some other incidents particularly the recommendation of the late archbishop of dublin167 the doctor became known to his excellency whose fatal turn of mind toward heathenish and outlandish books and languages finding as i conceive a like disposition in the doctor was the cause of his becoming so domestic as we are told he is at the castle of dublin  three or four years ago the doctor grown weary of an academic life for some reasons best known to the managers of the discipline in that learned society which it may not be for their honour to mention168 resolved to leave it although by the benefit of the pupils and his seniorfellowship with all its perquisites he received every year between nine hundred and a thousand pounds  and a small northern living in the universitys donation of somewhat better than hundred pounds a year falling at the same time with the chancellorship of christchurch to about equal the value in the gift of his excellency the doctor ventured into the world in a very scanty condition having squandered away all his annual income in a manner which although perhaps proper enough for a clergyman without a family will not be for the advantage of his character to discover either on the exchange or at a bankers shop  about two months ago his excellency gave the doctor a prebend in st patricks cathedral which being of near the same value with either of the two former will add a third part to his revenues after he shall have paid the great incumbrances upon it so that he may now be said to possess of church preferments in scattered tithes three hundred pounds a year instead of the like sum of infallible rents from a senior fellowship with the offices annexed beside the advantage of a free lodging and some other easements  but since the doctor hath not in any of his writings his sermons his actions his discourse or his company discovered one single principle of either whig or tory and that the lord lieutenant still continues to admit him i shall boldly pronounce him one of us but like a new freemason who hath not yet learned all the dialect of the mystery neither can he justly be accused of any tory doctrines except perhaps some among those few with which that wicked party was charged during the height of their power but have been since transferred for the most solid reasons to the whole body of our firmest friends  i have now done with the clergy and upon the strictest examination have not been able to find above one of that order against whom any party suspicion can lie which is the unfortunate gentleman doctor sheridan who by mere chancemedley shot his own fortune dead with a single text  as to the laity i can hear of but one person of the tory stamp who since the beginning of his excellencys government did ever receive any solid mark of his favour i mean sir arthur acheson169 reported to be an acknowledged tory and what is almost as bad a scholar into the bargain it is whispered about as a certain truth that this gentleman is to have a grant of a certain barrack upon his estate within two miles of his own house for which the crown is to be his tenant at the rent of sixty pounds per annum he being only at the expense of about five hundred pounds to put the house in repair build stables and other necessaries i will place this invidious mark of beneficence conferred on a tory in a fair light by computing the costs and necessary defalcations after which it may be seen how much sir arthur will be annually a clear gainer by the public notwithstanding his unfortunate principles and his knowledge in greek and latin    for repairs c 500l the interest whereof per ann 30 0 0   for all manner of poultry to furnish the troopers     but which the said troopers must be at the     labour of catching valued per ann                   5 0 0   for straggling sheep                                     8 0 0   for game destroyed five miles round                      6 0 0                                                                                                                       49 0 0    rent paid to sir arthur        60 0 0     deduct                        49 0 0                                        remains clear                11 0 0                                     thus if sir arthur acheson shall have the good fortune to obtain a grant of this barrack he will receive net profit annually from the crown eleven pounds sterling to help him in entertaining the officers and making provisions for his younger children  it is true there is another advantage to be expected which may fully compensate the loss of cattle and poultry by multiplying the breed of mankind and particularly of good protestants in a part of the kingdom half depopulated by the wild humour among the farmers there of leaving their country but i am not so skilful in arithmetic as to compute the value  i have reckoned one per cent below the legal interest for the money that sir arthur must expend and valued the damage in the other articles very moderately however i am confident he may with good management be a saver at least which is a prodigious instance of moderation in our friends toward a professed tory whatever merit he may pretend by the unwillingness he hath shewn to make his excellency uneasy in his administration  thus i have with the utmost impartiality collected every single favour further than personal civilities conferred by his excellency on tories and reputed tories since his first arrival hither to this present 13th day of april in the year of our lord 1730 giving all allowance possible to the arguments on the other side of the question                                         and the account will stand thus  disposed of preferments and employments to tories or reputed tories by his excellency the lord lieutenant in about the space of six years    to doctor thomas sheridan in a rectory near     kinsale per ann                            100 0 0   to sir arthur acheson baronet a barrack     per ann                                      11 0 0                                                                                                      111 0 0                                                    give me leave now to compute in gross the value of the favours done by his excellency to the true friends of their king and country and of the protestant religion  it is to be remembered that although his excellency cannot be properly said to bestow bishoprics commands in the army the place of a judge or commissioner in the revenue and some others yet they are for the most part disposed upon his recommendation except where the persons are immediately sent from england by their interest at court for which i have allowed large defalcations in the following accounts and it is remarkable that the only considerable station conferred on a reputed tory since his present excellencys government was of this latter kind  and indeed it is but too remarkable that in a neighbouring nation where that dangerous denomination of men is incomparably more numerous more powerful and of consequence more formidable real tories can often with much less difficulty obtain very high favours from the government than their reputed brethren can arrive to the lowest in ours i observe this with all possible submission to the wisdom of their policy which however will not i believe dispute the praise of vigilance with ours                      whig account    to persons promoted to bishoprics or removed     to more beneficial ones computed     per ann                                    10050 0 0   to civil employments                            9030 0 0   to military commands                            8436 0 0                                                                                                     27516 0 0                     tory account    to tories                                         111 0 0

sufficient reason to be fully satisfied with the share of trust and power and employments which they possess under the lenity of the present government so i do not find how his excellency can be justly censured for favouring none but highchurch highfliers termagants laudists sacheverellians tiptopgallantmen jacobites tantivies antihanoverians friends to popery and the pretender and to arbitrary power disobligers of england breakers of dependency inflamers of quarrels between the two nations public incendiaries enemies to the king and kingdoms haters of true protestants laurelmen annists complainers of the nations poverty ormondians iconoclasts antigloriousmemorists whiterosalists tenthajunians and the like when by a fair state of the account the balance i conceive plainly lies on the other side170     a proposal  for  an act of parliament to pay off the debt of the nation  without taxing the subject  by which the number of landed gentry and substantial farmers will be considerably increased and no one person will be the poorer or contribute one farthing to the charge          note        in volume three of the present edition two tracts are given      relating to attempts made by the bishops of ireland for enlarging      their powers these tracts are entitled on the bill for the      clergys residing on their livings and considerations upon two      bills sent down from the house of lords and the house of commons      in ireland relating to the clergy of ireland pp 249272 the      bills which swift argued against were evidently intended to give      the bishops further powers and increased opportunities for making      money the matter is gone into at length in the notes prefixed to      the above reprints the bishops sought rights which would enable      them to obtain large powers in letting leases and their eagerness      to get such powers coupled with the efforts they expended showed      that they had less regard for the churchs interest than for their      own       in the present tract swift with his usual assumption of grave      consideration of an important question but in reality with cutting      irony proposes to dispose of all the church lands for a lump sum      give the bishops their full just share including the amount of      fines for possible renewals of leases and at the same time pay      off the national debt with the money that remains with an air of      strict seriousness he solemnly computes the exact sums obtainable      and impartially divides the amounts with accurate care then with      a dig at the strangers england was continually sending to irish      preferments among whom he counts himself he concludes by saying      that although the interests of such cannot be expected to be those      of the country to which they have been translated yet he as one      of them is quite willing and indeed feels himself in duty bound      to consult the interest of people among whom i have been so well      received and if i can be any way instrumental toward contributing      to reduce this excellent proposal into a law  my sincere      endeavours to serve this church and kingdom will be rewarded                                            the text of this pamphlet is based on that given at the end of the      volume containing the first edition of considerations upon two      bills etc published in 1732       t s     a proposal for an act of parliament to pay off the debt of the nation without taxing the subject   the debts contracted some years past for the service and safety of the nation are grown so great that under our present distressed condition by the want of trade the great remittances to pay absentees regiments serving abroad and many other drains of money well enough known and felt the kingdom seems altogether unable to discharge them by the common methods of payment and either a poll or land tax would be too odious to think of especially the latter because the lands which have been let for these ten or dozen years past were raised so high that the owners can at present hardly receive any rent at all for it is the usual practice of an irish tenant rather than want land to offer more for a farm than he knows he can be ever able to pay and in that case he grows desperate and pays nothing at all so that a landtax upon a racked estate would be a burthen wholly insupportable  the question will then be how these national debts can be paid and how i can make good the several particulars of my proposal which i shall now lay open to the public  the revenues of their graces and lordships the archbishops and bishops of this kingdom excluding the fines do amount by a moderate computation to 36800l per ann i mean the rents which the bishops receive from their tenants but the real value of those lands at a full rent taking the several sees one with another is reckoned to be at least threefourths more so that multiplying 36800l by four the full rent of all the bishops lands will amount to 147200l per ann from which subtracting the present rent received by their lordships that is 36800l the profits of the lands received by the first and second tenants who both have great bargains will rise to the sum of 110400l per ann which lands if they were to be sold at twentytwo years purchase would raise a sum of 2428800l reserving to the bishops their present rents only excluding fines171  of this sum i propose that out of the onehalf which amounts to 1214400l so much be applied as will entirely discharge the debts of the nation and the remainder laid up in the treasury to supply contingencies as well as to discharge some of our heavy taxes until the kingdom shall be in a better condition  but whereas the present set of bishops would be great losers by this scheme for want of their fines which would be hard treatment to such religious loyal and deserving personages i have therefore set apart the other half to supply that defect which it will more than sufficiently do  a bishops lease for the full term is reckoned to be worth eleven years purchase but if we take the bishops round i suppose there may be four years of each lease elapsed and many of the bishops being well stricken in years i cannot think their lives round to be worth more than seven years purchase so that the purchasers may very well afford fifteen years purchase for the reversion especially by one great additional advantage which i shall soon mention  this sum of 2428800l must likewise be sunk very considerably because the lands are to be sold only at fifteen years purchase and this lessens the sum to about 1656000l of which i propose twelve hundred thousand pounds to be applied partly for the payment of the national debt and partly as a fund for future exigencies and the remaining 456000l i propose as a fund for paying the present set of bishops their fines which it will abundantly do and a great part remain as an addition to the public stock  although the bishops round do not in reality receive three fines apiece which take up 21 years yet i allow it to be so but then i will suppose them to take but one years rent in recompense of giving them so large a term of life and thus multiplying 36800l by 3 the product will be only 110400l so that above threefourths will remain to be applied to public use  if i have made wrong computations i hope to be excused as a stranger to the kingdom which i never saw till i was called to an employment and yet where i intend to pass the rest of my days but i took care to get the best information i could and from the most proper persons however the mistakes i may have been guilty of will very little affect the main of my proposal although they should cause a difference of one hundred thousand pounds more or less  these fines are only to be paid to the bishop during his incumbency in the same see if he changeth it for a better the purchasers of the vacant see lands are to come immediately into possession of the see he hath left and both the bishop who is removed and he who comes into his place are to have no more fines for the removed bishop will find his account by a larger revenue and the other see will find candidates enough for the law maxim will here have place that caveat c i mean the persons who succeed may choose whether they will accept or no  as to the purchasers they will probably be tenants to the see who are already in possession and can afford to give more than any other bidders  i will further explain myself if a person already a bishop be removed into a richer see he must be content with the bare revenues without any fines and so must he who comes into a bishopric vacant by death and this will bring the matter sooner to bear which if the crown shall think fit to countenance will soon change the present set of bishops and consequently encourage purchasers of their lands for example if a primate should die and the gradation be wisely made almost the whole set of bishops might be changed in a month each to his great advantage although no fines were to be got and thereby save a great part of that sum which i have appropriated towards supplying the deficiency of fines  i have valued the bishops lands two years purchase above the usual computed rate because those lands will have a sanction from the king and council in england and be confirmed by an act of parliament here besides it is well known that higher prices are given every day for worse lands at the remotest distances and at rack rents which i take to be occasioned by want of trade when there are few borrowers and the little money in private hands lying dead there is no other way to dispose of it but in buying of land which consequently makes the owners hold it so high  besides paying the nations debts the sale of these lands would have many other good effects upon the nation it will considerably increase the number of gentry where the bishops tenants are not able or willing to purchase for the lands will afford an hundred gentlemen a good revenue to each several persons from england will probably be glad to come over hither and be the buyers rather than give thirty years purchase at home under the loads of taxes for the public and the poor as well as repairs by which means much money may be brought among us and probably some of the purchasers themselves may be content to live cheap in a worse country rather than be at the charge of exchange and agencies and perhaps of nonsolvencies in absence if they let their lands too high  this proposal will also multiply farmers when the purchasers will have lands in their own power to give long and easy leases to industrious husbandmen  i have allowed some bishoprics of equal income to be of more or less value to the purchaser according as they are circumstanced for instance the lands of the primacy and some other sees are let so low that they hardly pay a fifth penny of the real value to the bishop and there the fines are the greater on the contrary the sees of meath and clonfert consisting as i am told much of tithes those tithes are annually let to the tenants without any fines so the see of dublin is said to have many feefarms which pay no fines and some leases for lives which pay very little and not so soon nor so duly  i cannot but be confident that their graces my lords the archbishops and my lords the bishops will heartily join in this proposal out of gratitude to his late and present majesty the best of kings who have bestowed such high and opulent stations as well as in pity to this country which is now become their own whereby they will be instrumental towards paying the nations debts without impoverishing themselves enrich an hundred gentlemen as well as free them from dependence and thus remove that envy which is apt to fall upon their graces and lordships from considerable persons whose birth and fortunes rather qualify them to be lords of manors than servile dependants upon churchmen however dignified or distinguished  if i do not flatter myself there could not be any law more popular than this for the immediate tenants to bishops being some of them persons of quality and good estates and more of them grown up to be gentlemen by the profits of these very leases under a succession of bishops think it a disgrace to be subject both to rents and fines at the pleasure of their landlords then the bulk of the tenants especially the dissenters who are our loyal protestant brethren look upon it both as an unnatural and iniquitous thing that bishops should be owners of land at all wherein i beg to differ from them being a point so contrary to the practice of the apostles whose successors they are deemed to be and who although they were contented that land should be sold for the common use of the brethren yet would not buy it themselves but had it laid at their feet to be distributed to poor proselytes  i will add one word more that by such a wholesome law all the oppressions felt by undertenants of church leases which are now laid on by the bishops would entirely be prevented by their graces and lordships consenting to have their lands sold for payment of the nations debts reserving only the present rent for their own plentiful and honourable support  i beg leave to add one particular that when heads of a bill as i find the style runs in this kingdom shall be brought in for forming this proposal into a law i should humbly offer that there might be a power given to every bishop except those who reside in dublin for applying one hundred acres of profitable land that lies nearest to his palace as a demesne for the conveniency of his family  i know very well that this scheme hath been much talked of for some time past and is in the thoughts of many patriots neither was it properly mine although i fell readily into it when it was first communicated to me  though i am almost a perfect stranger in this kingdom yet since i have accepted an employment here of some consequence as well as profit i cannot but think myself in duty bound to consult the interest of a people among whom i have been so well received and if i can be any way instrumental towards contributing to reduce this excellent proposal into a law which being not in the least injurious to england will i am confident meet with no opposition from that side my sincere endeavours to serve this church and kingdom will be well rewarded     a case submitted by dean swift to mr lindsay counsellor at law172   a b agent for j s comes to desire j s to sign an assignment of a lease in order to be registered for the security of 38l j s asks a b to show him the lease a b says he left it at home j s asks the said a b how many years of the lease are unexpired what rent the tenant pays and how much below the rack value and what number of acres there are upon the farm to each of which questions the agent a b answers categorically that he cannot tell and that he did not think j would ask him such questions the said a b was asked how he came two years after the lease was assigned and not sooner to have it registered a b answers that he could not sue till the assignment  query whether the said agent a b made any one answer like a man of business     an  examination  of  certain abuses corruptions and enormities  in the city of dublin          note        like many of swifts satirical writings the title of this tract is      no indication to its subjectmatter whatever abuses corruptions      and enormities may have been rife in the city of dublin in swifts      time the pamphlet which follows certainly throws no light on them      it is in no sense a social document but it is a very amusing and      excellent piece of jeering at the fancied apprehensions that were      rife about the pretender the disaffected people and the      jacobites it is aimed at the whigs who were continually using the      party cries of no popery jacobitism and the other cognate      expressions to distress their political opponents at the same      time these cries had their effects and created a great deal of      mischief the roman catholics in particular were cruelly treated      because of the anxiety for the protestant succession and among the      lower tradesmen for whom such cries would be of serious meaning a      petty persecution against their roman catholic fellowtradesmen      continually prevailed monck mason draws attention to some curious      instances see his history of st patricks cathedral p 399      note y       in the journals of the irish house of commons vol ii p 77      is the record of a petition presented in the year 1695 by the      protestant porters of the city of dublin against one darby ryan      a papist and notoriously disaffected this ryan was complained of      for employing those of his own persuasion and affection to carry a      cargo of coals he had bought to his own customers the petitioners      complained that they protestants were debased and hindered from      their small trade and gains another set of petitioners was the      drivers of hackney coaches they complained that before the late      trouble they got a livelihood by driving coaches in and about the      city of dublin but since that time so many papists had got      coaches and drove them with such ordinary horses that the      petitioners could hardly get bread they therefore prayed the      house that none but protestant hackneycoachmen may have liberty to      keep and drive hackneycoaches swift may have had these instances      in his mind when he urges that the criers who cry their wares in      dublin should be true protestants and should give security to the      government for permission to cry       in a country where such absurd complaints could be seriously      presented and as seriously considered a genuine apprehension must      have existed the whigs in making capital out of this existing      feeling stigmatized their tory opponents as high churchmen and      therefore very little removed from papists and therefore      jacobites of course there were no real grounds for such epithets      but they indulged in them nevertheless with the addition of      insinuations and suggestionsno insinuation being too feeble or      too farfetched so long as it served       swift writing in the person of a whig affects extreme anxiety for      the most ridiculous of signs and finds a papist or a jacobite      or a disaffected person in the least likely of places the tract      in this light is a really amusing piece swift takes the      opportunity also to hit walpole under a pretended censure of his      extravagance corruption and avarice                                            the text here given of this tract is based on that of the original      edition issued in dublin in 1732 the last paragraph however does      not appear in that edition and is reprinted here from scott       t s     an  examination  of certain  abuses corruptions  and  enormities  in the  city of dublin  illustration  dublin printed in the year 1732     nothing is held more commendable in all great cities especially the metropolis of a kingdom than what the french call the police by which word is meant the government thereof to prevent the many disorders occasioned by great numbers of people and carriages especially through narrow streets in this government our famous city of dublin is said to be very defective and universally complained of many wholesome laws have been enacted to correct those abuses but are ill executed and many more are wanting which i hope the united wisdom of the nation whereof so many good effects have already appeared this session will soon take into their most profound consideration  as i have been always watchful over the good of mine own country and particularly for that of our renowned city where absit invidia i had the honour to draw my first breath173 i cannot have a minutes ease or patience to forbear enumerating some of the greatest enormities abuses and corruptions spread almost through every part of dublin and proposing such remedies as i hope the legislature will approve of  the narrow compass to which i have confined myself in this paper will allow me only to touch at the most important defects and such as i think seem to require the most speedy redress  and first perhaps there was never known a wiser institution than that of allowing certain persons of both sexes in large and populous cities to cry through the streets many necessaries of life it would be endless to recount the conveniences which our city enjoys by this useful invention and particularly strangers forced hither by business who reside here but a short time for these having usually but little money and being wholly ignorant of the town might at an easy price purchase a tolerable dinner if the several criers would pronounce the names of the goods they have to sell in any tolerable language and therefore till our lawmakers shall think it proper to interpose so far as to make these traders pronounce their words in such terms that a plain christian hearer may comprehend what is cried i would advise all new comers to look out at their garret windows and there see whether the thing that is cried be tripes or flummery buttermilk or cowheels for as things are now managed how is it possible for an honest countryman just arrived to find out what is meant for instance by the following words with which his ears are constantly stunned twice a day mugs jugs and porringers up in the garret and down in the cellar i say how is it possible for any stranger to understand that this jargon is meant as an invitation to buy a farthings worth of milk for his breakfast or supper unless his curiosity draws him to the window or till his landlady shall inform him i produce this only as one instance among a hundred much worse i mean where the words make a sound wholly inarticulate which give so much disturbance and so little information  the affirmation solemnly made in the cry of herrings is directly against all truth and probability herrings alive alive here the very proverb will convince us of this for what is more frequent in ordinary speech than to say of some neighbour for whom the passingbell rings that he is dead as a herring and pray how is it possible that a herring which as philosophers observe cannot live longer than one minute three seconds and a half out of water should bear a voyage in open boats from howth to dublin be tossed into twenty hands and preserve its life in sieves for several hours nay we have witnesses ready to produce that many thousands of these herrings so impudently asserted to be alive have been a day and a night upon dry land but this is not the worst what can we think of those impious wretches who dare in the face of the sun vouch the very same affirmative of their salmon and cry salmon alive alive whereas if you call the woman who cries it she is not ashamed to turn back her mantle and shew you this individual salmon cut into a dozen pieces i have given good advice to these infamous disgracers of their sex and calling without the least appearance of remorse and fully against the conviction of their own consciences i have mentioned this grievance to several of our parish ministers but all in vain so that it must continue until the government shall think fit to interpose  there is another cry which from the strictest observation i can make appears to be very modern and it is that of sweethearts174 and is plainly intended for a reflection upon the female sex as if there were at present so great a dearth of lovers that the women instead of receiving presents from men were now forced to offer money to purchase sweethearts neither am i sure that the cry doth not glance at some disaffection against the government insinuating that while so many of our troops are engaged in foreign service and such a great number of our gallant officers constantly reside in england the ladies are forced to take up with parsons and attorneys but this is a most unjust reflection as may soon be proved by any person who frequents the castle our public walks our balls and assemblies where the crowds of toupees175 were never known to swarm as they do at present  there is a cry peculiar to this city which i do not remember to have been used in london or at least not in the same terms that it has been practised by both parties during each of their power but very unjustly by the tories while these were at the helm they grew daily more and more impatient to put all true whigs and hanoverians out of employments to effect which they hired certain ordinary fellows with large baskets on their shoulders to call aloud at every house dirt to carry out giving that denomination to our whole party as if they would signify that the kingdom could never be cleansed till we were swept from the earth like rubbish but since that happy turn of times when we were so miraculously preserved by just an inch from popery slavery massacre and the pretender i must own it prudence in us still to go on with the same cry which hath ever since been so effectually observed that the true political dirt is wholly removed and thrown on its proper dunghills there to corrupt and be no more heard of  but to proceed to other enormities every person who walks the streets must needs observe the immense number of human excrements at the doors and steps of waste houses and at the sides of every dead wall for which the disaffected party have assigned a very false and malicious cause they would have it that these heaps were laid there privately by british fundaments to make the world believe that our irish vulgar do daily eat and drink and consequently that the clamour of poverty among us must be false proceeding only from jacobites and papists they would confirm this by pretending to observe that a british anus being more narrowly perforated than one of our own country and many of these excrements upon a strict view appearing copple crowned with a point like a cone or pyramid are easily distinguished from the hibernian which lie much flatter and with lest continuity i communicated this conjecture to an eminent physician who is well versed in such profound speculations and at my request was pleased to make trial with each of his fingers by thrusting them into the anus of several persons of both nations and professed he could find no such difference between them as those illdisposed people allege on the contrary he assured me that much the greater number of narrow cavities were of hibernian origin this i only mention to shew how ready the jacobites are to lay hold of any handle to express their malice against the government i had almost forgot to add that my friend the physician could by smelling each finger distinguish the hibernian excrement from the british and was not above twice mistaken in an hundred experiments upon which he intends very soon to publish a learned dissertation  there is a diversion in this city which usually begins among the butchers but is often continued by a succession of other people through many streets it is called the cossing of a dog and i may justly number it among our corruptions the ceremony is this a strange dog happens to pass through a fleshmarket whereupon an expert butcher immediately cries in a loud voice and the proper tone coss coss several times the same word is repeated by the people the dog who perfectly understands the terms of art and consequently the danger he is in immediately flies the people and even his own brother animals pursue the pursuit and cry attend him perhaps half a mile he is well worried in his flight and sometimes hardly escapes this our illwishers of the jacobite kind are pleased to call a persecution and affirm that it always falls upon dogs of the tory principle but we can well defend ourselves by justly alleging that when they were uppermost they treated our dogs full as inhumanly as to my own part who have in former times often attended these processions although i can very well distinguish between a whig and tory dog yet i never carried my resentments very far upon a party principle except it were against certain malicious dogs who most discovered their malice against us in the worst of times176 and i remember too well that in the wicked ministry of the earl of oxford a large mastiff of our party being unmercifully cossed ran without thinking between my legs as i was coming up fishamble street and as i am of low stature with very short legs bore me riding backwards down the hill for above two hundred yards and although i made use of his tail for a bridle holding it fast with both my hands and clung my legs as close to his sides as i could yet we both came down together into the middle of the kennel where after rolling three or four times over each other i got up with much ado amid the shouts and huzzas of a thousand malicious jacobites i cannot indeed but gratefully acknowledge that for this and many other services and sufferings i have been since more than overpaid  this adventure may perhaps have put me out of love with the diversions of cossing which i confess myself an enemy to unless we could always be sure of distinguishing tory dogs whereof great numbers have since been so prudent as entirely to change their principles and are now justly esteemed the best worriers of their former friends  i am assured and partly know that all the chimneysweepers boys where members of parliament chiefly lodge are hired by our enemies to skulk in the tops of chimneys with their heads no higher than will just permit them to look round and at the usual hours when members are going to the house if they see a coach stand near the lodging of any loyal member they call coach coach as loud as they can bawl just at the instant when the footman begins to give the same call and this is chiefly done on those days when any point of importance is to be debated this practice may be of very dangerous consequence for these boys are all hired by enemies to the government and thus by the absence of a few members for a few minutes a question may be carried against the true interest of the kingdom and very probably not without any eye toward the pretender  i have not observed the wit and fancy of this town so much employed in any one article as that of contriving variety of signs to hang over houses where punch is to be sold the bowl is represented full of punch the ladle stands erect in the middle supported sometimes by one and sometimes by two animals whose feet rest upon the edge of the bowl these animals are sometimes one black lion and sometimes a couple sometimes a single eagle and sometimes a spread one and we often meet a crow a swan a bear or a cock in the same posture  now i cannot find how any of these animals either separate or in conjunction are properly speaking either fit emblems or embellishments to advance the sale of punch besides it is agreed among naturalists that no brute can endure the taste of strong liquor except where he hath been used to it from his infancy and consequently it is against all the rules of hieroglyph to assign those animals as patrons or protectors of punch for in that case we ought to suppose that the host keeps always ready the real bird or beast whereof the picture hangs over his door to entertain his guest which however to my knowledge is not true in fact for not one of those birds is a proper companion for a christian as to aiding and assisting in making the punch for the birds as they are drawn upon the sign are much more likely to mute or shed their feathers into the liquor then as to the bear he is too terrible awkward and slovenly a companion to converse with neither are any of them at all handy enough to fill liquor to the company i do therefore vehemently suspect a plot intended against the government by these devices for although the spreadeagle be the arms of germany upon which account it may possibly be a lawful protestant sign yet i who am very suspicious of fair outsides in a matter which so nearly concerns our welfare cannot but call to mind that the pretenders wife is said to be of german birth and that many popish princes in so vast an extent of land are reported to excel both at making and drinking punch besides it is plain that the spreadeagle exhibits to us the perfect figure of a cross which is a badge of popery then as to the cock he is well known to represent the french nation our old and dangerous enemy the swan who must of necessity cover the entire bowl with his wings can be no other than the spaniard who endeavours to engross all the treasures of the indies to himself the lion is indeed the common emblem of royal power as well as the arms of england but to paint him black is perfect jacobitism and a manifest type of those who blacken the actions of the best princes it is not easy to distinguish whether the other fowl painted over the punchbowl be a crow or raven it is true they have both been held ominous birds but i rather take it to be the former because it is the disposition of a crow to pick out the eyes of other creatures and often even of christians after they are dead and is therefore drawn here with a design to put the jacobites in mind of their old practice first to lull us asleep which is an emblem of death and then to blind our eyes that we may not see their dangerous practices against the state  to speak my private opinion the least offensive picture in the whole set seems to be the bear because he represents ursa major or the great bear who presides over the north where the reformation first began and which next to britain including scotland and the north of ireland is the great protector of the protestant religion but however in those signs where i observe the bear to be chained i cant help surmising a jacobite contrivance by which these traitors hint an earnest desire of using all true whigs as the predecessors did the primitive christians i mean to represent us as bears and then halloo their tory dogs to bait us to death  thus i have given a fair account of what i dislike in all those signs set over those houses that invite us to punch i own it was a matter that did not need explaining being so very obvious to the most common understanding yet i know not how it happens but methinks there seems a fatal blindness to overspread our corporeal eyes as well as our intellectual and i heartily wish i may be found a false prophet for these are not bare suspicions but manifest demonstrations  therefore away with those popish jacobite and idolatrous gewgaws and i heartily wish a law were enacted under severe penalties against drinking any punch at all for nothing is easier than to prove it a disaffected liquor the chief ingredients which are brandy oranges and lemons are all sent us from popish countries and nothing remains of protestant growth but sugar and water for as to biscuit which formerly was held a necessary ingredient and is truly british we find it is entirely rejected  but i will put the truth of my assertion past all doubt i mean that this liquor is by one important innovation grown of ill example and dangerous consequence to the public it is well known that by the true original institution of making punch left us by captain ratcliffe the sharpness is only occasioned by the juice of lemons and so continued till after the happy revolution oranges alas are a mere innovation and in a manner but of yesterday it was the politics of jacobites to introduce them gradually and to what intent the thing speaks itself it was cunningly to shew their virulence against his sacred majesty king william of ever glorious and immortal memory but of late to shew how fast disloyalty increaseth they came from one or two and then to three oranges nay at present we often find punch made all with oranges and not one single lemon for the jacobites before the death of that immortal prince had by a superstition formed a private prayer that as they squeezed the orange so might that protestant king be squeezed to death177 according to that known sorcery described by virgil    limus ut hic durescit et hæc ut cera liquescit c                                              ecl viii 80  and thus the romans when they sacrificed an ox used this kind of prayer as i knock down this ox so may thou o jupiter knock down our enemies in like manner after king williams death whenever a jacobite squeezed an orange he had a mental curse upon the glorious memory and a hearty wish for power to squeeze all his majestys friends to death as he squeezed that orange which bore one of his titles as he was prince of orange this i do affirm for truth many of that faction having confessed it to me under an oath of secrecy which however i thought it my duty not to keep when i saw my dear country in danger but what better can be expected from an impious set of men who never scruple to drink confusion to all true protestants under the name of whigs a most unchristian and inhuman practice which to our great honour and comfort was never charged upon us even by our most malicious detractors  the sign of two angels hovering in the air and with their right hands supporting a crown is met with in several parts of this city and hath often given me great offence for whether by the unskilfulness or dangerous principles of the painters although i have good reasons to suspect the latter those angels are usually drawn with such horrid countenances that they give great offence to every loyal eye and equal cause of triumph to the jacobites being a most infamous reflection upon our most able and excellent ministry  i now return to that great enormity of our city cries most of which we have borrowed from london i shall consider them only in a political view as they nearly affect the peace and safety of both kingdoms and having been originally contrived by wicked machiavels to bring in popery slavery and arbitrary power by defeating the protestant succession and introducing the pretender ought in justice to be here laid open to the world  about two or three months after the happy revolution all persons who possessed any employment or office in church or state were obliged by an act of parliament to take the oaths to king william and queen mary and a great number of disaffected persons refusing to take the said oaths from a pretended scruple of conscience but really from a spirit of popery and rebellion they contrived a plot to make the swearing to those princes odious in the eyes of the people to this end they hired certain women of ill fame but loud shrill voices under pretence of selling fish to go through the streets with sieves on their heads and cry buy my soul buy my soul plainly insinuating that all those who swore to king william were just ready to sell their souls for an employment this cry was revived at the death of queen anne and i hear still continues in london with great offence to all true protestants but to our great happiness seems to be almost dropped in dublin  but because i altogether contemn the displeasure and resentment of highfliers tories and jacobites whom i look upon to be worse even than professed papists i do here declare that those evils which i am going to mention were all brought in upon us in the worst of times under the late earl of oxfords administration during the four last years of queen annes reign that wicked minister was universally known to be a papist in his heart he was of a most avaricious nature and is said to have died worth four millions sterl178 besides his vast expenses in building statues gold plate jewels and other costly rarities he was of a mean obscure birth from the very dregs of the people and so illiterate that he could hardly read a paper at the council table i forbear to touch at his open profane profligate life because i desire not to rake into the ashes of the dead and therefore i shall observe this wise maxim de mortuis nil nisi bonum  this flagitious man in order to compass his black designs employed certain wicked instruments which great statesmen are never without to adapt several london cries in such a manner as would best answer his ends and whereas it was upon grounds grievously suspected that all places at court were sold to the highest bidder certain women were employed by his emissaries to carry fish in baskets on their heads and bawl through the streets buy my fresh places i must indeed own that other women used the same cry who were innocent of this wicked design and really sold their fish of that denomination to get an honest livelihood but the rest who were in the secret although they carried fish in their sieves or baskets to save appearances yet they had likewise a certain sign somewhat resembling that of the freemasons which the purchasers of places knew well enough and were directed by the women whither they were to resort and make their purchase and i remember very well how oddly it looked when we observed many gentlemen finely dressed about the court end of the town and as far as york buildings where the lord treasurer oxford dwelt calling the women who cried buy my fresh places and talking to them in the corner of a street after they understood each others sign but we never could observe that any fish was bought  some years before the cries last mentioned the duke of savoy was reported to have made certain overtures to the court of england for admitting his eldest son by the duchess of orleanss daughter to succeed to the crown as next heir upon the pretenders being rejected and that son was immediately to turn protestant it was confidently reported that great numbers of people disaffected to the then illustrious but now royal house of hanover were in those measures whereupon another set of women were hired by the jacobite leaders to cry through the whole town buy my savoys dainty savoys curious savoys but i cannot directly charge the late earl of oxford with this conspiracy because he was not then chief minister however the wicked cry still continues in london and was brought over hither where it remains to this day and in my humble opinion a very offensive sound to every true protestant who is old enough to remember those dangerous times  during the ministry of that corrupt and jacobite earl abovementioned the secret pernicious design of those in power was to sell flanders to france the consequence of which must have been the infallible ruin of the statesgeneral and would have opened the way for france to obtain that universal monarchy after which they have so long aspired to which the british dominions must next after holland have been compelled to submit and the protestant religion would be rooted out of the world  a design of this vast importance after long consultation among the jacobite grandees with the earl of oxford at their head was at last determined to be carried on by the same method with the former it was therefore again put in practice but the conduct of it was chiefly left to chosen men whose voices were louder and stronger than those of the other sex and upon this occasion was first instituted in london that famous cry of flounders but the criers were particularly directed to pronounce the word flaunders and not flounders for the country which we now by corruption call flanders is in its true orthography spelt flaunders as may be obvious to all who read old english books i say from hence begun that thundering cry which hath ever since stunned the ears of all london made so many children fall into fits and women miscarry come buy my fresh flaunders curious flaunders charming flaunders alive alive ho which last words can with no propriety of speech be applied to fish manifestly dead as i observed before in herrings and salmon but very justly to ten provinces which contain many millions of living christians and the application is still closer when we consider that all the people were to be taken like fishes in a net and by assistance of the pope who sets up to be the universal fisher of men the whole innocent nation was according to our common expression to be laid as flat as a flounder  i remember myself a particular crier of flounders in london who arrived at so much fame for the loudness of his voice that he had the honour to be mentioned upon that account in a comedy he hath disturbed me many a morning before he came within fifty doors of my lodging and although i were not in those days so fully apprized of the designs which our common enemy had then in agitation yet i know not how by a secret impulse young as i was i could not forbear conceiving a strong dislike against the fellow and often said to myself this cry seems to be forged in the jesuits school alas poor england i am grievously mistaken if there be not some popish plot at the bottom i communicated my thoughts to an intimate friend who reproached me with being too visionary in my speculations but it proved afterwards that i conjectured right and i have often since reflected that if the wicked faction could have procured only a thousand men of as strong lungs as the fellow i mentioned none can tell how terrible the consequences might have been not only to these two kingdoms but over all europe by selling flanders to france and yet these cries continue unpunished both in london and dublin although i confess not with equal vehemency or loudness because the reason for contriving this desperate plot is to our great felicity wholly ceased  it is well known that the majority of the british house of commons in the last years of queen annes reign were in their hearts directly opposite to the earl of oxfords pernicious measures which put him under the necessity of bribing them with salaries whereupon he had again recourse to his old politics and accordingly his emissaries were very busy in employing certain artful women of no good life or conversation as it was fully proved before justice peyton to cry that vegetable commonly called celery through the town these women differed from the common criers of that herb by some private mark which i could never learn but the matter was notorious enough and sufficiently talked of and about the same period was the cry of celery brought over into this kingdom but since there is not at this present the least occasion to suspect the loyalty of our criers upon that article i am content that it may still be tolerated  i shall mention but one cry more which hath any reference to politics but is indeed of all others the most insolent as well as treasonable under our present happy establishment i mean that of turnups not of turnips according to the best orthography but absolutely turnups although this cry be of an older date than some of the preceding enormities for it began soon after the revolution yet was it never known to arrive at so great a height as during the earl of oxfords power some people whom i take to be private enemies are indeed as ready as myself to profess their disapprobation of this cry on pretence that it began by the contrivance of certain old procuresses who kept houses of illfame where lewd women met to draw young men into vice and this they pretend to prove by some words in the cry because after the crier had bawled out turnups ho buy my dainty turnups he would sometimes add the two following verses    turn up the mistress and turn up the maid   and turn up the daughter and be not afraid  this say some political sophists plainly shews that there can be nothing further meant in this infamous cry than an invitation to lewdness which indeed ought to be severely punished in all wellregulated governments but cannot be fairly interpreted as a crime of state but i hope we are not so weak and blind to be deluded at this time of day with such poor evasions i could if it were proper demonstrate the very time when those two verses were composed and name the author who was no other than the famous mr swan so well known for his talent at quibbling and was as virulent a jacobite as any in england neither could he deny the fact when he was taxed for it in my presence by sir harry buttoncolt and colonel davenport at the smyrna coffeehouse on the 10th of june 1701 thus it appears to a demonstration that those verses were only a blind to conceal the most dangerous designs of that party who from the first years after the happy revolution used a cant way of talking in their clubs after this manner we hope to see the cards shuffled once more and another king turn up trump and when shall we meet over a dish of turnups the same term of art was used in their plots against the government and in their treasonable letters writ in ciphers and deciphered by the famous dr wallis as you may read in the trials of those times this i thought fit to set forth at large and in so clear a light because the scotch and french authors have given a very different account of the word turnup but whether out of ignorance or partiality i shall not decree because i am sure the reader is convinced by my discovery it is to be observed that this cry was sung in a particular manner by fellows in disguise to give notice where those traitors were to meet in order to concert their villainous designs  i have no more to add upon this article than an humble proposal that those who cry this root at present in our streets of dublin may be compelled by the justices of the peace to pronounce turnip and not turnup for i am afraid we have still too many snakes in our bosom and it would be well if their cellars were sometimes searched when the owners least expect it for i am not out of fear that latet anguis in herbâ  thus we are zealous in matters of small moment while we neglect those of the highest importance i have already made it manifest that all these cries were contrived in the worst of times under the ministry of that desperate statesman robert late earl of oxford and for that very reason ought to be rejected with horror as begun in the reign of jacobites and may well be numbered among the rags of popery and treason or if it be thought proper that these cries must continue surely they ought to be only trusted in the hands of true protestants who have given security to the government  having already spoken of many abuses relating to signposts i cannot here omit one more because it plainly relates to politics and is perhaps of more dangerous consequence than any of the city cries because it directly tends to destroy the succession it is the sign of his present majesty king george the second to be met with in many streets and yet i happen to be not only the first but the only discoverer of this audacious instance of jacobitism and i am confident that if the justices of the peace would please to make a strict inspection they might find in all such houses before which those signs are hung up in the manner i have observed that the landlords were malignant papists or which is worse notorious jacobites whoever views those signs may read over his majestys head the following letters and ciphers g r ii which plainly signifies george king the second and not king george the second or george the second king but laying the point after the letter g by which the owner of the house manifestly shews that he renounces his allegiance to king george the second and allows him to be only the second king inuendo that the pretender is the first king and looking upon king george to be only a kind of second king or viceroy till the pretender shall come over and seize the kingdom i appeal to all mankind whether this be a strained or forced interpretation of the inscription as it now stands in almost every street whether any decipherer would make the least doubt or hesitation to explain it as i have done whether any other protestant country would endure so public an instance of treason in the capital city from such vulgar conspirators and lastly whether papists and jacobites of great fortunes and quality may not probably stand behind the curtain in this dangerous open and avowed design against the government but i have performed my duty and leave the reforming of these abuses to the wisdom the vigilance the loyalty and activity of my superiors179     a serious and useful scheme  to make an  hospital for incurables          note        this piece included by sir walter scott for the first time among      swifts writings was in the opinion of that editor indisputably      the work of the dean of st patricks the present editor sees no      reason to disagree with this judgement and it is therefore      reprinted here the original issue of 1733 printed by faulkner      contained also swifts petition of the footmen in and about      dublin and had a lengthy advertisement of the complete works of      swift which faulkner was at that time projecting it is      difficult however to understand why the tract was not included in      later editions of swifts complete works sir walter scott puts      forward an explanation suggested by dr barrett who believed the      reason to have been that this jeu desprit might be interpreted      as casting a slur on an hospital erected upon lazorshill now on      the donnybrook road near dublin for the reception of persons      afflicted with incurable maladies the reason seems a poor one      though it may have been as dr barrett states a better argument      might be found from the style and subject matter of the tract      itself the style is strongly swifts and the subject of such an      hospital must certainly have occupied swifts thoughts at this      time since he left his fortune for the erection of a similar      building                                            the text of the present edition is based on that of the volume      issued by faulkner in 1733 compared with the dublin reprint of the      following year       t s     a  serious and useful  scheme  to make an  hospital for incurables  of  universal benefit to all his majestys subjects                                       humbly addressed to the rt hon the lord  the rt hon sir  and to the rt hon  esq                                       to which is added  a petition of the footmen in and about dublin                                       fæcunda culpæ seculahor                                       printed at london and  dublin  printed by george faulkner and sold at his shop in essex street opposite to the bridge and by g risk g ewing and w smith booksellers in damestreet 1733     there is not any thing which contributes more to the reputation of particular persons or to the honour of a nation in general than erecting and endowing proper edifices for the reception of those who labour under different kinds of distress the diseased and unfortunate are thereby delivered from the misery of wanting assistance and others are delivered from the misery of beholding them  it is certain that the genius of the people of england is strongly turned to public charities and to so noble a degree that almost in every part of this great and opulent city and also in many of the adjacent villages we meet with a great variety of hospitals supported by the generous contributions of private families as well as by the liberality of the public some for seamen worn out in the service of their country and others for infirm disabled soldiers some for the maintenance of tradesmen decayed and others for their widows and orphans some for the service of those who linger under tedious distempers and others for such as are deprived of their reason  but i find upon nice inspection that there is one kind of charity almost totally disregarded which nevertheless appears to me of so excellent a nature as to be at present more wanted and better calculated for the ease quietness and felicity of this whole kingdom than any other can possibly be i mean an hospital for incurables  i must indeed confess that an endowment of this nature would prove a very large and perpetual expense however i have not the least diffidence that i shall be able effectually to convince the world that my present scheme for such an hospital is very practicable and must be very desirable by every one who hath the interest of his country or his fellowcreatures really at heart  it is observable that although the bodies of human creatures be affected with an infinite variety of disorders which elude the power of medicine and are often found to be incurable yet their minds are also overrun with an equal variety which no skill no power no medicine can alter or amend and i think that out of regard to the public peace and emolument as well as the repose of many pious and valuable families this latter species of incurables ought principally to engage our attention and beneficence  i believe an hospital for such incurables will be universally allowed necessary if we only consider what numbers of absolute incurables every profession rank and degree would perpetually produce which at present are only national grievances and of which we can have no other effectual method to purge the kingdom  for instance let any man seriously consider what numbers there are of incurable fools incurable knaves incurable scolds incurable scribblers besides myself incurable coxcombs incurable infidels incurable liars incurable whores in all places of public resortnot to mention the incurably vain incurably envious incurably proud incurably affected incurably impertinent and ten thousand other incurables which i must of necessity pass over in silence lest i should swell this essay into a volume and without doubt every unprejudiced person will agree that out of mere christian charity the public ought to be eased as much as possible of this troublesome and intolerable variety of incurables  and first under the denomination of incurable fools we may reasonably expect that such an hospital would be furnished with considerable numbers of the growth of our own universities who at present appear in various professions in the world under the venerable titles of physicians barristers and ecclesiastics  and as those ancient seminaries have been for some years past accounted little better than nurseries of such sort of incurables it should seem highly commendable to make some kind of provision for them because it is more than probable that if they are to be supported by their own particular merit in their several callings they must necessarily acquire but a very indifferent maintenance  i would not willingly be here suspected to cast reflections on any order of men as if i thought that small gains from the profession of any art or science were always an undoubted sign of an equally small degree of understanding for i profess myself to be somewhat inclined to a very opposite opinion having frequently observed that at the bar the pulse and the pulpit those who have the least learning or sense to plead meet generally with the largest share of promotions and profit of which many instances might be produced but the public seems to want no conviction in this particular  under the same denominations we may further expect a large and ridiculous quantity of old rich widows whose eager and impatient appetites inflame them with extravagant passions for fellows of a very different age and complexion from themselves who purchase contempt and aversion with good jointures and being loaded with years infirmities and probably ill humour are forced to bribe into their embraces such whose fortunes and characters are equally desperate  besides our collection of incurable fools would receive an incredible addition from every one of the following articles  from young extravagant heirs who are just of a competent age to become the bubbles of jockeys sportsmen gamesters bullies sharpers courtesans and such sort of honourable pickpockets  from misers who half starve themselves to feed the prodigality of their heirs and who proclaim to the world how unworthy they are of possessing estates by the wretched and ridiculous methods they take to enjoy them  from contentious people of all conditions who are content to waste the greatest part of their own fortunes at law to be the instruments of impoverishing others  from those who have any confidence in profession of friendship before trial or any dependence on the fidelity of a mistress  from young illiterate squires who travel abroad to import lewdness conceit arrogance vanity and foppery of which commodities there seems to be so great an abundance at home  from young clergymen who contrive by matrimony to acquire a family before they have obtained the necessary means to maintain one  from those who have considerable estates in different kingdoms and yet are so incurably stupid as to spend their whole incomes in this  these and several other articles which might be mentioned would afford us a perpetual opportunity of easing the public by having an hospital for the accommodation of such incurables who at present either by the overfondness of near relations or the indolence of the magistrates are permitted to walk abroad and appear in the most crowded places of this city as if they were indeed reasonable creatures  i had almost forgot to hint that under this article there is a modest probability that many of the clergy would be found properly qualified for admittance into the hospital who might serve in the capacity of chaplains and save the unnecessary expense of salaries  to these fools in order succeed such as may justly be included under the extensive denomination of incurable knaves of which our several inns of court would constantly afford us abundant supplies  i think indeed that of this species of incurables there ought to be a certain limited number annually admitted which number neither any regard to the quiet or benefit of the nation nor any other charitable or publicspirited reason should tempt us to exceed because if all were to be admitted on such a foundation who might be reputed incurable of this distemper and if it were possible for the public to find any place large enough for their reception i have not the least doubt that all our inns which are at this day so crowded would in a short time be emptied of their inhabitants and the law that beneficial craft want hands to conduct it  i tremble to think what herds of attorneys solicitors pettifoggers scriveners usurers hackneyclerks pickpockets pawnbrokers jailors and justices of the peace would hourly be driven to such an hospital and what disturbance it might also create in several noble and wealthy families  what unexpected distress might it prove to several men of fortune and quality to be suddenly deprived of their rich stewards in whom they had for many years reposed the utmost confidence and to find them irrecoverably lodged among such a collection of incurables  how many orphans might then expect to see their guardians hurried away to the hospital and how many greedy executors find reason to lament the want of opportunity to pillage  would not exchange alley have cause to mourn for the loss of its stockjobbers and brokers and the charitable corporation for the confinement of many of its directors  might not westminsterhall as well as all the gaminghouses in this great city be entirely unpeopled and the professors of art in each of those assemblies become useless in their vocations by being deprived of all future opportunity to be dishonest  in short it might put the whole kingdom into confusion and disorder and we should find that the entire revenues of this nation would be scarce able to support so great a number of incurables in this way as would appear qualified for admission into our hospital  for if we only consider how this kingdom swarms with quadrilletables and gaminghouses both public and private and also how each of those houses as well as westminsterhall aforesaid swarms with knaves who are anxious to win or fools who have anything to lose we may be soon convinced how necessary it will be to limit the number of incurables comprehended under these titles lest the foundation should prove insufficient to maintain any others besides them  however if by this scheme of mine the nation can be eased of twenty or thirty thousand such incurables i think it ought to be esteemed somewhat beneficial and worthy of the attention of the public  the next sort for whom i would gladly provide and who for several generations have proved insupportable plagues and grievances to the good people of england are those who may properly be admitted under the character of incurable scolds  i own this to be a temper of so desperate a nature that few females can be found willing to own themselves anyway addicted to it and yet it is thought that there is scarce a single parson prentice alderman squire or husband who would not solemnly avouch the very reverse  i could wish indeed that the word scold might be changed for some more gentle term of equal signification because i am convinced that the very name is as offensive to female ears as the effects of that incurable distemper are to the ears of the men which to be sure is inexpressible  and that it hath been always customary to honour the very same kind of actions with different appellations only to avoid giving offence is evident to common observation  for instance how many lawyers attorneys solicitors undersheriffs intriguing chambermaids and counterofficers are continually guilty of extortion bribery oppression and many other profitable knaveries to drain the purses of those with whom they are any way concerned and yet all these different expedients to raise a fortune pass generally under the milder names of fees perquisites vails presents gratuities and such like although in strictness of speech they should be called robbery and consequently be rewarded with a gibbet  nay how many honourable gentlemen might be enumerated who keep open shop to make a trade of iniquity who teach the law to wink whenever power or profit appears in her way and contrive to grow rich by the vice the contention or the follies of mankind and who nevertheless instead of being branded with the harshsounding names of knaves pilferers or public oppressors as they justly merit are only distinguished by the title of justices of the peace in which single term all those several appellations are generally thought to be implied  but to proceed when first i determined to prepare this scheme for the use and inspection of the public i intended to examine one whole ward in this city that my computation of the number of incurable scolds might be more perfect and exact but i found it impossible to finish my progress through more than one street  i made my first application to a wealthy citizen in cornhill commoncouncilman for his ward to whom i hinted that if he knew eer an incurable scold in the neighbourhood i had some hope to provide for her in such a manner as to hinder her from being further troublesome he referred me with great delight to his nextdoor friend yet whispered me that with much greater ease and pleasure he could furnish me out of his own family  and begged the preference  his nextdoor friend owned readily that his wifes qualifications were not misrepresented and that he would cheerfully contribute to promote so useful a scheme but positively asserted that it would be of small service to rid the neighbourhood of one woman while such multitudes would remain all equally insupportable  by which circumstance i conjectured that the quantity of these incurables in london westminster and southwark would be very considerable and that a generous contribution might reasonably be expected for such an hospital as i am recommending  besides the number of these female incurables would probably be very much increased by additional quantities of old maids who being wearied with concealing their illhumour for onehalf of their lives are impatient to give it full vent in the other for old maids like old thinbodied wines instead of growing more agreeable by years are observed for the most part to become intolerably sharp sour and useless  under this denomination also we may expect to be furnished with as large a collection of old bachelors especially those who have estates and but a moderate degree of understanding for an old wealthy bachelor being perpetually surrounded with a set of flatterers cousins poor dependents and wouldbe heirs who for their own views submit to his perverseness and caprice becomes insensibly infected with this scolding malady which generally proves incurable and renders him disagreeable to his friends and a fit subject for ridicule to his enemies  as to the incurable scribblers of which society i have the honour to be a member they probably are innumerable and of consequence it will be absolutely impossible to provide for onetenth part of their fraternity however as this set of incurables are generally more plagued with poverty than any other it will be a double charity to admit them on the foundation a charity to the world to whom they are a common pest and nuisance and a charity to themselves to relieve them from want contempt kicking and several other accidents of that nature to which they are continually liable  grubstreet itself would then have reason to rejoice to see so many of its halfstarved manufacturers amply provided for and the whole tribe of meagre incurables would probably shout for joy at being delivered from the tyranny and garrets of printers publishers and booksellers  what a mixed multitude of balladwriters odemakers translators farcecompounders operamongers biographers pamphleteers and journalists would appear crowding to the hospital not unlike the brutes resorting to the ark before the deluge and what an universal satisfaction would such a sight afford to all except pastrycooks grocers chandlers and tobaccoretailers to whom alone the writings of those incurables were anyway profitable  i have often been amazed to observe what a variety of incurable coxcombs are to be met with between st jamess and limehouse at every hour of the day as numerous as welsh parsons and equally contemptible how they swarm in all coffeehouses theatres public walks and private assemblies how they are incessantly employed in cultivating intrigues and every kind of irrational pleasure how industrious they seem to mimic the appearance of monkeys as monkeys are emulous to imitate the gestures of men and from such observations i concluded that to confine the greatest part of those incurables who are so many living burlesques of human nature would be of eminent service to this nation and i am persuaded that i am far from being singular in that opinion  as for the incurable infidels and liars i shall range them under the same article and would willingly appoint them the same apartment in the hospital because there is a much nearer resemblance between them than is generally imagined  have they not an equal delight in imposing falsities on the public and seem they not equally desirous to be thought of more sagacity and importance than others do they not both report what both know to be false and both confidently assert what they are conscious is most liable to contradiction  the parallel might easily be carried on much further if the intended shortness of this essay would admit it however i cannot forbear taking notice with what immense quantities of incurable liars his majestys kingdoms are overrun what offence and prejudice they are to the public what inconceivable injury to private persons and what a necessity there is for an hospital to relieve the nation from the curse of so many incurables  this distemper appears almost in as many different shapes as there are persons afflicted with it and in every individual is always beyond the power of medicine  some lie for their interest such as fishmongers flatterers pimps lawyers fortunehunters and fortunetellers and others lie for their entertainment as maids wives widows and all other teatable attendants  some lie out of vanity as poets painters players fops military officers and all those who frequent the levees of the great and others lie out of ill nature as old maids c  some lie out of custom as lovers coxcombs footmen sailors mechanics merchants and chambermaids and others lie out of complaisance or necessity as courtiers chaplains c in short it were endless to enumerate them all but this sketch may be sufficient to give us some small imperfect idea of their numbers  as to the remaining incurables we may reasonably conclude that they bear at least an equal proportion to those already mentioned but with regard to the incurable whores in this kingdom i must particularly observe that such of them as are public and make it their profession have proper hospitals for their reception already if we could find magistrates without passions or officers without an incurable itch to a bribe and such of them as are private and make it their amusement i should be unwilling to disturb for two reasons  first because it might probably afflict many noble wealthy contented and unsuspecting husbands by convincing them of their own dishonour and the unpardonable disloyalty of their wives and secondly because it will be for ever impossible to confine a woman from being guilty of any kind of misconduct when once she is firmly resolved to attempt it  from all which observations every reasonable man must infallibly be convinced that an hospital for the support of these different kinds of incurables would be extremely beneficial to these kingdoms i think therefore that nothing further is wanting but to demonstrate to the public that such a scheme is very practicable both by having an undoubted method to raise an annual income at least sufficient to make the experiment which is the way of founding all hospitals and by having also a strong probability that such an hospital would be supported by perpetual benefactions which in very few years might enable us to increase the number of incurables to ninetenths more than we can reasonably venture on at first                                       a computation of the daily and annual expenses of an hospital to be erected for incurables                                                                    per day    incurable fools are almost infinite however at   first i would have only twenty thousand admitted   and allowing to each person but one shilling per   day for maintenance which is as low as possible the   daily expense for this article will be                            £1000    incurable knaves are if possible more numerous   including foreigners especially irishmen yet i   would limit the number of these to about thirty   thousand which would amount to                                    1500    incurable scolds would be plentifully supplied   from almost every family in the kingdom and indeed   to make this hospital of any real benefit we   cannot admit fewer even at first than thirty thousand   including the ladies of billingsgate and leadenhall   market which is                                                   1500    the incurable scribblers are undoubtedly a very   considerable society and of that denomination i   would admit at least forty thousand because it is   to be supposed that such incurables will be found   in greatest distress for a daily maintenance and   if we had not great encouragement to hope that   many of that class would properly be admitted   among the incurable fools i should strenuously intercede   to have ten or twenty thousand more added   but their allowed number will amount to                            2000    incurable coxcombs are very numerous and   considering what numbers are annually imported   from france and italy we cannot admit fewer than   ten thousand which will be                                         500    incurable infidels as they affect to be called   should be received into the hospital to the number   of ten thousand however if it should accidentally   happen to grow into a fashion to be believers it is   probable that the great part of them would in a   very short time be dismissed from the hospital as   perfectly cured their expense would be                             500    incurable liars are infinite in all parts of the kingdom   and making allowance for citizens wives   mercers prentices newswriters old maids and   flatterers we cannot possibly allow a smaller number   than thirty thousand which will amount to                         1500    the incurable envious are in vast quantities   throughout this whole nation nor can it reasonably   be expected that their numbers should lessen while   fame and honours are heaped upon some particular   persons as the public reward of their superior   accomplishments while others who are equally excellent   in their own opinions are constrained to   live unnoticed and contemned and as it would   be impossible to provide for all those who are possessed   with this distemper i should consent to admit   only twenty thousand at first by way of experiment   amounting to                                                       1000    of the incurable vain affected and impertinent   i should at least admit ten thousand which number   i am confident will appear very inconsiderable if   we include all degrees of females from the duchess   to the chambermaid all poets who have had a little   success especially in the dramatic way and all   players who have met with a small degree of approbation   amounting only to                                                   500  by which plain computation it is evident that two hundred thousand persons will be daily provided for and the allowance for maintaining this collection of incurables may be seen in the following account                                                                    per day   for the incurable   fools being           20000 at one shilling each               £1000   knaves                 30000          ditto

amount to such a sum as in 365   days comes to                                     £3650000  and i am fully satisfied that a sum much greater than this may easily be raised with all possible satisfaction to the subject and without interfering in the least with the revenues of the crown  in the first place a large proportion of this sum might be raised by the voluntary contribution of the inhabitants  the computed number of people in great britain is very little less than eight millions of which upon a most moderate computation we may account one half to be incurables and as all those different incurables whether acting in the capacity of friends acquaintances wives husbands daughters counsellors parents old maids or old bachelors are inconceivable plagues to all those with whom they happen to be concerned and as there is no hope of being eased of such plagues except by such an hospital which by degrees might be enlarged to contain them all i think it cannot be doubted that at least three millions and an half of people out of the remaining proportion would be found both able and desirous to contribute so small a sum as twenty shillings per annum for the quiet of the kingdom the peace of private families and the credit of the nation in general and this contribution would amount to very near our requisite sum  nor can this by any means be esteemed a wild conjecture for where is there a man of common sense honesty or goodnature who would not gladly propose even a much greater sum to be freed from a scold a knave a fool a liar a coxcomb conceitedly repeating the compositions of others or a vain impertinent poet repeating his own  in the next place it may justly be supposed that many young noblemen knights squires and extravagant heirs with very large estates would be confined in our hospital and i would propose that the annual income of every particular incurables estate should be appropriated to the use of the house but besides these there will undoubtedly be many old misers aldermen justices directors of companies templars and merchants of all kinds whose personal fortunes are immense and who should proportionably pay to the hospital  yet lest by being here misunderstood i should seem to propose an unjust or oppressive scheme i shall further explain my design  suppose for instance a young nobleman possessed of ten or twenty thousand pounds per annum should accidentally be confined there as an incurable i would have only such a proportion of his estate applied to the support of the hospital as he himself would spend if he were at liberty and after his death the profits of the estate should regularly devolve to the next lawful heir whether male or female  and my reason for this proposal is because considerable estates which probably would be squandered away among hounds horses whores sharpers surgeons tailors pimps masquerades or architects if left to the management of such incurables would by this means become of some real use both to the public and themselves and perhaps this may be the only method which can be found to make such young spendthrifts of any real benefit to their country  and although the estates of deceased incurables might be permitted to descend to the next heirs the hospital would probably sustain no great disadvantage because it is very likely that most of these heirs would also gradually be admitted under some denomination or other and consequently their estates would again devolve to the use of the hospital  as to the wealthy misers c i would have their private fortunes nicely examined and calculated because if they were old bachelors as it would frequently happen their whole fortunes should then be appropriated to the endowment but if married i would leave twothirds of their fortunes for the support of their families which families would cheerfully consent to give away the remaining third if not more to be freed from such peevish and disagreeable governors  so that deducting from the two hundred thousand incurables the forty thousand scribblers who to be sure would be found in very bad circumstances i believe among the remaining hundred and sixty thousand fools knaves and coxcombs so many would be found of large estates and easy fortunes as would at least produce two hundred thousand pounds per annum  as a further addition to our endowment i would have a tax upon all inscriptions and tombstones monuments and obelisks erected to the honour of the dead or on porticoes and trophies to the honour of the living because these will naturally and properly come under the article of lies pride vanity c  and if all inscriptions throughout this kingdom were impartially examined in order to tax those which should appear demonstrably false or flattering i am convinced that not onefifth part of the number would after such a scrutiny escape exempted  many an ambitious turbulent spirit would then be found belied with the opposite title of lover of his country and many a middlesex justice as improperly described sleeping in hope of salvation  many an usurer discredited by the appellations of honest and frugal and many a lawyer with the character of conscientious and equitable  many a british statesman and general decaying with more honour than they lived and their dusts distinguished with a better reputation than when they were animated  many dull parsons improperly styled eloquent and as many stupid physicians improperly styled learned  yet notwithstanding the extensiveness of a tax upon such monumental impositions i will count only upon twenty thousand at five pounds per annum each which will amount to one hundred thousand pounds annually  to these annuities i would also request the parliament of this nation to allow the benefit of two lotteries yearly by which the hospital would gain two hundred thousand pounds clear nor can such a request seem any way extraordinary since it would be appropriated to the benefit of fools and knaves which is the sole cause of granting one for this present year  in the last place i would add the estate of richard norton esq180 and to do his memory all possible honour i would have his statue erected in the very first apartment of the hospital or in any other which might seem more apt and on his monument i would permit a long inscription composed by his dearest friends which should remain taxfree for ever  from these several articles therefore would annually arise the following sums                                                             m th h

   c that of richard norton esq always    excepted                                                100000   by two annual lotteries                                   200000   by the estate of richard

                             and the necessary sum for the hospital being            £3650000   there will remain annually over and above                 356000  which sum of 356000l should be applied towards erecting the building and answer accidental expenses in such a manner as should seem most proper to promote the design of the hospital but the whole management of it should be left to the skill and discretion of those who are to be constituted governors  it may indeed prove a work of some small difficulty to fix upon a commodious place large enough for a building of this nature i should have thoughts of attempting to enclose all yorkshire if i were not apprehensive that it would be crowded with so many incurable knaves of its own growth that there would not be the least room left for the reception of any others by which accident our whole project might be retarded for some time  thus have i set this matter in the plainest light i could that every one may judge of the necessity usefulness and practicableness of this scheme and i shall only add a few scattered hints which to me seem not altogether unprofitable  i think the prime minister for the time being ought largely to contribute to such a foundation because his high station and merits must of necessity infect a great number with envy hatred lying and such sort of distempers and of consequence furnish the hospital annually with many incurables  i would desire that the governors appointed to direct this hospital should have if such a thing were possible some appearance of religion and belief in god because those who are to be admitted as incurable infidels atheists deists and freethinkers most of which tribe are only so out of pride conceit and affectation might perhaps grow gradually into believers if they perceived it to be the custom of the place where they lived  although it be not customary for the natives of ireland to meet with any manner of promotion in this kingdom i would in this respect have that national prejudice entirely laid aside and request that for the reputation of both kingdoms a large apartment in the hospital may be fitted up for irishmen particularly who either by knavery lewdness or fortunehunting should appear qualified for admittance because their numbers would certainly be very considerable  i would further request that a father who seems delighted at seeing his son metamorphosed into a fop or a coxcomb because he hath travelled from london to paris may be sent along with the young gentleman to the hospital as an old fool absolutely incurable  if a poet hath luckily produced anything especially in the dramatic way which is tolerably well received by the public he should be sent immediately to the hospital because incurable vanity is always the consequence of a little success and if his compositions be ill received let him be admitted as a scribbler  and i hope in regard to the great pains i have taken about this scheme that i shall be admitted upon the foundation as one of the scribbling incurables but as an additional favour i entreat that i may not be placed in an apartment with a poet who hath employed his genius for the stage because he will kill me with repeating his own compositions and i need not acquaint the world that it is extremely painful to bear any nonsenseexcept our own  my private reason for soliciting so early to be admitted is because it is observed that schemers and projectors are generally reduced to beggary but by my being provided for in the hospital either as an incurable fool or a scribbler that discouraging observation will for once be publicly disproved and my brethren in that way will be secure of a public reward for their labours  it gives me i own a great degree of happiness to reflect that although in this short treatise the characters of many thousands are contained among the vast variety of incurables yet not any one person is likely to be offended because it is natural to apply ridiculous characters to all the world except ourselves and i dare be bold to say that the most incurable fool knave scold coxcomb scribbler or liar in this whole nation will sooner enumerate the circle of their acquaintance as addicted to those distempers than once imagine themselves any way qualified for such an hospital  i hope indeed that our wise legislature will take this project into their serious consideration and promote an endowment which will be of such eminent service to multitudes of his majestys unprofitable subjects and may in time be of use to themselves and their posterity                                         from my garret in moorfields aug 20 1733     to the honourable  house of commons c  the humble petition of the footmen in and about the city of dublin          note        swift may have written the following mock petition by way of satire      against the many absurd petitions which were presented at the time      to the irish house of commons and of which two examples were      quoted in the note to a previous tract if coalporters and      hackneycoachmen might address the honourable house why not      footmen                                            the present text is based on that found at the end of swifts      serious and useful scheme to make an hospital for incurables      issued by george faulkner in 1733 faulkner reprinted this volume      in 1734       t s     to the honourable house of commons c  the humble petition of the footmen in and about the city of dublin   humbly sheweth  that your petitioners are a great and numerous society endowed with several privileges time out of mind  that certain lewd idle and disorderly persons for several months past as it is notoriously known have been daily seen in the public walks of this city habited sometimes in green coats and sometimes in laced with long oaken cudgels in their hands and without swords in hopes to procure favour by that advantage with a great number of ladies who frequent those walks pretending and giving themselves out to be true genuine irish footmen whereas they can be proved to be no better than common toupees182 as a judicious eye may soon discover by their awkward clumsy ungenteel gait and behaviour by their unskilfulness in dress even with the advantage of wearing our habits by their illfavoured countenances with an air of impudence and dulness peculiar to the rest of their brethren who have not yet arrived at that transcendent pitch of assurance although it may be justly apprehended that they will do so in time if these counterfeits shall happen to succeed in their evil design of passing for real footmen thereby to render themselves more amiable to the ladies  your petitioners do further allege that many of the said counterfeits upon a strict examination have been found in the very act of strutting swearing staring swaggering in a manner that plainly shewed their best endeavours to imitate us wherein although they did not succeed yet by their ignorant and ungainly way of copying our graces the utmost indignity was endeavoured to be cast upon our whole profession  your petitioners do therefore make it their humble request that this honourable house to many of whom your petitioners are nearly allied will please to take this grievance into your most serious consideration humbly submitting whether it would not be proper that certain officers might at the public charge be employed to search for and discover all such counterfeit footmen and carry them before the next justice of peace by whose warrant upon the first conviction they should be stripped of their coats and oaken ornaments and be set two hours in the stocks upon the second conviction besides stripping be set six hours in the stocks with a paper pinned on their breast signifying their crime in large capital letters and in the following words a b commonly called a b esq a toupee and a notorious impostor who presumed to personate a true irish footman  and for any further offence the said toupee shall be committed to bridewell whipped three times forced to hard labour for a month and not be set at liberty till he shall have given sufficient security for his good behaviour  your honours will please to observe with what lenity we propose to treat these enormous offenders who have already brought such a scandal on our honourable calling that several wellmeaning people have mistaken them to be of our fraternity in diminution to that credit and dignity wherewith we have supported our station as we always did in the worst of times183 and we further beg leave to remark that this was manifestly done with a seditious design to render us less capable of serving the public in any great employments as several of our fraternity as well as our ancestors have done  we do therefore humbly implore your honours to give necessary orders for our relief in this present exigency and your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray c    dublin 1733     advice  to the  freemen of the city of dublin  in the choice of a member to represent them in parliament  written in the year 1733          note        swift here argues that a holder of an office under the government      cannot of necessity be an honest representative of the people      there were two candidates before the freemen for the suffrages of      the city one lord mayor french and the other mr john macarrell      the latter was an officeholder he was register to the barracks      and received his salary from the government it was not to be      expected that he would vote against his employer be he never so      honest a man swift openly informs the freemen that the drapier is      against this man the lord mayor was elected                                            the text of this advice is based on that given in the eighth      volume of swifts collected works issued in 1746 the forster      collection contains a madeup booklet of pp 196205 taken from a      volume of one of the collected editions       t s     advice to the freemen of the city of dublin in the choice of a member to represent them in parliament   those few writers who since the death of alderman burton have employed their pens in giving advice to our citizens how they should proceed in electing a new representative for the next sessions having laid aside their pens i have reason to hope that all true lovers of their country in general and particularly those who have any regard for the privileges and liberties of this great and ancient city will think a second and a third time before they come to a final determination upon what person they resolve to fix their choice  i am told there are only two persons who set up for candidates one is the present lord mayor184 and the other a gentleman of good esteem an alderman of the city a merchant of reputation and possessed of a considerable office under the crown185 the question is which of these two persons it will be most for the advantage of the city to elect i have but little acquaintance with either so that my inquiries will be very impartial and drawn only from the general character and situation of both  in order to this i must offer my countrymen and fellowcitizens some reasons why i think they ought to be more than ordinarily careful at this juncture upon whom they bestow their votes  to perform this with more clearness it may be proper to give you a short state of our unfortunate country  we consist of two parties i do not mean popish and protestant high and low church episcopal and sectarians whig and tory but of these english who happen to be born in this kingdom whose ancestors reduced the whole nation under the obedience of the english crown and the gentlemen sent from the other side to possess most of the chief employments here this latter party is very much enlarged and strengthened by the whole power in the church the law the army the revenue and the civil administration deposited in their hands although out of political ends and to save appearances some employments are still deposited yet gradually in a smaller number to persons born here this proceeding fortified with good words and many promises is sufficient to flatter and feed the hopes of hundreds who will never be one farthing the better as they might easily be convinced if they were qualified to think at all  civil employments of all kinds have been for several years past with great prudence made precarious and during pleasure by which means the possessors are and must inevitably be for ever dependent yet those very few of any consequence which are dealt with so sparing a hand to persons born among us are enough to keep hope alive in great numbers who desire to mend their condition by the favour of those in power  now my dear fellowcitizens how is it possible you can conceive that any person who holds an office of some hundred pounds a year which may be taken from him whenever power shall think fit will if he should be chosen a member for any city do the least thing when he sits in the house that he knows or fears may be displeasing to those who gave him or continue him in that office believe me these are no times to expect such an exalted degree of virtue from mortal men blazing stars are much more frequently seen than such heroical worthies and i could sooner hope to find ten thousand pounds by digging in my garden than such a phoenix by searching among the present race of mankind  i cannot forbear thinking it a very erroneous as well as modern maxim of politics in the english nation to take every opportunity of depressing ireland whereof an hundred instances may be produced in points of the highest importance and within the memory of every middleaged man although many of the greatest persons among that party which now prevails have formerly upon that article much differed in their opinion from their present successors  but so the fact stands at present it is plain that the court and country party here i mean in the house of commons very seldom agree in anything but their loyalty to his present majesty their resolutions to make him and his viceroy easy in the government to the utmost of their power under the present condition of the kingdom but the persons sent from england who to a trifle are possessed of the sole executive power in all its branches with their few adherents in possession who were born here and hundreds of expectants hopers and promissees put on quite contrary notions with regard to ireland they count upon a universal submission to whatever shall be demanded wherein they act safely because none of themselves except the candidates feel the least of our pressures  i remember a person of distinction some days ago affirmed in a good deal of mixed company and of both parties that the gentry from england who now enjoy our highest employments of all kinds can never be possibly losers of one farthing by the greatest calamities that can befall this kingdom except a plague that would sweep away a million of our hewers of wood and drawers of water or an invasion that would fright our grandees out of the kingdom for this person argued that while there was a penny left in the treasury the civil and military list must be paid and that the episcopal revenues which are usually farmed out at six times below the real value could hardly fail he insisted farther that as money diminished the price of all necessaries for life must of consequence do so too which would be for the advantage of all persons in employment as well as of my lords the bishops and to the ruin of everybody else among the company there wanted not men in office besides one or two expectants yet i did not observe any of them disposed to return an answer but the consequences drawn were these that the great men in power sent hither from the other side were by no means upon the same foot with his majestys other subjects of ireland they had no common ligament to bind them with us they suffered not with our sufferings and if it were possible for us to have any cause of rejoicing they could not rejoice with us  suppose a person born in this kingdom shall happen by his services for the english interest to have an employment conferred on him worth four hundred pounds a year and that he hath likewise an estate in land worth four hundred pounds a year more suppose him to sit in parliament then suppose a landtax to be brought in of five shillings a pound for ten years i tell you how this gentleman will compute he hath four hundred pounds a year in land the tax he must pay yearly is one hundred pounds by which in ten years he will pay only a thousand pounds but if he gives his vote against this tax he will lose four thousand pounds by being turned out of his employment together with the power and influence he hath by virtue or colour of his employment and thus the balance will be against him three thousand pounds  i desire my fellowcitizens you will please to call to mind how many persons you can vouch for among your acquaintance who have so much virtue and selfdenial as to lose four hundred pounds a year for life together with the smiles and favour of power and the hopes of higher advancement merely out of a generous love of his country  the contentions of parties in england are very different from those among us the battle there is fought for power and riches and so it is indeed among us but whether a great employment be given to tom or to peter they were both born in england the profits are to be spent there all employments except a very few are bestowed on the natives they do not send to germany holland sweden or denmark much less to ireland for chancellors bishops judges or other officers their salaries whether well or ill got are employed at home and whatever their morals or politics be the nation is not the poorer  the house of commons in england have frequently endeavoured to limit the number of members who should be allowed to have employments under the crown several acts have been made to that purpose which many wise men think are not yet effectual enough and many of them are rendered ineffectual by leaving the power of reelection our house of commons consists i think of about three hundred members if one hundred of these should happen to be made up of persons already provided for joined with expecters compliers easy to be persuaded such as will give a vote for a friend who is in hopes to get something if they be merry companions without suspicion of a natural bashfulness not apt or able to look forwards if good words smiles and caresses have any power over them the larger part of a second hundred may be very easily brought in at a most reasonable rate  there is an englishman186 of no long standing among us but in an employment of great trust power and profit this excellent person did lately publish at his own expense a pamphlet printed in england by authority to justify the bill for a general excise or inland duty in order to introduce that blessed scheme among us what a tender care must such an english patriot for ireland have of our interest if he should condescend to sit in our parliament i will bridle my indignation however methinks i long to see that mortal who would with pleasure blow us all up at a blast but he duly receives his thousand pounds a year makes his progresses like a king is received in pomp at every town and village where he travels187 and shines in the english newspapers  i will now apply what i have said to you my brethren and fellowcitizens count upon it as a truth next to your creed that no one person in office of which he is not master for life whether born here or in england will ever hazard that office for the good of this country one of your candidates is of this kind and i believe him to be an honest gentleman as the word honest is generally understood but he loves his employment better than he doth you or his country or all the countries upon earth will you contribute and give him city security to pay him the value of his employment if it should be taken from him during his life for voting on all occasions with the honest country party in the housealthough i must question whether he would do it even upon that condition  wherefore since there are but two candidates i entreat you will fix on the present lord mayor he hath shewn more virtue more activity more skill in one years government of the city than a hundred years can equal he hath endeavoured with great success to banish frauds corruptions and all other abuses from amongst you  a dozen such men in power would be able to reform a kingdom he hath no employment under the crown nor is likely to get or solicit for any his education having not turned him that way i will assure for no mans future conduct but he who hath hitherto practised the rules of virtue with so much difficulty in so great and busy a station deserves your thanks and the best return you can make him and you my brethren have no other to give him than that of representing you in parliament tell me not of your engagements and promises to another your promises were sins of inconsideration at best and you are bound to repent and annul them that gentleman although with good reputation is already engaged on the other side he hath four hundred pounds a year under the crown which he is too wise to part with by sacrificing so good an establishment to the empty names of virtue and love of his country i can assure you the drapier is in the interest of the present lord mayor whatever you may be told to the contrary i have lately heard him declare so in public company and offer some of these very reasons in defence of his opinion although he hath a regard and esteem for the other gentleman but would not hazard the good of the city and the kingdom for a compliment  the lord mayors severity to some unfair dealers should not turn the honest men among them against him whatever he did was for the advantage of those very traders whose dishonest members he punished he hath hitherto been above temptation to act wrong and therefore as mankind goes he is the most likely to act right as a representative of your city as he constantly did in the government of it     some  considerations  humbly offered to the right honourable the lord mayor the court of aldermen and commoncouncil of the honourable city of dublin  in the  choice of a recorder  1733     some considerations in the choice of a recorder   the office of recorder to this city being vacant by the death of a very worthy gentleman188 it is said that five or six persons are soliciting to succeed him in the employment i am a stranger to all their persons and to most of their characters which latter i hope will at this time be canvassed with more decency than it sometimes happeneth upon the like occasions therefore as i am wholly impartial i can with more freedom deliver my thoughts how the several persons and parties concerned ought to proceed in electing a recorder for this great and ancient city  and first as it is a very natural so i can by no means think it an unreasonable opinion that the sons or near relations of aldermen and other deserving citizens should be duly regarded as proper competitors for an employment in the citys disposal provided they be equally qualified with other candidates and provided that such employments require no more than common abilities and common honesty but in the choice of a recorder the case is entirely different he ought to be a person of good abilities in his calling of an unspotted character an able practitioner one who hath occasionally merited of this city before he ought to be of some maturity in years a member of parliament and likely to continue so regular in his life firm in his loyalty to the hanover succession indulgent to tender consciences but at the same time a firm adherer to the established church if he be such a one who hath already sat in parliament it ought to be inquired of what weight he was there whether he voted on all occasions for the good of his country and particularly for advancing the trade and freedom of this city whether he be engaged in any faction either national or religious and lastly whether he be a man of courage not to be drawn from his duty by the frown or menaces of power nor capable to be corrupted by allurements or bribesthese and many other particulars are of infinitely more consequence than that single circumstance of being descended by a direct or collateral line from any alderman or distinguished citizen dead or alive  there is not a dealer or shopkeeper in this city of any substance whose thriving less or more may not depend upon the good or ill conduct of a recorder he is to watch every motion in parliament that may the least affect the freedom trade or welfare of it  in this approaching election the commons as they are a numerous body so they seem to be most concerned in point of interest and their interest ought to be most regarded because it altogether dependeth upon the true interest of the city they have no private views and giving their votes as i am informed by balloting they lie under no awe or fear of disobliging competitors it is therefore hoped that they will duly consider which of the candidates is most likely to advance the trade of themselves and their brothercitizens to defend their liberties both in and out of parliament against all attempts of encroachment or oppression and so god direct them in the choice of a recorder who may for many years supply that important office with skill diligence courage and fidelity and let all the people say amen     a proposal  for giving  badges to the beggars in all the parishes of dublin          note        the badging of beggars was a favourite scheme of swifts for the      better regulation of the many who infested the city of dublin as      tramps and idlers while many of these were really deserving      persons there were a great many also who made the business of      begging a profession eleven years before this tract was printed      swift wrote to archbishop king on the same subject as will be seen      from the letter quoted in the note on pages 326327                                            the present text is based on the original edition of 1737 collated      with that given by sir walter scott       t s     a  proposal  for giving  badges  to the  beggars  in all the  parishes of dublin  by the  dean of st patricks                                       london  printed for t cooper at the globe in pater noster row  mdccxxxvii  price six pence     it hath been a general complaint that the poorhouse especially since the new constitution by act of parliament hath been of no benefit to this city for the ease of which it was wholly intended i had the honour to be a member of it many years before it was new modelled by the legislature not from any personal regard but merely as one of the two deans who are of course put into most commissions that relate to the city and i have likewise the honour to have been left out of several commissions upon the score of party in which my predecessors time out of mind have always been members  the first commission was made up of about fifty persons which were the lord mayor aldermen and sheriffs and some few other citizens the judges the two archbishops the two deans of the city and one or two more gentlemen and i must confess my opinion that the dissolving the old commission and establishing a new one of nearly three times the number have been the great cause of rendering so good a design not only useless but a grievance instead of a benefit to the city in the present commission all the city clergy are included besides a great number of squires not only those who reside in dublin and the neighbourhood but several who live at a great distance and cannot possibly have the least concern for the advantage of the city  at the few general meetings that i have attended since the new establishment i observed very little was done except one or two acts of extreme justice which i then thought might as well have been spared and i have found the court of assistants usually taken up in little brangles about coachmen or adjusting accounts of meal and small beer which however necessary might sometimes have given place to matters of much greater moment i mean some schemes recommended to the general board for answering the chief ends in erecting and establishing such a poorhouse and endowing it with so considerable a revenue and the principal end i take to have been that of maintaining the poor and orphans of the city where the parishes are not able to do it and clearing the streets from all strollers foreigners and sturdy beggars with which to the universal complaint and admiration dublin is more infested since the establishment of the poorhouse than it was ever known to be since its first erection  as the whole fund for supporting this hospital is raised only from the inhabitants of the city so there can be hardly any thing more absurd than to see it misemployed in maintaining foreign beggars and bastards or orphans whose country landlords never contributed one shilling towards their support i would engage that half this revenue if employed with common care and no very great degree of common honesty would maintain all the real objects of charity in this city except a small number of original poor in every parish who might without being burthensome to the parishioners find a tolerable support  i have for some years past applied myself to several lord mayors and to the late archbishop of dublin189 for a remedy to this evil of foreign beggars and they all appeared ready to receive a very plain proposal i mean that of badging the original poor of every parish who begged in the streets190 that the said beggars should be confined to their own parishes that they should wear their badges well sewn upon one of their shoulders always visible on pain of being whipped and turned out of town or whatever legal punishment may be thought proper and effectual but by the wrong way of thinking in some clergymen and the indifference of others this method was perpetually defeated to their own continual disquiet which they do not ill deserve and if the grievance affected only them it would be of less consequence because the remedy is in their own power but all streetwalkers and shopkeepers bear an equal share in this hourly vexation  i never heard more than one objection against this expedient of badging the poor and confining their walks to their several parishes the objection was this what shall we do with the foreign beggars must they be left to starve i answered no but they must be driven or whipped out of town and let the next country parish do as they please or rather after the practice in england send them from one parish to another until they reach their own homes by the old laws of england still in force and i presume by those of ireland every parish is bound to maintain its own poor and the matter is of no such consequence in this point as some would make it whether a country parish be rich or poor in the remoter and poorer parishes of the kingdom all necessaries for life proper for poor people are comparatively cheaper i mean buttermilk oatmeal potatoes and other vegetables and every farmer or cottager who is not himself a beggar can sometimes spare a sup or a morsel not worth the fourth part of a farthing to an indigent neighbour of his own parish who is disabled from work a beggar native of the parish is known to the squire to the church minister to the popish priest or the conventicle teachers as well as to every farmer he hath generally some relations able to live and contribute something to his maintenance none of which advantages can be reasonably expected on a removal to places where he is altogether unknown if he be not quite maimed he and his trull and litter of brats if he hath any may get half their support by doing some kind of work in their power and thereby be less burthensome to the people in short all necessaries of life grow in the country and not in cities and are cheaper where they grow nor is it equal that beggars should put us to the charge of giving them victuals and the carriage too  but when the spirit of wandering takes him attended by his female and their equipage of children he becomes a nuisance to the whole country he and his female are thieves and teach the trade of stealing to their brood at four years old and if his infirmities be counterfeit it is dangerous for a single person unarmed to meet him on the road he wanders from one county to another but still with a view to this town whither he arrives at last and enjoys all the privileges of a dublin beggar  i do not wonder that the country squires should be very willing to send up their colonies but why the city should be content to receive them is beyond my imagination  if the city were obliged by their charter to maintain a thousand beggars they could do it cheaper by eighty per cent a hundred miles off than in this town or any of its suburbs  there is no village in connaught that in proportion shares so deeply in the daily increasing miseries of ireland as its capital city to which miseries there hardly remained any addition except the perpetual swarms of foreign beggars who might be banished in a month without expense and with very little trouble  as i am personally acquainted with a great number of street beggars i find some weak attempts to have been made in one or two parishes to promote the wearing of badges and my first question to those who ask an alms is where is your badge i have in several years met with about a dozen who were ready to produce them some out of their pockets others from under their coat and two or three on their shoulders only covered with a sort of capes which they could lift up or let down upon occasion they are too lazy to work they are not afraid to steal nor ashamed to beg and yet are too proud to be seen with a badge as many of them have confessed to me and not a few in very injurious terms particularly the females they all look upon such an obligation as a high indignity done to their office i appeal to all indifferent people whether such wretches deserve to be relieved as to myself i must confess this absurd insolence hath so affected me that for several years past i have not disposed of one single farthing to a street beggar nor intend to do so until i see a better regulation and i have endeavoured to persuade all my brotherwalkers to follow my example which most of them assure me they do for if beggary be not able to beat out pride it cannot deserve charity however as to persons in coaches and chairs they bear but little of the persecution we suffer and are willing to leave it entirely upon us  to say the truth there is not a more undeserving vicious race of human kind than the bulk of those who are reduced to beggary even in this beggarly country for as a great part of our publick miseries is originally owing to our own faults but what those faults are i am grown by experience too wary to mention so i am confident that among the meaner people nineteen in twenty of those who are reduced to a starving condition did not become so by what lawyers call the work of god either upon their bodies or goods but merely from their own idleness attended with all manner of vices particularly drunkenness thievery and cheating  whoever enquires as i have frequently done from those who have asked me an alms what was their former course of life will find them to have been servants in good families broken tradesmen labourers cottagers and what they call decayed housekeepers but to use their own cant reduced by losses and crosses by which nothing can be understood but idleness and vice  as this is the only christian country where people contrary to the old maxim are the poverty and not the riches of the nation so the blessing of increase and multiply is by us converted into a curse and as marriage hath been ever countenanced in all free countries so we should be less miserable if it were discouraged in ours as far as can be consistent with christianity it is seldom known in england that the labourer the lower mechanick the servant or the cottager thinks of marrying until he hath saved up a stock of money sufficient to carry on his business nor takes a wife without a suitable portion and as seldom fails of making a yearly addition to that stock with a view of providing for his children but in this kingdom the case is directly contrary where many thousand couples are yearly married whose whole united fortunes bating the rags on their backs would not be sufficient to purchase a pint of buttermilk for their wedding supper nor have any prospect of supporting their honourable state but by service or labour or thievery nay their happiness is often deferred until they find credit to borrow or cunning to steal a shilling to pay their popish priest or infamous couplebeggar surely no miraculous portion of wisdom would be required to find some kind of remedy against this destructive evil or at least not to draw the consequences of it upon our decaying city the greatest part whereof must of course in a few years become desolate or in ruins  in all other nations that are not absolutely barbarous parents think themselves bound by the law of nature and reason to make some provision for their children but the reasons offered by the inhabitants of ireland for marrying is that they may have children to maintain them when they grow old and unable to work  i am informed that we have been for some time past extremely obliged to england for one very beneficial branch of commerce for it seems they are grown so gracious as to transmit us continually colonies of beggars in return of a million of money they receive yearly from hence that i may give no offence i profess to mean real english beggars in the literal meaning of the word as it is usually understood by protestants it seems the justices of the peace and parish officers in the western coasts of england have a good while followed the trade of exporting hither their supernumerary beggars in order to advance the english protestant interest among us and these they are so kind to send over gratis and duty free i have had the honour more than once to attend large cargoes of them from chester to dublin and i was then so ignorant as to give my opinion that our city should receive them into bridewell and after a months residence having been well whipped twice a day fed with bran and water and put to hard labour they should be returned honestly back with thanks as cheap as they came or if that were not approved of i proposed that whereas one english man is allowed to be of equal intrinsic value with twelve born in ireland we should in justice return them a dozen for one to dispose of as they pleased but to return  as to the native poor of this city there would be little or no damage in confining them to their several parishes for instance a beggar of the parish of st warboroughs191 or any other parish here if he be an object of compassion hath an equal chance to receive his proportion of alms from every charitable hand because the inhabitants one or other walk through every street in town and give their alms without considering the place wherever they think it may be well disposed of and these helps added to what they get in eatables by going from house to house among the gentry and citizens will without being very burthensome be sufficient to keep them alive  it is true the poor of the suburb parishes will not have altogether the same advantage because they are not equally in the road of business and passengers but here it is to be considered that the beggars there have not so good a title to publick charity because most of them are strollers from the country and compose a principal part of that great nuisance which we ought to remove  i should be apt to think that few things can be more irksome to a city minister than a number of beggars which do not belong to his district whom he hath no obligation to take care of who are no part of his flock and who take the bread out of the mouths of those to whom it properly belongs when i mention this abuse to any minister of a cityparish he usually lays the fault upon the beadles who he says are bribed by the foreign beggars and as those beadles often keep alehouses they find their account in such customers this evil might easily be remedied if the parishes would make some small addition to the salaries of a beadle and be more careful in the choice of those officers but i conceive there is one effectual method in the power of every minister to put in practice i mean by making it the interest of all his own original poor to drive out intruders for if the parishbeggars were absolutely forbidden by the minister and churchofficers to suffer strollers to come into the parish upon pain of themselves not being permitted to beg alms at the churchdoors or at the houses and shops of the inhabitants they would prevent interlopers more effectually than twenty beadles  and here i cannot but take notice of the great indiscretion in our cityshopkeepers who suffer their doors to be daily besieged by crowds of beggars as the gates of a lord are by duns to the great disgust and vexation of many customers whom i have frequently observed to go to other shops rather than suffer such a persecution which might easily be avoided if no foreign beggars were allowed to infest them  wherefore i do assert that the shopkeepers who are the greatest complainers of this grievance lamenting that for every customer they are worried by fifty beggars do very well deserve what they suffer when a prentice with a horsewhip is able to lash every beggar from the shop who is not of the parish and does not wear the badge of that parish on his shoulder well fastened and fairly visible and if this practice were universal in every house to all the sturdy vagrants we should in a few weeks clear the town of all mendicants except those who have a proper title to our charity as for the aged and infirm it would be sufficient to give them nothing and then they must starve or follow their brethren  it was the city that first endowed this hospital and those who afterwards contributed as they were such who generally inhabited here so they intended what they gave to be for the use of the citys poor the revenues which have since been raised by parliament are wholly paid by the city without the least charge upon any other part of the kingdom and therefore nothing could more defeat the original design than to misapply those revenues on strolling beggars or bastards from the country which bear no share in the charges we are at  if some of the outparishes be overburthened with poor the reason must be that the greatest part of those poor are strollers from the country who nestle themselves where they can find the cheapest lodgings and from thence infest every part of the town out of which they ought to be whipped as a most insufferable nuisance being nothing else but a profligate clan of thieves drunkards heathens and whoremongers fitter to be rooted out of the face of the earth than suffered to levy a vast annual tax upon the city which shares too deep in the public miseries brought on us by the oppressions we lye under from our neighbours our brethren our countrymen our fellow protestants and fellow subjects  some time ago i was appointed one of a committee to inquire into the state of the workhouse where we found that a charity was bestowed by a great person for a certain time which in its consequences operated very much to the detriment of the house for when the time was elapsed all those who were supported by that charity continued on the same foot with the rest of the foundation and being generally a pack of profligate vagabond wretches from several parts of the kingdom corrupted all the rest so partial or treacherous or interested or ignorant or mistaken are generally all recommenders not only to employments but even to charity itself  i know it is complained that the difficulty of driving foreign beggars out of the city is charged upon the bellowers as they are called who find their accounts best in suffering those vagrants to follow their trade through every part of the town but this abuse might easily be remedied and very much to the advantage of the whole city if better salaries were given to those who execute that office in the several parishes and would make it their interest to clear the town of those caterpillars rather than hazard the loss of an employment that would give them an honest livelyhood but if that would fail yet a general resolution of never giving charity to a street beggar out of his own parish or without a visible badge would infallibly force all vagrants to depart  there is generally a vagabond spirit in beggars which ought to be discouraged and severely punished it is owing to the same causes that drove them into poverty i mean idleness drunkenness and rash marriages without the least prospect of supporting a family by honest endeavours which never came into their thoughts it is observed that hardly one beggar in twenty looks upon himself to be relieved by receiving bread or other food and they have in this town been frequently seen to pour out of their pitcher good broth that hath been given them into the kennel neither do they much regard clothes unless to sell them for their rags are part of their tools with which they work they want only ale brandy and other strong liquors which cannot be had without money and money as they conceive always abounds in the metropolis  i had some other thoughts to offer upon this subject but as i am a desponder in my nature and have tolerably well discovered the disposition of our people who never will move a step towards easing themselves from any one single grievance it will be thought that i have already said too much and to little or no purpose which hath often been the fate or fortune of the writer                                                        j swift    april 22    1737     considerations  about maintaining the poor          note        the text of this short paper is taken from deane swifts edition      which was followed by sir walter scott       t s     considerations about maintaining the poor   we have been amused for at least thirty years past with numberless schemes in writing and discourse both in and out of parliament for maintaining the poor and setting them to work especially in this city most of which were idle indigested or visionary and all of them ineffectual as it has plainly appeared by the consequences many of those projectors were so stupid that they drew a parallel from holland to england to be settled in ireland that is to say from two countries with full freedom and encouragement for trade to a third where all kind of trade is cramped and the most beneficial parts are entirely taken away but the perpetual infelicity of false and foolish reasoning as well as proceeding and acting upon it seems to be fatal to this country  for my own part who have much conversed with those folks who call themselves merchants i do not remember to have met with a more ignorant and wrongthinking race of people in the very first rudiments of trade which however was not so much owing to their want of capacity as to the crazy constitution of this kingdom where pedlars are better qualified to thrive than the wisest merchants i could fill a volume with only setting down a list of the public absurdities by which this kingdom has suffered within the compass of my own memory such as could not be believed of any nation among whom folly was not established as a law i cannot forbear instancing a few of these because it may be of some use to those who shall have it in their power to be more cautious for the future  the first was the building of the barracks whereof i have seen above onehalf and have heard enough of the rest to affirm that the public has been cheated of at least twothirds of the money raised for that use by the plain fraud of the undertakers  another was the management of the money raised for the palatines when instead of employing that great sum in purchasing lands in some remote and cheap part of the kingdom and there planting those people as a colony the whole end was utterly defeated  a third is the insurance office against fire by which several thousand pounds are yearly remitted to england a trifle it seems we can easily spare and will gradually increase until it comes to a good national tax for the societymarks upon our houses under which might properly be written the lord have mercy upon us spread faster and farther than the colony of frogs192 i have for above twenty years past given warning several thousand times to many substantial people and to such who are acquainted with lords and squires and the like great folks to any of whom i have not the honour to be known i mentioned my daily fears lest our watchful friends in england might take this business out of our hands and how easy it would be to prevent that evil by erecting a society of persons who had good estates such for instance as that noble knot of bankers under the style of swift and company but now we are become tributary to england not only for materials to light our own fires but for engines to put them out to which if hearthmoney be added repealed in england as a grievance we have the honour to pay three taxes for fire  a fourth was the knavery of those merchants or linenmanufacturers or both when upon occasion of the plague at marseilles we had a fair opportunity of getting into our hands the whole linentrade of spain but the commodity was so bad and held at so high a rate that almost the whole cargo was returned and the small remainder sold below the prime cost  so many other particulars of the same nature crowd into my thoughts that i am forced to stop and the rather because they are not very proper for my subject to which i shall now return  among all the schemes for maintaining the poor of the city and setting them to work the least weight has been laid upon that single point which is of the greatest importance i mean that of keeping foreign beggars from swarming hither out of every part of the country for until this be brought to pass effectually all our wise reasonings and proceedings upon them will be vain and ridiculous  the prodigious number of beggars throughout this kingdom in proportion to so small a number of people is owing to many reasons to the laziness of the natives the want of work to employ them the enormous rents paid by cottagers for their miserable cabins and potatoeplots their early marriages without the least prospect of establishment the ruin of agriculture whereby such vast numbers are hindered from providing their own bread and have no money to purchase it the mortal damp upon all kinds of trade and many other circumstances too tedious or invidious to mention  and to the same causes we owe the perpetual concourse of foreign beggars to this town the country landlords giving all assistance except money and victuals to drive from their estates those miserable creatures they have undone  it was a general complaint against the poorhouse under its former governors that the number of poor in this city did not lessen by taking three hundred into the house and all of them recommended under the ministers and churchwardens hands of the several parishes and this complaint must still continue although the poorhouse should be enlarged to contain three thousand or even double that number  the revenues of the poorhouse as it is now established amount to about two thousand pounds ayear whereof two hundred allowed for officers and one hundred for repairs the remaining seventeen hundred at four pounds ahead will support four hundred and twentyfive persons this is a favourable allowance considering that i subtract nothing for the diet of those officers and for wear and tear of furniture and if every one of these collegiates should be set to work it is agreed they will not be able to gain by their labour above onefourth part of their maintenance  at the same time the oratorial part of these gentlemen seldom vouchsafe to mention fewer than fifteen hundred or two thousand people to be maintained in this hospital without troubling their heads about the fund         on barbarous denominations  in ireland    sir  i have been lately looking over the advertisements in some of your dublin newspapers which are sent me to the country and was much entertained with a large list of denominations of lands to be sold or let i am confident they must be genuine for it is impossible that either chance or modern invention could sort the alphabet in such a manner as to make those abominable sounds whether first invented to invoke or fright away the devil i must leave among the curious  if i could wonder at anything barbarous ridiculous or absurd among us this should be one of the first i have often lamented that agricola the fatherinlaw of tacitus was not prevailed on by that petty king from ireland who followed his camp to come over and civilize us with a conquest as his countrymen did britain where several roman appellations remain to this day and so would the rest have done if that inundation of angles saxons and other northern people had not changed them so much for the worse although in no comparison with ours in one of the advertisements just mentioned i encountered near a hundred words together which i defy any creature in human shape except an irishman of the savage kind to pronounce neither would i undertake such a task to be owner of the lands unless i had liberty to humanize the syllables twenty miles round the legislature may think what they please and that they are above copying the romans in all their conquests of barbarous nations but i am deceived if anything has more contributed to prevent the irish from being tamed than this encouragement of their language which might be easily abolished and become a dead one in half an age with little expense and less trouble  how is it possible that a gentleman who lives in those parts where the townlands as they call them of his estate produce such odious sounds from the mouth the throat and the nose can be able to repeat the words without dislocating every muscle that is used in speaking and without applying the same tone to all other words in every language he understands as it is plainly to be observed not only in those people of the better sort who live in galway and the western parts but in most counties of ireland  it is true that in the city parts of london the trading people have an affected manner of pronouncing and so in my time had many ladies and coxcombs at court it is likewise true that there is an odd provincial cant in most counties in england sometimes not very pleasing to the ear and the scotch cadence as well as expression are offensive enough but none of these defects derive contempt to the speaker whereas what we call the irish brogue is no sooner discovered than it makes the deliverer in the last degree ridiculous and despised and from such a mouth an englishman expects nothing but bulls blunders and follies neither does it avail whether the censure be reasonable or not since the fact is always so and what is yet worse it is too well known that the bad consequence of this opinion affects those among us who are not the least liable to such reproaches farther than the misfortune of being born in ireland although of english parents and whose education has been chiefly in that kingdom  i have heard many gentlemen among us talk much of the great convenience to those who live in the country that they should speak irish it may possibly be so but i think they should be such who never intend to visit england upon pain of being ridiculous for i do not remember to have heard of any one man that spoke irish who had not the accent upon his tongue easily discernible to any english ear  but i have wandered a little from my subject which was only to propose a wish that these execrable denominations were a little better suited to an english mouth if it were only for the sake of the english lawyers who in trials upon appeals to the house of lords find so much difficulty in repeating the names that if the plaintiff or defendant were by they would never be able to discover which were their own lands but besides this i would desire not only that the appellations of what they call townlands were changed but likewise of larger districts and several towns and some counties and particularly the seats of countrygentlemen leaving an alias to solve all difficulties in point of law but i would by no means trust these alterations to the owners themselves who as they are generally no great clerks so they seem to have no large vocabulary about them nor to be well skilled in prosody the utmost extent of their genius lies in naming their country habitation by a hill a mount a brook a burrow a castle a bawn a ford and the like ingenious conceits yet these are exceeded by others whereof some have contrived anagramatical appellations from half their own and their wives names joined together others only from the lady as for instance a person whose wifes name was elizabeth calls his seat by the name of bessborow there is likewise a famous town where the worst iron in the kingdom is made and it is called swandlingbar the original of which name i shall explain lest the antiquaries of future ages might be at a loss to derive it it was a most witty conceit of four gentlemen who ruined themselves with this iron project sw stands for swift193 and for sanders ling for davling and bar for barry methinks i see the four loggerheads sitting in consult like smectymnuus each gravely contributing a part of his own name to make up one for their place in the ironwork and could wish they had been hanged as well as undone for their wit but i was most pleased with the denomination of a townland which i lately saw in an advertisement of pues paper this is to give notice that the lands of douras alias whigborough c now this zealous proprietor having a mind to record his principles in religion or loyalty to future ages within five miles round him for want of other merit thought fit to make use of this expedient wherein he seems to mistake his account for this distinguishing term whig had a most infamous original denoting a man who favoured the fanatic sect and an enemy to kings and so continued till this idea was a little softened some years after the revolution and during a part of her late majestys reign after which it was in disgrace until the queens death since which time it hath indeed flourished with a witness but how long will it continue so in our variable scene or what kind of mortal it may describe is a question which this courtly landlord is not able to answer and therefore he should have set a date on the title of his borough to let us know what kind of a creature a whig was in that year of our lord i would readily assist nomenclators of this costive imagination and therefore i propose to others of the same size in thinking that when they are at a loss about christening a countryseat instead of straining their invention they would call it boobyborough foolbrook puppyford coxcombhall mountloggerhead duncehill which are innocent appellations proper to express the talents of the owners but i cannot reconcile myself to the prudence of this lord of whigborough because i have not yet heard among the presbyterian squires how much soever their persons and principles are in vogue that any of them have distinguished their country abode by the name of mountregicide covenanthall fanatichill roundheadbawn cantingbrook or montrebel and the like because there may probably come a time when those kind of sounds may not be so grateful to the ears of the kingdom for i do not conceive it would be a mark of discretion upon supposing a gentleman in allusion to his name or the merit of his ancestors to call his house tyburnhall  but the scheme i would propose for changing the denominations of land into legible and audible syllables is by employing some gentlemen in the university who by the knowledge of the latin tongue and their judgment in sounds might imitate the roman way by translating those hideous words into their english meanings and altering the termination where a bare translation will not form a good cadence to the ear or be easily delivered from the mouth and when both those means happen to fail then to name the parcels of land from the nature of the soil or some peculiar circumstance belonging to it as in england farnham oatlands blackheath cornbury ryegate ashburnham barnelms coleorton sandwich and many others  i am likewise apt to quarrel with some titles of lords among us that have a very ungracious sound which are apt to communicate mean ideas to those who have not the honour to be acquainted with their persons or their virtues of whom i have the misfortune to be one but i cannot pardon those gentlemen who have gotten titles since the judicature of the peers among us has been taken away to which they all submitted with a resignation that became good christians as undoubtedly they are however since that time i look upon a graceful harmonious title to be at least forty per cent in the value intrinsic of an irish peerage and since it is as cheap as the worst for any irish law hitherto enacted in england to the contrary i would advise the next set before they pass their patents to call a consultation of scholars and musical gentlemen to adjust this most important and essential circumstance the scotch noblemen though born almost under the north pole have much more tunable appellations except some very few which i suppose were given them by the irish along with their language at the time when that kingdom was conquered and planted from hence and to this day retain the denominations of places and surnames of families as all historians agree194  i should likewise not be sorry if the names of some bishops sees were so much obliged to the alphabet that upon pronouncing them we might contract some veneration for the order and persons of those reverend peers which the gross ideas sometimes joined to their titles are very unjustly apt to diminish     speech delivered by dean swift  to an assembly of merchants met at the guildhall  to draw up a petition to the lord lieutenant  on the lowering of coin  april 24th 1736          note        writing to sheridan under date april 24th 1736 in a letter      written partly by herself and partly by swift mrs whiteway      swifts housekeeper refers to the occasion of this speech in the      following words       the drapier went this day to the tholsel195 as a merchant to      sign a petition to the government against lowering the gold where      we hear he made a long speech for which he will be reckoned a      jacobite god send hanging does not go round scotts edition      vol xviii p 470 1824       the occasion for this agitation against the lowering of the gold      arose thus archbishop boulter had for a long time been much      concerned about the want of small silver in ireland the subject      seemed to weigh on him greatly since he refers to it again and      again in his correspondence with carteret newcastle dorset and      walpole on may 25th 1736 he wrote to walpole to inform him that      the lord lieutenant had taken with him to england an application      from the government for lowering the gold made current here by      proclamation and raising the foreign silver silver being      scarce bankers and tradesmen were accustomed to charge a premium      for the changing of gold as much as sixpence and sevenpence in the      pound sterling being obtained see boulters letters vol ii      p 122 dublin 1770       there was no question about the benefit of boulters scheme in the      minds of the two houses of commons and lords swift however      opposed it vehemently because he thought the advantage to be      obtained by this lowering of the gold would accrue to the      absentees in 1687 james had issued a proclamation by which an      english shilling was made the equivalent of thirteen pence in      ireland and an english guinea to twentyfour shillings primate      boulters object gained by the proclamation of the order on      september 29th 1737 was to reduce the value of the guinea from      twentythree shillings at which it then stood to £1 2s 9d      swift thinks monck mason considered the absentees would benefit      by this from the circumstances of the reserved rents being      expressed in the imaginary coin called a pound but actually paid      in guineas when the value of guineas was lowered it required a      proportionately greater number to make up a specific sum history      of st patricks p 401 note c       swift as he wrote to sheridan battled in vain with the duke and      his clan he thought it just a kind of settlement upon england of      £25000 a year for ever yet some of my friends he goes on to      say differ from me though all agree that the absentees will be      just so much gainers letter of date may 22nd 1737       in a note to boulters letter to the duke of newcastle september      29th 1737 the editor of those letters ambrose phillips remarks      such a spirit of opposition had been raised on this occasion by      dean swift and the bankers that it was thought proper to lodge at      the primates house an extraordinary guard of soldiers this      probably was after the open exchange of words between boulter and      swift the primate had accused swift of inflaming the minds of the      people and hinted broadly that he might incur the displeasure of      the government i inflame them retorted swift had i but lifted      my finger they would have torn you to pieces the day of the      proclaiming of the order for the lowering of the gold was marked by      swift with the display of a black flag from the steeple of st      patricks and the tolling of muffled bells a piece of conduct      which boulter called an insult to the government       it is à propos to record here the revenge swift took on boulter      for the accusation of inflaming the people the incident was put by      him into the following verse         at dublins high feast sat primate and dean        both dressed like divines with hand and face clean        quoth hugh of armagh the mob is grown bold        ay ay quoth the dean the cause is old gold        no no quoth the primate if causes we sift        the mischief arises from witty dean swift        the smart one replies theres no wit in the case        and nothing of that ever troubled your grace        though with your state sieve your own motions you st        a boulter by name is no bolter of wit        its matter of weight and a mere money job        but the lower the coin the higher the mob        go to tell your friend bob and the other great folk        that sinking the coin is a dangerous joke        the irish dear joys have enough common sense        to treat gold reduced like woods copper pence        its pity a prelate should die without law        but if i say the wordtake care of armagh       with the lowering of the gold the primate imported £2000 worth of      copper money for irish consumption swift was most indignant at      this and his protest printed by faulkner brought that publisher      before the council and gave swift a fit of nerves ms letter      march 31st 1737 to lord orrery quoted by craik in swifts      life vol ii p 160 swifts objection against the copper was      due to the fact that it was not minted in ireland i quarrel not      with the coin but with the indignity of its not being coined      here same ms letter       among the pamphlets in the halliday collection in the royal irish      academy dublin is a tract with the following title       reasons why we should not lower the coins now current in this      kingdom  dublin printed and sold by e waters in damestreet       at the end of this tract is printed swifts speech to an assembly      of above one hundred and fifty eminent persons who met at the guild      hall on saturday the 24th april 1736 in order to draw up their      petition and present it to his grace the lord lieutenant against      lowering said coin it is from this tract that the present text      has been taken the editor is obliged to sir henry craiks life of      swift for drawing attention to this hitherto uncollected piece       t s     speech delivered on the lowering of the coin   i beg you will consider and very well weigh in your hearts what i am going to say and what i have often said before there are several bodies of men among whom the power of this kingdom is divided1st the lordlieutenant lords justices and council next to these my lords the bishops there is likewise my lord chancellor and my lords the judges of the landwith other eminent persons in the land who have employments and great salaries annexed to these must be added the commissioners of the revenue with all their under officers and lastly their honours of the army of all degrees  now gentlemen i beg you again to consider that none of these persons above named can ever suffer the loss of one farthing by all the miseries under which the kingdom groans at present for first until the kingdom be entirely ruined the lordlieutenant and lords justices must have their salaries my lords the bishops whose lands are set at a fourth part value will be sure of their rents and their fines my lords the judges and those of other employments in the country must likewise have their salaries the gentlemen of the revenue will pay themselves and as to the officers of the army the consequence of not paying them is obvious enough nay so far will those persons i have already mentioned be from suffering that on the contrary their revenues being no way lessened by the fall of money and the price of all commodities considerably sunk thereby they must be great gainers therefore gentlemen i do entreat you that as long as you live you will look on all persons who are for lowering the gold or any other coin as no friends to this poor kingdom but such who find their private account in what will be detrimental to ireland and as the absentees are in the strongest view our greatest enemies first by consuming above onehalf of the rents of this nation abroad and secondly by turning the weight by their absence so much on the popish side by weakening the protestant interest can there be a greater folly than to pave a bridge of gold at your own expense to support them in their luxury and vanity abroad while hundreds of thousands are starving at home for want of employment     miscellaneous pieces     irish eloquence196   i hope you will come and take a drink of my ale i always brew with my own bear i was

part of my education in your university and the good fortune to be of some service to it while i had a share of credit at court as well as since when i had very little or none i may hope to be excused for laying a case before you and offering my opinion upon it  mr dunkin198 whom you all know sent me some time ago a memorial intended to be laid before you which perhaps he hath already done his request is that you would be pleased to enlarge his annuity at present and that he may have the same right in his turn to the first church preferment vacant in your gift as if he had been made a fellow according to the scheme of his aunts will because the absurdity of the condition in it ought to be imputed to the old womans ignorance although her intention be very manifest and the intention of the testator in all wills is chiefly regarded by the law what i would therefore propose is this that you would increase his pension to one hundred pounds ayear and make him a firm promise of the first church living in your disposal to the value of two hundred pounds ayear or somewhat more this i take to be a reasonable medium between what he hath proposed in his memorial and what you allow him at present  i am almost a perfect stranger to mr dunkin having never seen him above twice and then in mixed company nor should i know his person if i met him in the streets  but i know he is a man of wit and parts which if applied properly to the business of his function instead of poetry wherein it must be owned he sometimes excels might be of great use and service to him  i hope you will please to remember that since your body hath received no inconsiderable benefaction from the aunt it will much increase your reputation rather to err on the generous side toward the nephew  these are my thoughts after frequently reflecting on the case under all its circumstances and so i leave it to your wiser judgments  i am with true respect and esteem reverend and worthy sirs  your most

of mr stannard but it was not delivered to me in as many weeks more because i suppose he was too full of more important business since that time i have been wholly confined by sickness so that i was not able to return you my acknowledgment and it is with much difficulty i do it now my head continuing in great disorder mr faulkner will be the bearer of my letter who sets out this morning for cork  i could have wished as i am a private man that in the instrument of my freedom you had pleased to assign your reasons for making choice of me i know it is a usual compliment to bestow the freedom of the city on an archbishop or lordchancellor and other persons of great titles merely on account of their stations or power but a private man and a perfect stranger without power or grandeur may justly expect to find the motives assigned in the instrument of his freedom on what account he is thus distinguished and yet i cannot discover in the whole parchment scrip any one reason offered next as to the silver box there is not so much as my name upon it nor any one syllable to show it was a present from your city therefore i have by the advice of friends agreeable with my opinion sent back the box and instrument of freedom by mr faulkner to be returned to you leaving to your choice whether to insert the reasons for which you were pleased to give me my freedom or bestow the box upon some more worthy person whom you may have an intention to honour because it will equally fit everybody       i am with true esteem and gratitude                   gentlemen        your most obedient and

and chapter of st patricks cathedral dublin                                                   january 28 1741  whereas my infirmities of age and illhealth have prevented me to preside in the chapters held for the good order and government of my cathedral church of st patrick dublin in person i have by a legal commission made and appointed the very reverend doctor john wynne præcentor of the said cathedral to be subdean in my stead and absence i do hereby ratify and confirm all the powers delegated to the said dr wynne in the said commission  and i do hereby require and request the very reverend subdean not to permit any of the vicarschoral choristers or organists to attend or assist at any public musical performances without my consent or his consent with the consent of the chapter first obtained  and whereas it hath been reported that i gave a licence to certain vicars to assist at a club of fiddlers in fishamble street i do hereby declare that i remember no such licence to have been ever signed or sealed by me and that if ever such pretended licence should be produced i do hereby annul and vacate the said licence intreating my said subdean and chapter to punish such vicars as shall ever appear there as songsters fiddlers pipers trumpeters drummers drummajors or in any sonal quality according to the flagitious aggravations of their respective disobedience rebellion perfidy and ingratitude  i require my said subdean to proceed to the extremity of expulsion if the said vicars should be found ungovernable impenitent or selfsufficient especially taberner phipps and church who as i am informed have in violation of my subdeans and chapters order in december last at the instance of some obscure persons unknown presumed to sing and fiddle at the club above mentioned  my resolution is to preserve the dignity of my station and the honour of my chapter and gentlemen it is incumbent upon you to aid me and to show who and what the dean and chapter of saint patricks are                             signed by me                              jonathan swift                                  dean of st patricks    witnesses present     james king     francis wilson  to the very reverend doctor john wynne subdean of the cathedral church of saint patrick dublin and to the reverend dignitaries and prebendaries of the same     appendix     a letter to the writer of the occasional paper       note        in april 1727 swift paid his last visit to england the visit      paid by him to walpole already referred to resulted in nothing      though it cannot on that account be argued that swifts open      friendship for and even support of pulteney and bolingbroke was      owing to his failure with walpole swift pleaded with walpole for      ireland and ireland only as his letter to peterborough amply      testifies it had nothing to do with the political situation in      england the explanation for this sympathy is most likely found in      sir henry craiks suggestion that swift humoured the pretences of      his friends that they were of the party that maintained the      national virtues resisted corruption and defended liberty against      arbitrary power to pulteney swift always wrote reminding him that      the country looked to him as its saviour and he wrote in a similar      vein to bolingbroke and pope the craftsman had been founded by      pulteney and bolingbroke a curious companionship when one      remembers the past lives of these two men for the express purpose      of bringing low walpoles political power it began by exposing the      tricks of robin and continued to lay bare the cunning and wiles      of the craftsman at the head of the government of the country      both pulteney and bolingbroke wrote regularly and the former      displayed a journalistic power quite extraordinary       the letter which follows was written by swift when in london on the      occasion of his last visit but a note in craiks life of swift      vol ii pp 166167 is very interesting as showing that swift      did certainly give hints for some of the subjects for discussion i      take the liberty to transcribe this note in full sir henry craik      thinks it more than likely that swift may have suggested during      his last visit to london some of the lines on which bolingbroke      and pulteney worked in the note he adds       this finds some confirmation from the following heads of a tract      which i have found in a memorandum in swifts handwriting the      memorandum belongs to mr frederick locker now dead who kindly      permitted me to use his papers the same which came from theophilus      swift into scotts possession but the interest of this memorandum      escaped scotts notice        proposal for virtue       every little fellow who has a vote now corrupted       an arithmetical computation how much spent in election of      commons and pensions and foreign courts how then can our debts be      paid       no fear that gentlemen will not stand and serve without pensions      and that they will let the kingdom be invaded for want of fleets      and armies or bring in pretender etc       how king will ensure his own interest as well as the publick he      is now forced to keep himself bare etc at least late king was       perpetual expedients stopgaps etc at long run must terminate      in something fatal as it does in private estates       there may be probably 10000 landed men in england fit for      parliament this would reduce parliament to consist of real landed      men which is full as necessary for senates as for juries what do      the other 9000 do for want of pensions         in private life virtue may be difficult by passions      infirmities temptations want of pence strong opposition etc      but not in public administration there it makes all things easy       form the scheme suppose a king of england would resolve to give      no pension for party etc and call a parliament perfectly free      as he could       what can a k reasonably ask that a parliament will refuse when      they are resty it is by corrupt ministers who have designs      dangerous to the state and must therefore support themselves by      bribing etc       open fair dealing the best       a contemptuous character of court art how different from true      politics for comparing the talents of two professions that are      very different i cannot but think that in the present sense of      the word politician a common sharper or pickpocket has every      quality that can be required in the other and accordingly i have      personally known more than half a dozen in their hour esteemed      equally to excell in both                                            the present text is based on that given in the eighth volume of the      quarto issue of swifts works published in 1765       t s       a letter to the writer of   the occasional paper200    vide the craftsman 1727    sir  although in one of your papers you declare an intention of turning them during the dead season of the year into accounts of domestic and foreign intelligence yet i think we your correspondents should not understand your meaning so literally as if you intended to reject inserting any other paper which might probably be useful for the public neither indeed am i fully convinced that this new course you resolve to take will render you more secure than your former laudable practice of inserting such speculations as were sent you by several wellwishers to the good of the kingdom however grating such notices might be to some who wanted neither power nor inclination to resent them at your cost for since there is a direct law against spreading false news if you should venture to tell us in one of the craftsmen that the dey of algiers had got the toothache or the king of bantam had taken a purge and the facts should be contradicted in succeeding packets i do not see what plea you could offer to avoid the utmost penalty of the law because you are not supposed to be very gracious among those who are most able to hurt you  besides as i take your intentions to be sincerely meant for the public service so your original method of entertaining and instructing us will be more general and more useful in this season of the year when people are retired to amusements more cool more innocent and much more reasonable than those they have left when their passions are subsided or suspended when they have no occasions of inflaming themselves or each other where they will have opportunities of hearing common sense every day in the week from their tenants or neighbouring farmers and thereby be qualified in hours of rain or leisure to read and consider the advice or information you shall send them  another weighty reason why you should not alter your manner of writing by dwindling to a newsmonger is because there is no suspension of arms agreed on between you and your adversaries who fight with a sort of weapons which have two wonderful qualities that they are never to be worn out and are best wielded by the weakest hands and which the poverty of our language forceth me to call by the trite appellations of scurrility slander and billingsgate i am far from thinking that these gentlemen or rather their employers for the operators themselves are too obscure to be guessed at should be answered after their own way although it were possible to drag them out of their obscurity but i wish you would enquire what real use such a conduct is to the cause they have been so largely paid to defend the author of the three first occasional letters a person altogether unknown hath been thought to glance for what reasons he best knows at some public proceedings as if they were not agreeable to his private opinions in answer to this the pamphleteers retained on the other side are instructed by their superiors to single out an adversary whose abilities they have most reason to apprehend and to load himself his family and friends with all the infamy that a perpetual conversation in bridewell newgate and the stews could furnish them but at the same time so very unluckily that the most distinguishing parts of their characters strike directly in the face of their benefactor whose idea presenting itself along with his guineas perpetually to their imagination occasioned this desperate blunder  but allowing this heap of slander to be truth and applied to the proper person what is to be the consequence are our public debts to be the sooner paid the corruptions that author complains of to be the sooner cured an honourable peace or a glorious war the more likely to ensue trade to flourish the ostend company to be demolished gibraltar and port mahon left entire in our possession the balance of europe to be preserved the malignity of parties to be for ever at an end none but persons of merit virtue genius and learning to be encouraged i ask whether any of these effects will follow upon the publication of this authors libel even supposing he could prove every syllable of it to be true  at the same time i am well assured that the only reason of ascribing those papers to a particular person is built upon the information of a certain pragmatical spy of quality well known to act in that capacity by those into whose company he insinuates himself a sort of persons who although without much love esteem or dread of people in present power yet have too much common prudence to speak their thoughts with freedom before such an intruder who therefore imposes grossly upon his masters if he makes them pay for anything but his own conjectures  it is a grievous mistake in a great minister to neglect or despise much more to irritate men of genius and learning i have heard one of the wisest persons in my time observe that an administration was to be known and judged by the talents of those who appeared their advocates in print this i must never allow to be a general rule yet i cannot but think it prodigiously unfortunate that among the answerers defenders repliers and panegyrists started up in defence of present persons and proceedings there hath not yet arisen one whose labours we can read with patience however we may applaud their loyalty and good will and all this with the advantages of constant ready pay of natural and acquired venom and a grant of the whole fund of slander to range over and riot in as they please201  on the other side a turbulent writer of occasional letters and other vexatious papers in conjunction perhaps with one or two friends as bad as himself is able to disconcert tease and sour us whenever he thinks fit merely by the strength of genius and truth and after so dexterous a manner that when we are vexed to the soul and well know the reasons why we are so we are ashamed to own the first and cannot tell how to express the other in a word it seems to me that all the writers are on one side and all the railers on the other  however i do not pretend to assert that it is impossible for an ill minister to find men of wit who may be drawn by a very valuable consideration to undertake his defence but the misfortune is that the heads of such writers rebel against their hearts their genius forsakes them when they would offer to prostitute it to the service of injustice corruption party rage and false representations of things and persons  and this is the best argument i can offer in defence of great men who have been of late so very unhappy in the choice of their paperchampions although i cannot much commend their good husbandry in those exorbitant payments of twenty and sixty guineas at a time for a scurvy pamphlet since the sort of work they require is what will all come within the talents of any one who hath enjoyed the happiness of a very bad education hath kept the vilest company is endowed with a servile spirit is master of an empty purse and a heart full of malice  but to speak the truth in soberness it should seem a little hard since the old whiggish principle hath been recalled of standing up for the liberty of the press to a degree that no man for several years past durst venture out a thought which did not square to a point with the maxims and practices that then prevailed i say it is a little hard that the vilest mercenaries should be countenanced preferred rewarded for discharging their brutalities against men of honour only upon a bare conjecture  if it should happen that these profligates have attacked an innocent person i ask what satisfaction can their hirers give in return not all the wealth raked together by the most corrupt rapacious ministers in the longest course of unlimited power would be sufficient to atone for the hundredth part of such an injury  in the common way of thinking it is a situation sufficient in all conscience to satisfy a reasonable ambition for a private person to command the forces the laws the revenues of a great kingdom to reward and advance his followers and flatterers as he pleases and to keep his enemies real or imaginary in the dust in such an exaltation why should he be at the trouble to make use of fools to sound his praises because i always thought the lion was hard set when he chose the ass for his trumpeter or knaves to revenge his quarrels at the expense of innocent mens reputations  with all those advantages i cannot see why persons in the height of power should be under the least concern on account of their reputation for which they have no manner of use or to ruin that of others which may perhaps be the only possession their enemies have left them supposing times of corruption which i am very far from doing if a writer displays them in their proper colours does he do anything worse than sending customers to the shop here only at the sign of the brazen head are to be sold places and pensions beware of counterfeits and take care of mistaking the door  for my own part i think it very unnecessary to give the character of a great minister in the fulness of his power because it is a thing that naturally does itself and is obvious to the eyes of all mankind for his personal qualities are all derived into the most minute parts of his administration if this be just prudent regular impartial intent upon the public good prepared for present exigencies and provident of the future such is the director himself in his private capacity if it be rapacious insolent partial palliating long and deep diseases of the public with empirical remedies false disguised impudent malicious revengeful you shall infallibly find the private life of the conductor to answer in every point nay what is more every twinge of the gout or gravel will be felt in their consequences by the community as the thiefcatcher upon viewing a house broke open could immediately distinguish from the manner of the workmanship by what hand it was done  it is hard to form a maxim against which an exception is not ready to start up so in the present case where the minister grows enormously rich the public is proportionably poor as in a private family the steward always thrives the fastest when his lord is running out                                                                              an account of the court and empire of japan202   regoge203 was the thirtyfourth emperor of japan and began his reign in the year 341 of the christian era succeeding to nena204 a princess who governed with great felicity  there had been a revolution in that empire about twentysix years before which made some breaches in the hereditary line and regoge successor to nena although of the royal family was a distant relation there were two violent parties in the empire which began in the time of the revolution above mentioned and at the death of the empress nena were in the highest degree of animosity each charging the other with a design of introducing new gods and changing the civil constitution the names of these two parties were husiges and yortes205 the latter were those whom nena the late empress most favoured towards the end of her reign and by whose advice she governed  the husige faction enraged at their loss of power made private applications to regoge during the life of the empress which prevailed so far that upon her death the new emperor wholly disgraced the yortes and employed only the husiges in all his affairs the japanese author highly blames his imperial majestys proceeding in this affair because it was allowed on all hands that he had then a happy opportunity of reconciling parties for ever by a moderating scheme but he on the contrary began his reign by openly disgracing the principal and most popular yortes some of which had been chiefly instrumental in raising him to the throne by this mistaken step he occasioned a rebellion which although it were soon quelled by some very surprising turns of fortune yet the fear whether real or pretended of new attempts engaged him in such immense charges that instead of clearing any part of that prodigious debt left on his kingdom by the former war which might have been done by any tolerable management in twelve years of the most profound peace he left his empire loaden with a vast addition to the old encumbrance  this prince before he succeeded to the empire of japan was king of tedsu206 a dominion seated on the continent to the west side of japan tedsu was the place of his birth and more beloved by him than his new empire for there he spent some months almost every year and thither was supposed to have conveyed great sums of money saved out of his imperial revenues  there were two maritime towns of great importance bordering upon tedsu207 of these he purchased a litigated title and to support it was forced not only to entrench deeply on his japanese revenues but to engage in alliances very dangerous to the japanese empire208  japan was at that time a limited monarchy which some authors are of opinion was introduced there by a detachment from the numerous army of brennus who ravaged a great part of asia and those of them who fixed in japan left behind them that kind of military institution which the northern people in ensuing ages carried through most parts of europe the generals becoming kings the great officers a senate of nobles with a representative from every centenary of private soldiers and in the assent of the majority in these two bodies confirmed by the general the legislature consisted  i need not farther explain a matter so universally known but return to my subject  the husige faction by a gross piece of negligence in the yortes had so far insinuated themselves and their opinions into the favour of regoge before he came to the empire that this prince firmly believed them to be his only true friends and the others his mortal enemies209 by this opinion he governed all the actions of his reign  the emperor died suddenly in his journey to tedsu where according to his usual custom he was going to pass the summer  this prince during his whole reign continued an absolute stranger to the language the manners the laws and the religion of japan and passing his whole time among old mistresses or a few privadoes left the whole management of the empire in the hands of a minister upon the condition of being made easy in his personal revenues and the management of parties in the senate his last minister210 who governed in the most arbitrary manner for several years he was thought to hate more than he did any other person in japan except his only son the heir to the empire the dislike he bore to the former was because the minister under pretence that he could not govern the senate without disposing of employments among them would not suffer his master to oblige one single person but disposed of all to his own relations and dependants but as to that continued and virulent hatred he bore to the prince his son from the beginning of his reign to his death the historian hath not accounted for it further than by various conjectures which do not deserve to be related  the minister above mentioned was of a family not contemptible had been early a senator and from his youth a mortal enemy to the yortes he had been formerly disgraced in the senate for some frauds in the management of a public trust211 he was perfectly skilled by long practice in the senatorial forms and dexterous in the purchasing of votes from those who could find their accounts better in complying with his measures than they could probably lose by any tax that might be charged on the kingdom he seemed to fail in point of policy by not concealing his gettings never scrupling openly to lay out vast sums of money in paintings buildings and purchasing estates when it was known that upon his first coming into business upon the death of the empress nena his fortune was but inconsiderable he had the most boldness and the least magnanimity that ever any mortal was endowed with by enriching his relations friends and dependants in a most exorbitant manner he was weak enough to imagine that he had provided a support against an evil day he had the best among all false appearances of courage which was a most unlimited assurance whereby he would swagger the boldest men into a dread of his power but had not the smallest portion of magnanimity growing jealous and disgracing every man who was known to bear the least civility to those he disliked he had some small smattering in books but no manner of politeness nor in his whole life was ever known to advance any one person upon the score of wit learning or abilities for business the whole system of his ministry was corruption and he never gave bribe or pension without frankly telling the receivers what he expected from them and threatening them to put an end to his bounty if they failed to comply in every circumstance  a few months before the emperors death there was a design concerted between some eminent persons of both parties whom the desperate state of the empire had united to accuse the minister at the first meeting of a new chosen senate which was then to assemble according to the laws of that empire and it was believed that the vast expense he must be at in choosing an assembly proper for his purpose added to the low state of the treasury the increasing number of pensioners the great discontent of the people and the personal hatred of the emperor would if well laid open in the senate be of weight enough to sink the minister when it should appear to his very pensioners and creatures that he could not supply them much longer  while this scheme was in agitation an account came of the emperors death and the prince his son212 with universal joy mounted the throne of japan  the new emperor had always lived a private life during the reign of his father who in his annual absence never trusted him more than once with the reins of government which he held so evenly that he became too popular to be confided in any more he was thought not unfavourable to the yortes at least not altogether to approve the virulence wherewith his father proceeded against them and therefore immediately upon his succession the principal persons of that denomination came in several bodies to kiss the hem of his garment whom he received with great courtesy and some of them with particular marks of distinction  the prince during the reign of his father having not been trusted with any public charge employed his leisure in learning the language the religion the customs and disposition of the japanese wherein he received great information among others from nomptoc213 master of his finances and president of the senate who secretly hated lelopaw the minister and likewise from ramneh214 a most eminent senator who despairing to do any good with the father had with great industry skill and decency used his endeavour to instil good principles into the young prince  upon the news of the former emperors death a grand council was summoned of course where little passed besides directing the ceremony of proclaiming the successor but in some days after the new emperor having consulted with those persons in whom he could chiefly confide and maturely considered in his own mind the present state of his affairs as well as the disposition of his people convoked another assembly of his council wherein after some time spent in general business suitable to the present emergency he directed lelopaw to give him in as short terms as he conveniently could an account of the nations debts of his management in the senate and his negotiations with foreign courts which that minister having delivered according to his usual manner with much assurance and little satisfaction the emperor desired to be fully satisfied in the following particulars  whether the vast expense of choosing such members into the senate as would be content to do the public business were absolutely necessary  whether those members thus chosen in would cross and impede the necessary course of affairs unless they were supplied with great sums of money and continued pensions  whether the same corruption and perverseness were to be expected from the nobles  whether the empire of japan were in so low a condition that the imperial envoys at foreign courts must be forced to purchase alliances or prevent a war by immense bribes given to the ministers of all the neighbouring princes  why the debts of the empire were so prodigiously advanced in a peace of twelve years at home and abroad  whether the yortes were universally enemies to the religion and laws of the empire and to the imperial family now reigning  whether those persons whose revenues consist in lands do not give surer pledges of fidelity to the public and are more interested in the welfare of the empire than others whose fortunes consist only in money  and because lelopaw for several years past had engrossed the whole administration the emperor signified that from him alone he expected an answer  this minister who had sagacity enough to cultivate an interest in the young princes family during the late emperors life received early intelligence from one of his emissaries of what was intended at the council and had sufficient time to frame as plausible an answer as his cause and conduct would allow however having desired a few minutes to put his thoughts in order he delivered them in the following manner                                        sir  upon this short unexpected warning to answer your imperial majestys queries i should be wholly at a loss in your majestys august presence and that of this most noble assembly if i were armed with a weaker defence than my own loyalty and integrity and the prosperous success of my endeavours  it is well known that the death of the empress nena happened in a most miraculous juncture and that if she had lived two months longer your illustrious family would have been deprived of your right and we should have seen an usurper upon your throne who would have wholly changed the constitution of this empire both civil and sacred and although that empress died in a most opportune season yet the peaceable entrance of your majestys father was effected by a continual series of miracles the truth of this appears by that unnatural rebellion which the yortes raised without the least provocation in the first year of the late emperors reign which may be sufficient to convince your majesty that every soul of that denomination was is and will be for ever a favourer of the pretender a mortal enemy to your illustrious family and an introducer of new gods into the empire upon this foundation was built the whole conduct of our affairs and since a great majority of the kingdom was at that time reckoned to favour the yortes faction who in the regular course of elections must certainly be chosen members of the senate then to be convoked it was necessary by the force of money to influence elections in such a manner that your majestys father might have a sufficient number to weigh down the scale on his side and thereby carry on those measures which could only secure him and his family in the possession of the empire to support this original plan i came into the service but the members of the senate knowing themselves every day more necessary upon the choosing of a new senate i found the charges to increase and that after they were chosen they insisted upon an increase of their pensions because they well knew that the work could not be carried on without them and i was more general in my donatives because i thought it was more for the honour of the crown that every vote should pass without a division and that when a debate was proposed it should immediately be quashed by putting the question  sir the date of the present senate is expired and your imperial majesty is now to convoke a new one which i confess will be somewhat more expensive than the last because the yortes from your favourable reception have begun to reassume a spirit whereof the country had some intelligence and we know the majority of the people without proper management would be still in that fatal interest however i dare undertake with the charge only of four hundred thousand sprangs215 to return as great a majority of senators of the true stamp as your majesty can desire as to the sums of money paid in foreign courts i hope in some years to ease the nation of them when we and our neighbours come to a good understanding however i will be bold to say they are cheaper than a war where your majesty is to be a principal  the pensions indeed to senators and other persons must needs increase from the restiveness of some and scrupulous nature of others and the new members who are unpractised must have better encouragement however i dare undertake to bring the eventual charge within eight hundred thousand sprangs but to make this easy there shall be new funds raised of which i have several schemes ready without taxing bread or flesh which shall be referred to more pressing occasions  your majesty knows it is the laudable custom of all eastern princes to leave the whole management of affairs both civil and military to their viziers the appointments for your family and private purse shall exceed those of your predecessors you shall be at no trouble further than to appear sometimes in council and leave the rest to me you shall hear no clamour or complaints your senate shall upon occasions declare you the best of princes the father of your country the arbiter of asia the defender of the oppressed and the delight of mankind  sir hear not those who would most falsely impiously and maliciously insinuate that your government can be carried on without that wholesome necessary expedient of sharing the public revenue with your faithful deserving senators this i know my enemies are pleased to call bribery and corruption be it so but i insist that without this bribery and corruption the wheels of government will not turn or at least will be apt to take fire like other wheels unless they be greased at proper times if an angel from heaven should descend to govern this empire upon any other scheme than what our enemies call corruption he must return from whence he came and leave the work undone  sir it is well known we are a trading nation and consequently cannot thrive in a bargain where nothing is to be gained the poor electors who run from their shops or the plough for the service of their country are they not to be considered for their labour and their loyalty the candidates who with the hazard of their persons the loss of their characters and the ruin of their fortunes are preferred to the senate in a country where they are strangers before the very lords of the soil are they not to be rewarded for their zeal to your majestys service and qualified to live in your metropolis as becomes the lustre of their stations  sir if i have given great numbers of the most profitable employments among my own relations and nearest allies it was not out of any partiality but because i know them best and can best depend upon them i have been at the pains to mould and cultivate their opinions abler heads might probably have been found but they would not be equally under my direction a huntsman who hath the absolute command of his dogs will hunt more effectually than with a better pack to whose manner and cry he is a stranger  sir upon the whole i will appeal to all those who best knew your royal father whether that blessed monarch had ever one anxious thought for the public or disappointment or uneasiness or want of money for all his occasions during the time of my administration and how happy the people confessed themselves to be under such a king i leave to their own numerous addresses which all politicians will allow to be the most infallible proof how any nation stands affected to their sovereign                                       lelopaw having ended his speech and struck his forehead thrice against the table as the custom is in japan sat down with great complacency of mind and much applause of his adherents as might be observed by their countenances and their whispers but the emperors behaviour was remarkable for during the whole harangue he appeared equally attentive and uneasy after a short pause his majesty commanded that some other counsellor should deliver his thoughts either to confirm or object against what had been spoken by lelopaw     the answer of the right hon william pulteney esq to the right hon sir robert walpole216                                                          oct 15 1730  sir  a pamphlet was lately sent me entitled a letter from the right honourable sir r w to the right honourable w p esq occasioned by the late invectives on the king her majesty and all the royal family by these initial letters of our names the world is to understand that you and i must be meant although the letter seems to require an answer yet because it appears to be written rather in the style and manner used by some of your pensioners than your own i shall allow you the liberty to think the same of this answer and leave the public to determine which of the two actors can better personate their principals that frigid and fustian way of haranguing wherewith your representer begins continues and ends his declamation i shall leave to the critics in eloquence and propriety to descant on because it adds nothing to the weight of your accusations nor will my defence be one grain the better by exposing its puerilities  i shall therefore only remark upon this particular that the frauds and corruptions in most other arts and sciences as law physic i shall proceed no further are usually much more plausibly defended than in that of politics whether it be that by a kind of fatality the vindication of a corrupt minister is always left to the management of the meanest and most prostitute writers or whether it be that the effects of a wicked or unskilful administration are more public visible pernicious and universal whereas the mistakes in other sciences are often matters that affect only speculation or at worst the bad consequences fall upon few and private persons a nation is quickly sensible of the miseries it feels and little comforted by knowing what account it turns to by the wealth the power the honours conferred on those who sit at the helm or the salaries paid to their penmen while the body of the people is sunk into poverty and despair a frenchman in his wooden shoes may from the vanity of his nation and the constitution of that government conceive some imaginary pleasure in boasting the grandeur of his monarch in the midst of his own slavery but a freeborn englishman with all his loyalty can find little satisfaction at a minister overgrown in wealth and power from the lowest degree of want and contempt when that power or wealth are drawn from the bowels and blood of the nation for which every fellowsubject is a sufferer except the great man himself his family and his pensioners i mean such a minister if there hath ever been such a one whose whole management hath been a continued link of ignorance blunders and mistakes in every article besides that of enriching and aggrandizing himself  for these reasons the faults of men who are most trusted in public business are of all others the most difficult to be defended a man may be persuaded into a wrong opinion wherein he hath small concern but no oratory can have the power over a sober man against the conviction of his own senses and therefore as i take it the money thrown away on such advocates might be more prudently spared and kept in such a ministers own pocket than lavished in hiring a corporation of pamphleteers to defend his conduct and prove a kingdom to be flourishing in trade and wealth which every particular subject except those few already excepted can lawfully swear and by dear experience knows to be a falsehood  give me leave noble sir in the way of argument to suppose this to be your case could you in good conscience or moral justice chide your paperadvocates for their ill success in persuading the world against manifest demonstration their miscarriage is owing alas to want of matter should we allow them to be masters of wit raillery or learning yet the subject would not admit them to exercise their talents and consequently they can have no recourse but to impudence lying and scurrility  i must confess that the author of your letter to me hath carried this last qualification to a greater height than any of his fellows but he hath in my opinion failed a little in point of politeness from the original which he affects to imitate if i should say to a prime minister sir you have sufficiently provided that dunkirk should be absolutely demolished and never repaired you took the best advantages of a long and general peace to discharge the immense debts of the nation you did wonders with the fleet you made the spaniards submit to our quiet possession of gibraltar and portmahon you never enriched yourself and family at the expense of the publicsuch is the style of your supposed letter which however if i am well informed by no means comes up to the refinements of a fishwife in billingsgate you never had a bastard by tom the waterman you never stole a silver tankard you were never whipped at the carts tail  in the title of your letter it is said to be occasioned by the late invectives on the king her majesty and all the royal family and the whole contents of the paper stripped from your eloquence goes on upon a supposition affectedly serious that their majesties and the whole royal family have been lately bitterly and publicly inveighed against in the most enormous and treasonable manner now being a man as you well know altogether out of business i do sometimes lose an hour in reading a few of those controversial papers upon politics which have succeeded for some years past to the polemical tracts between whig and tory and in this kind of reading if it may deserve to be so called although i have been often but little edified or entertained yet hath it given me occasion to make some observations first i have observed that however men may sincerely agree in all the branches of the low church principle in a tenderness for dissenters of every kind in a perfect abhorrence of popery and the pretender and in the most firm adherence to the protestant succession in the royal house of hanover yet plenty of matter may arise to kindle their animosities against each other from the various infirmities follies and vices inherent in mankind  secondly i observed that although the vulgar reproach which charges the quarrels between ministers and their opposers to be only a contention for power between those who are in and those who would be in if they could yet as long as this proceeds no further than a scuffle of ambition among a few persons it is only a matter of course whereby the public is little affected but when corruptions are plain open and undisguised both in their causes and effects to the hazard of a nations ruin and so declared by all the principal persons and the bulk of the people those only excepted who are gainers by those corruptions and when such ministers are forced to fly for shelter to the throne with a complaint of disaffection to majesty against all who durst dislike their administration such a general disposition in the minds of men cannot i think by any rules of reason be called the clamour of a few disaffected incendiaries gasping217 after power it is the true voice of the people which must and will at last be heard or produce consequences that i dare not mention  i have observed thirdly that among all the offensive printed papers which have come to my hand whether good or bad the writers have taken particular pains to celebrate the virtues of our excellent king and queen even where these were strictly speaking no part of the subject nor can it be properly objected that such a proceeding was only a blind to cover their malice towards you and your assistants because to affront the king queen or the royal family as it would be directly opposite to the principles that those kind of writers have always professed so it would destroy the very end they have in pursuit and it is somewhat remarkable that those very writers against you and the regiment you command are such as most distinguish themselves upon all or upon no occasions by their panegyrics on their prince and as all of them do this without favour or hire so some of them continue the same practice under the severest prosecution by you and your janizaries  you seem to know or at least very strongly to conjecture who those persons are that give you so much weekly disquiet will you dare to assert that any of these are jacobites endeavour to alienate the hearts of the people to defame the prince and then dethrone him for these are your expressions and that i am their patron their bulwark their hope and their refuge can you think i will descend to vindicate myself against an aspersion so absurd god be thanked we have had many a change of ministry without changing our prince for if it had been otherwise perhaps revolutions might have been more frequent heaven forbid that the welfare of a great kingdom and of a brave people should be trusted with the thread of a single subjects life for i suppose it is not yet in your view to entail the ministryship in your family thus i hope we may live to see different ministers and different measures without any danger to the succession in the royal protestant line of hanover  you are pleased to advance a topic which i could never heartily approve of in any party although they have each in their turn advanced it while they had the superiority you tell us it is hard that while every private man shall have the liberty to choose what servants he pleaseth the same privilege should be refused to a king this assertion crudely understood can hardly be supported if by servants be only meant those who are purely menial who provide for their masters food and clothing or for the convenience and splendour of his family the point is not worth debating but the bad or good choice of a chancellor a secretary an ambassador a treasurer and many other officers is of very high consequence to the whole kingdom so is likewise that amphibious race of courtiers between servants and ministers such as the steward chamberlain treasurer of the household and the like being all of the privy council and some of the cabinet who according to their talents their principles and their degree of favour may be great instruments of good or evil both to the subject and the prince so that the parallel is by no means adequate between a princes court and a private family and yet if an insolent footman be troublesome in the neighbourhood if he breaks the peoples windows insults their servants breaks into other folks houses to pilfer what he can find although he belong to a duke and be a favourite in his station yet those who are injured may without just offence complain to his lord and for want of redress get a warrant to send him to the stocks to bridewell or to newgate according to the nature and degree of his delinquencies thus the servants of the prince whether menial or otherwise if they be of his council are subject to the enquiries and prosecutions of the great council of the nation even as far as to capital punishment and so must ever be in our constitution till a minister can procure a majority even of that council to shelter him which i am sure you will allow to be a desperate crisis under any party of the most plausible denomination  the only instance you produce or rather insinuate to prove the late invectives against the king queen and royal family is drawn from that deduction of the english history published in several papers by the craftsman wherein are shewn the bad consequences to the public as well as to the prince from the practices of evil ministers in most reigns and at several periods when the throne was filled by wise monarchs as well as by weak this deduction therefore cannot reasonably give the least offence to a british king when he shall observe that the greatest and ablest of his predecessors by their own candour by a particular juncture of affairs or by the general infirmity of human nature have sometimes put too much trust in confident insinuating and avaricious ministers  wisdom attended by virtue and a generous nature is not unapt to be imposed on thus milton describes uriel the sharpestsighted spirit in heaven and regent of the sun deceived by the dissimulation and flattery of the devil for which the poet gives a philosophical reason but needless here to quote218 is anything more common or more useful than to caution wise men in high stations against putting too much trust in undertaking servants cringing flatterers or designing friends since the asiatic custom of governing by prime ministers hath prevailed in so many courts of europe how careful should every prince be in the choice of the person on whom so great a trust is devolved whereon depend the safety and welfare of himself and all his subjects queen elizabeth whose administration is frequently quoted as the best pattern for english princes to follow could not resist the artifices of the earl of leicester who although universally allowed to be the most ambitious insolent and corrupt person of his age was yet her greatest and almost her only favourite his religion indeed being partly puritan and partly infidel might have better tallied with present times yet this wise queen would never suffer the openest enemies of that overgrown lord to be sacrificed to his vengeance nor durst he charge them with a design of introducing popery or the spanish pretender  how many great families do we all know whose masters have passed for persons of good abilities during the whole course of their lives and yet the greatest part of whose estates have sunk in the hands of their stewards and receivers their revenues paid them in scanty portions at large discount and treble interest though they did not know it while the tenants were daily racked and at the same time accused to their landlords of insolvency of this species are such managers who like honest peter waters pretend to clear an estate keep the owner penniless and after seven years leave him five times more in debt while they sink half a plum into their own pockets  those who think themselves concerned may give you thanks for that gracious liberty you are pleased to allow them of taking vengeance on the ministers and there shooting their envenomed arrows as to myself i neither owe you vengeance nor make use of such weapons but it is your weakness or ill fortune or perhaps the fault of your constitution to convert wholesome remedies into poison for you have received better and more frequent instructions than any minister of your age and country if god had given you the grace to apply them  i dare promise you the thanks of half the kingdom if you will please to perform the promise you have made of suffering the craftsman and company or whatever other infamous wretches and execrable villains you mean to take their vengeance only on your own sacred ministerial person without bringing any of your brethren much less the most remote branch of the royal family into the debate this generous offer i suspected from the first because there were never heard of so many so unnecessary and so severe prosecutions as you have promoted during your ministry in a kingdom where the liberty of the press is so much pretended to be allowed but in reading a page or two i found you thought it proper to explain away your grant for there you tell us that these miscreants meaning the writers against you are to remember that the laws have abundantly less generous less mild and merciful sentiments than yourself and into their secular hands the poor authors must be delivered to fines prisons pillories whippings and the gallows thus your promise of impunity which began somewhat jesuitically concludes with the mercy of a spanish inquisitor  if it should so happen that i am neither abettor patron protector nor supporter of these imaginary invectives against the king her majesty or any of the royal family i desire to know what satisfaction i am to get from you or the creature you employed in writing the libel which i am now answering it will be no excuse to say that i differ from you in every particular of your political reason and practise because that will be to load the best the soundest and most numerous part of the kingdom with the denominations you are pleased to bestow upon me that they are jacobites wicked miscreants infamous wretches execrable villains and defamers of the king queen and all the royal family and guilty of high treason you cannot know my style but i can easily know your works which are performed in the sight of the sun your good inclinations are visible but i begin to doubt the strength of your credit even at court that you have not power to make his majesty believe me the person which you represent in your libel as most infallibly you have often attempted and in vain because i must otherwise have found it by the marks of his royal displeasure however to be angry with you to whom i am indebted for the greatest obligation i could possibly receive would be the highest ingratitude it is to you i owe that reputation i have acquired for some years past of being a lover of my country and its constitution to you i owe the libels and scurrilities conferred upon me by the worst of men and consequently some degree of esteem and friendship from the best from you i learned the skill of distinguishing between a patriot and a plunderer of his country and from you i hope in time to acquire the knowledge of being a loyal faithful and useful servant to the best of princes king george the second and therefore i can conclude by your example but with greater truth that i am not only with humble submission and respect but with infinite gratitude sir your most obedient and most obliged servant

 1 unpublished letters of swift edited by dr birkbeck hill 1899  2 mr murrays mss quoted by craik  3 it appeared almost impossible for swift to see the injustice of this test clause in reality it had been the outcome of the legislation against the irish roman catholics in 1703 the irish parliament had passed a bill by which it was enacted that all estates should be equally divided among the children of roman catholics notwithstanding any settlements to the contrary unless the persons to whom they were to descend would qualify by taking the oaths prescribed by government and conform to the established church crawfords history of ireland 1783 vol ii p 256 the bill was transmitted to england for approval there at a time when anne was asking the emperor for his indulgence towards the protestants of his realms this placed the queen in an awkward position since she could hardly expect indulgence from a roman catholic monarch towards protestants when she a protestant monarch was persecuting roman catholics to obviate this dilemma the queens ministers added a clause to the bill by which all persons in ireland were rendered incapable of any employment under the crown or of being magistrates in any city who agreeably to the english test act did not receive the sacrament as prescribed by the church of england ibid under this clause of course came all the protestant dissenters including the presbyterians from the north the bill so amended passed into law but its iniquitous influence was a disgrace to the legislators of the day and his advocacy of it however much he was convinced of its expediency proves swift a shortsighted statesman wherever the enemies of the church of england were concerned t s  4 colonel john birch 16161691 was of lancashire swift calls him of herefordshire because he had been appointed governor of the city of hereford after he had captured it by a stratagem in 1654 devotedly attached to presbyterian principles birch was a man of shrewd business abilities and remarkable oratorical gifts on the restoration of charles ii in which he took a prominent part on account of charless championship of presbyterianism birch held important business posts he sat in parliament for leominster and penrhyn and his plans for the rebuilding of london after the great fire though they were not adopted were yet such as would have been extremely salutary had they been accepted of his eloquence burnet says he was the roughest and boldest speaker in the house and talked in the language and phrases of a carrier but with a beauty and eloquence that was always acceptable the reference to the carrier is purposely made since birch did not hide the fact that he had once pursued that occupation swift was twentyfour years of age when birch died so that he must have been a very young man when he heard birch make the remark he quotes t s  5 sir thomas littleton 16471710 was chosen speaker of the english house of commons by the junto in 1698 onslow in a note to burnets history speaks of the good work he did as treasurer of the navy macky describes him as a sternlooked man with a brown complexion well shaped see characters at the time of swifts writing the above letter littleton was member for portsmouth t s  6 viscount molesworth in his considerations for promoting the agriculture of ireland 1723 pointed out that even with the added expense of freight it was cheaper to import corn from england than to grow it in ireland itself t s  7 mr lecky points out that in england after the revolution the councils were directed by commercial influence at that time there was an important woollen industry in england which it was feared the growing irish woollen manufactures would injure the english manufacturers petitioned for their total destruction and the house of lords in response to the petition represented to the king that the growing manufacture of cloth in ireland both by the cheapness of all sorts of necessaries of life and goodness of materials for making all manner of cloth doth invite your subjects of england with their families and servants to leave their habitations to settle there to the increase of the woollen manufacture in ireland which makes your loyal subjects in this kingdom very apprehensive that the further growth of it may greatly prejudice the said manufacture here the commons went further and suggested the advisability of discouraging the industry by hindering the exportation of wool from ireland to other countries and limiting it to england alone the act of 10 and 11 will iii c 10 made the suggestion law and even prohibited entirely the exportation of irish wool anywhere thus as swift puts it the politic gentlemen of ireland have depopulated vast tracts of the best land for the feeding of sheep see notes to later tracts in this volume on observations on the woollen manufactures and letter on the weavers t s  8 that swift did not exaggerate may be gathered from the statute books and more immediately from hely hutchinsons commercial restraints of ireland 1779 arthur dobbss trade and improvement of ireland leckys history of ireland vols i and ii and monck masons notes in his history of st patricks cathedral p 320 et seq t s  9 barnstaple was at that time the chief market in england for irish wool t s  10 in 1726 swift presented some pieces of irish manufactured silk to the princess of wales and to mrs howard in sending the silk to mrs howard he wrote also a letter in which he remarked i beg you will not tell any parliament man from whence you had that plaid otherwise out of malice they will make a law to cut off all our weavers fingers t s  11 this last sentence is as the original edition has it in faulkners first collected edition and in the fifth volume of the miscellanies london 1735 the following occurs in its place i must confess that as to the former i should not be sorry if they would stay at home and for the latter i hope in a little time we shall have no occasion for them  swift knew what he was advising when he suggested that the people of ireland should not import their goods from england he was well aware that english manufactures were not really necessary sir william petty had a half century before pointed out that a third of the manufactures then imported into ireland could be produced by its own factories another third could as easily and as cheaply be obtained from countries other than england and consequently that it was scarce necessary at all for ireland to receive any goods of england and not convenient to receive above onefourth part from thence of the whole which it needeth to import polit anatomy of ireland 1672 t s  12 faulkner and the miscellanies london 1735 print instead of as any prelate in christendom the words as if he had not been born among us the archbishop was dr william king with whom swift had had much correspondence see letters in scotts edition 1824  dr william king who succeeded narcissus marsh as archbishop of dublin in march 17023 swift had not always been on friendly terms with king but at this time they were in sympathy as to the wrongs and grievances of ireland king strongly supported the agitation against woods halfpence but later when he attempted to interfere with the affairs of the deanery of st patricks swift and he came to an open rupture see also volume on the drapiers letters in this edition t s  13 faulkner and the miscellanies of 1735 print this amount as three thousand six hundred this was the sum paid by the lordlieutenant to the lordsjustices who represented him in the government of ireland the lordlieutenant himself did not then as the viceroy of ireland does now take up his residence in the country although in receipt of a large salary he only came to dublin to deliver the speeches at the openings of parliament or on some other special occasion t s  14 the dublin edition of this pamphlet has a note stating that cotter was a gentleman of cork who was executed for committing a rape on a quaker t s  15 said to be colonel bladon 16801746 who translated the commentaries of cæsar he was a dependant of the duke of marlborough to whom he dedicated this translation t s  16 lord grimston william luckyn first viscount grimston 16831756 was created an irish peer with the title baron dunboyne in 1719 the full title of the play to which swift refers is the lawyers fortune or love in a hollow tree it was published in 1705 swift refers to grimston in his verses on poetry a rhapsody pope in one of his satires calls him booby lord grimston withdrew his play from circulation after the second edition but it was reprinted in rotterdam in 1728 and in london in 1736 dr johnson told chesterfield a story which made the duchess of marlborough responsible for this london reprint which had for frontispiece the picture of an ass wearing a coronet t s  17 the original edition prints ministers instead of chief governors t s  18 in 1720 bishop nicholson of derry writing to the archbishop of canterbury describes the wretched condition of the towns and the country districts and the misery of their population  our trade of all kind is at a stand insomuch as that our most eminent merchants who used to pay bills of 1000l at sight are hardly able to raise 100l in so many days spindles of yarn our daily bread are fallen from 2s 6d to 15d and everything also in proportion our best beef as good as i ever ate in england is sold under 34d a pound and all this not from any extraordinary plenty of commodities but from a perfect dearth of money never did i behold even in picardy westphalia or scotland such dismal marks of hunger and want as appeared in the countenances of most of the poor creatures i met with on the road brit mus add mss 6116 quoted by lecky t s  19 the absentee landlord was an evil to ireland on which much has been written it was difficult to keep the country in order when the landed proprietors took so little interest in their possessions as to do nothing but exact rents from their tenants and spend the money so obtained in england two and even three hundred years before swifts day absenteeism had been the cause of much of the rebellion in ireland which harassed the english monarchs who endeavoured to put a stop to the evil by confiscating the estates of such landlords acts were passed by richard ii and henry viii to this effect but in later times the statutes were ignored and not enforced and the irish landlord in endeavours to obtain for himself social recognition and standing in england which because of his irish origin were denied him remained in england indulging himself in lavish expenditure and display the consequences of this were the impoverishment of his estates and their eventual management by rackrenters these rackrenters whose only interest lay in squeezing money out of the impoverished tenants became the bane of the agricultural holder  unfortunately the spirit of absenteeism extended itself to the holders of offices in ireland and even the lordlieutenant rarely took up his residence in dublin for any time longer than necessitated by the immediate demands of his installation and speechmaking although he drew his emoluments from the irish revenues in the list of absentees instances are given where men appointed to irish offices would land on saturday night receive the sacrament on sunday take the oath in court on monday morning and be on their way back to england by monday afternoon  it has been calculated that out of a total rental of £1800000 as much as 3313 per cent was sent out of the country t s  20 sheridan in the sixth number of the intelligencer contributes an account of the state of ireland written to the text o patria o divûm domus  when i travel through any part of this unhappy kingdom and i have now by several excursions made from dublin gone through most counties of it it raises two passions in my breast of a different kind an indignation against those vile betrayers and insulters of it who insinuate themselves into favour by saying it is a rich nation and a sincere passion for the natives who are sunk to the lowest degree of misery and poverty whose houses are dunghills whose victuals are the blood of their cattle or the herbs in the field and whose clothing to the dishonour of god and man is nakedness yet notwithstanding all the dismal appearances it is the common phrase of our upstart race of people who have suddenly sprang up like the dragons teeth among us that ireland was never known to be so rich as it is now by which as i apprehend they can only mean themselves for they have skipped over the channel from the vantage ground of a dunghill upon no other merit either visible or divineable than that of not having been born among us  this is the modern way of planting colonieset ubi solitudinem faciunt id imperium vocant when those who are so unfortunate to be born here are excluded from the meanest preferments and deemed incapable of being entertained even as common soldiers whose poor stipend is but four pence a day no trade no emoluments no encouragement for learning among the natives who yet by a perverse consequence are divided into factions with as much violence and rancour as if they had the wealth of the indies to contend for it puts me in mind of a fable which i read in a monkish author he quotes for it one of the greek mythologists that once upon a time a colony of large dogs called the molossi transplanted themselves from epirus to Ætolia where they seized those parts of the countries most fertile in flesh of all kinds obliging the native dogs to retire from their best kennels to live under ditches and bushes but to preserve good neighbourhood and peace and finding likewise that the Ætolian dogs might be of some use in the low offices of life they passed a decree that the natives should be entitled to the short ribs tops of back knucklebones and guts of all the game which they were obliged by their masters to run down this condition was accepted and what was a little singular while the molossian dogs kept a good understanding among themselves living in peace and luxury these Ætolian curs were perpetually snarling growling barking and tearing at each others throats nay sometimes those of the best quality among them were seen to quarrel with as much rancour for a rotten gut as if it had been a fat haunch of venison but what need we wonder at this in dogs when the same is every day practised among men  last year i travelled from dublin to dundalk through a country esteemed the most fruitful part of the kingdom and so nature intended it but no ornaments or improvements of such a scene were visible no habitation fit for gentlemen no farmers houses few fields of corn and almost a bare face of nature without new plantations of any kind only a few miserable cottages at three or four miles distance and one church in the centre between this city and drogheda when i arrived at this last town the first mortifying sight was the ruins of several churches battered down by that usurper cromwell whose fanatic zeal made more desolation in a few days than the piety of succeeding prelates or the wealth of the town have in more than sixty years attempted to repair  perhaps the inhabitants through a high strain of virtue have in imitation of the athenians made a solemn resolution never to rebuild those sacred edifices but rather leave them in ruins as monuments to perpetuate the detestable memory of that hellish instrument of rebellion desolation and murder for the athenians when mardonius had ravaged a great part of greece took a formal oath at the isthmus to lose their lives rather than their liberty to stand by their leaders to the last to spare the cities of such barbarians as they conquered and what crowned all the conclusion of their oath was we will never repair any of the temples which they have burned and destroyed lest they may appear to posterity as so many monuments of these wicked barbarians this was a glorious resolution and i am sorry to think that the poverty of my countrymen will not let the world suppose they have acted upon such a generous principle yet upon this occasion i cannot but observe that there is a fatality in some nations to be fond of those who have treated them with the least humanity thus i have often heard the memory of cromwell who has depopulated and almost wholly destroyed this miserable country celebrated like that of a saint and at the same time the sufferings of the royal martyr turned into ridicule and his murder justified even from the pulpit and all this done with an intent to gain favour under a monarchy which is a new strain of politics that i shall not pretend to account for  examine all the eastern towns of ireland and you will trace this horrid instrument of destruction in defacing of churches and particularly in destroying whatever was ornamental either within or without them we see in the several towns a very few houses scattered among the ruins of thousands which he laid level with their streets great numbers of castles the country seats of gentlemen then in being still standing in ruin habitations for bats daws and owls without the least repairs or succession of other buildings nor have the country churches as far as my eye could reach met with any better treatment from him nine in ten of them lying among their graves and god only knows when they are to have a resurrection when i passed from dundalk where this cursed usurpers handy work is yet visible i cast mine eyes around from the top of a mountain from whence i had a wide and a waste prospect of several venerable ruins it struck me with a melancholy not unlike that expressed by cicero in one of his letters which being much upon the like prospect and concluding with a very necessary reflection on the uncertainty of things in this world i shall here insert a translation of what he says in my return from asia as i sailed from Ægina towards megara i began to take a prospect of the several countries round me behind me was Ægina before me megara on the right hand the piræus and on the left was corinth which towns were formerly in a most flourishing condition now they lie prostrate and in ruin  thus i began to think with myself shall we who have but a trifling existence express any resentment when one of us either dies a natural death or is slain whose lives are necessarily of a short duration when at one view i beheld the carcases of so many great cities what if he had seen the natives of those free republics reduced to all the miserable consequences of a conquered people living without the common defences against hunger and cold rather appearing like spectres than men i am apt to think that seeing his fellow creatures in ruin like this it would have put him past all patience for philosophic reflection  as for my own part i confess that the sights and occurrences which i had in this my last journey so far transported me to a mixture of rage and compassion that i am not able to decide which had the greater influence upon my spirits for this new cant of a rich and flourishing nation was still uppermost in my thoughts every mile i travelled giving me such ample demonstrations to the contrary for this reason i have been at the pains to render a most exact and faithful account of all the visible signs of riches which i met with in sixty miles riding through the most public roads and the best part of the kingdom first as to trade i met nine cars loaden with old musty shrivelled hides one carload of butter four jockeys driving eight horses all out of case one cow and calf driven by a man and his wife six tattered families flitting to be shipped off to the west indies a colony of a hundred and fifty beggars all repairing to people our metropolis and by encreasing the number of hands to encrease its wealth upon the old maxim that people are the riches of a nation and therefore ten thousand mouths with hardly ten pair of hands or hardly any work to employ them will infallibly make us a rich and flourishing people secondly travellers enough but seven in ten wanting shirts and cravats nine in ten going bare foot and carrying their brogues and stockings in their hands one woman in twenty having a pillion the rest riding bare backed above two hundred horsemen with four pair of boots amongst them all seventeen saddles of leather the rest being made of straw and most of their garrons only shod before i went into one of the principal farmers houses out of curiosity and his whole furniture consisted of two blocks for stools a bench on each side the fireplace made of turf six trenchers one bowl a pot six horn spoons three noggins three blankets one of which served the man and maid servant the other the master of the family his wife and five children a small churn a wooden candlestick a broken stick for a pair of tongs in the public towns one third of the inhabitants walking the streets bare foot windows half built up with stone to save the expense of glass the broken panes up and down supplied by brown paper few being able to afford white in some places they were stopped with straw or hay another mark of our riches are the signs at the several inns upon the road viz in some a staff stuck in the thatch with a turf at the end of it a staff in a dunghill with a white rag wrapped about the head a pole where they can afford it with a besom at the top an oatmeal cake on a board at the window and at the principal inns of the road i have observed the signs taken down and laid against the wall near the door being taken from their post to prevent the shaking of the house down by the wind in short i saw not one single house in the best town i travelled through which had not manifest appearances of beggary and want i could give many more instances of our wealth but i hope these will suffice for the end i propose  it may be objected what use it is of to display the poverty of the nation in the manner i have done i answer i desire to know for what ends and by what persons this new opinion of our flourishing state has of late been so industriously advanced one thing is certain that the advancers have either already found their own account or have been heartily promised or at least have been entertained with hopes by seeing such an opinion pleasing to those who have it in their power to reward  it is no doubt a very generous principle in any person to rejoice in the felicities of a nation where themselves are strangers or sojourners but if it be found that the same persons on all other occasions express a hatred and contempt of the nation and people in general and hold it for a maximthat the more such a country is humbled the more their own will rise it need be no longer a secret why such an opinion and the advantages of it are encouraged and besides if the bayliff reports to his master that the ox is fat and strong when in reality it can hardly carry its own legs is it not natural to think that command will be given for a greater load to be put upon it t s  21 this was a project for the establishment of a national bank for ireland swift ridiculed the proposal see p 31 no doubt out of suspicion of the acts of stockjobbers and the monied interests which were enlisted on the side of the whigs his experience also of the abortive south sea schemes would tend to make his opposition all the stronger but the plans for the bank were not illconceived and had swift been in calmer temper he might have seen the advantages which attached to the proposals t s  22 thus in original edition in faulkner and the miscellanies of 1735 the words are altogether imaginary t s  23 the motto round a crown piece which was the usual price of permits orig edit  24 the dean of st patricks f  25 paul lorrain who was appointed ordinary of newgate in 1698 compiled numerous confessions and dying speeches of prisoners condemned to be hanged a letter to swift from pope and bolingbroke dated december 1725 mentions him as the great historiographer and steele in the tatler and spectator refers to lorrains saints lorrain attended some famous criminals to the scaffold including captain kidd and jack sheppard t s  26 the following is an account of the proceedings of both the houses of the irish parliament upon the subject of this proposed bank  in the year 1720 james earl of abercorn gustavus viscount boyne sir ralph gore bart oliver st george and michael ward esqs in behalf of themselves and others presented a petition to his majesty for a charter of incorporation whereby they might be established as a bank under the name and title of the bank of ireland they proposed to raise a fund of £500000 to supply merchants etc with money at five per cent and agreed to contribute £50000 to the service of government in consideration of their obtaining a charter in their petition they state that the raising of a million for that purpose is creating a greater fund than the nation can employ soon after the abovementioned petition was lodged a second application was made by lord forbes and others who proposed raising a million for that purpose and offered to discharge the £50000 national debt of that kingdom in five years from the time they should obtain a charter the latter application being subsequent in point of date was withdrawn lord forbes and his friends having acquainted the lordlieutenant that rather than by a competition obstruct a proposal of so general advantage they were willing to desist from their application the former was accordingly approved of and the king on the 29th of july 1721 issued letters of privy seal directing that a charter of incorporation should pass the great seal of ireland comm journ vol iii appendix ix page cc etc  when the parliament of ireland met on the 12th of september following the duke of grafton lord lieutenant in his speech from the throne communicated the intention of his majesty to both houses and concluded by saying as this is a matter of general and national concern his majesty leaves it to the wisdom of parliament to consider what advantages the public may receive by erecting a bank and in what manner it may be settled upon a safe foundation so as to be beneficial to the kingdom the commons in their address which was voted unanimously on the 14th expressed their gratitude for his majestys goodness and royal favour in directing a commission to establish a bank and on the 21st moved for the papers to be laid before them they even on the 29th agreed to the following resolution of the committee they had appointed that the establishment of a bank upon a solid and good foundation under proper regulations and restrictions will contribute to restoring of credit and support of the trade and manufacture of the kingdom but when the heads of a bill for establishing the bank came to be discussed a strenuous opposition was raised to it on the 9th of december sir thomas taylor chairman of the committee to whom the matter had been referred reported that they had gone through the first enacting paragraph and disagreed to the same accordingly the question being proposed and put the house after a division wherein there appeared 150 for the question and 80 against it voted that they could not find any safe foundation for establishing a public bank and resolved that an address conformable to this resolution should be presented to the lordlieutenant comm journ vol iii pp 247289  the proceedings of the house of lords resembled that of the commons on the 8th of november they concurred with the resolution of their committee which was unfavourable to the establishment of a bank a protest was however entered signed by four temporal and two spiritual peers and when an address to his majesty grounded on that resolution was proposed a long debate ensued which occupied two days on the 9th december a list of the subscriptions was called for and on the 16th they resolved that if any lord spiritual or temporal

in 1757 a remarkable dearth prevailed in ireland mr skelton went out into the country to discover the real state of his poor and travelled from cottage to cottage over mountains rocks and heath in one cabin he found the people eating boiled prushia a weed with a yellow flower that grows in cornfields by itself for their breakfast and tasted this sorry food which seemed nauseous to him next morning he gave orders to have prushia gathered and boiled for his own breakfast that he might live on the same sort of food with the poor he ate this for one or two days but at last his stomach turning against it he set off immediately for ballyshannon to buy oatmeal for them one day when he was travelling in this manner through the country he came to a lonely cottage in the mountains where he found a poor woman lying in childbed with a number of children about her all she had in her weak helpless condition to keep herself and her children alive was blood and sorrel boiled up together the blood her husband who was a herdsman took from the cattle of others under his care for he had none of his own this was a usual sort of food in that country in times of scarcity for they bled the cows for that purpose and thus the same cow often afforded both milk and blood they were obliged when the carriers were bringing the meal to pettigo to guard it with their clubs as the people of the adjacent

borne out by hely hutchinsons account in his commercial restraints of ireland to which reference has already been made  in the year 1698 a bill was introduced into the english parliament grounded upon complaints that the woollen manufacture in ireland prejudiced the staple trade of england the matter terminated at last in an address to the king wherein the commons implored his majestys protection and favour on this matter and that he would make it his royal care and enjoin all those whom he employed in ireland to use their utmost diligence to hinder the exportation of wool from ireland except it be imported into england and for the discouraging the woollen manufacture and increasing the linen manufacture of ireland accordingly on the 16th july the king wrote a letter of instructions to the earl of galway in which the following passage appears the chief thing that must be tried to be prevented is that the irish parliament takes no notice of what has passed in this here and that you make effectual laws for the linen manufacture and discourage as far as possible the woollenthe earl of galway and the other justices convened the parliament on the 27th of september in their speech they recommended a bill for the encouragement of the manufactures of linen and hemp which say they will be found more advantageous to this kingdom than the woollen manufacture which being the settled trade of england from whence all foreign markets are supplied can never be encouraged here the house of commons so far concurred with the lords justices sentiments as to say in their address of thanks that they would heartily endeavour to establish the linen manufacture and to render the same useful to england and we hope they add to find such a temperament with respect to the woollen trade here that the same may not be injurious to england cont rapins hist p 376 and they did says mr smith so far come into a temperament in this case as hoping it would be accepted by way of compromise to lay a high duty of  upon all their woollen manufacture exported under which had england acquiesced i am persuaded it would have been better for the kingdom in general but the false notion of a possible monopoly made the english deaf to all other terms of accommodation by which means they lost the horse rather than quit the stable memoirs of wool vol ii p 30 the duties imposed by the irish parliament at this time upon the export of manufactured wool was four shillings on the value of twenty shillings of the old drapery and two shillings upon the like value of the new except friezes but this concurrence of the people of ireland seemed rather to heighten the jealousy between the two nations by making the people of england imagine the manufactures of ireland were arrived at a dangerous pitch of improvement since they could be supposed capable of bearing so extravagant a duty accordingly in the next following year the english parliament passed an act 1011 william iii cap 10 that no person should export from ireland wool or woollen goods except to england or wales under high penalties such goods to be shipped only from certain ports in ireland and to certain ports in england but this was not the whole grievance the old duties upon the import of those commodities whether raw or manufactured into great britain were left in the same state as before which amounted nearly to a prohibition thus did the english although they had not themselves any occasion for those commodities prohibit nevertheless their being sent to any other nation  the discouragement of the woollen manufacture of ireland affected particularly the english settlers there for the linen was entirely in the hands of the scotch who were established in ulster and the irish natives had no share in either it is stated in a pamphlet entitled a discourse concerning ireland etc in answer to the exon and barnstaple petitions printed 16978 that there were then in the city and suburbs of dublin 12000 english families and throughout the nation 50000 who were bred to trades connected with the manufacture of wool who could no more get their bread in the linen manufacture than a london taylor by shoemaking  mr walter scott says life of swift p 278 that the irish woollen manufacture produced an annual million but this is not the fact mr dobbs in his essay on the trade of ireland informs us from the customhouse books that in the year 1697 which immediately preceded the year in which the address abovementioned was transmitted to the king the total value of irish woollen exports of all sorts was only £23614 9s 6d and in 1687 when they were at the highest they did not exceed £70521 14s 0d it moreover appears that the greater part of these exports were of a sort which did not interfere with the trade of england £56415 16s 0d was in friezes and £2520 18s 0d coarse stockings the rest consisted in serges and other stuffs of the new drapery which affected not the trade of england generally but only the particular interests of exeter and its neighbourhood and a very few other inconsiderable towns  but whatever injury was intended little prejudice was done to ireland except what followed immediately after the passing of this act it appears from mr dobbss pamphlet that a few years after four times the quantity of woollen goods were shipped in each year clandestinely than had ever been exported legally before moreover the irish vastly increased their manufactures for home consumption and learned to make fine cloth from spanish wool it was only to england itself that any disadvantage redounded many manufacturers who were unsettled by this measure passed over to germany spain and to rouen and other parts of france from these beginnings they have in many branches so much improved the woollen manufactures of france as to vie with the english in foreign marketsupon the whole those nations may be justly said to have deprived britain of millions since that time instead of the thousands ireland might possibly have madewhat mr dobbs has here asserted relative to the removal of the manufacturers has been confirmed by another tract letter from a clothier a member of parliament printed in 1731 which informs us that for some years after the english seemed to engross all the woollen trade but this appearance of benefit abated as the foreign factories raised on the ruin of the irish acquired strength he shows too that the importation of unmanufactured wool from ireland to england had been gradually decreasing since that time which was probably on account of the increase of the illicit trade to foreign parts towards the encouragement of which the duties or legal transportation served to act as a bounty of 36 per cent so true it is that england can never fall into measures for unreasonably cramping the industry of the people of ireland without doing herself the greatest prejudice note g pp 320321 t s  104 the causes for absenteeism are thus noted by lecky hist of ireland p 213 vol i ed 1892 the very large part of the confiscated land was given to englishmen who had property and duties in england and habitually lived there much of it also came into the market and as there was very little capital in ireland and as catholics were forbidden to purchase land this also passed largely into the hands of english speculators besides the level of civilization was much higher in england than in ireland the position of a protestant landlord living in the midst of a degraded population differing from him in religion and race had but little attraction the political situation of the country closed to an irish gentleman nearly every avenue of honourable ambition and owing to a long series of very evident causes the sentiment of public duty was deplorably low the economical condition was not checked by any considerable movement in the opposite direction for after the suppression of the irish manufactures but few englishmen except those who obtained irish offices came to ireland  the amount of the rent obtained in ireland that was spent in england is estimated elsewhere by swift to have been at least onethird in 1729 prior assessed the amount at £627000 in the supplement to his list of absentees prior gives eight further articles by which money was yearly drawn out of the kingdom see

argyll however fought his forces and though the victory remained undecided mar was compelled to seek safety in france the rebellion caused so much disturbance in every part of the british isles that

james the seconds reign and died in india in 1699 which do very little honour either to his heart or understanding  it is reported that being trepanned into a marriage with this lady by a stratagem of the celebrated lionel duke of dorset lord allen refused for some time to acknowledge her as his wife but the lady after living some time in close retirement caused an advertisement to be inserted in the papers stating the death of a brother in the east indies by which miss margaret du pass had succeeded to a large fortune accordingly she put on mourning and assumed an equipage conforming to her supposed change of fortune lord allens affairs being much deranged he became now as anxious to prove the marriage with the wealthy heiress as he had formerly been to disown the unportioned damsel and succeeded after such opposition as the lady judged necessary to give colour to the farce before the deceit was discovered lady allen by her good sense and talents had obtained such ascendance over her husband that they ever afterwards lived in great harmony  lord allen was at the time of giving offence to swift a privycounsellor and distinguished himself according to lodge in the house of peers by

kept alive as long as possible the sentence was put in execution when she fainted with the cruel torment the hangman gave her strong liquors c to revive her the sixth day she died her long sufferings youth and good constitution made her flesh so tender delicious and valuable that the executioner sold it for above eight tallies for there was such thronging to this inhuman market that men of great fashion thought themselves fortunate if they could purchase a pound or two of it lond 1705 p 112 s  133 the english government had been making concessions to the dissenters and of course swift satirically alludes here to the arguments used by the government in the steps they had taken but the truth of the matter swift hints was that those who desired to abolish the test were more anxious for their pockets than their consciences t s  134 the inhabitants of a district of brazil supposed to be savages making the name synonymous with savage ignorance t s  135    remove me from this land

suffering from irish competition t s  138 this was the celebrated periodical founded by pulteney after he had separated himself from walpole to which bolingbroke contributed his famous letters of an occasional writer the journal carried on a political war against walpoles administration and endeavoured to bring about the establishment of a new party to consist of tories and the whigs who could not agree with walpoles methods caleb danvers was a mere name for a grub street hack who was supposed to be the writer but walpole had no difficulty in recognizing the hand of bolingbroke and his

to the crown that this importation of irish cattle was lowering english rents two acts passed in 1665 and 1680 fully met the wishes of the landlords and ruined absolutely the irish cattle trade prevented thus from breeding cattle the irish turned to the breeding of sheep and established in a very short time an excellent trade in wool how england ruined this industry also may be seen from

sheridan in his life of swift gives an instance of this which is quoted by scott carteret had appointed sheridan one of his domestic chaplains and the two would often spend hours together or in company with swift exchanging talk and knowledge when sheridan had one of the greek tragedies performed by the scholars of the school he kept carteret wished to read the play over with him before the performance at this reading sheridan was surprised at the ease with which his patron could translate the original and asking him how he came to know it so well carteret told him that when he was envoy in denmark he had been for a long time confined to his chamber partly by illness and partly by the severity of the weather and having but few books with him he had read sophocles over and over so often as to be almost able to repeat the whole verbatim which impressed it ever after indelibly on his memory t s  147 this refers to richard tighe the gentleman who informed on poor sheridan for preaching from the text on the anniversary of king georges accession sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof it was on this information that sheridan lost his living swift never afterwards missed an opportunity to ridicule tighe and he has lampooned that individual in several poems in the legion club swift calls him dick fitzbaker alluding to his descent from one of cromwells contractors who supplied the army with bread t s  148 the worst of times was the expression used by the whigs when they referred to oxfords administration in the last four years of queen annes reign t s  149 a famous

lampooned and bettesworth complained to the house of commons hutcheson aided bettesworth in this prosecution causing swift to be roused to a strong indignation against such unconstitutional proceedings    better we all were in our graves   than live in slavery to slaves  these are the lines beginning one of his more trenchant lampoons against the magistrate t s  151 the beast who had kicked him is the expression swift uses for tighe in writing to sheridan in a letter on september 25th 1725 in that letter swift urges sheridan to revenge and promises him his help t s  152 the word

swift was once asked to excuse him for his conduct on the plea that he was mad swift replied i know that he is a madman and if that were all no man living could commiserate his condition more than myself but sir he is a madman possessed by the devil i renounce him see scotts life of swift p 365 t s  156 the reader may compare what is stated in these two paragraphs with the same opinion

the anniversary of the accession of george i in his history of solomon the second swift censures his friend strongly for his indiscretion t s  161 the richard tighe aforementioned t s  162 sheridan wrote a poem displeasing to swift which swift thus animadverts on in the history of the second solomon having lain many years under the obloquy of a high tory and a jacobite upon the present queens birthday he dr sheridan writ a song to be performed before the government and those who attended them in praise of the queen and king on the common topics of her beauty wit family love of england and all other virtues wherein the king and the royal children were sharers it was very hard to avoid the common topics a young collegian who had done the same job the year before got some reputation on account of his wit solomon would needs vie with him by which he lost the esteem of his old friends the tories and got not the least interest with the whigs for they are now too strong to want advocates of that kind and therefore one of the lordsjustices reading the verses in some company said ah doctor this shall not do his name was at length in the titlepage and he did this without the knowledge or advice of one living soul as he himself confesseth t s  163 dr stopford bishop of cloyne one of swifts intimate friends stopford always acknowledged that he owed his advancement entirely to swifts kindness he wrote an elegant latin tribute to swift given by scott in an appendix to the life with delany and others he was one of swifts executors  164 delany was a ripe scholar and much esteemed by swift though the latter had occasion to rebuke him for attempting to court favour with the castle people and for an attack on the intelligencer a journal which swift and sheridan had started delany however was a little jealous of sheridans favour with the dean he was afterwards chancellor of st patricks and wrote a life of swift t s  165 sir constantine phipps lord chancellor of

project for converting a large house called hamiltons bawn situated about two miles from sir arthur achesons seat into a barrack the project gave rise to swifts poem entitled the grand question

s  190 the following from deane swifts edition given by sir walter scott in his edition of swifts works refers to this very plain proposal it is evidently written by swift and is dated as from the deanery house september 26th 1726 almost eleven years before the above tract was issued  deaneryhouse sept 26 1726  the continued concourse of beggars from all parts of the kingdom to this city having made it impossible for the several parishes to maintain their own poor according to the ancient laws of the land several lord mayors did apply themselves to the lord archbishop of dublin that his grace would direct his clergy and his churchwardens of the said city to appoint badges of brass copper or pewter to be worn by the poor of the several parishes the badges to be marked with the initial letters of the name of each church and numbered 1 2 3 etc and to be well sewed and fastened on the right and left shoulder of the outward garment of each of the said poor by which they might be distinguished and that none of the said poor should go out of their own parish to beg alms whereof the beadles were to take care  his grace the lord archbishop did accordingly give his directions to the clergy which however have proved wholly ineffectual by the fraud perverseness or pride of the said poor several of them openly protesting they will never submit to wear the said badges and of those who received them almost every one keep them in their pockets or hang them in a string about their necks or fasten them under their coats not to be seen by which means the whole design is eluded so that a man may walk from one end of the town to another without seeing one beggar regularly badged and in such great numbers that they are a mighty nuisance to the public most of them being foreigners  it is therefore proposed that his grace the lord archbishop would please to call the clergy of the city together and renew his directions and exhortations to them to put the affair of badges effectually in practice by such methods as his grace and they shall agree upon and i think it would be highly necessary that some paper should be pasted up in several proper parts of the city signifying this order and exhorting all people to give no alms except to those poor who are regularly badged and only while they are in the precincts of their own parishes and if something like this were delivered by the ministers in the readingdesk two or three lordsdays successively it would still be of further use to put this matter upon a right foot and that all who offend against this regulation shall be treated as vagabonds and sturdy beggars t s  191 spelt now st warburghs t s  192 about the beginning of the eighteenth century dr gwythers a physician and fellow of the university of dublin brought over with him a parcel of frogs from england to ireland in order to propagate their species in that kingdom and threw them into the ditches of the university park but they all perished whereupon he sent to england for some bottles of the frogspawn which he threw into those ditches by which means the species of frogs was propagated in that kingdom however their number was so small in the year 1720 that a frog was nowhere to be seen in ireland except in the neighbourhood of the university park but within six or seven years after they spread thirty forty or fifty miles over the country and so at last by degrees over the whole country d s  193 swifts uncle godwin swift for whose memory he had no special regard seems to have been concerned in this ingenious anagram and unfortunate project s  194 this reproach has been certainly removed since the dean flourished for the titles of the irish peerages of late creation have rather been in the opposite extreme and resemble in some instances the appellatives in romances and novels  thomas obrien macmahon an irish author quoted by mr southey in his omniana in a most angry pamphlet on the candour and goodnature of englishmen has the following diverting passage which may serve as a corollary to swifts tractyou sent out the children of your princes says he addressing the irish and sometimes your princes in person to enlighten this kingdom then sitting in utter darkness meaning england and how have they recompensed you why after lawlessly distributing your estates possessed for thirteen centuries or more by your illustrious families whose antiquity and nobility if equalled by any nation in the world none but the immutable god of abrahams chosen though at present wandering and afflicted people surpasses

given by sheridan by way of retaliation to these specimens of irish blunders noted by swift t s  197 this specimen of irishenglish or what swift condemned as such is taken from an unfinished copy in the deans handwriting found among mr lyonss papers s  198 see note on p 368 t s  199 dunkin was one of swifts favourites to judge by the efforts swift made on his behalf writing to alderman barber 17th january 173738 swift speaks of him as a gentleman of much wit and the best english as well as latin poet in this kingdom several of dunkins poems were printed in scotts edition of swifts works

by no means negligent of his literary assistants but unfortunately like an unskilful general he confided more in the number than the spirit or discipline of his forces arnall concanen and henley were wretched auxiliaries yet they could not complain of indifferent pay since arnall used to brag that in the course of four years he had received from the treasury for his political writings the sum of £10997 6s 8d s  202 the authority for considering this account to be the work of swift is mr deane swift the editor of the edition of 1765 of swifts works it is included in the eighth volume of the quarto edition issued that year burke also seems to have had no doubt at all about the authorship referring to the deans disposition to defend queen anne and to ridicule her successor he says it is probable that the pieces in which he does it account of the court of japan and directions for making a birthday song were the occasion of most of the other posthumous articles having been so long withheld from the publick undoubtedly there is much in this piece that savours of swifts method of dealing with such a subject but that could easily be imitated by a clever reader of gulliver the style however in which it is written is not distinctly swifts  at the time this tract was written 1728 the tory party was anxiously hoping that the accession of george ii would see the downfall of walpole but the party was doomed to a bitter disappointment walpole not only maintained but added to the power he enjoyed under george i by what means this was accomplished the writer of this piece attempts to hint sir walter scott thinks the piece was probably left imperfect when the crisis to which the tories so anxiously looked forward terminated so undesirably in the confirmation of walpoles
