42183099	the secret sharer  by joseph conrad     i   on my right hand there were lines of fishing stakes resembling a mysterious system of halfsubmerged bamboo fences incomprehensible in its division of the domain of tropical fishes and crazy of aspect as if abandoned forever by some nomad tribe of fishermen now gone to the other end of the ocean for there was no sign of human habitation as far as the eye could reach to the left a group of barren islets suggesting ruins of stone walls towers and blockhouses had its foundations set in a blue sea that itself looked solid so still and stable did it lie below my feet even the track of light from the westering sun shone smoothly without that animated glitter which tells of an imperceptible ripple and when i turned my head to take a parting glance at the tug which had just left us anchored outside the bar i saw the straight line of the flat shore joined to the stable sea edge to edge with a perfect and unmarked closeness in one leveled floor half brown half blue under the enormous dome of the sky corresponding in their insignificance to the islets of the sea two small clumps of trees one on each side of the only fault in the impeccable joint marked the mouth of the river meinam we had just left on the first preparatory stage of our homeward journey and far back on the inland level a larger and loftier mass the grove surrounding the great paknam pagoda was the only thing on which the eye could rest from the vain task of exploring the monotonous sweep of the horizon here and there gleams as of a few scattered pieces of silver marked the windings of the great river and on the nearest of them just within the bar the tug steaming right into the land became lost to my sight hull and funnel and masts as though the impassive earth had swallowed her up without an effort without a tremor my eye followed the light cloud of her smoke now here now there above the plain according to the devious curves of the stream but always fainter and farther away till i lost it at last behind the mitershaped hill of the great pagoda and then i was left alone with my ship anchored at the head of the gulf of siam  she floated at the starting point of a long journey very still in an immense stillness the shadows of her spars flung far to the eastward by the setting sun at that moment i was alone on her decks there was not a sound in herand around us nothing moved nothing lived not a canoe on the water not a bird in the air not a cloud in the sky in this breathless pause at the threshold of a long passage we seemed to be measuring our fitness for a long and arduous enterprise the appointed task of both our existences to be carried out far from all human eyes with only sky and sea for spectators and for judges  there must have been some glare in the air to interfere with ones sight because it was only just before the sun left us that my roaming eyes made out beyond the highest ridges of the principal islet of the group something which did away with the solemnity of perfect solitude the tide of darkness flowed on swiftly and with tropical suddenness a swarm of stars came out above the shadowy earth while i lingered yet my hand resting lightly on my ships rail as if on the shoulder of a trusted friend but with all that multitude of celestial bodies staring down at one the comfort of quiet communion with her was gone for good and there were also disturbing sounds by this timevoices footsteps forward the steward flitted along the maindeck a busily ministering spirit a hand bell tinkled urgently under the poop deck  i found my two officers waiting for me near the supper table in the lighted cuddy we sat down at once and as i helped the chief mate i said  are you aware that there is a ship anchored inside the islands i saw her mastheads above the ridge as the sun went down  he raised sharply his simple face overcharged by a terrible growth of whisker and emitted his usual ejaculations bless my soul sir you dont say so  my second mate was a roundcheeked silent young man grave beyond his years i thought but as our eyes happened to meet i detected a slight quiver on his lips i looked down at once it was not my part to encourage sneering on board my ship it must be said too that i knew very little of my officers in consequence of certain events of no particular significance except to myself i had been appointed to the command only a fortnight before neither did i know much of the hands forward all these people had been together for eighteen months or so and my position was that of the only stranger on board i mention this because it has some bearing on what is to follow but what i felt most was my being a stranger to the ship and if all the truth must be told i was somewhat of a stranger to myself the youngest man on board barring the second mate and untried as yet by a position of the fullest responsibility i was willing to take the adequacy of the others for granted they had simply to be equal to their tasks but i wondered how far i should turn out faithful to that ideal conception of ones own personality every man sets up for himself secretly  meantime the chief mate with an almost visible effect of collaboration on the part of his round eyes and frightful whiskers was trying to evolve a theory of the anchored ship his dominant trait was to take all things into earnest consideration he was of a painstaking turn of mind as he used to say he liked to account to himself for practically everything that came in his way down to a miserable scorpion he had found in his cabin a week before the why and the wherefore of that scorpionhow it got on board and came to select his room rather than the pantry which was a dark place and more what a scorpion would be partial to and how on earth it managed to drown itself in the inkwell of his writing deskhad exercised him infinitely the ship within the islands was much more easily accounted for and just as we were about to rise from table he made his pronouncement she was he doubted not a ship from home lately arrived probably she drew too much water to cross the bar except at the top of spring tides therefore she went into that natural harbor to wait for a few days in preference to remaining in an open roadstead  thats so confirmed the second mate suddenly in his slightly hoarse voice she draws over twenty feet shes the liverpool ship sephora with a cargo of coal hundred and twentythree days from cardiff  we looked at him in surprise  the tugboat skipper told me when he came on board for your letters sir explained the young man he expects to take her up the river the day after tomorrow  after thus overwhelming us with the extent of his information he slipped out of the cabin the mate observed regretfully that he could not account for that young fellows whims what prevented him telling us all about it at once he wanted to know  i detained him as he was making a move for the last two days the crew had had plenty of hard work and the night before they had very little sleep i felt painfully that ia strangerwas doing something unusual when i directed him to let all hands turn in without setting an anchor watch i proposed to keep on deck myself till one oclock or thereabouts i would get the second mate to relieve me at that hour  he will turn out the cook and the steward at four i concluded and then give you a call of course at the slightest sign of any sort of wind well have the hands up and make a start at once  he concealed his astonishment very well sir outside the cuddy he put his head in the second mates door to inform him of my unheardof caprice to take a five hours anchor watch on myself i heard the other raise his voice incredulouslywhat the captain himself then a few more murmurs a door closed then another a few moments later i went on deck  my strangeness which had made me sleepless had prompted that unconventional arrangement as if i had expected in those solitary hours of the night to get on terms with the ship of which i knew nothing manned by men of whom i knew very little more fast alongside a wharf littered like any ship in port with a tangle of unrelated things invaded by unrelated shore people i had hardly seen her yet properly now as she lay cleared for sea the stretch of her maindeck seemed to me very fine under the stars very fine very roomy for her size and very inviting i descended the poop and paced the waist my mind picturing to myself the coming passage through the malay archipelago down the indian ocean and up the atlantic all its phases were familiar enough to me every characteristic all the alternatives which were likely to face me on the high seaseverything except the novel responsibility of command but i took heart from the reasonable thought that the ship was like other ships the men like other men and that the sea was not likely to keep any special surprises expressly for my discomfiture  arrived at that comforting conclusion i bethought myself of a cigar and went below to get it all was still down there everybody at the after end of the ship was sleeping profoundly i came out again on the quarterdeck agreeably at ease in my sleeping suit on that warm breathless night barefooted a glowing cigar in my teeth and going forward i was met by the profound silence of the fore end of the ship only as i passed the door of the forecastle i heard a deep quiet trustful sigh of some sleeper inside and suddenly i rejoiced in the great security of the sea as compared with the unrest of the land in my choice of that untempted life presenting no disquieting problems invested with an elementary moral beauty by the absolute straightforwardness of its appeal and by the singleness of its purpose  the riding light in the forerigging burned with a clear untroubled as if symbolic flame confident and bright in the mysterious shades of the night passing on my way aft along the other side of the ship i observed that the rope side ladder put over no doubt for the master of the tug when he came to fetch away our letters had not been hauled in as it should have been i became annoyed at this for exactitude in some small matters is the very soul of discipline then i reflected that i had myself peremptorily dismissed my officers from duty and by my own act had prevented the anchor watch being formally set and things properly attended to i asked myself whether it was wise ever to interfere with the established routine of duties even from the kindest of motives my action might have made me appear eccentric goodness only knew how that absurdly whiskered mate would account for my conduct and what the whole ship thought of that informality of their new captain i was vexed with myself  not from compunction certainly but as it were mechanically i proceeded to get the ladder in myself now a side ladder of that sort is a light affair and comes in easily yet my vigorous tug which should have brought it flying on board merely recoiled upon my body in a totally unexpected jerk what the devil i was so astounded by the immovableness of that ladder that i remained stockstill trying to account for it to myself like that imbecile mate of mine in the end of course i put my head over the rail  the side of the ship made an opaque belt of shadow on the darkling glassy shimmer of the sea but i saw at once something elongated and pale floating very close to the ladder before i could form a guess a faint flash of phosphorescent light which seemed to issue suddenly from the naked body of a man flickered in the sleeping water with the elusive silent play of summer lightning in a night sky with a gasp i saw revealed to my stare a pair of feet the long legs a broad livid back immersed right up to the neck in a greenish cadaverous glow one hand awash clutched the bottom rung of the ladder he was complete but for the head a headless corpse the cigar dropped out of my gaping mouth with a tiny plop and a short hiss quite audible in the absolute stillness of all things under heaven at that i suppose he raised up his face a dimly pale oval in the shadow of the ships side but even then i could only barely make out down there the shape of his blackhaired head however it was enough for the horrid frostbound sensation which had gripped me about the chest to pass off the moment of vain exclamations was past too i only climbed on the spare spar and leaned over the rail as far as i could to bring my eyes nearer to that mystery floating alongside  as he hung by the ladder like a resting swimmer the sea lightning played about his limbs at every stir and he appeared in it ghastly silvery fishlike he remained as mute as a fish too he made no motion to get out of the water either it was inconceivable that he should not attempt to come on board and strangely troubling to suspect that perhaps he did not want to and my first words were prompted by just that troubled incertitude  whats the matter i asked in my ordinary tone speaking down to the face upturned exactly under mine  cramp it answered no louder then slightly anxious i say no need to call anyone  i was not going to i said  are you alone on deck  yes  i had somehow the impression that he was on the point of letting go the ladder to swim away beyond my kenmysterious as he came but for the moment this being appearing as if he had risen from the bottom of the sea it was certainly the nearest land to the ship wanted only to know the time i told him and he down there tentatively  i suppose your captains turned in  i am sure he isnt i said  he seemed to struggle with himself for i heard something like the low bitter murmur of doubt whats the good his next words came out with a hesitating effort  look here my man could you call him out quietly  i thought the time had come to declare myself  i am the captain  i heard a by jove whispered at the level of the water the phosphorescence flashed in the swirl of the water all about his limbs his other hand seized the ladder  my names leggatt  the voice was calm and resolute a good voice the selfpossession of that man had somehow induced a corresponding state in myself it was very quietly that i remarked  you must be a good swimmer  yes ive been in the water practically since nine oclock the question for me now is whether i am to let go this ladder and go on swimming till i sink from exhaustion orto come on board here  i felt this was no mere formula of desperate speech but a real alternative in the view of a strong soul i should have gathered from this that he was young indeed it is only the young who are ever confronted by such clear issues but at the time it was pure intuition on my part a mysterious communication was established already between us twoin the face of that silent darkened tropical sea i was young too young enough to make no comment the man in the water began suddenly to climb up the ladder and i hastened away from the rail to fetch some clothes  before entering the cabin i stood still listening in the lobby at the foot of the stairs a faint snore came through the closed door of the chief mates room the second mates door was on the hook but the darkness in there was absolutely soundless he too was young and could sleep like a stone remained the steward but he was not likely to wake up before he was called i got a sleeping suit out of my room and coming back on deck saw the naked man from the sea sitting on the main hatch glimmering white in the darkness his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands in a moment he had concealed his damp body in a sleeping suit of the same graystripe pattern as the one i was wearing and followed me like my double on the poop together we moved right aft barefooted silent  what is it i asked in a deadened voice taking the lighted lamp out of the binnacle and raising it to his face  an ugly business  he had rather regular features a good mouth light eyes under somewhat heavy dark eyebrows a smooth square forehead no growth on his cheeks a small brown mustache and a wellshaped round chin his expression was concentrated meditative under the inspecting light of the lamp i held up to his face such as a man thinking hard in solitude might wear my sleeping suit was just right for his size a wellknit young fellow of twentyfive at most he caught his lower lip with the edge of white even teeth  yes i said replacing the lamp in the binnacle the warm heavy tropical night closed upon his head again  theres a ship over there he murmured  yes i know the sephora did you know of us  hadnt the slightest idea i am the mate of her he paused and corrected himself i should say i was  aha something wrong  yes very wrong indeed ive killed a man  what do you mean just now  no on the passage weeks ago thirtynine south when i say a man  fit of temper i suggested confidently  the shadowy dark head like mine seemed to nod imperceptibly above the ghostly gray of my sleeping suit it was in the night as though i had been faced by my own reflection in the depths of a somber and immense mirror  a pretty thing to have to own up to for a conway boy murmured my double distinctly  youre a conway boy  i am he said as if startled then slowly perhaps you too  it was so but being a couple of years older i had left before he joined after a quick interchange of dates a silence fell and i thought suddenly of my absurd mate with his terrific whiskers and the bless my soulyou dont say so type of intellect my double gave me an inkling of his thoughts by saying my fathers a parson in norfolk do you see me before a judge and jury on that charge for myself i cant see the necessity there are fellows that an angel from heavenand i am not that he was one of those creatures that are just simmering all the time with a silly sort of wickedness miserable devils that have no business to live at all he wouldnt do his duty and wouldnt let anybody else do theirs but whats the good of talking you know well enough the sort of illconditioned snarling cur  he appealed to me as if our experiences had been as identical as our clothes and i knew well enough the pestiferous danger of such a character where there are no means of legal repression and i knew well enough also that my double there was no homicidal ruffian i did not think of asking him for details and he told me the story roughly in brusque disconnected sentences i needed no more i saw it all going on as though i were myself inside that other sleeping suit  it happened while we were setting a reefed foresail at dusk reefed foresail you understand the sort of weather the only sail we had left to keep the ship running so you may guess what it had been like for days anxious sort of job that he gave me some of his cursed insolence at the sheet i tell you i was overdone with this terrific weather that seemed to have no end to it terrific i tell youand a deep ship i believe the fellow himself was half crazed with funk it was no time for gentlemanly reproof so i turned round and felled him like an ox he up and at me we closed just as an awful sea made for the ship all hands saw it coming and took to the rigging but i had him by the throat and went on shaking him like a rat the men above us yelling look out look out then a crash as if the sky had fallen on my head they say that for over ten minutes hardly anything was to be seen of the shipjust the three masts and a bit of the forecastle head and of the poop all awash driving along in a smother of foam it was a miracle that they found us jammed together behind the forebitts its clear that i meant business because i was holding him by the throat still when they picked us up he was black in the face it was too much for them it seems they rushed us aft together gripped as we were screaming murder like a lot of lunatics and broke into the cuddy and the ship running for her life touch and go all the time any minute her last in a sea fit to turn your hair gray only alooking at it i understand that the skipper too started raving like the rest of them the man had been deprived of sleep for more than a week and to have this sprung on him at the height of a furious gale nearly drove him out of his mind i wonder they didnt fling me overboard after getting the carcass of their precious shipmate out of my fingers they had rather a job to separate us ive been told a sufficiently fierce story to make an old judge and a respectable jury sit up a bit the first thing i heard when i came to myself was the maddening howling of that endless gale and on that the voice of the old man he was hanging on to my bunk staring into my face out of his souwester  mr leggatt you have killed a man you can act no longer as chief mate of this ship  his care to subdue his voice made it sound monotonous he rested a hand on the end of the skylight to steady himself with and all that time did not stir a limb so far as i could see nice little tale for a quiet tea party he concluded in the same tone  one of my hands too rested on the end of the skylight neither did i stir a limb so far as i knew we stood less than a foot from each other it occurred to me that if old bless my soulyou dont say so were to put his head up the companion and catch sight of us he would think he was seeing double or imagine himself come upon a scene of weird witchcraft the strange captain having a quiet confabulation by the wheel with his own gray ghost i became very much concerned to prevent anything of the sort i heard the others soothing undertone  my fathers a parson in norfolk it said evidently he had forgotten he had told me this important fact before truly a nice little tale  you had better slip down into my stateroom now i said moving off stealthily my double followed my movements our bare feet made no sound i let him in closed the door with care and after giving a call to the second mate returned on deck for my relief  not much sign of any wind yet i remarked when he approached  no sir not much he assented sleepily in his hoarse voice with just enough deference no more and barely suppressing a yawn  well thats all you have to look out for you have got your orders  yes sir  i paced a turn or two on the poop and saw him take up his position face forward with his elbow in the ratlines of the mizzen rigging before i went below the mates faint snoring was still going on peacefully the cuddy lamp was burning over the table on which stood a vase with flowers a polite attention from the ships provision merchantthe last flowers we should see for the next three months at the very least two bunches of bananas hung from the beam symmetrically one on each side of the rudder casing everything was as before in the shipexcept that two of her captains sleeping suits were simultaneously in use one motionless in the cuddy the other keeping very still in the captains stateroom  it must be explained here that my cabin had the form of the capital letter l the door being within the angle and opening into the short part of the letter a couch was to the left the bed place to the right my writing desk and the chronometers table faced the door but anyone opening it unless he stepped right inside had no view of what i call the long or vertical part of the letter it contained some lockers surmounted by a bookcase and a few clothes a thick jacket or two caps oilskin coat and such like hung on hooks there was at the bottom of that part a door opening into my bathroom which could be entered also directly from the saloon but that way was never used  the mysterious arrival had discovered the advantage of this particular shape entering my room lighted strongly by a big bulkhead lamp swung on gimbals above my writing desk i did not see him anywhere till he stepped out quietly from behind the coats hung in the recessed part  i heard somebody moving about and went in there at once he whispered  i too spoke under my breath  nobody is likely to come in here without knocking and getting permission  he nodded his face was thin and the sunburn faded as though he had been ill and no wonder he had been i heard presently kept under arrest in his cabin for nearly seven weeks but there was nothing sickly in his eyes or in his expression he was not a bit like me really yet as we stood leaning over my bed place whispering side by side with our dark heads together and our backs to the door anybody bold enough to open it stealthily would have been treated to the uncanny sight of a double captain busy talking in whispers with his other self  but all this doesnt tell me how you came to hang on to our side ladder i inquired in the hardly audible murmurs we used after he had told me something more of the proceedings on board the sephora once the bad weather was over  when we sighted java head i had had time to think all those matters out several times over i had six weeks of doing nothing else and with only an hour or so every evening for a tramp on the quarterdeck  he whispered his arms folded on the side of my bed place staring through the open port and i could imagine perfectly the manner of this thinking outa stubborn if not a steadfast operation something of which i should have been perfectly incapable  i reckoned it would be dark before we closed with the land he continued so low that i had to strain my hearing near as we were to each other shoulder touching shoulder almost so i asked to speak to the old man he always seemed very sick when he came to see meas if he could not look me in the face you know that foresail saved the ship she was too deep to have run long under bare poles and it was i that managed to set it for him anyway he came when i had him in my cabinhe stood by the door looking at me as if i had the halter round my neck alreadyi asked him right away to leave my cabin door unlocked at night while the ship was going through sunda straits there would be the java coast within two or three miles off angier point i wanted nothing more ive had a prize for swimming my second year in the conway  i can believe it i breathed out  god only knows why they locked me in every night to see some of their faces youd have thought they were afraid id go about at night strangling people am i a murdering brute do i look it by jove if i had been he wouldnt have trusted himself like that into my room youll say i might have chucked him aside and bolted out there and thenit was dark already well no and for the same reason i wouldnt think of trying to smash the door there would have been a rush to stop me at the noise and i did not mean to get into a confounded scrimmage somebody else might have got killedfor i would not have broken out only to get chucked back and i did not want any more of that work he refused looking more sick than ever he was afraid of the men and also of that old second mate of his who had been sailing with him for yearsa grayheaded old humbug and his steward too had been with him devil knows how longseventeen years or morea dogmatic sort of loafer who hated me like poison just because i was the chief mate no chief mate ever made more than one voyage in the sephora you know those two old chaps ran the ship devil only knows what the skipper wasnt afraid of all his nerve went to pieces altogether in that hellish spell of bad weather we hadof what the law would do to himof his wife perhaps oh yes shes on board though i dont think she would have meddled she would have been only too glad to have me out of the ship in any way the brand of cain business dont you see thats all right i was ready enough to go off wandering on the face of the earthand that was price enough to pay for an abel of that sort anyhow he wouldnt listen to me this thing must take its course i represent the law here he was shaking like a leaf so you wont no then i hope you will be able to sleep on that i said and turned my back on him i wonder that you can cries he and locks the door  well after that i couldnt not very well that was three weeks ago we have had a slow passage through the java sea drifted about carimata for ten days when we anchored here they thought i suppose it was all right the nearest land and thats five miles is the ships destination the consul would soon set about catching me and there would have been no object in holding to these islets there i dont suppose theres a drop of water on them i dont know how it was but tonight that steward after bringing me my supper went out to let me eat it and left the door unlocked and i ate itall there was too after i had finished i strolled out on the quarterdeck i dont know that i meant to do anything a breath of fresh air was all i wanted i believe then a sudden temptation came over me i kicked off my slippers and was in the water before i had made up my mind fairly somebody heard the splash and they raised an awful hullabaloo hes gone lower the boats hes committed suicide no hes swimming certainly i was swimming its not so easy for a swimmer like me to commit suicide by drowning i landed on the nearest islet before the boat left the ships side i heard them pulling about in the dark hailing and so on but after a bit they gave up everything quieted down and the anchorage became still as death i sat down on a stone and began to think i felt certain they would start searching for me at daylight there was no place to hide on those stony thingsand if there had been what would have been the good but now i was clear of that ship i was not going back so after a while i took off all my clothes tied them up in a bundle with a stone inside and dropped them in the deep water on the outer side of that islet that was suicide enough for me let them think what they liked but i didnt mean to drown myself i meant to swim till i sankbut thats not the same thing i struck out for another of these little islands and it was from that one that i first saw your riding light something to swim for i went on easily and on the way i came upon a flat rock a foot or two above water in the daytime i dare say you might make it out with a glass from your poop i scrambled up on it and rested myself for a bit then i made another start that last spell must have been over a mile  his whisper was getting fainter and fainter and all the time he stared straight out through the porthole in which there was not even a star to be seen i had not interrupted him there was something that made comment impossible in his narrative or perhaps in himself a sort of feeling a quality which i cant find a name for and when he ceased all i found was a futile whisper so you swam for our light  yesstraight for it it was something to swim for i couldnt see any stars low down because the coast was in the way and i couldnt see the land either the water was like glass one might have been swimming in a confounded thousandfeet deep cistern with no place for scrambling out anywhere but what i didnt like was the notion of swimming round and round like a crazed bullock before i gave out and as i didnt mean to go back no do you see me being hauled back stark naked off one of these little islands by the scruff of the neck and fighting like a wild beast somebody would have got killed for certain and i did not want any of that so i went on then your ladder  why didnt you hail the ship i asked a little louder  he touched my shoulder lightly lazy footsteps came right over our heads and stopped the second mate had crossed from the other side of the poop and might have been hanging over the rail for all we knew  he couldnt hear us talkingcould he my double breathed into my very ear anxiously  his anxiety was in answer a sufficient answer to the question i had put to him an answer containing all the difficulty of that situation i closed the porthole quietly to make sure a louder word might have been overheard  whos that he whispered then  my second mate but i dont know much more of the fellow than you do  and i told him a little about myself i had been appointed to take charge while i least expected anything of the sort not quite a fortnight ago i didnt know either the ship or the people hadnt had the time in port to look about me or size anybody up and as to the crew all they knew was that i was appointed to take the ship home for the rest i was almost as much of a stranger on board as himself i said and at the moment i felt it most acutely i felt that it would take very little to make me a suspect person in the eyes of the ships company  he had turned about meantime and we the two strangers in the ship faced each other in identical attitudes  your ladder he murmured after a silence whod have thought of finding a ladder hanging over at night in a ship anchored out here i felt just then a very unpleasant faintness after the life ive been leading for nine weeks anybody would have got out of condition i wasnt capable of swimming round as far as your rudder chains and lo and behold there was a ladder to get hold of after i gripped it i said to myself whats the good when i saw a mans head looking over i thought i would swim away presently and leave him shoutingin whatever language it was i didnt mind being looked at ii liked it and then you speaking to me so quietlyas if you had expected memade me hold on a little longer it had been a confounded lonely timei dont mean while swimming i was glad to talk a little to somebody that didnt belong to the sephora as to asking for the captain that was a mere impulse it could have been no use with all the ship knowing about me and the other people pretty certain to be round here in the morning i dont knowi wanted to be seen to talk with somebody before i went on i dont know what i would have said fine night isnt it or something of the sort  do you think they will be round here presently i asked with some incredulity  quite likely he said faintly  he looked extremely haggard all of a sudden his head rolled on his shoulders  hm we shall see then meantime get into that bed i whispered want help there  it was a rather high bed place with a set of drawers underneath this amazing swimmer really needed the lift i gave him by seizing his leg he tumbled in rolled over on his back and flung one arm across his eyes and then with his face nearly hidden he must have looked exactly as i used to look in that bed i gazed upon my other self for a while before drawing across carefully the two green serge curtains which ran on a brass rod i thought for a moment of pinning them together for greater safety but i sat down on the couch and once there i felt unwilling to rise and hunt for a pin i would do it in a moment i was extremely tired in a peculiarly intimate way by the strain of stealthiness by the effort of whispering and the general secrecy of this excitement it was three oclock by now and i had been on my feet since nine but i was not sleepy i could not have gone to sleep i sat there fagged out looking at the curtains trying to clear my mind of the confused sensation of being in two places at once and greatly bothered by an exasperating knocking in my head it was a relief to discover suddenly that it was not in my head at all but on the outside of the door before i could collect myself the words come in were out of my mouth and the steward entered with a tray bringing in my morning coffee i had slept after all and i was so frightened that i shouted this way i am here steward as though he had been miles away he put down the tray on the table next the couch and only then said very quietly i can see you are here sir i felt him give me a keen look but i dared not meet his eyes just then he must have wondered why i had drawn the curtains of my bed before going to sleep on the couch he went out hooking the door open as usual  i heard the crew washing decks above me i knew i would have been told at once if there had been any wind calm i thought and i was doubly vexed indeed i felt dual more than ever the steward reappeared suddenly in the doorway i jumped up from the couch so quickly that he gave a start  what do you want here  close your port sirthey are washing decks  it is closed i said reddening  very well sir but he did not move from the doorway and returned my stare in an extraordinary equivocal manner for a time then his eyes wavered all his expression changed and in a voice unusually gentle almost coaxingly  may i come in to take the empty cup away sir  of course i turned my back on him while he popped in and out then i unhooked and closed the door and even pushed the bolt this sort of thing could not go on very long the cabin was as hot as an oven too i took a peep at my double and discovered that he had not moved his arm was still over his eyes but his chest heaved his hair was wet his chin glistened with perspiration i reached over him and opened the port  i must show myself on deck i reflected  of course theoretically i could do what i liked with no one to say nay to me within the whole circle of the horizon but to lock my cabin door and take the key away i did not dare directly i put my head out of the companion i saw the group of my two officers the second mate barefooted the chief mate in long indiarubber boots near the break of the poop and the steward halfway down the poop ladder talking to them eagerly he happened to catch sight of me and dived the second ran down on the maindeck shouting some order or other and the chief mate came to meet me touching his cap  there was a sort of curiosity in his eye that i did not like i dont know whether the steward had told them that i was queer only or downright drunk but i know the man meant to have a good look at me i watched him coming with a smile which as he got into pointblank range took effect and froze his very whiskers i did not give him time to open his lips  square the yards by lifts and braces before the hands go to breakfast  it was the first particular order i had given on board that ship and i stayed on deck to see it executed too i had felt the need of asserting myself without loss of time that sneering young cub got taken down a peg or two on that occasion and i also seized the opportunity of having a good look at the face of every foremast man as they filed past me to go to the after braces at breakfast time eating nothing myself i presided with such frigid dignity that the two mates were only too glad to escape from the cabin as soon as decency permitted and all the time the dual working of my mind distracted me almost to the point of insanity i was constantly watching myself my secret self as dependent on my actions as my own personality sleeping in that bed behind that door which faced me as i sat at the head of the table it was very much like being mad only it was worse because one was aware of it  i had to shake him for a solid minute but when at last he opened his eyes it was in the full possession of his senses with an inquiring look  alls well so far i whispered now you must vanish into the bathroom  he did so as noiseless as a ghost and then i rang for the steward and facing him boldly directed him to tidy up my stateroom while i was having my bathand be quick about it as my tone admitted of no excuses he said yes sir and ran off to fetch his dustpan and brushes i took a bath and did most of my dressing splashing and whistling softly for the stewards edification while the secret sharer of my life stood drawn up bolt upright in that little space his face looking very sunken in daylight his eyelids lowered under the stern dark line of his eyebrows drawn together by a slight frown  when i left him there to go back to my room the steward was finishing dusting i sent for the mate and engaged him in some insignificant conversation it was as it were trifling with the terrific character of his whiskers but my object was to give him an opportunity for a good look at my cabin and then i could at last shut with a clear conscience the door of my stateroom and get my double back into the recessed part there was nothing else for it he had to sit still on a small folding stool half smothered by the heavy coats hanging there we listened to the steward going into the bathroom out of the saloon filling the water bottles there scrubbing the bath setting things to rights whisk bang clatterout again into the saloonturn the keyclick such was my scheme for keeping my second self invisible nothing better could be contrived under the circumstances and there we sat i at my writing desk ready to appear busy with some papers he behind me out of sight of the door it would not have been prudent to talk in daytime and i could not have stood the excitement of that queer sense of whispering to myself now and then glancing over my shoulder i saw him far back there sitting rigidly on the low stool his bare feet close together his arms folded his head hanging on his breastand perfectly still anybody would have taken him for me  i was fascinated by it myself every moment i had to glance over my shoulder i was looking at him when a voice outside the door said  beg pardon sir  well i kept my eyes on him and so when the voice outside the door announced theres a ships boat coming our way sir i saw him give a startthe first movement he had made for hours but he did not raise his bowed head  all right get the ladder over  i hesitated should i whisper something to him but what his immobility seemed to have been never disturbed what could i tell him he did not know already finally i went on deck     ii  the skipper of the sephora had a thin red whisker all round his face and the sort of complexion that goes with hair of that color also the particular rather smeary shade of blue in the eyes he was not exactly a showy figure his shoulders were high his stature but middlingone leg slightly more bandy than the other he shook hands looking vaguely around a spiritless tenacity was his main characteristic i judged i behaved with a politeness which seemed to disconcert him perhaps he was shy he mumbled to me as if he were ashamed of what he was saying gave his name it was something like archboldbut at this distance of years i hardly am sure his ships name and a few other particulars of that sort in the manner of a criminal making a reluctant and doleful confession he had had terrible weather on the passage outterribleterriblewife aboard too  by this time we were seated in the cabin and the steward brought in a tray with a bottle and glasses thanks no never took liquor would have some water though he drank two tumblerfuls terrible thirsty work ever since daylight had been exploring the islands round his ship  what was that forfun i asked with an appearance of polite interest  no he sighed painful duty  as he persisted in his mumbling and i wanted my double to hear every word i hit upon the notion of informing him that i regretted to say i was hard of hearing  such a young man too he nodded keeping his smeary blue unintelligent eyes fastened upon me what was the cause of itsome disease he inquired without the least sympathy and as if he thought that if so id got no more than i deserved  yes disease i admitted in a cheerful tone which seemed to shock him but my point was gained because he had to raise his voice to give me his tale it is not worth while to record his version it was just over two months since all this had happened and he had thought so much about it that he seemed completely muddled as to its bearings but still immensely impressed  what would you think of such a thing happening on board your own ship ive had the sephora for these fifteen years i am a wellknown shipmaster  he was densely distressedand perhaps i should have sympathized with him if i had been able to detach my mental vision from the unsuspected sharer of my cabin as though he were my second self there he was on the other side of the bulkhead four or five feet from us no more as we sat in the saloon i looked politely at captain archbold if that was his name but it was the other i saw in a gray sleeping suit seated on a low stool his bare feet close together his arms folded and every word said between us falling into the ears of his dark head bowed on his chest  i have been at sea now man and boy for sevenandthirty years and ive never heard of such a thing happening in an english ship and that it should be my ship wife on board too  i was hardly listening to him  dont you think i said that the heavy sea which you told me came aboard just then might have killed the man i have seen the sheer weight of a sea kill a man very neatly by simply breaking his neck  good god he uttered impressively fixing his smeary blue eyes on me the sea no man killed by the sea ever looked like that he seemed positively scandalized at my suggestion and as i gazed at him certainly not prepared for anything original on his part he advanced his head close to mine and thrust his tongue out at me so suddenly that i couldnt help starting back  after scoring over my calmness in this graphic way he nodded wisely if i had seen the sight he assured me i would never forget it as long as i lived the weather was too bad to give the corpse a proper sea burial so next day at dawn they took it up on the poop covering its face with a bit of bunting he read a short prayer and then just as it was in its oilskins and long boots they launched it amongst those mountainous seas that seemed ready every moment to swallow up the ship herself and the terrified lives on board of her  that reefed foresail saved you i threw in  under godit did he exclaimed fervently it was by a special mercy i firmly believe that it stood some of those hurricane squalls  it was the setting of that sail which i began  gods own hand in it he interrupted me nothing less could have done it i dont mind telling you that i hardly dared give the order it seemed impossible that we could touch anything without losing it and then our last hope would have been gone  the terror of that gale was on him yet i let him go on for a bit then said casuallyas if returning to a minor subject  you were very anxious to give up your mate to the shore people i believe  he was to the law his obscure tenacity on that point had in it something incomprehensible and a little awful something as it were mystical quite apart from his anxiety that he should not be suspected of countenancing any doings of that sort sevenandthirty virtuous years at sea of which over twenty of immaculate command and the last fifteen in the sephora seemed to have laid him under some pitiless obligation  and you know he went on groping shamefacedly amongst his feelings i did not engage that young fellow his people had some interest with my owners i was in a way forced to take him on he looked very smart very gentlemanly and all that but do you knowi never liked him somehow i am a plain man you see he wasnt exactly the sort for the chief mate of a ship like the sephora  i had become so connected in thoughts and impressions with the secret sharer of my cabin that i felt as if i personally were being given to understand that i too was not the sort that would have done for the chief mate of a ship like the sephora i had no doubt of it in my mind  not at all the style of man you understand he insisted superfluously looking hard at me  i smiled urbanely he seemed at a loss for a while  i suppose i must report a suicide  beg pardon  suicide thats what ill have to write to my owners directly i get in  unless you manage to recover him before tomorrow i assented dispassionately i mean alive  he mumbled something which i really did not catch and i turned my ear to him in a puzzled manner he fairly bawled  the landi say the mainland is at least seven miles off my anchorage  about that  my lack of excitement of curiosity of surprise of any sort of pronounced interest began to arouse his distrust but except for the felicitous pretense of deafness i had not tried to pretend anything i had felt utterly incapable of playing the part of ignorance properly and therefore was afraid to try it is also certain that he had brought some readymade suspicions with him and that he viewed my politeness as a strange and unnatural phenomenon and yet how else could i have received him not heartily that was impossible for psychological reasons which i need not state here my only object was to keep off his inquiries surlily yes but surliness might have provoked a pointblank question from its novelty to him and from its nature punctilious courtesy was the manner best calculated to restrain the man but there was the danger of his breaking through my defense bluntly i could not i think have met him by a direct lie also for psychological not moral reasons if he had only known how afraid i was of his putting my feeling of identity with the other to the test but strangely enoughi thought of it only afterwardsi believe that he was not a little disconcerted by the reverse side of that weird situation by something in me that reminded him of the man he was seekingsuggested a mysterious similitude to the young fellow he had distrusted and disliked from the first  however that might have been the silence was not very prolonged he took another oblique step  i reckon i had no more than a twomile pull to your ship not a bit more  and quite enough too in this awful heat i said  another pause full of mistrust followed necessity they say is mother of invention but fear too is not barren of ingenious suggestions and i was afraid he would ask me pointblank for news of my other self  nice little saloon isnt it i remarked as if noticing for the first time the way his eyes roamed from one closed door to the other and very well fitted out too here for instance i continued reaching over the back of my seat negligently and flinging the door open is my bathroom  he made an eager movement but hardly gave it a glance i got up shut the door of the bathroom and invited him to have a look round as if i were very proud of my accommodation he had to rise and be shown round but he went through the business without any raptures whatever  and now well have a look at my stateroom i declared in a voice as loud as i dared to make it crossing the cabin to the starboard side with purposely heavy steps  he followed me in and gazed around my intelligent double had vanished i played my part  very convenientisnt it  very nice very comf he didnt finish and went out brusquely as if to escape from some unrighteous wiles of mine but it was not to be i had been too frightened not to feel vengeful i felt i had him on the run and i meant to keep him on the run my polite insistence must have had something menacing in it because he gave in suddenly and i did not let him off a single item mates room pantry storerooms the very sail locker which was also under the poophe had to look into them all when at last i showed him out on the quarterdeck he drew a long spiritless sigh and mumbled dismally that he must really be going back to his ship now i desired my mate who had joined us to see to the captains boat  the man of whiskers gave a blast on the whistle which he used to wear hanging round his neck and yelled sephoras away my double down there in my cabin must have heard and certainly could not feel more relieved than i four fellows came running out from somewhere forward and went over the side while my own men appearing on deck too lined the rail i escorted my visitor to the gangway ceremoniously and nearly overdid it he was a tenacious beast on the very ladder he lingered and in that unique guiltily conscientious manner of sticking to the point  i say you you dont think that  i covered his voice loudly  certainly not i am delighted goodby  i had an idea of what he meant to say and just saved myself by the privilege of defective hearing he was too shaken generally to insist but my mate close witness of that parting looked mystified and his face took on a thoughtful cast as i did not want to appear as if i wished to avoid all communication with my officers he had the opportunity to address me  seems a very nice man his boats crew told our chaps a very extraordinary story if what i am told by the steward is true i suppose you had it from the captain sir  yes i had a story from the captain  a very horrible affairisnt it sir  it is  beats all these tales we hear about murders in yankee ships  i dont think it beats them i dont think it resembles them in the least  bless my soulyou dont say so but of course ive no acquaintance whatever with american ships not i so i couldnt go against your knowledge its horrible enough for me but the queerest part is that those fellows seemed to have some idea the man was hidden aboard here they had really did you ever hear of such a thing  preposterousisnt it  we were walking to and fro athwart the quarterdeck no one of the crew forward could be seen the day was sunday and the mate pursued  there was some little dispute about it our chaps took offense as if we would harbor a thing like that they said wouldnt you like to look for him in our coalhole quite a tiff but they made it up in the end i suppose he did drown himself dont you sir  i dont suppose anything  you have no doubt in the matter sir  none whatever  i left him suddenly i felt i was producing a bad impression but with my double down there it was most trying to be on deck and it was almost as trying to be below altogether a nervetrying situation but on the whole i felt less torn in two when i was with him there was no one in the whole ship whom i dared take into my confidence since the hands had got to know his story it would have been impossible to pass him off for anyone else and an accidental discovery was to be dreaded now more than ever  the steward being engaged in laying the table for dinner we could talk only with our eyes when i first went down later in the afternoon we had a cautious try at whispering the sunday quietness of the ship was against us the stillness of air and water around her was against us the elements the men were against useverything was against us in our secret partnership time itselffor this could not go on forever the very trust in providence was i suppose denied to his guilt shall i confess that this thought cast me down very much and as to the chapter of accidents which counts for so much in the book of success i could only hope that it was closed for what favorable accident could be expected  did you hear everything were my first words as soon as we took up our position side by side leaning over my bed place  he had and the proof of it was his earnest whisper the man told you he hardly dared to give the order  i understood the reference to be to that saving foresail  yes he was afraid of it being lost in the setting  i assure you he never gave the order he may think he did but he never gave it he stood there with me on the break of the poop after the main topsail blew away and whimpered about our last hopepositively whimpered about it and nothing elseand the night coming on to hear ones skipper go on like that in such weather was enough to drive any fellow out of his mind it worked me up into a sort of desperation i just took it into my own hands and went away from him boiling andbut whats the use telling you you know do you think that if i had not been pretty fierce with them i should have got the men to do anything not i the bosn perhaps perhaps it wasnt a heavy seait was a sea gone mad i suppose the end of the world will be something like that and a man may have the heart to see it coming once and be done with itbut to have to face it day after dayi dont blame anybody i was precious little better than the rest onlyi was an officer of that old coal wagon anyhow  i quite understand i conveyed that sincere assurance into his ear he was out of breath with whispering i could hear him pant slightly it was all very simple the same strungup force which had given twentyfour men a chance at least for their lives had in a sort of recoil crushed an unworthy mutinous existence  but i had no leisure to weigh the merits of the matterfootsteps in the saloon a heavy knock theres enough wind to get under way with sir here was the call of a new claim upon my thoughts and even upon my feelings  turn the hands up i cried through the door ill be on deck directly  i was going out to make the acquaintance of my ship before i left the cabin our eyes metthe eyes of the only two strangers on board i pointed to the recessed part where the little campstool awaited him and laid my finger on my lips he made a gesturesomewhat vaguea little mysterious accompanied by a faint smile as if of regret  this is not the place to enlarge upon the sensations of a man who feels for the first time a ship move under his feet to his own independent word in my case they were not unalloyed i was not wholly alone with my command for there was that stranger in my cabin or rather i was not completely and wholly with her part of me was absent that mental feeling of being in two places at once affected me physically as if the mood of secrecy had penetrated my very soul before an hour had elapsed since the ship had begun to move having occasion to ask the mate he stood by my side to take a compass bearing of the pagoda i caught myself reaching up to his ear in whispers i say i caught myself but enough had escaped to startle the man i cant describe it otherwise than by saying that he shied a grave preoccupied manner as though he were in possession of some perplexing intelligence did not leave him henceforth a little later i moved away from the rail to look at the compass with such a stealthy gait that the helmsman noticed itand i could not help noticing the unusual roundness of his eyes these are trifling instances though its to no commanders advantage to be suspected of ludicrous eccentricities but i was also more seriously affected there are to a seaman certain words gestures that should in given conditions come as naturally as instinctively as the winking of a menaced eye a certain order should spring on to his lips without thinking a certain sign should get itself made so to speak without reflection but all unconscious alertness had abandoned me i had to make an effort of will to recall myself back from the cabin to the conditions of the moment i felt that i was appearing an irresolute commander to those people who were watching me more or less critically  and besides there were the scares on the second day out for instance coming off the deck in the afternoon i had straw slippers on my bare feet i stopped at the open pantry door and spoke to the steward he was doing something there with his back to me at the sound of my voice he nearly jumped out of his skin as the saying is and incidentally broke a cup  what on earths the matter with you i asked astonished  he was extremely confused beg your pardon sir i made sure you were in your cabin  you see i wasnt  no sir i could have sworn i had heard you moving in there not a moment ago its most extraordinary very sorry sir  i passed on with an inward shudder i was so identified with my secret double that i did not even mention the fact in those scanty fearful whispers we exchanged i suppose he had made some slight noise of some kind or other it would have been miraculous if he hadnt at one time or another and yet haggard as he appeared he looked always perfectly selfcontrolled more than calmalmost invulnerable on my suggestion he remained almost entirely in the bathroom which upon the whole was the safest place there could be really no shadow of an excuse for anyone ever wanting to go in there once the steward had done with it it was a very tiny place sometimes he reclined on the floor his legs bent his head sustained on one elbow at others i would find him on the campstool sitting in his gray sleeping suit and with his cropped dark hair like a patient unmoved convict at night i would smuggle him into my bed place and we would whisper together with the regular footfalls of the officer of the watch passing and repassing over our heads it was an infinitely miserable time it was lucky that some tins of fine preserves were stowed in a locker in my stateroom hard bread i could always get hold of and so he lived on stewed chicken pate de foie gras asparagus cooked oysters sardineson all sorts of abominable sham delicacies out of tins my earlymorning coffee he always drank and it was all i dared do for him in that respect  every day there was the horrible maneuvering to go through so that my room and then the bathroom should be done in the usual way i came to hate the sight of the steward to abhor the voice of that harmless man i felt that it was he who would bring on the disaster of discovery it hung like a sword over our heads  the fourth day out i think we were then working down the east side of the gulf of siam tack for tack in light winds and smooth waterthe fourth day i say of this miserable juggling with the unavoidable as we sat at our evening meal that man whose slightest movement i dreaded after putting down the dishes ran up on deck busily this could not be dangerous presently he came down again and then it appeared that he had remembered a coat of mine which i had thrown over a rail to dry after having been wetted in a shower which had passed over the ship in the afternoon sitting stolidly at the head of the table i became terrified at the sight of the garment on his arm of course he made for my door there was no time to lose  steward i thundered my nerves were so shaken that i could not govern my voice and conceal my agitation this was the sort of thing that made my terrifically whiskered mate tap his forehead with his forefinger i had detected him using that gesture while talking on deck with a confidential air to the carpenter it was too far to hear a word but i had no doubt that this pantomime could only refer to the strange new captain  yes sir the palefaced steward turned resignedly to me it was this maddening course of being shouted at checked without rhyme or reason arbitrarily chased out of my cabin suddenly called into it sent flying out of his pantry on incomprehensible errands that accounted for the growing wretchedness of his expression  where are you going with that coat  to your room sir  is there another shower coming  im sure i dont know sir shall i go up again and see sir  no never mind  my object was attained as of course my other self in there would have heard everything that passed during this interlude my two officers never raised their eyes off their respective plates but the lip of that confounded cub the second mate quivered visibly  i expected the steward to hook my coat on and come out at once he was very slow about it but i dominated my nervousness sufficiently not to shout after him suddenly i became aware it could be heard plainly enough that the fellow for some reason or other was opening the door of the bathroom it was the end the place was literally not big enough to swing a cat in my voice died in my throat and i went stony all over i expected to hear a yell of surprise and terror and made a movement but had not the strength to get on my legs everything remained still had my second self taken the poor wretch by the throat i dont know what i could have done next moment if i had not seen the steward come out of my room close the door and then stand quietly by the sideboard  saved i thought but no lost gone he was gone  i laid my knife and fork down and leaned back in my chair my head swam after a while when sufficiently recovered to speak in a steady voice i instructed my mate to put the ship round at eight oclock himself  i wont come on deck i went on i think ill turn in and unless the wind shifts i dont want to be disturbed before midnight i feel a bit seedy  you did look middling bad a little while ago the chief mate remarked without showing any great concern  they both went out and i stared at the steward clearing the table there was nothing to be read on that wretched mans face but why did he avoid my eyes i asked myself then i thought i should like to hear the sound of his voice  steward  sir startled as usual  where did you hang up that coat  in the bathroom sir the usual anxious tone its not quite dry yet sir  for some time longer i sat in the cuddy had my double vanished as he had come but of his coming there was an explanation whereas his disappearance would be inexplicable i went slowly into my dark room shut the door lighted the lamp and for a time dared not turn round when at last i did i saw him standing boltupright in the narrow recessed part it would not be true to say i had a shock but an irresistible doubt of his bodily existence flitted through my mind can it be i asked myself that he is not visible to other eyes than mine it was like being haunted motionless with a grave face he raised his hands slightly at me in a gesture which meant clearly heavens what a narrow escape narrow indeed i think i had come creeping quietly as near insanity as any man who has not actually gone over the border that gesture restrained me so to speak  the mate with the terrific whiskers was now putting the ship on the other tack in the moment of profound silence which follows upon the hands going to their stations i heard on the poop his raised voice hard alee and the distant shout of the order repeated on the maindeck the sails in that light breeze made but a faint fluttering noise it ceased the ship was coming round slowly i held my breath in the renewed stillness of expectation one wouldnt have thought that there was a single living soul on her decks a sudden brisk shout mainsail haul broke the spell and in the noisy cries and rush overhead of the men running away with the main brace we two down in my cabin came together in our usual position by the bed place  he did not wait for my question i heard him fumbling here and just managed to squat myself down in the bath he whispered to me the fellow only opened the door and put his arm in to hang the coat up all the same  i never thought of that i whispered back even more appalled than before at the closeness of the shave and marveling at that something unyielding in his character which was carrying him through so finely there was no agitation in his whisper whoever was being driven distracted it was not he he was sane and the proof of his sanity was continued when he took up the whispering again  it would never do for me to come to life again  it was something that a ghost might have said but what he was alluding to was his old captains reluctant admission of the theory of suicide it would obviously serve his turnif i had understood at all the view which seemed to govern the unalterable purpose of his action  you must maroon me as soon as ever you can get amongst these islands off the cambodge shore he went on  maroon you we are not living in a boys adventure tale i protested his scornful whispering took me up  we arent indeed theres nothing of a boys tale in this but theres nothing else for it i want no more you dont suppose i am afraid of what can be done to me prison or gallows or whatever they may please but you dont see me coming back to explain such things to an old fellow in a wig and twelve respectable tradesmen do you what can they know whether i am guilty or notor of what i am guilty either thats my affair what does the bible say driven off the face of the earth very well i am off the face of the earth now as i came at night so i shall go  impossible i murmured you cant  cant not naked like a soul on the day of judgment i shall freeze on to this sleeping suit the last day is not yetand you have understood thoroughly didnt you  i felt suddenly ashamed of myself i may say truly that i understoodand my hesitation in letting that man swim away from my ships side had been a mere sham sentiment a sort of cowardice  it cant be done now till next night i breathed out the ship is on the offshore tack and the wind may fail us  as long as i know that you understand he whispered but of course you do its a great satisfaction to have got somebody to understand you seem to have been there on purpose and in the same whisper as if we two whenever we talked had to say things to each other which were not fit for the world to hear he added its very wonderful  we remained side by side talking in our secret waybut sometimes silent or just exchanging a whispered word or two at long intervals and as usual he stared through the port a breath of wind came now and again into our faces the ship might have been moored in dock so gently and on an even keel she slipped through the water that did not murmur even at our passage shadowy and silent like a phantom sea  at midnight i went on deck and to my mates great surprise put the ship round on the other tack his terrible whiskers flitted round me in silent criticism i certainly should not have done it if it had been only a question of getting out of that sleepy gulf as quickly as possible i believe he told the second mate who relieved him that it was a great want of judgment the other only yawned that intolerable cub shuffled about so sleepily and lolled against the rails in such a slack improper fashion that i came down on him sharply  arent you properly awake yet  yes sir i am awake  well then be good enough to hold yourself as if you were and keep a lookout if theres any current well be closing with some islands before daylight  the east side of the gulf is fringed with islands some solitary others in groups on the blue background of the high coast they seem to float on silvery patches of calm water arid and gray or dark green and rounded like clumps of evergreen bushes with the larger ones a mile or two long showing the outlines of ridges ribs of gray rock under the dark mantle of matted leafage unknown to trade to travel almost to geography the manner of life they harbor is an unsolved secret there must be villagessettlements of fishermen at leaston the largest of them and some communication with the world is probably kept up by native craft but all that forenoon as we headed for them fanned along by the faintest of breezes i saw no sign of man or canoe in the field of the telescope i kept on pointing at the scattered group  at noon i gave no orders for a change of course and the mates whiskers became much concerned and seemed to be offering themselves unduly to my notice at last i said  i am going to stand right in quite inas far as i can take her  the stare of extreme surprise imparted an air of ferocity also to his eyes and he looked truly terrific for a moment  were not doing well in the middle of the gulf i continued casually i am going to look for the land breezes tonight  bless my soul do you mean sir in the dark amongst the lot of all them islands and reefs and shoals  wellif there are any regular land breezes at all on this coast one must get close inshore to find them mustnt one  bless my soul he exclaimed again under his breath all that afternoon he wore a dreamy contemplative appearance which in him was a mark of perplexity after dinner i went into my stateroom as if i meant to take some rest there we two bent our dark heads over a halfunrolled chart lying on my bed  there i said its got to be kohring ive been looking at it ever since sunrise it has got two hills and a low point it must be inhabited and on the coast opposite there is what looks like the mouth of a biggish riverwith some towns no doubt not far up its the best chance for you that i can see  anything kohring let it be  he looked thoughtfully at the chart as if surveying chances and distances from a lofty heightand following with his eyes his own figure wandering on the blank land of cochinchina and then passing off that piece of paper clean out of sight into uncharted regions and it was as if the ship had two captains to plan her course for her i had been so worried and restless running up and down that i had not had the patience to dress that day i had remained in my sleeping suit with straw slippers and a soft floppy hat the closeness of the heat in the gulf had been most oppressive and the crew were used to seeing me wandering in that airy attire  she will clear the south point as she heads now i whispered into his ear goodness only knows when though but certainly after dark ill edge her in to half a mile as far as i may be able to judge in the dark  be careful he murmured warninglyand i realized suddenly that all my future the only future for which i was fit would perhaps go irretrievably to pieces in any mishap to my first command  i could not stop a moment longer in the room i motioned him to get out of sight and made my way on the poop that unplayful cub had the watch i walked up and down for a while thinking things out then beckoned him over  send a couple of hands to open the two quarterdeck ports i said mildly  he actually had the impudence or else so forgot himself in his wonder at such an incomprehensible order as to repeat  open the quarterdeck ports what for sir  the only reason you need concern yourself about is because i tell you to do so have them open wide and fastened properly  he reddened and went off but i believe made some jeering remark to the carpenter as to the sensible practice of ventilating a ships quarterdeck i know he popped into the mates cabin to impart the fact to him because the whiskers came on deck as it were by chance and stole glances at me from belowfor signs of lunacy or drunkenness i suppose  a little before supper feeling more restless than ever i rejoined for a moment my second self and to find him sitting so quietly was surprising like something against nature inhuman  i developed my plan in a hurried whisper  i shall stand in as close as i dare and then put her round i will presently find means to smuggle you out of here into the sail locker which communicates with the lobby but there is an opening a sort of square for hauling the sails out which gives straight on the quarterdeck and which is never closed in fine weather so as to give air to the sails when the ships way is deadened in stays and all the hands are aft at the main braces you will have a clear road to slip out and get overboard through the open quarterdeck port ive had them both fastened up use a ropes end to lower yourself into the water so as to avoid a splashyou know it could be heard and cause some beastly complication  he kept silent for a while then whispered i understand  i wont be there to see you go i began with an effort the rest  i only hope i have understood too  you have from first to lastand for the first time there seemed to be a faltering something strained in his whisper he caught hold of my arm but the ringing of the supper bell made me start he didnt though he only released his grip  after supper i didnt come below again till well past eight oclock the faint steady breeze was loaded with dew and the wet darkened sails held all there was of propelling power in it the night clear and starry sparkled darkly and the opaque lightless patches shifting slowly against the low stars were the drifting islets on the port bow there was a big one more distant and shadowily imposing by the great space of sky it eclipsed  on opening the door i had a back view of my very own self looking at a chart he had come out of the recess and was standing near the table  quite dark enough i whispered  he stepped back and leaned against my bed with a level quiet glance i sat on the couch we had nothing to say to each other over our heads the officer of the watch moved here and there then i heard him move quickly i knew what that meant he was making for the companion and presently his voice was outside my door  we are drawing in pretty fast sir land looks rather close  very well i answered i am coming on deck directly  i waited till he was gone out of the cuddy then rose my double moved too the time had come to exchange our last whispers for neither of us was ever to hear each others natural voice  look here i opened a drawer and took out three sovereigns take this anyhow ive got six and id give you the lot only i must keep a little money to buy some fruit and vegetables for the crew from native boats as we go through sunda straits  he shook his head  take it i urged him whispering desperately no one can tell what  he smiled and slapped meaningly the only pocket of the sleeping jacket it was not safe certainly but i produced a large old silk handkerchief of mine and tying the three pieces of gold in a corner pressed it on him he was touched i supposed because he took it at last and tied it quickly round his waist under the jacket on his bare skin  our eyes met several seconds elapsed till our glances still mingled i extended my hand and turned the lamp out then i passed through the cuddy leaving the door of my room wide open steward  he was still lingering in the pantry in the greatness of his zeal giving a rubup to a plated cruet stand the last thing before going to bed being careful not to wake up the mate whose room was opposite i spoke in an undertone  he looked round anxiously sir  can you get me a little hot water from the galley  i am afraid sir the galley fires been out for some time now  go and see  he flew up the stairs  now i whispered loudly into the saloontoo loudly perhaps but i was afraid i couldnt make a sound he was by my side in an instantthe double captain slipped past the stairsthrough a tiny dark passage  a sliding door we were in the sail locker scrambling on our knees over the sails a sudden thought struck me i saw myself wandering barefooted bareheaded the sun beating on my dark poll i snatched off my floppy hat and tried hurriedly in the dark to ram it on my other self he dodged and fended off silently i wonder what he thought had come to me before he understood and suddenly desisted our hands met gropingly lingered united in a steady motionless clasp for a second  no word was breathed by either of us when they separated  i was standing quietly by the pantry door when the steward returned  sorry sir kettle barely warm shall i light the spirit lamp  never mind  i came out on deck slowly it was now a matter of conscience to shave the land as close as possiblefor now he must go overboard whenever the ship was put in stays must there could be no going back for him after a moment i walked over to leeward and my heart flew into my mouth at the nearness of the land on the bow under any other circumstances i would not have held on a minute longer the second mate had followed me anxiously  i looked on till i felt i could command my voice  she will weather i said then in a quiet tone  are you going to try that sir he stammered out incredulously  i took no notice of him and raised my tone just enough to be heard by the helmsman  keep her good full  good full sir  the wind fanned my cheek the sails slept the world was silent the strain of watching the dark loom of the land grow bigger and denser was too much for me i had shut my eyesbecause the ship must go closer she must the stillness was intolerable were we standing still  when i opened my eyes the second view started my heart with a thump the black southern hill of kohring seemed to hang right over the ship like a towering fragment of everlasting night on that enormous mass of blackness there was not a gleam to be seen not a sound to be heard it was gliding irresistibly towards us and yet seemed already within reach of the hand i saw the vague figures of the watch grouped in the waist gazing in awed silence  are you going on sir inquired an unsteady voice at my elbow  i ignored it i had to go on  keep her full dont check her way that wont do now i said warningly  i cant see the sails very well the helmsman answered me in strange quavering tones  was she close enough already she was i wont say in the shadow of the land but in the very blackness of it already swallowed up as it were gone too close to be recalled gone from me altogether  give the mate a call i said to the young man who stood at my elbow as still as death and turn all hands up  my tone had a borrowed loudness reverberated from the height of the land several voices cried out together we are all on deck sir  then stillness again with the great shadow gliding closer towering higher without a light without a sound such a hush had fallen on the ship that she might have been a bark of the dead floating in slowly under the very gate of erebus  my god where are we  it was the mate moaning at my elbow he was thunderstruck and as it were deprived of the moral support of his whiskers he clapped his hands and absolutely cried out lost  be quiet i said sternly  he lowered his tone but i saw the shadowy gesture of his despair what are we doing here  looking for the land wind  he made as if to tear his hair and addressed me recklessly  she will never get out you have done it sir i knew itd end in something like this she will never weather and you are too close now to stay shell drift ashore before shes round oh my god  i caught his arm as he was raising it to batter his poor devoted head and shook it violently  shes ashore already he wailed trying to tear himself away  is she keep good full there  good full sir cried the helmsman in a frightened thin childlike voice  i hadnt let go the mates arm and went on shaking it ready about do you hear you go forwardshakeand stop thereshakeand hold your noiseshakeand see these headsheets properly overhauledshake shakeshake  and all the time i dared not look towards the land lest my heart should fail me i released my grip at last and he ran forward as if fleeing for dear life  i wondered what my double there in the sail locker thought of this commotion he was able to hear everythingand perhaps he was able to understand why on my conscience it had to be thus closeno less my first order hard alee reechoed ominously under the towering shadow of kohring as if i had shouted in a mountain gorge and then i watched the land intently in that smooth water and light wind it was impossible to feel the ship comingto no i could not feel her and my second self was making now ready to ship out and lower himself overboard perhaps he was gone already  the great black mass brooding over our very mastheads began to pivot away from the ships side silently and now i forgot the secret stranger ready to depart and remembered only that i was a total stranger to the ship i did not know her would she do it how was she to be handled  i swung the mainyard and waited helplessly she was perhaps stopped and her very fate hung in the balance with the black mass of kohring like the gate of the everlasting night towering over her taffrail what would she do now had she way on her yet i stepped to the side swiftly and on the shadowy water i could see nothing except a faint phosphorescent flash revealing the glassy smoothness of the sleeping surface it was impossible to telland i had not learned yet the feel of my ship was she moving what i needed was something easily seen a piece of paper which i could throw overboard and watch i had nothing on me to run down for it i didnt dare there was no time all at once my strained yearning stare distinguished a white object floating within a yard of the ships side white on the black water a phosphorescent flash passed under it what was that thing i recognized my own floppy hat it must have fallen off his head and he didnt bother now i had what i wantedthe saving mark for my eyes but i hardly thought of my other self now gone from the ship to be hidden forever from all friendly faces to be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth with no brand of the curse on his sane forehead to stay a slaying hand too proud to explain  and i watched the hatthe expression of my sudden pity for his mere flesh it had been meant to save his homeless head from the dangers of the sun and nowbeholdit was saving the ship by serving me for a mark to help out the ignorance of my strangeness ha it was drifting forward warning me just in time that the ship had gathered sternaway  shift the helm i said in a low voice to the seaman standing still like a statue  the mans eyes glistened wildly in the binnacle light as he jumped round to the other side and spun round the wheel  i walked to the break of the poop on the overshadowed deck all hands stood by the forebraces waiting for my order the stars ahead seemed to be gliding from right to left and all was so still in the world that i heard the quiet remark shes round passed in a tone of intense relief between two seamen  let go and haul  the foreyards ran round with a great noise amidst cheery cries and now the frightful whiskers made themselves heard giving various orders already the ship was drawing ahead and i was alone with her nothing no one in the world should stand now between us throwing a shadow on the way of silent knowledge and mute affection the perfect communion of a seaman with his first command  walking to the taffrail i was in time to make out on the very edge of a darkness thrown by a towering black mass like the very gateway of erebusyes i was in time to catch an evanescent glimpse of my white hat left behind to mark the spot where the secret sharer of my cabin and of my thoughts as though he were my second self had lowered himself into the water to take his punishment a free man a proud swimmer striking out for a new destiny
