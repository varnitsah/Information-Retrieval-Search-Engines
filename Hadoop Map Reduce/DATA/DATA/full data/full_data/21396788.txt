21396788	the wings of the dove  by henry james   volume ii   new york  charles scribners sons  1909   copyright 1902 and 1909 by charles scribners sons      book sixth     the wings of the dove    i    i say you know kateyou did stay had been merton denshers punctual remark on their adventure after they had as it were got out of it an observation which she not less promptly on her side let him see that she forgave in him only because he was a man she had to recognise with whatever disappointment that it was doubtless the most helpful he could make in this character the fact of the adventure was flagrant between them they had looked at each other on gaining the street as people look who have just rounded together a dangerous corner and there was therefore already enough unanimity sketched out to have lighted for her companion anything equivocal in her action but the amount of light men did needkate could have been eloquent at this moment about that what however on his seeing more struck him as most distinct in her was her sense that reunited after his absence and having been now half the morning together it behooved them to face without delay the question of handling their immediate future that it would require some handling that they should still have to deal deal in a crafty manner with difficulties and delays was the great matter he had come back to greater than any but the refreshed consciousness of their personal need of each other this need had had twenty minutes the afternoon before to find out where it stood and the time was fully accounted for by the charm of the demonstration he had arrived at euston at five having wired her from liverpool the moment he landed and she had quickly decided to meet him at the station whatever publicity might attend such an act when he had praised her for it on alighting from his train she had answered frankly enough that such things should be taken at a jump she didnt care today who saw her and she profited by it for her joy tomorrow inevitably she should have time to think and then as inevitably would become a baser creature a creature of alarms and precautions it was none the less for tomorrow at an early hour that she had appointed their next meeting keeping in mind for the present a particular obligation to show at lancaster gate by six oclock she had given with imprecations her reasonpeople to tea eternally and a promise to aunt maud but she had been liberal enough on the spot and had suggested the national gallery for the morning quite as with an idea that had ripened in expectancy they might be seen there too but nobody would know them just as for that matter now in the refreshmentroom to which they had adjourned they would incur the notice but at the worst of the unacquainted they would have something there for the facility it would give thus had it already come up for them again that they had no place of convenience  he found himself on english soil with all sorts of feelings but he hadnt quite faced having to reckon with a certain ruefulness in regard to that subject as one of the strongest he was aware later on that there were questions his impatience had shirked whereby it actually rather smote him for want of preparation and assurance that he had nowhere to take his love he had taken it thus at eustonand on kates own suggestioninto the place where people had beer and buns and had ordered tea at a small table in the corner which no doubt as they were lost in the crowd did well enough for a stopgap it perhaps did as well as her simply driving with him to the door of his lodging which had had to figure as the sole device of his own wit that wit the truth was had broken down a little at the sharp prevision that once at his door they would have to hang back she would have to stop there wouldnt come in with him couldnt possibly and he shouldnt be able to ask her would feel he couldnt without betraying a deficiency of what would be called even at their advanced stage respect for her that again was all that was clear except the further fact that it was maddening compressed and concentrated confined to a single sharp pang or two but none the less in wait for him there on the euston platform and lifting its head as that of a snake in the garden was the disconcerting sense that respect in their game seemed somehowhe scarce knew what to call ita fifth wheel to the coach it was properly an inside thing not an outside a thing to make love greater not to make happiness less they had met again for happiness and he distinctly felt during his most lucid moment or two how he must keep watch on anything that really menaced that boon if kate had consented to drive away with him and alight at his house there would probably enough have occurred for them at the foot of his steps one of those strange instants between man and woman that blow upon the red spark the spark of conflict ever latent in the depths of passion she would have shaken her headoh sadly divinelyon the question of coming in and he though doing all justice to her refusal would have yet felt his eyes reach further into her own than a possible word at such a time could reach this would have meant the suspicion the dread of the shadow of an adverse will lucky therefore in the actual case that the scant minutes took another turn and that by the halfhour she did in spite of everything contrive to spend with him kate showed so well how she could deal with things that maddened she seemed to ask him to beseech him and all for his better comfort to leave her now and henceforth to treat them in her own way  she had still met it in naming so promptly for their early convenience one of the great museums and indeed with such happy art that his fully seeing where she had placed him hadnt been till after he left her his absence from her for so many weeks had had such an effect upon him that his demands his desires had grown and only the night before as his ship steamed beneath summer stars in sight of the irish coast he had felt all the force of his particular necessity he hadnt in other words at any point doubted he was on his way to say to her that really their mistake must end their mistake was to have believed that they could hold outhold out that is not against aunt maud but against an impatience that prolonged and exasperated made a man ill he had known more than ever on their separating in the court of the station how ill a man and even a woman could feel from such a cause but he struck himself as also knowing that he had already suffered kate to begin finely to apply antidotes and remedies and subtle sedatives it had a vulgar soundas throughout in love the names of things the verbal terms of intercourse were compared with love itself horribly vulgar but it was as if after all he might have come back to find himself put off though it would take him of course a day or two to see his letters from the states had pleased whom it concerned though not so much as he had meant they should and he should be paid according to agreement and would now take up his money it wasnt in truth very much to take up so that he hadnt in the least come back flourishing a chequebook that new motive for bringing his mistress to terms he couldnt therefore pretend to produce the ideal certainty would have been to be able to present a change of prospect as a warrant for the change of philosophy and without it he should have to make shift but with the pretext of the lapse of time the lapse of timenot so many weeks after all she might always of course saycouldnt at any rate have failed to do something for him and that consideration it was that had just now tided him over all the more that he had his vision of what it had done personally for kate this had come out for him with a splendour that almost scared him even in their small corner of the room at eustonalmost scared him because it just seemed to blaze at him that waiting was the game of dupes not yet had she been so the creature he had originally seen not yet had he felt so soundly safely sure it was all there for him playing on his pride of possession as a hidden master in a great dim church might play on the grandest organ his final sense was that a woman couldnt be like that and then ask of one the impossible  she had been like that afresh on the morrow and so for the hour they had been able to float in the mere joy of contactsuch contact as their situation in pictured public halls permitted this poor makeshift for closeness confessed itself in truth by twenty small signs of unrest even on kates part inadequate so little could a decent interest in the interesting place presume to remind them of its claims they had met there in order not to meet in the streets and not again with an equal want of invention and of style at a railwaystation not again either in kensington gardens which they could easily and tacitly agree would have had too much of the taste of their old frustrations the present taste the taste that morning in the pictured halls had been a variation yet densher had at the end of a quarter of an hour fully known what to conclude from it this fairly consoled him for their awkwardness as if he had been watching it affect her she might be as nobly charming as she liked and he had seen nothing to touch her in the states she couldnt pretend that in such conditions as those she herself believed it enough to appease him she couldnt pretend she believed he would believe it enough to render her a like service it wasnt enough for that purposeshe as good as showed him it wasnt that was what he could be glad by demonstration to have brought her to he would have said to her had he put it crudely and on the spot now am i to understand you that you consider this sort of thing can go on it would have been open to her no doubt to reply that to have him with her again to have him all kept and treasured so still under her grasping hand as she had held him in their yearning interval was a sort of thing that he must allow her to have no quarrel about but that would be a mere gesture of her grace a mere sport of her subtlety she knew as well as he what they wanted in spite of which indeed he scarce could have said how beautifully he mightnt once more have named it and urged it if she hadnt at a given moment blurred as it were the accord they had soon seated themselves for better talk and so they had remained a while intimate and superficial the immediate things to say had been many for they hadnt exhausted them at euston they drew upon them freely now and kate appeared quite to forgetwhich was prodigiously becoming to herto look about for surprises he was to try afterwards and try in vain to remember what speech or what silence of his own what natural sign of the eyes or accidental touch of the hand had precipitated for her in the midst of this a sudden different impulse she had got up with inconsequence as if to break the charm though he wasnt aware of what he had done at the moment to make the charm a danger she had patched it up agreeably enough the next minute by some odd remark about some picture to which he hadnt so much as replied it being quite independently of this that he had himself exclaimed on the dreadful closeness of the rooms he had observed that they must go out again to breathe and it was as if their common consciousness while they passed into another part was that of persons who infinitely engaged together had been startled and were trying to look natural it was probably while they were so occupiedas the young man subsequently reconceivedthat they had stumbled upon his little new york friend he thought of her for some reason as little though she was of about kates height to which any more than to any other felicity in his mistress he had never applied the diminutive  what was to be in the retrospect more distinct to him was the process by which he had become aware that kates acquaintance with her was greater than he had gathered she had written of it in due course as a new and amusing one and he had written back that he had met over there and that he much liked the young person whereupon she had answered that he must find out about her at home kate in the event however had not returned to that and he had of course with so many things to find out about been otherwise taken up little miss theales individual history was not stuff for his newspaper besides which moreover he was seeing but too many little miss theales they even went so far as to impose themselves as one of the groups of social phenomena that fell into the scheme of his public letters for this group in especial perhapsthe irrepressible the supereminent young personshis best pen was ready thus it was that there could come back to him in london an hour or two after their luncheon with the american pair the sense of a situation for which kate hadnt wholly prepared him possibly indeed as marked as this was his recovered perception that preparations of more than one kind had been exactly what both yesterday and today he felt her as having in hand that appearance in fact if he dwelt on it so ministered to apprehension as to require some brushing away he shook off the suspicion to some extent on their separating first from their hostesses and then from each other by the aid of a long and rather aimless walk he was to go to the office later but he had the next two or three hours and he gave himself as a pretext that he had eaten much too much after kate had asked him to put her into a cabwhich as an announced a resumed policy on her part he found himself deprecatinghe stood a while by a corner and looked vaguely forth at his london there was always doubtless a moment for the absentee recapturedthe moment that of the reflux of the first emotionat which it was beyond disproof that one was back his full parenthesis was closed and he was once more but a sentence of a sort in the general text the text that from his momentary streetcorner showed as a great grey page of print that somehow managed to be crowded without being fine the grey however was more or less the blur of a point of view not yet quite seized again and there would be colour enough to come out he was back flatly enough but back to possibilities and prospects and the ground he now somewhat sightlessly covered was the act of renewed possession  he walked northward without a plan without suspicion quite in the direction his little new york friend in her restless ramble had taken a day or two before he reached like milly the regents park and though he moved further and faster he finally sat down like milly from the force of thought for him too in this position be it addedand he might positively have occupied the same benchvarious troubled fancies folded their wings he had no more yet said what he really wanted than kate herself had found time she should hear enough of that in a couple of days he had practically not pressed her as to what most concerned them it had seemed so to concern them during these first hours but to hold each other spiritually speaking close this at any rate was palpable that there were at present more things rather than fewer between them the explanation about the two ladies would be part of the lot yet could wait with all the rest they were not meanwhile certainly what most made him roamthe missing explanations werent that was what she had so often said before and always with the effect of suddenly breaking off now please call me a good cab their previous encounters the times when they had reached in their stroll the south side of the park had had a way of winding up with this special irrelevance it was effectively what most divided them for he would generally but for her reasons have been able to jump in with her what did she think he wished to do to herit was a question he had had occasion to put a small matter however doubtlesssince when it came to that they didnt depend on cabs good or bad for the sense of union its importance was less from the particular loss than as a kind of irritating mark of her expertness this expertness under providence had been great from the first so far as joining him was concerned and he was critical only because it had been still greater even from the first too in respect to leaving him he had put the question to her again that afternoon on the repetition of her appealhad asked her once more what she supposed he wished to do he recalled on his bench in the regents park the freedom of fancy funny and pretty with which she had answered recalled the moment itself while the usual hansom charged them during which he felt himself disappointed as he was grimacing back at the superiority of her very humour in its added grace of gaiety to the celebrated solemn american their fresh appointment had been at all events by that time made and he should see what her choice in respect to ita surprise as well as a reliefwould do toward really simplifying it meant either new help or new hindrance though it took them at least out of the streets and her naming this privilege had naturally made him ask if mrs lowder knew of his return  not from me kate had replied but i shall speak to her now and she had argued as with rather a quick fresh view that it would now be quite easy weve behaved for months so properly that ive margin surely for my mention of you youll come to see her and shell leave you with me shell show her good nature and her lack of betrayed fear in that with her you know youve never broken quite the contrary and she likes you as much as ever were leaving town it will be the end just now therefore its nothing to ask ill ask tonight kate had wound up and if youll leave it to memy cleverness i assure you has grown infernalill make it all right  he had of course thus left it to her and he was wondering more about it now than he had wondered there in brook street he repeated to himself that if it wasnt in the line of triumph it was in the line of muddle this indeed no doubt was as a part of his wonder for still other questions kate had really got off without meeting his little challenge about the terms of their intercourse with her dear milly her dear milly it was sensible was somehow in the picture her dear milly popping up in his absence occupiedhe couldnt have said quite why he felt itmore of the foreground than one would have expected her in advance to find clear she took up room and it was almost as if room had been made for her kate had appeared to take for granted he would know why it had been made but that was just the point it was a foreground in which he himself in which his connexion with kate scarce enjoyed a space to turn round but miss theale was perhaps at the present juncture a possibility of the same sort as the softened if not the squared aunt maud it might be true of her also that if she werent a bore shed be a convenience it rolled over him of a sudden after he had resumed his walk that this might easily be what kate had meant the charming girl adored herdensher had for himself made out thatand would protect would lend a hand to their interviews these might take place in other words on her premises which would remove them still better from the streets that was an explanation which did hang together it was impaired a little of a truth by this fact that their next encounter was rather markedly not to depend upon her yet this fact in turn would be accounted for by the need of more preliminaries one of the things he conceivably should gain on thursday at lancaster gate would be a further view of that propriety   ii  it was extraordinary enough that he should actually be finding himself when thursday arrived none so wide of the mark kate hadnt come all the way to this for him but she had come to a good deal by the end of a quarter of an hour what she had begun with was her surprise at her appearing to have left him on tuesday anything more to understand the parts as he now saw under her hand did fall more or less together and it wasnt even as if she had spent the interval in twisting and fitting them she was bright and handsome not fagged and worn with the general clearness for it certainly stuck out enough that if the american ladies themselves werent to be squared which was absurd they fairly imposed the necessity of trying aunt maud again one couldnt say to them kind as she had been to them well meet please whenever youll let us at your house but we count on you to help us to keep it secret they must in other terms inevitably speak to aunt maudit would be of the last awkwardness to ask them not to kate had embraced all this in her choice of speaking first what kate embraced altogether was indeed wonderful today for densher though he perhaps struck himself rather as getting it out of her piece by piece than as receiving it in a steady light he had always felt however that the more he asked of her the more he found her prepared as he imaged it to hand out he had said to her more than once even before his absence you keep the key of the cupboard and i foresee that when were married youll dole me out my sugar by lumps she had replied that she rejoiced in his assumption that sugar would be his diet and the domestic arrangement so prefigured might have seemed already to prevail the supply from the cupboard at this hour was doubtless of a truth not altogether cloyingly sweet but it met in a manner his immediate requirements if her explanations at any rate prompted questions the questions no more exhausted them than they exhausted her patience and they were naturally of the series the simpler as for instance in his taking it from her that miss theale then could do nothing for them he frankly brought out what he had ventured to think possible if we cant meet here and weve really exhausted the charms of the open air and the crowd some such little raft in the wreck some occasional opportunity like that of tuesday has been present to me these two days as better than nothing but if our friends are so accountable to this house of course theres no more to be said and its one more nail thank god in the coffin of our odious delay he was but too glad without more ado to point the moral now i hope you see we cant work it anyhow  if she laughed for thisand her spirits seemed really highit was because of the opportunity that at the hotel he had most shown himself as enjoying your ideas beautiful when one remembers that you hadnt a word except for milly but she was as beautifully goodhumoured you might of course get used to heryou will youre quite rightso long as theyre with us or near us and she put it lucidly that the dear things couldnt help simply as charming friends giving them a lift theyll speak to aunt maud but they wont shut their doors to us that would be another matter a friend always helpsand shes a friend she had left mrs stringham by this time out of the question she had reduced it to milly besides she particularly likes us she particularly likes you i say old boy make something of that he felt her dodging the ultimatum he had just made sharp his definite reminder of how little at the best they could work it but there were certain of his remarksthose mostly of the sharper penetrationthat it had been quite her practice from the first not formally not reverently to notice she showed the effect of them in ways less trite this was what happened now he didnt think in truth that she wasnt really minding she took him up none the less on a minor question you say we cant meet here but you see its just what we do what could be more lovely than this  it wasnt to torment himthat again he didnt believe but he had to come to the house in some discomfort so that he frowned a little at her calling it thus a luxury wasnt there an element in it of coming back into bondage the bondage might be veiled and varnished but he knew in his bones how little the very highest privileges of lancaster gate could ever be a sign of their freedom they were upstairs in one of the smaller apartments of state a room arranged as a boudoir but visibly unusedit defied familiarityand furnished in the ugliest of blues he had immediately looked with interest at the closed doors and kate had met his interest with the assurance that it was all right that aunt maud did them justiceso far that was as this particular time was concerned that they should be alone and have nothing to fear but the fresh allusion to this that he had drawn from her acted on him now more directly brought him closer still to the question they were aloneit was all right he took in anew the shut doors and the permitted privacy the solid stillness of the great house they connected themselves on the spot with something made doubly vivid in him by the whole present play of her charming strong will what it amounted to was that he couldnt have herhanged if he couldevasive he couldnt and he wouldntwouldnt have her inconvenient and elusive he didnt want her deeper than himself fine as it might be as wit or as character he wanted to keep her where their communications would be straight and easy and their intercourse independent the effect of this was to make him say in a moment will you take me just as i am  she turned a little pale for the tone of truth in itwhich qualified to his sense delightfully the strength of her will and the pleasure he found in this was not the less for her breaking out after an instant into a strain that stirred him more than any she had ever used with him ah do let me try myself i assure you i see my wayso dont spoil it wait for me and give me time dear man kate said only believe in me and it will be beautiful  he hadnt come back to hear her talk of his believing in her as if he didnt but he had come backand it all was upon him nowto seize her with a sudden intensity that her manner of pleading with him had made as happily appeared irresistible he laid strong hands upon her to say almost in anger do you love me love me love me and she closed her eyes as with the sense that he might strike her but that she could gratefully take it her surrender was her response her response her surrender and though scarce hearing what she said he so profited by these things that it could for the time be ever so intimately appreciable to him that he was keeping her the long embrace in which they held each other was the rout of evasion and he took from it the certitude that what she had from him was real to her it was stronger than an uttered vow and the name he was to give it in afterthought was that she had been sublimely sincere that was all he askedsincerity making a basis that would bear almost anything this settled so much and settled it so thoroughly that there was nothing left to ask her to swear to oaths and vows apart now they could talk it seemed in fact only now that their questions were put on the table he had taken up more expressly at the end of five minutes her plea for her own plan and it was marked that the difference made by the passage just enacted was a difference in favour of her choice of means means had somehow suddenly become a detailher province and her care it had grown more consistently vivid that her intelligence was one with her passion i certainly dont want he saidand he could say it with a smile of indulgenceto be all the while bringing it up that i dont trust you  i should hope not what do you think i want to do  he had really at this to make out a little what he thought and the first thing that put itself in evidence was of course the oddity after all of their game to which he could but frankly allude were doing at the best in trying to temporise in so special a way a thing most people would call us fools for but his visit passed all the same without his again attempting to make just as he was serve he had no more money just as he was than he had had just as he had been or than he should have probably when it came to that just as he always would be whereas she on her side in comparison with her state of some months before had measureably more to relinquish he easily saw how their meeting at lancaster gate gave more of an accent to that quantity than their meeting at stations or in parks and yet on the other hand he couldnt urge this against it if mrs lowder was indifferent her indifference added in a manner to what kates taking him as he was would call on her to sacrifice such in fine was her art with him that she seemed to put the question of their still waiting into quite other terms than the terms of ugly blue of florid sèvres of complicated brass in which their boudoir expressed it she said almost all in fact by saying on this article of aunt maud after he had once more pressed her that when he should see her as must inevitably soon happen he would understand do you mean he asked at this that theres any definite sign of her coming round im not talking he explained of mere hypocrisies in her or mere brave duplicities remember after all that supremely clever as we are and as strong a team i admit as there is goingremember that she can play with us quite as much as we play with her  she doesnt want to play with me my dear kate lucidly replied she doesnt want to make me suffer a bit more than she need she cares for me too much and everything she does or doesnt do has a value this has a valueher being as she has been about us today i believe shes in her room where shes keeping strictly to herself while youre here with me but that isnt playingnot a bit  what is it then the young man returnedfrom the moment it isnt her blessing and a cheque  kate was complete its simply her absence of smallness there is something in her above trifles she generally trusts us she doesnt propose to hunt us into corners and if we frankly ask for a thingwhy said kate she shrugs but she lets it go she has really but one faultshes indifferent on such ground as she has taken about us to details however the girl cheerfully went on it isnt in detail we fight her  it seems to me densher brought out after a moments thought of this that its in detail we deceive hera speech that as soon as he had uttered it applied itself for him as also visibly for his companion to the afterglow of their recent embrace  any confusion attaching to this adventure however dropped from kate whom as he could see with sacred joy it must take more than that to make compunctious i dont say we can do it again i mean she explained meet here  densher indeed had been wondering where they could do it again if lancaster gate was so limited that issue reappeared i maynt come back at all  certainlyto see her its she really his companion smiled whos in love with you  but it made hima trifle more gravelook at her a moment dont make out you know that every ones in love with me  she hesitated i dont say every one  you said just now miss theale  i said she liked youyes  well it comes to the same thing with which however he pursued of course i ought to thank mrs lowder in person i mean for thisas from myself  ah but you know not too much she had an ironic gaiety for the implications of his this besides wishing to insist on a general prudence shell wonder what youre thanking her for  densher did justice to both considerations yes i cant very well tell her all  it was perhaps because he said it so gravely that kate was again in a manner amused yet she gave out light you cant very well tell her anything and that doesnt matter only be nice to her please her make her see how clever you areonly without letting her see that youre trying if youre charming to her youve nothing else to do  but she oversimplified too i can be charming to her so far as i see only by letting her suppose i give you upwhich ill be hanged if i do it is he said with feeling a game  of course its a game but shell never suppose you give me upor i give youif you keep reminding her how you enjoy our interviews  then if she has to see us as obstinate and constant densher asked what good does it do  kate was for a moment checked what good does what  does my pleasing herdoes anything i cant he impatiently declared please her  kate looked at him hard again disappointed at his want of consistency but it appeared to determine in her something better than a mere complaint then i can leave it to me with which she came to him under the compulsion again that had united them shortly before and took hold of him in her urgency to the same tender purpose it was her form of entreaty renewed and repeated which made after all as he met it their great fact clear and it somehow clarified all things so to possess each other the effect of it was that once more on these terms he could only be generous he had so on the spot then left everything to her that she reverted in the course of a few moments to one of her previousand as positively seemedher most precious ideas you accused me just now of saying that millys in love with you well if you come to that i do say it so there you are thats the good shell do us it makes a basis for her seeing youso that shell help us to go on  densher staredshe was wondrous all round and what sort of a basis does it make for my seeing her  oh i dont mind kate smiled  dont mind my leading her on  she put it differently dont mind her leading you  well she wontso its nothing not to mind but how can that help he pursued with what she knows  what she knows that neednt prevent  he wondered prevent her loving us  prevent her helping you shes like that kate croy explained  it took indeed some understanding making nothing of the fact that i love another  making everything said kate to console you  but for what  for not getting your other  he continued to stare but how does she know  that you wont get her she doesnt but on the other hand she doesnt know you will meanwhile she sees you baffled for she knows of aunt mauds stand thatkate was lucidgives her the chance to be nice to you  and what does it give me the young man none the less rationally asked the chance to be a brute of a humbug to her  kate so possessed her facts as it were that she smiled at his violence youll extraordinarily like her shes exquisite and there are reasons i mean others  what others  well ill tell you another time those i give you the girl added are enough to go on with  to go on to what  why to seeing her againsay as soon as you can which moreover on all grounds is no more than decent of you  he of course took in her reference and he had fully in mind what had passed between them in new york it had been no great quantity but it had made distinctly at the time for his pleasure so that anything in the nature of an appeal in the name of it could have a slight kindling consequence oh i shall naturally call again without delay yes said densher her being in love with me is nonsense but i must quite independently of that make every acknowledgement of favours received  it appeared practically all kate asked then you see i shall meet you there  i dont quite see he presently returned why she should wish to receive you for it  she receives me for myselfthat is for her self she thinks no end of me that i should have to drum it into you  yet still he didnt take it then i confess shes beyond me  well kate could but leave it as she saw it she regards me as alreadyin these few weeksher dearest friend its quite separate were in she and i ever so deep and it was to confirm this that as if it had flashed upon her that he was somewhere at sea she threw out at last her own real light she doesnt of course know i care for you she thinks i care so little that its not worth speaking of that he had been somewhere at sea these remarks made quickly clear and kate hailed the effect with surprise have you been supposing that she does know  about our situation certainly if youre such friends as you show meand if you havent otherwise represented it to her she uttered at this such a sound of impatience that he stood artlessly vague you have denied it to her  she threw up her arms at his being so backward denied it my dear man weve never spoken of you  never never  strange as it may appear to your glorynever  he couldnt piece it together but wont mrs lowder have spoken  very probably but of you not of me  this struck him as obscure how does she know me but as part and parcel of you  how kate triumphantly asked why exactly to make nothing of it to have nothing to do with it to stick consistently to her line about it aunt mauds line is to keep all reality out of our relationthat is out of my being in danger from youby not having so much as suspected or heard of it shell get rid of it as she believes by ignoring it and sinking itif she only does so hard enough therefore she in her manner denies it if you will thats how she knows you otherwise than as part and parcel of me she wont for a moment have allowed either to mrs stringham or to milly that ive in any way as they say distinguished you  and you dont suppose said densher that they must have made it out for themselves  no my dear i dont not even kate declared after millys so funnily bumping against us on tuesday  she doesnt see from that  that youre so to speak mad about me yes she sees no doubt that you regard me with a complacent eyefor you show it i think always too much and too crudely but nothing beyond that i dont show it too much i dont perhapsto please you completely where others are concernedshow it enough  can you show it or not as you like densher demanded  it pulled her up a little but she came out resplendent not where you are concerned beyond seeing that youre rather gone she went on milly only sees that im decently good to you  very good indeed she must think it  very good indeed then she easily sees me kate smiled as very good indeed  the young man brooded but in a sense to take some explaining  then i explain she was really fine it came back to her essential plea for her freedom of action and his beauty of trust i mean she added i will explain  and what will i do  recognise the difference it must make if she thinks but here in truth kate faltered it was his silence alone that for the moment took up her apparent meaning and before he again spoke she had returned to remembrance and prudence they were now not to forget that aunt mauds liberality having put them on their honour they mustnt spoil their case by abusing it he must leave her in time they should probably find it would help them but she came back to milly too mind you go to see her  densher still however took up nothing of this then i may come again  for aunt maudas much as you like but we cant again said kate play her this trick i cant see you here alone  then where  go to see milly she for all satisfaction repeated  and what good will that do me  try it and youll see  you mean youll manage to be there densher asked say you are how will that give us privacy  try ityoull see the girl once more returned we must manage as we can  thats precisely what i feel it strikes me we might manage better his idea of this was a thing that made him an instant hesitate yet he brought it out with conviction why wont you come to me  it was a question her troubled eyes seemed to tell him he was scarce generous in expecting her definitely to answer and by looking to him to wait at least she appealed to something that she presently made him feel as his pity it was on that special shade of tenderness that he thus found himself thrown back and while he asked of his spirit and of his flesh just what concession they could arrange she pressed him yet again on the subject of her singular remedy for their embarrassment it might have been irritating had she ever struck him as having in her mind a stupid corner youll see she said the difference it will make  well since she wasnt stupid she was intelligent it was he who was stupidthe proof of which was that he would do what she liked but he made a last effort to understand her allusion to the difference bringing him round to it he indeed caught at something subtle but strong even as he spoke is what you meant a moment ago that the difference will be in her being made to believe you hate me  kate however had simply for this gross way of putting it one of her more marked shows of impatience with which in fact she sharply closed their discussion he opened the door on a sign from her and she accompanied him to the top of the stairs with an air of having so put their possibilities before him that questions were idle and doubts perverse i verily believe i shall hate you if you spoil for me the beauty of what i see   iii  he was really notwithstanding to hear more from her of what she saw and the very next occasion had for him still other surprises than that he received from mrs lowder on the morning after his visit to kate the telegraphic expression of a hope that he might be free to dine with them that evening and his freedom affected him as fortunate even though in some degree qualified by her missive expecting american friends whom im so glad to find you know his knowledge of american friends was clearly an accident of which he was to taste the fruit to the last bitterness this apprehension however we hasten to add enjoyed for him in the immediate event a certain merciful shrinkage the immediate event being that at lancaster gate five minutes after his due arrival prescribed him for eightthirty mrs stringham came in alone the long daylight the postponed lamps the habit of the hour made dinners late and guests still later so that punctual as he was he had found mrs lowder alone with kate herself not yet in the field he had thus had with her several bewildering momentsbewildering by reason fairly of their tacit invitation to him to be supernaturally simple this was exactly goodness knew what he wanted to be but he had never had it so largely and freelyso supernaturally simply for that matterimputed to him as of easy achievement it was a particular in which aunt maud appeared to offer herself as an example appeared to say quite agreeably what i want of you dont you see is to be just exactly as i am the quantity of the article required was what might especially have caused him to staggerhe liked so in general the quantities in which mrs lowder dealt he would have liked as well to ask her how feasible she supposed it for a poor young man to resemble her at any point but he had after all soon enough perceived that he was doing as she wished by letting his wonder show just a little as silly he was conscious moreover of a small strange dread of the results of discussion with herstrange truly because it was her good nature not her asperity that he feared asperity might have made him angryin which there was always a comfort good nature in his conditions had a tendency to make him ashamedwhich aunt maud indeed wonderfully liking him for himself quite struck him as having guessed to spare him therefore she also avoided discussion she kept him down by refusing to quarrel with him this was what she now proposed to him to enjoy and his secret discomfort was his sense that on the whole it was what would best suit him being kept down was a bore but his great dread verily was of being ashamed which was a thing distinct and it mattered but little that he was ashamed of that too it was of the essence of his position that in such a house as this the tables could always be turned on him what do you offer what do you offerthe place however muffled in convenience and decorum constantly hummed for him with that thick irony the irony was a renewed reference to obvious bribes and he had already seen how little aid came to him from denouncing the bribes as ugly in form that was what the precious metalsthey alonecould afford to be it was vain enough for him accordingly to try to impart a gloss to his own comparative brummagem the humiliation of this impotence was precisely what aunt maud sought to mitigate for him by keeping him down and as her effort to that end had doubtless never yet been so visible he had probably never felt so definitely placed in the world as while he waited with her for her halfdozen other guests she welcomed him genially back from the states as to his view of which her few questions though not coherent were comprehensive and he had the amusement of seeing in her as through a clear glass the outbreak of a plan and the sudden consciousness of a curiosity she became aware of america under his eyes as a possible scene for social operations the idea of a visit to the wonderful country had clearly but just occurred to her yet she was talking of it at the end of a minute as her favourite dream he didnt believe in it but he pretended to this helped her as well as anything else to treat him as harmless and blameless she was so engaged with the further aid of a complete absence of allusions when the highest effect was given her method by the beautiful entrance of kate the method therefore received support all round for no young man could have been less formidable than the person to the relief of whose shyness her niece ostensibly came the ostensible in kate struck him altogether on this occasion as prodigious while scarcely less prodigious for that matter was his own reading on the spot of the relation between his companionsa relation lighted for him by the straight look not exactly loving nor lingering yet searching and soft that on the part of their hostess the girl had to reckon with as she advanced it took her in from head to foot and in doing so it told a story that made poor densher again the least bit sick it marked so something with which kate habitually and consummately reckoned  that was the storythat she was always for her beneficent dragon under arms living up every hour but especially at festal hours to the value mrs lowder had attached to her high and fixed this estimate ruled on each occasion at lancaster gate the social scene so that he now recognised in it something like the artistic idea the plastic substance imposed by tradition by genius by criticism in respect to a given character on a distinguished actress as such a person was to dress the part to walk to look to speak in every way to express the part so all this was what kate was to do for the character she had undertaken under her aunts roof to represent it was made up the character of definite elements and touchesthings all perfectly ponderable to criticism and the way for her to meet criticism was evidently at the start to be sure her makeup had had the last touch and that she looked at least no worse than usual aunt mauds appreciation of that tonight was indeed managerial and the performers own contribution fairly that of the faultless soldier on parade densher saw himself for the moment as in his purchased stall at the play the watchful manager was in the depths of a box and the poor actress in the glare of the footlights but she passed the poor performerhe could see how she always passed her wig her paint her jewels every mark of her expression impeccable and her entrance accordingly greeted with the proper round of applause such impressions as we thus note for densher come and go it must be granted in very much less time than notation demands but we may none the less make the point that there was still further time among them for him to feel almost too scared to take part in the ovation he struck himself as having lost for the minute his presence of mindso that in any case he only stared in silence at the older womans technical challenge and at the younger ones disciplined face it was as if the dramait thus came to him for the fact of a drama there was no blinkingwas between them them quite preponderantly with merton densher relegated to mere spectatorship a paying place in front and one of the most expensive this was why his appreciation had turned for the instant to fearhad just turned as we have said to sickness and in spite of the fact that the disciplined face did offer him over the footlights as he believed the small gleam fine faint but exquisite of a special intelligence so might a practised performer even when raked by doublebarrelled glasses seem to be all in her part and yet convey a sign to the person in the house she loved best  the drama at all events as densher saw it meanwhile went onamplified soon enough by the advent of two other guests stray gentlemen both stragglers in the rout of the season who visibly presented themselves to kate during the next moments as subjects for a like impersonal treatment and sharers in a like usual mercy at opposite ends of the social course they displayed in respect to the figure that each in his way made one the expansive the other the contractile effect of the perfect white waistcoat a scratch company of two innocuous youths and a pacified veteran was therefore what now offered itself to mrs stringham who rustled in a little breathless and full of the compunction of having had to come alone her companion at the last moment had been indisposedpositively not well enough and so had packed her off insistently with excuses with wild regrets this circumstance of their charming friends illness was the first thing kate took up with densher on their being able after dinner without bravado to have ten minutes naturally as she called itwhich wasnt what he didtogether but it was already as if the young man had by an odd impression throughout the meal not been wholly deprived of miss theales participation mrs lowder had made dear milly the topic and it proved on the spot a topic as familiar to the enthusiastic younger as to the sagacious older man any knowledge they might lack mrs lowders niece was moreover alert to supply while densher himself was freely appealed to as the most privileged after all of the group wasnt it he who had in a manner invented the wonderful creaturethrough having seen her first caught her in her native jungle hadnt he more or less paved the way for her by his prompt recognition of her rarity by preceding her in a friendly spiritas he had the ear of societywith a sharp flashlight or two  he met poor densher these enquiries as he could listening with interest yet with discomfort wincing in particular dry journalist as he was to find it seemingly supposed of him that he had put his penoh his penat the service of private distinction the ear of societythey were talking or almost as if he had publicly paragraphed a modest young lady they dreamt dreams in truth he appeared to perceive that fairly waked him up and he settled himself in his place both to resist his embarrassment and to catch the full revelation his embarrassment came naturally from the fact that if he could claim no credit for miss theales success so neither could he gracefully insist on his not having been concerned with her what touched him most nearly was that the occasion took on somehow the air of a commemorative banquet a feast to celebrate a brilliant if brief career there was of course more said about the heroine than if she hadnt been absent and he found himself rather stupefied at the range of millys triumph mrs lowder had wonders to tell of it the two wearers of the waistcoat either with sincerity or with hypocrisy professed in the matter an equal expertness and densher at last seemed to know himself in presence of a social case it was mrs stringham obviously whose testimony would have been most invoked hadnt she been as her friends representative rather confined to the function of inhaling the incense so that kate who treated her beautifully smiling at her cheering and consoling her across the table appeared benevolently both to speak and to interpret for her kate spoke as if she wouldnt perhaps understand their way of appreciating milly but would let them none the less in justice to their good will express it in their coarser fashion densher himself wasnt unconscious in respect to this of a certain broad brotherhood with mrs stringham wondering indeed while he followed the talk how it might move american nerves he had only heard of them before but in his recent tour he had caught them in the remarkable fact and there was now a moment or two when it came to him that he had perhapsand not in the way of an escapetaken a lesson from them they quivered clearly they hummed and drummed they leaped and bounded in mrs stringhams typical organismthis lady striking him as before all things excited as in the native phrase keyedup to a perception of more elements in the occasion than he was himself able to count she was accessible to sides of it he imagined that were as yet obscure to him for though she unmistakeably rejoiced and soared he none the less saw her at moments as even more agitated than pleasure required it was a state of emotion in her that could scarce represent simply an impatience to report at home her little dry new england brightnesshe had sampled all the shades of the american complexity if complexity it werehad its actual reasons for finding relief most in silence so that before the subject was changed he perceived with surprise at the others that they had given her enough of it he had quite had enough of it himself by the time he was asked if it were true that their friend had really not made in her own country the mark she had chalked so large in london it was mrs lowder herself who addressed him that enquiry while he scarce knew if he were the more impressed with her launching it under mrs stringhams nose or with her hope that he would allow to london the honour of discovery the less expansive of the white waistcoats propounded the theory that they saw in londonfor all that was saidmuch further than in the states it wouldnt be the first time he urged that they had taught the americans to appreciate especially when it was funny some native product he didnt mean that miss theale was funnythough she was weird and this was precisely her magic but it might very well be that new york in having her to show hadnt been aware of its luck there were plenty of people who were nothing over there and yet were awfully taken up in england just asto make the balance right thank goodnessthey sometimes sent out beauties and celebrities who left the briton cold the britons temperature in truth wasnt to be calculateda formulation of the matter that was not reached however without producing in mrs stringham a final feverish sally she announced that if the point of view for a proper admiration of her young friend had seemed to fail a little in new york there was no manner of doubt of her having carried boston by storm it pointed the moral that boston for the finer taste left new york nowhere and the good lady as the exponent of this doctrinewhich she set forth at a certain lengthmade obviously to denshers mind her nearest approach to supplying the weirdness in which millys absence had left them deficient she made it indeed effective for him by suddenly addressing him you know nothing sirbut not the least little bitabout my friend  he hadnt pretended he did but there was a purity of reproach in mrs stringhams face and tone a purity charged apparently with solemn meanings so that for a little small as had been his claim he couldnt but feel that she exaggerated he wondered what she did mean but while doing so he defended himself i certainly dont know enormously muchbeyond her having been most kind to me in new york as a poor bewildered and newly landed alien and my having tremendously appreciated it to which he added he scarce knew why what had an immediate success remember mrs stringham that you werent then present  ah there you are said kate with much gay expression though what it expressed he failed at the time to make out  you werent present then dearest mrs lowder richly concurred you dont know she continued with mellow gaiety how far things may have gone  it made the little woman he could see really lose her head she had more things in that head than any of them in any other unless perhaps it were kate whom he felt as indirectly watching him during this foolish passage though it pleased himand because of the foolishnessnot to meet her eyes he met mrs stringhams which affected him with her he could on occasion clear it upa sense produced by the mute communion between them and really the beginning as the event was to show of something extraordinary it was even already a little the effect of this communion that mrs stringham perceptibly faltered in her retort to mrs lowders joke oh its precisely my point that mr densher cant have had vast opportunities and then she smiled at him i wasnt away you know long  it made everything in the oddest way in the world immediately right for him and i wasnt there long either he positively saw with it that nothing for him so far as she was concerned would again be wrong shes beautiful but i dont say shes easy to know  ah shes a thousand and one things replied the good lady as if now to keep well with him  he asked nothing better she was off with you to these parts before i knew it i myself was off tooaway off to wonderful parts where i had endlessly more to see  but you didnt forget her aunt maud interposed with almost menacing archness  no of course i didnt forget her one doesnt forget such charming impressions but i never he lucidly maintained chattered to others about her  shell thank you for that sir said mrs stringham with a flushed firmness  yet doesnt silence in such a case aunt maud blandly enquired very often quite prove the depth of the impression  he would have been amused hadnt he been slightly displeased at all they seemed desirous to fasten on him well the impression was as deep as you like but i really want miss theale to know he pursued for mrs stringham that i dont figure by any consent of my own as an authority about her  kate came to his assistanceif assistance it wasbefore their friend had had time to meet this charge youre right about her not being easy to know one sees her with intensitysees her more than one sees almost any one but then one discovers that that isnt knowing her and that one may know better a person whom one doesnt see as i say half so much  the discrimination was interesting but it brought them back to the fact of her success and it was at that comparatively gross circumstance now so fully placed before them that millys anxious companion sat and lookedlooked very much as some spectator in an oldtime circus might have watched the oddity of a christian maiden in the arena mildly caressingly martyred it was the nosing and fumbling not of lions and tigers but of domestic animals let loose as for the joke even the joke made mrs stringham uneasy and her mute communion with densher to which we have alluded was more and more determined by it he wondered afterwards if kate had made this out though it was not indeed till much later on that he found himself in thought dividing the things she might have been conscious of from the things she must have missed if she actually missed at any rate mrs stringhams discomfort that but showed how her own idea held her her own idea was by insisting on the fact of the girls prominence as a feature of the seasons end to keep densher in relation for the rest of them both to present and to past its everything that has happened since that makes you naturally a little shy about her you dont know what has happened since but we do weve seen it and followed it weve a little been of it the great thing for him at this as kate gave it was in fact quite irresistibly that the case was a real onethe kind of thing that when ones patience was shorter than ones curiosity one had vaguely taken for possible in london but in which one had never been even to this small extent concerned the little americans sudden social adventure her happy and no doubt harmless flourish had probably been favoured by several accidents but it had been favoured above all by the simple springboard of the scene by one of those common caprices of the numberless foolish flock gregarious movements as inscrutable as oceancurrents the huddled herd had drifted to her blindlyit might as blindly have drifted away there had been of course a signal but the great reason was probably the absence at the moment of a larger lion the bigger beast would come and the smaller would then incontinently vanish it was at all events characteristic and what was of the essence of it was grist to his scribbling mill matter for his journalising hand that hand already in intention played over it the motive as a sign of the season a feature of the time of the purely expeditious and roughandtumble nature of the social boom the boom as in itself requiredthat would be the note the subject of the process a comparatively minor question anything was boomable enough when nothing else was more so the author of the rotten book the beauty who was no beauty the heiress who was only that the stranger who was for the most part saved from being inconveniently strange but by being inconveniently familiar the american whose americanism had been long desperately discounted the creature in fine as to whom spangles or spots of any sufficiently marked and exhibited sort could be loudly enough predicated  so he judged at least within his limits and the idea that what he had thus caught in the fact was the trick of fashion and the tone of society went so far as to make him take up again his sense of independence he had supposed himself civilised but if this was civilisation one could smoke ones pipe outside when twaddle was within he had rather avoided as we have remarked kates eyes but there came a moment when he would fairly have liked to put it across the table to her i say light of my life is this the great world there came another it must be addedand doubtless as a result of something that over the cloth did hang between themwhen she struck him as having quite answered dear nofor what do you take me not the least little bit only a poor silly though quite harmless imitation what she might have passed for saying however was practically merged in what she did say for she came overtly to his aid very much as if guessing some of his thoughts she enunciated to relieve his bewilderment the obvious truth that you couldnt leave london for three months at that time of the year and come back to find your friends just where they were as they had of course been jigging away they might well be so red in the face that you wouldnt know them she reconciled in fine his disclaimer about milly with that honour of having discovered her which it was vain for him modestly to shirk he had unearthed her but it was they all of them together who had developed her she was always a charmer one of the greatest ever seen but she wasnt the person he had backed  densher was to feel sure afterwards that kate had had in these pleasantries no conscious above all no insolent purpose of making light of poor susan shepherds property in their young friendwhich property by such remarks was very much pushed to the wall but he was also to know that mrs stringham had secretly resented them mrs stringham holding the opinion of which he was ultimately to have a glimpse that all the kate croys in christendom were but dust for the feet of her milly that it was true would be what she must reveal only when driven to her last entrenchments and well cornered in her passionthe rare passion of friendship the sole passion of her little life save the one other more imperturbably cerebral that she entertained for the art of guy de maupassant she slipped in the observation that her milly was incapable of change was just exactly on the contrary the same milly but this made little difference in the drift of kates contention she was perfectly kind to susie it was as if she positively knew her as handicapped for any disagreement by feeling that she kate had type and by being committed to admiration of type kate had occasion subsequentlyshe found it somehowto mention to our young man millys having spoken to her of this view on the good ladys part she would likemilly had had it from herto put kate croy in a book and see what she could so do with her chop me up fine or serve me wholeit was a way of being got at that kate professed she dreaded it would be mrs stringhams however she understood because mrs stringham oddly felt that with such stuff as the strange english girl was made of stuff that in spite of maud manningham who was full of sentiment she had never known there was none other to be employed these things were of later evidence yet densher might even then have felt them in the air they were practically in it already when kate waiving the question of her friends chemical change wound up with the comparatively unobjectionable proposition that he must now having missed so much take them all up on trust further on he met it peacefully a little perhaps as an example to mrs stringhamoh as far on as you like this even had its effect mrs stringham appropriated as much of it as might be meant for herself the nice thing about her was that she could measure how much so that by the time dinner was over they had really covered ground   iv  the younger of the other men it afterwards appeared was most in his element at the piano so that they had coffee and comic songs upstairsthe gentlemen temporarily relinquished submitting easily in this interest to mrs lowders parting injunction not to sit too tight our especial young man sat tighter when restored to the drawingroom he made it out perfectly with kate that they might off and on foregather without offence he had perhaps stronger needs in this general respect than she but she had better names for the scant risks to which she consented it was the blessing of a big house that intervals were large and of an august night that windows were open whereby at a given moment on the wide balcony with the songs sufficiently sung aunt maud could hold her little court more freshly densher and kate during these moments occupied side by side a small sofaa luxury formulated by the latter as the proof under criticism of their remarkably good conscience to seem not to know each otheronce youre herewould be the girl said to overdo it and she arranged it charmingly that they must have some passage to put aunt maud off the scent she would be wondering otherwise what in the world they found their account in for densher none the less the profit of snatched moments snatched contacts was partial and poor there were in particular at present more things in his mind than he could bring out while watching the windows it was true on the other hand that she suddenly met most of themand more than he could see on the spotby coming out for him with a reference to milly that was not in the key of those made at dinner shes not a bit right you know i mean in health just see her tonight i mean it looks grave for you she would have come you know if it had been at all possible  he took this in such patience as he could muster what in the worlds the matter with her  but kate continued without saying unless indeed your being here has been just a reason for her funking it  what in the worlds the matter with her densher asked again  why just what ive told youthat she likes you so much  then why should she deny herself the joy of meeting me  kate cast aboutit would take so long to explain and perhaps its true that she is bad she easily may be  quite easily i should say judging by mrs stringham whos visibly preoccupied and worried  visibly enough yet it maynt said kate be only for that  for what then  but this question too on thinking she neglected why if its anything real doesnt that poor lady go home shed be anxious and she has done all she need to be civil  i think densher remarked she has been quite beautifully civil  it made kate he fancied look at him the least bit harder but she was already in a manner explaining her preoccupation is probably on two different heads one of them would make her hurry back but the other makes her stay shes commissioned to tell milly all about you  well then said the young man between a laugh and a sigh im glad i felt downstairs a kind of drawing to her wasnt i rather decent to her  awfully nice youve instincts you fiend its all kate declared as it should be  except perhaps he after a moment cynically suggested that she isnt getting much good of me now will she report to milly on this and then as kate seemed to wonder what this might be on our present disregard for appearances  ah leave appearances to me she spoke in her high way ill make them all right aunt maud moreover she added has her so engaged that she wont notice densher felt with this that his companion had indeed perceptive flights he couldnt hope to matchhad for instance another when she still subjoined and mrs stringhams appearing to respond just in order to make that impression  well densher dropped with some humour lifes very interesting i hope its really as much so for you as you make it for others i mean judging by what you make it for me you seem to me to represent it as thrilling for ces dames and in a different way for each aunt maud susan shepherd milly but what is he wound up the matter do you mean shes as ill as she looks  kates face struck him as replying at first that his derisive speech deserved no satisfaction then she appeared to yield to a need of her ownthe need to make the point that as ill as she looked was what milly scarce could be if she had been as ill as she looked she could scarce be a question with them for her end would in that case be near she believed herself neverthelessand kate couldnt help believing her tooseriously menaced there was always the fact that they had been on the point of leaving town the two ladies and had suddenly been pulled up we bade them goodbyeor all butaunt maud and i the night before milly popping so very oddly into the national gallery for a farewell look found you and me together they were then to get off a day or two later but theyve not got offtheyre not getting off when i see themand i saw them this morningthey have showy reasons they do mean to go but theyve postponed it with which the girl brought out theyve postponed it for you he protested so far as a man might without fatuity since a protest was itself credulous but kate as ever understood herself youve made milly change her mind she wants not to miss youthough she wants also not to show she wants you which is why as i hinted a moment ago she may consciously have hung back tonight she doesnt know when she may see you againshe doesnt know she ever may she doesnt see the future it has opened out before her in these last weeks as a dark confused thing  densher wondered after the tremendous time youve all been telling me she has had  thats it theres a shadow across it  the shadow you consider of some physical breakup  some physical breakdown nothing less shes scared she has so much to lose and she wants more  ah well said densher with a sudden strange sense of discomfort couldnt one say to her that she cant have everything  nofor one wouldnt want to she really kate went on has been somebody here ask aunt maudyou may think me prejudiced the girl oddly smiled aunt maud will tell youthe worlds before her it has all come since you saw her and its a pity youve missed it for it certainly would have amused you she has really been a perfect successi mean of course so far as possible in the scrap of timeand she has taken it like a perfect angel if you can imagine an angel with a thumping bankaccount youll have the simplest expression of the kind of thing her fortunes absolutely huge aunt maud has had all the facts or enough of them in the last confidence from susie and susie speaks by book take them then in the last confidence from me there she is kate expressed above all what it most came to its open to her to make you see the very greatest marriage i assure you were not vulgar about her her possibilities are quite plain  densher showed he neither disbelieved nor grudged them but what good then on earth can i do her  well she had it ready you can console her  and for what  for all that if shes stricken she must see swept away i shouldnt care for her if she hadnt so much kate very simply said and then as it made him laugh not quite happily i shouldnt trouble about her if there were one thing she did have the girl spoke indeed with a noble compassion she has nothing  not all the young dukes  well we must seesee if anything can come of them she at any rate does love life to have met a person like you kate further explained is to have felt you become with all the other fine things a part of life oh she has you arranged  you have it strikes me my dearand he looked both detached and rueful pray what am i to do with the dukes  oh the dukes will be disappointed  then why shant i be  youll have expected less kate wonderfully smiled besides you will be youll have expected enough for that  yet its what you want to let me in for  i want said the girl to make things pleasant for her i use for the purpose what i have youre what i have of most precious and youre therefore what i use most  he looked at her long i wish i could use you a little more after which as she continued to smile at him is it a bad case of lungs he asked  kate showed for a little as if she wished it might be not lungs i think isnt consumption taken in time now curable  people are no doubt patched up but he wondered do you mean she has something thats past patching and before she could answer its really as if her appearance put her outside of such thingsbeing in spite of her youth that of a person who has been through all its conceivable she should be exposed to she affects one i should say as a creature saved from a shipwreck such a creature may surely in these days on the doctrine of chances go to sea again with confidence she has had her wreckshe has met her adventure  oh i grant you her wreckkate was all response so far but do let her have still her adventure there are wrecks that are not adventures  wellif there be also adventures that are not wrecks densher in short was willing but he came back to his point what i mean is that she has none of the effecton ones nerves or whateverof an invalid  kate on her side did this justice nothats the beauty of her  the beauty  yes shes so wonderful she wont show for that any more than your watch when its about to stop for want of being wound up gives you convenient notice or shows as different from usual she wont die she wont live by inches she wont smell as it were of drugs she wont taste as it were of medicine no one will know  then what he demanded frankly mystified now are we talking about in what extraordinary state is she  kate went on as if at this making it out in a fashion for herself i believe that if shes ill at all shes very ill i believe that if shes bad shes not a little bad i cant tell you why but thats how i see her shell really live or shell really not shell have it all or shell miss it all now i dont think shell have it all  densher had followed this with his eyes upon her her own having thoughtfully wandered and as if it were more impressive than lucid you think and you dont think and yet you remain all the while without an inkling of her complaint  no not without an inkling but its a matter in which i dont want knowledge she moreover herself doesnt want one to want it she has as to what may be preying upon her a kind of ferocity of modesty a kind ofi dont know what to call itintensity of pride and then and then but with this she faltered  and then what  im a brute about illness i hate it its well for you my dear kate continued that youre as sound as a bell  thank you densher laughed its rather good then for yourself too that youre as strong as the sea  she looked at him now a moment as for the selfish gladness of their young immunities it was all they had together but they had it at least without a flaweach had the beauty the physical felicity the personal virtue love and desire of the other yet it was as if that very consciousness threw them back the next moment into pity for the poor girl who had everything else in the world the great genial good they alas didnt have but failed on the other hand of this how were talking about her kate compunctiously sighed but there were the facts from illness i keep away  but you dontsince here you are in spite of all you say in the midst of it  ah im only watching  and putting me forward in your place thank you  oh said kate im breaking you in let it give you the measure of what i shall expect of you one cant begin too soon  she drew away as from the impression of a stir on the balcony the hand of which he had a minute before possessed himself and the warning brought him back to attention you havent even an idea if its a case for surgery  i dare say it may be that is that if it comes to anything it may come to that of course shes in the highest hands  the doctors are after her then  shes after themits the same thing i think im free to say it nowshe sees sir luke strett  it made him quickly wince ah fifty thousand knives then after an instant one seems to guess  yes but she waved it away dont guess only do as i tell you  for a moment now in silence he took it all in might have had it before him what you want of me then is to make up to a sick girl  ah but you admit yourself that she doesnt affect you as sick you understand moreover just how muchand just how little  its amazing he presently answered what you think i understand  well if youve brought me to it my dear she returned that has been your way of breaking me in besides which so far as making up to her goes plenty of others will  densher for a little under this suggestion might have been seeing their young friend on a pile of cushions and in a perpetual teagown amid flowers and with drawn blinds surrounded by the higher nobility others can follow their tastes besides others are free  but so are you my dear  she had spoken with impatience and her suddenly quitting him had sharpened it in spite of which he kept his place only looking up at her youre prodigious  of course im prodigiousand as immediately happened she gave a further sign of it that he fairly sat watching the door from the lobby had as she spoke been thrown open for a gentleman who immediately finding her within his view advanced to greet her before the announcement of his name could reach her companion densher none the less felt himself brought quickly into relation kates welcome to the visitor became almost precipitately an appeal to her friend who slowly rose to meet it i dont know whether you know lord mark and then for the other party mr merton densherwho has just come back from america  oh said the other party while densher said nothingoccupied as he mainly was on the spot with weighing the sound in question he recognised it in a moment as less imponderable than it might have appeared as having indeed positive claims it wasnt that is he knew the oh of the idiot however great the superficial resemblance it was that of the clever the accomplished man it was the very specialty of the speaker and a deal of expensive training and experience had gone to producing it densher felt somehow that as a thing of value accidentally picked up it would retain an interest of curiosity the three stood for a little together in an awkwardness to which he was conscious of contributing his share kate failing to ask lord mark to be seated but letting him know that he would find mrs lowder with some others on the balcony  oh and miss theale i supposeas i seemed to hear outside from below mrs stringhams unmistakeable voice  yes but mrs stringhams alone millys unwell the girl explained and was compelled to disappoint us  ah disappointrather and lingering a little he kept his eyes on densher she isnt really bad i trust  densher after all he had heard easily supposed him interested in milly but he could imagine him also interested in the young man with whom he had found kate engaged and whom he yet considered without visible intelligence that young man concluded in a moment that he was doing what he wanted satisfying himself as to each to this he was aided by kate who produced a prompt oh dear no i think not ive just been reassuring mr densher she addedwhos as concerned as the rest of us ive been calming his fears  oh said lord mark againand again it was just as good that was for densher the latter could see or think he saw and then for the others my fears would want calming we must take great care of her this way  she went with him a few steps and while densher hanging about gave them frank attention presently paused again for some further colloquy what passed between them their observer lost but she was presently with him again lord mark joining the rest densher was by this time quite ready for her its he whos your aunts man  oh immensely  i mean for you  thats what i mean too kate smiled there he is now you can judge  judge of what  judge of him  why should i judge of him densher asked ive nothing to do with him  then why do you ask about him  to judge of youwhich is different  kate seemed for a little to look at the difference to take the measure do you mean of my danger  he hesitated then he said im thinking i dare say of miss theales how does your aunt reconcile his interest in her  with his interest in me  with her own interest in you densher said while she reflected if that interestmrs lowderstakes the form of lord mark hasnt he rather to look out for the forms he takes  kate seemed interested in the question but oh he takes them easily she answered the beauty is that she doesnt trust him  that milly doesnt  yesmilly either but i mean aunt maud not really  densher gave it his wonder takes him to her heart and yet thinks he cheats  yes said katethats the way people are what they think of their enemies goodness knows is bad enough but im still more struck with what they think of their friends millys own state of mind however she went on is lucky thats aunt mauds security though she doesnt yet fully recognise itbesides being millys own  you conceive it a real escape then not to care for him  she shook her head in beautiful grave deprecation you oughtnt to make me say too much but im glad i dont  dont say too much  dont care for lord mark  oh densher answered with a sound like his lordships own to which he added you absolutely hold that that poor girl doesnt  ah you know what i hold about that poor girl it had made her again impatient  yet he stuck a minute to the subject you scarcely call him i suppose one of the dukes  mercy nofar from it hes not compared with other possibilities in it milly its true she said to be exact has no natural sense of social values doesnt in the least understand our differences or know whos who or whats what  i see that densher laughed is her reason for liking me  precisely she doesnt resemble me said kate who at least know what i lose  well it had all risen for densher to a considerable interest and aunt maudwhy shouldnt she know i mean that your friend there isnt really anything does she suppose him of ducal value  scarcely save in the sense of being uncle to a duke thats undeniably something hes the best moreover we can get  oh oh said densher and his doubt was not all derisive  it isnt lord marks grandeur she went on without heeding this because perhaps in the line of that aloneas he has no moneymore could be done but shes not a bit sordid she only counts with the sordidness of others besides hes grand enough with a duke in his family and at the other end of the string the things his genius  and do you believe in that  in lord marks genius kate as if for a more final opinion than had yet been asked of her took a moment to think she balanced indeed so that one would scarce have known what to expect but she came out in time with a very sufficient yes  political  universal i dont know at least she said what else to call it when a mans able to make himself without effort without violence without machinery of any sort so intensely felt he has somehow an effect without his being in any traceable way a cause  ah but if the effect said densher with conscious superficiality isnt agreeable  oh but it is  not surely for every one  if you mean not for you kate returned you may have reasonsand men dont count women dont know if its agreeable or not  then there you are  yes preciselythat takes on his part genius  densher stood before her as if he wondered what everything she thus promptly easily and above all amusingly met him with would have been found should it have come to an analysis to take something suddenly as if under a last determinant touch welled up in him and overflowedthe sense of his good fortune and her variety of the future she promised the interest she supplied all women but you are stupid how can i look at another youre different and differentand then youre different again no marvel aunt maud builds on youexcept that youre so much too good for what she builds for even society wont know how good for it you are its too stupid and youre beyond it youd have to pull it uphillits you yourself who are at the top the women one meetswhat are they but books one has already read youre a whole library of the unknown the uncut he almost moaned he ached from the depth of his content upon my word ive a subscription  she took it from him with her face again giving out all it had in answer and they remained once more confronted and united in their essential wealth of life its you who draw me out i exist in you not in others  it had been however as if the thrill of their association itself pressed in him as great felicities do the sharp spring of fear see here you know dont dont  dont what  dont fail me it would kill me  she looked at him a minute with no response but her eyes so you think youll kill me in time to prevent it she smiled but he saw her the next instant as smiling through tears and the instant after this she had got in respect to the particular point quite off she had come back to another which was one of her own her own were so closely connected that denshers were at best but parenthetic still she had a distance to go you do then see your way she put it to him before they joinedas was high timethe others and she made him understand she meant his way with milly  he had dropped a little in presence of the explanation then she had brought him up to a sort of recognition he could make out by this light something of what he saw but a dimness also there was undispelled since his return theres something you must definitely tell me if our friend knows that all the while  she came straight to his aid formulating for him his anxiety though quite to smooth it down all the while she and i here were growing intimate you and i were in unmentioned relation if she knows that yes she knows our relation must have involved your writing to me  then how could she suppose you werent answering  she doesnt suppose it  how then can she imagine you never named her  she doesnt she knows now i did name her ive told her everything shes in possession of reasons that will perfectly do  still he just brooded she takes things from you exactly as i take them  exactly as you take them  shes just such another victim  just such another youre a pair  then if anything happens said densher we can console each other  ah something may indeed happen she returned if youll only go straight  he watched the others an instant through the window what do you mean by going straight  not worrying doing as you like try as ive told you before and youll see youll have me perfectly always to refer to  oh rather i hope but if shes going away  it pulled kate up but a moment ill bring her back there you are you wont be able to say i havent made it smooth for you  he faced it all and certainly it was queer but it wasnt the queerness that after another minute was uppermost he was in a wondrous silken web and it was amusing you spoil me  he wasnt sure if mrs lowder who at this juncture reappeared had caught his word as it dropped from him probably not he thought her attention being given to mrs stringham with whom she came through and who was now none too soon taking leave of her they were followed by lord mark and by the other men but two or three things happened before any dispersal of the company began one of these was that kate found time to say to him with furtive emphasis you must go now another was that she next addressed herself in all frankness to lord mark drew near to him with an almost reproachful come and talk to mea challenge resulting after a minute for densher in a consciousness of their installation together in an outoftheway corner though not the same he himself had just occupied with her still another was that mrs stringham in the random intensity of her farewells affected him as looking at him with a small grave intimation something into which he afterwards read the meaning that if he had happened to desire a few words with her after dinner he would have found her ready this impression was naturally light but it just left him with the sense of something by his own act overlooked unappreciated it gathered perhaps a slightly sharper shade from the mild formality of her goodnight sir as she passed him a matter as to which there was now nothing more to be done thanks to the alertness of the young man he by this time had appraised as even more harmless than himself this personage had forestalled him in opening the door for her and was evidentlywith a view densher might have judged to ulterior designs on millyproposing to attend her to her carriage what further occurred was that aunt maud having released her immediately had a word for himself it was an imperative wait a minute by which she both detained and dismissed him she was particular about her minute but he hadnt yet given her as happened a sign of withdrawal  return to our little friend youll find her really interesting  if you mean miss theale he said i shall certainly not forget her but you must remember that so far as her interest is concerned i myself discovered ias was said at dinnerinvented her  well one seemed rather to gather that you hadnt taken out the patent dont i only mean in the press of other things too much neglect her  affected surprised by the coincidence of her appeal with kates he asked himself quickly if it mightnt help him with her he at any rate could but try youre all looking after my manners thats exactly you know what miss croy has been saying to me she keeps me upshe has had so much to say about them  he found pleasure in being able to give his hostess an account of his passage with kate that while quite veracious might be reassuring to herself but aunt maud wonderfully and facing him straight took it as if her confidence were supplied with other props if she saw his intention in it she yet blinked neither with doubt nor with acceptance she only said imperturbably yes shell herself do anything for her friend so that she but preaches what she practises  densher really quite wondered if aunt maud knew how far kates devotion went he was moreover a little puzzled by this special harmony in face of which he quickly asked himself if mrs lowder had bethought herself of the american girl as a distraction for him and if kates mastery of the subject were therefore but an appearance addressed to her aunt what might really become in all this of the american girl was therefore a question that on the latter contingency would lose none of its sharpness however questions could wait and it was easy so far as he understood to meet mrs lowder it isnt a bit all the same you know that i resist i find miss theale charming  well it was all she wanted then dont miss a chance  the only thing is he went on that shesnaturally nowleaving town and as i take it going abroad  aunt maud looked indeed an instant as if she herself had been dealing with this difficulty she wont go she smiled in spite of it till she has seen you moreover when she does go she paused leaving him uncertain but the next minute he was still more at sea we shall go too  he gave a smile that he himself took for slightly strange and what good will that do me  we shall be near them somewhere and youll come out to us  oh he said a little awkwardly  ill see that you do i mean ill write to you  ah thank you thank you merton densher laughed she was indeed putting him on his honour and his honour winced a little at the use he rather helplessly saw himself suffering her to believe she could make of it there are all sorts of things he vaguely remarked to consider  no doubt but theres above all the great thing  and pray whats that  why the importance of your not losing the occasion of your life im treating you handsomely im looking after it for you i cani can smooth your path shes charming shes clever and shes good and her fortunes a real fortune  ah there she was aunt maud the pieces fell together for him as he felt her thus buying him off and buying himit would have been funny if it hadnt been so gravewith miss theales money he ventured derisive fairly to treat it as extravagant im much obliged to you for the handsome offer  of what doesnt belong to me she wasnt abashed i dont say it doesbut theres no reason it shouldnt to you mind you moreovershe kept it upim not one who talks in the air and you owe me somethingif you want to know why  distinct he felt her pressure he felt given her basis her consistency he even felt to a degree that was immediately to receive an odd confirmation her truth her truth for that matter was that she believed him bribeable a belief that for his own mind as well while they stood there lighted up the impossible what then in this light did kate believe him but that wasnt what he asked aloud of course i know i owe you thanks for a deal of kind treatment your inviting me for instance tonight  yes my inviting you tonights a part of it but you dont know she added how far ive gone for you  he felt himself red and as if his honour were colouring up but he laughed again as he could i see how far youre going  im the most honest woman in the world but ive nevertheless done for you what was necessary and then as her now quite sombre gravity only made him stare to start you it was necessary from me it has the weight he but continued to stare and she met his blankness with surprise dont you understand me ive told the proper lie for you still he only showed her his flushed strained smile in spite of which speaking with force and as if he must with a minutes reflexion see what she meant she turned away from him i depend upon you now to make me right  the minutes reflexion he was of course more free to take after he had left the house he walked up the bayswater road but he stopped short under the murky stars before the modern church in the middle of the square that going eastward opened out on his left he had had his brief stupidity but now he understood she had guaranteed to milly theale through mrs stringham that kate didnt care for him she had affirmed through the same source that the attachment was only his he made it out he made it out and he could see what she meant by its starting him she had described kate as merely compassionate so that milly might be compassionate too proper indeed it was her liethe very properest possible and the most deeply richly diplomatic so milly was successfully deceived   v  to see her alone the poor girl he none the less promptly felt was to see her after all very much on the old basis the basis of his three visits in new york the new element when once he was again face to face with her not really amounting to much more than a recognition with a little surprise of the positive extent of the old basis everything but that everything embarrassing fell away after he had been present five minutes it was in fact wonderful that their excellent their pleasant their permitted and proper and harmless american relationthe legitimacy of which he could thus scarce express in names enoughshould seem so unperturbed by other matters they had both since then had great adventuressuch an adventure for him was his mental annexation of her country and it was now for the moment as if the greatest of them all were this acquired consciousness of reasons other than those that had already served densher had asked for her at her hotel the day after aunt mauds dinner with a rich that is with a highly troubled preconception of the part likely to be played for him at present in any contact with her by kates and mrs lowders so oddly conjoined and so really superfluous attempts to make her interesting she had been interesting enough without themthat appeared today to come back to him and admirable and beautiful as was the charitable zeal of the two ladies it might easily have nipped in the bud the germs of a friendship inevitably limited but still perfectly open to him what had happily averted the need of his breaking off what would as happily continue to avert it was his own good sense and good humour a certain spring of mind in him which ministered imagination aiding to understandings and allowances and which he had positively never felt such ground as just now to rejoice in the possession of many menhe practically made the reflexionwouldnt have taken the matter that way would have lost patience finding the appeal in question irrational exorbitant and thereby making short work with it would have let it render any further acquaintance with miss theale impossible he had talked with kate of this young womans being sacrificed and that would have been one way so far as he was concerned to sacrifice her such however had not been the tune to which his at first bewildered view had since the night before cleared itself up it wasnt so much that he failed of being the kind of man who chucked for he knew himself as the kind of man wise enough to mark the case in which chucking might be the minor evil and the least cruelty it was that he liked too much every one concerned willingly to show himself merely impracticable he liked kate goodness knew and he also clearly enough liked mrs lowder he liked in particular milly herself and hadnt it come up for him the evening before that he quite liked even susan shepherd he had never known himself so generally merciful it was a footing at all events whatever accounted for it on which he should surely be rather a muff not to manage by one turn or another to escape disobliging should he find he couldnt work it there would still be time enough the idea of working it crystallised before him in such guise as not only to promise much interestfairly in case of success much enthusiasm but positively to impart to failure an appearance of barbarity  arriving thus in brook street both with the best intentions and with a margin consciously left for some primary awkwardness he found his burden to his great relief unexpectedly light the awkwardness involved in the responsibility so newly and so ingeniously traced for him turned round on the spot to present him another face this was simply the face of his old impression which he now fully recoveredthe impression that american girls when rare case they had the attraction of milly were clearly the easiest people in the world had what had happened been that this specimen of the class was from the first so committed to ease that nothing subsequent could ever make her difficult that affected him now as still more probable than on the occasion of the hour or two lately passed with her in kates society milly theale had recognised no complication to denshers view while bringing him with his companion from the national gallery and entertaining them at luncheon it was therefore scarce supposable that complications had become so soon too much for her his pretext for presenting himself was fortunately of the best and simplest the least he could decently do given their happy acquaintance was to call with an enquiry after learning that she had been prevented by illness from meeting him at dinner and then there was the beautiful accident of her other demonstration he must at any rate have given a sign as a sequel to the hospitality he had shared with kate well he was giving one nowsuch as it was he was finding her to begin with accessible and very naturally and prettily glad to see him he had come after luncheon early though not so early but that she might already be out if she were well enough and she was well enough and yet was still at home he had an inner glimpse with this of the comment kate would have made on it it wasnt absent from his thought that milly would have been at home by her account because expecting after a talk with mrs stringham that a certain person might turn up he evenso pleasantly did things goenjoyed freedom of mind to welcome on that supposition a fresh sign of the beautiful hypocrisy of women he went so far as to enjoy believing the girl might have stayed in for him it helped him to enjoy her behaving as if she hadnt she expressed that is exactly the right degree of surprise she didnt a bit overdo it the lesson of which was perceptibly that so far as his late lights had opened the door to any want of the natural in their meetings he might trust her to take care of it for him as well as for herself she had begun this admirably on his entrance with her turning away from the table at which she had apparently been engaged in letterwriting it was the very possibility of his betraying a concern for her as one of the afflicted that she had within the first minute conjured away she was never neverdid he understandto be one of the afflicted for him and the manner in which he understood it something of the answering pleasure that he couldnt help knowing he showed constituted he was very soon after to acknowledge something like a start for intimacy when things like that could pass people had in truth to be equally conscious of a relation it soon made one at all events when it didnt find one made she had let him askthere had been time for that his allusion to her friends explanatory arrival at lancaster gate without her being inevitable but she had blown away and quite as much with the look in her eyes as with the smile on her lips every ground for anxiety and every chance for insistence how was shewhy she was as he thus saw her and as she had reasons of her own nobody elses business for desiring to appear kates account of her as too proud for pity as fiercely shy about so personal a secret came back to him so that he rejoiced he could take a hint especially when he wanted to the question the girl had quickly disposed ofoh it was nothing im all right thank youwas one he was glad enough to be able to banish it wasnt at all in spite of the appeal kate had made to him on it his affair for his interest had been invoked in the name of compassion and the name of compassion was exactly what he felt himself at the end of two minutes forbidden so much as to whisper he had been sent to see her in order to be sorry for her and how sorry he might be quite privately he was yet to make out didnt that signify however almost not at allinasmuch as whatever his upshot he was never to give her a glimpse of it thus the ground was unexpectedly cleared though it was not till a slightly longer time had passed that he read clear at first with amusement and then with a strange shade of respect what had most operated extraordinarily quite amazingly he began to see that if his pity hadnt had to yield to still other things it would have had to yield quite definitely to her own that was the way the case had turned round he had made his visit to be sorry for her but he would repeat itif he did repeat itin order that she might be sorry for him his situation made him she judgedwhen once one liked hima subject for that degree of tenderness he felt this judgement in her and felt it as something he should really in decency in dignity in common honesty have very soon to reckon with  odd enough was it certainly that the question originally before him the question placed there by kate should so of a sudden find itself quite dislodged by another this other it was easy to see came straight up with the fact of her beautiful delusion and her wasted charity the whole thing preparing for him as pretty a case of conscience as he could have desired and one at the prospect of which he was already wincing if he was interesting it was because he was unhappy and if he was unhappy it was because his passion for kate had spent itself in vain and if kate was indifferent inexorable it was because she had left milly in no doubt of it that above all was what came up for himhow clear an impression of this attitude how definite an account of his own failure kate must have given her friend his immediate quarter of an hour there with the girl lighted up for him almost luridly such an inference it was almost as if the other party to their remarkable understanding had been with them as they talked had been hovering about had dropped in to look after her work the value of the work affected him as different from the moment he saw it so expressed in poor milly since it was false that he wasnt loved so his right was quite quenched to figure on that ground as important and if he didnt look out he should find himself appreciating in a way quite at odds with straightness the good faith of millys benevolence there was the place for scruples there the need absolutely to mind what he was about if it wasnt proper for him to enjoy consideration on a perfectly false footing where was the guarantee that if he kept on he mightnt soon himself pretend to the grievance in order not to miss the sweet considerationfrom a charming girlwas soothing on whatever theory and it didnt take him far to remember that he had himself as yet done nothing deceptive it was kates description of him his defeated state it was none of his own his responsibility would begin as he might say only with acting it out the sharp point was however in the difference between acting and not acting this difference in fact it was that made the case of conscience he saw it with a certain alarm rise before him that everything was acting that was not speaking the particular word if you like me because you think she doesnt it isnt a bit true she does like me awfullythat would have been the particular word which there were at the same time but too palpably such difficulties about his uttering wouldnt it be virtually as indelicate to challenge her as to leave her deludedand this quite apart from the exposure so to speak of kate as to whom it would constitute a kind of betrayal kates design was something so extraordinarily special to kate that he felt himself shrink from the complications involved in judging it not to give away the woman one loved but to back her up in her mistakesonce they had gone a certain lengththat was perhaps chief among the inevitabilities of the abjection of love loyalty was of course supremely prescribed in presence of any design on her part however roundabout to do one nothing but good  densher had quite to steady himself not to be awestruck at the immensity of the good his own friend must on all this evidence have wanted to do him of one thing indeed meanwhile he was sure milly theale wouldnt herself precipitate his necessity of intervention she would absolutely never say to him is it so impossible she shall ever care for you seriouslywithout which nothing could well be less delicate than for him aggressively to set her right kate would be free to do that if kate in some prudence some contrition for some better reason in fine should revise her plan but he asked himself what failing this he could do that wouldnt be after all more gross than doing nothing this brought him round again to the acceptance of the fact that the poor girl liked him she put it for reasons of her own on a simple a beautiful ground a ground that already supplied her with the pretext she required the ground was there that is in the impression she had received retained cherished the pretext over and above it was the pretext for acting on it that she now believed as she did made her sure at last that she might act so that what densher therefore would have struck at would be the root in her soul of a pure pleasure it positively lifted its head and flowered this pure pleasure while the young man now sat with her and there were things she seemed to say that took the words out of his mouth these were not all the things she did say they were rather what such things meant in the light of what he knew her warning him for instance off the question of how she was the quick brave little art with which she did that represented to his fancy a truth she didnt utter im well for youthats all you have to do with or need trouble about i shall never be anything so horrid as ill for you so there you are worry about me spare me please as little as you can dont be afraid in short to ignore my interesting side it isnt you see even now while you sit here that there arent lots of others only do them justice and we shall get on beautifully this was what was folded finely up in her talkall quite ostensibly about her impressions and her intentions she tried to put densher again on his american doings but he wouldnt have that today as he thought of the way in which the other afternoon before kate he had sat complacently jawing he accused himself of excess of having overdone it having madeat least apparentlymore of a set at their entertainer than he was at all events then intending he turned the tables drawing her out about london about her vision of life there and only too glad to treat her as a person with whom he could easily have other topics than her aches and pains he spoke to her above all of the evidence offered him at lancaster gate that she had come but to conquer and when she had met this with full and gay assenthow could i help being the feature of the season the whatdoyoucallit the theme of every tonguethey fraternised freely over all that had come and gone for each since their interrupted encounter in new york  at the same time while many things in quick succession came up for them came up in particular for densher nothing perhaps was just so sharp as the odd influence of their present conditions on their view of their past ones it was as if they hadnt known how thick they had originally become as if in a manner they had really fallen to remembrance of more passages of intimacy than there had in fact at the time quite been room for they were in a relation now so complicated whether by what they said or by what they didnt say that it might have been seeking to justify its speedy growth by reaching back to one of those fabulous periods in which prosperous states place their beginnings he recalled what had been said at mrs lowders about the steps and stages in peoples careers that absence caused one to miss and about the resulting frequent sense of meeting them further on which with some other matters also recalled he took occasion to communicate to milly the matters he couldnt mention mingled themselves with those he did so that it would doubtless have been hard to say which of the two groups now played most of a part he was kept face to face with this young lady by a force absolutely resident in their situation and operating for his nerves with the swiftness of the forces commonly regarded by sensitive persons as beyond their control the current thus determined had positively become for him by the time he had been ten minutes in the room something that but for the absurdity of comparing the very small with the very great he would freely have likened to the rapids of niagara an uncriticised acquaintance between a clever young man and a responsive young woman could do nothing more at the most than go and his actual experiment went and went and went nothing probably so conduced to make it go as the marked circumstance that they had spoken all the while not a word about kate and this in spite of the fact that if it were a question for them of what had occurred in the past weeks nothing had occurred comparable to kates predominance densher had but the night before appealed to her for instruction as to what he must do about her but he fairly winced to find how little this came to she had foretold him of course how little but it was a truth that looked different when shown him by milly it proved to him that the latter had in fact been dealt with but it produced in him the thought that kate might perhaps again conveniently be questioned he would have liked to speak to her before going furtherto make sure she really meant him to succeed quite so much with all the difference that as we say came up for him it came up afresh naturally that he might make his visit brief and never renew it yet the strangest thing of all was that the argument against that issue would have sprung precisely from the beautiful little eloquence involved in millys avoidances  precipitate these well might be since they emphasised the fact that she was proceeding in the sense of the assurances she had taken over the latter she had visibly not hesitated for hadnt they had the merit of giving her a chance densher quite saw her felt her take it the chance neither more nor less of help rendered him according to her freedom it was what kate had left her with listen to him i never so do as you like what milly liked was to do it thus appeared as she was doing our young mans glimpse of which was just what would have been for him not less a glimpse of the peculiar brutality of shaking her off the choice exhaled its shy fragrance of heroism for it was not aided by any question of parting with kate she would be charming to kate as well as to kates adorer she would incur whatever pain could dwell for her in the sightshould she continue to be exposed to the sightof the adorer thrown with the adored it wouldnt really have taken much more to make him wonder if he hadnt before him one of those rare cases of exaltationfood for fiction food for poetryin which a mans fortune with the woman who doesnt care for him is positively promoted by the woman who does it was as if milly had said to herself well he can at least meet her in my society if thats anything to him so that my line can only be to make my society attractive she certainly couldnt have made a different impression if she had so reasoned all of which none the less didnt prevent his soon enough saying to her quite as if she were to be whirled into space and now then what becomes of you do you begin to rush about on visits to countryhouses  she disowned the idea with a headshake that put on what face she would couldnt help betraying to him something of her suppressed view of the possibilityever ever perhapsof any such proceedings they werent at any rate for her now dear no we go abroad for a few weeks somewhere of high air that has been before us for many days weve only been kept on by last necessities here however everythings done and the winds in our sails  may you scud then happily before it but when he asked do you come back  she looked ever so vague then as if to correct it oh when the wind turns and what do you do with your summer  ah i spend it in sordid toil i drench it with mercenary ink my work in your country counts for play as well you see whats thought of the pleasure your country can give my holidays over  im sorry you had to take it said milly at such a different time from ours if you could but have worked while weve been working  i might be playing while you play oh the distinction isnt so great with me theres a little of each for me of work and of play in either but you and mrs stringham with miss croy and mrs lowderyou all he went on have been given up like navvies or niggers to real physical toil your rest is something youve earned and you need my labours comparatively light  very true she smiled but all the same i like mine  it doesnt leave you done  not a bit i dont get tired when im interested oh i could go far  he bethought himself then why dont yousince youve got here as i learn the whole place in your pocket  well its a kind of economyim saving things up ive enjoyed so what you speak ofthough your account of its fantasticthat im watching over its future that i cant help being anxious and careful i wantin the interest itself of what ive had and may still havenot to make stupid mistakes the way not to make them is to get off again to a distance and see the situation from there i shall keep it fresh she wound up as if herself rather pleased with the ingenuity of her statementi shall keep it fresh by that prudence for my return  ah then you will return can you promise one that  her face fairly lighted at his asking for a promise but she made as if bargaining a little isnt london rather awful in winter  he had been going to ask her if she meant for the invalid but he checked the infelicity of this and took the enquiry as referring to social life noi like it with one thing and another its less of a mob than later on and it would have for us the meritshould you come here thenthat we should probably see more of you so do reappear for usif it isnt a question of climate  she looked at that a little graver if what isnt a question  why the determination of your movements you spoke just now of going somewhere for that  for better airshe remembered oh yes one certainly wants to get out of london in august  rather of coursehe fully understood though im glad youve hung on long enough for me to catch you try us at any rate he continued once more  whom do you mean by us she presently asked  it pulled him up an instantrepresenting as he saw it might have seemed an allusion to himself as conjoined with kate whom he was proposing not to mention any more than his hostess did but the issue was easy i mean all of us together every one youll find ready to surround you with sympathy  it made her none the less in her odd charming way challenge him afresh why do you say sympathy  well its doubtless a pale word what we shall feel for you will be much nearer worship  as near then as you like with which at last kates name was sounded the people id most come back for are the people you know id do it for mrs lowder who has been beautifully kind to me  so she has to me said densher i feel he added as she at first answered nothing that quite contrary to anything i originally expected ive made a good friend of her  i didnt expect it eitherits turning out as it has but i did said milly with kate i shall come back for her too id do anythingshe kept it upfor kate  looking at him as with conscious clearness while she spoke she might for the moment have effectively laid a trap for whatever remains of the ideal straightness in him were still able to pull themselves together and operate he was afterwards to say to himself that something had at that moment hung for him by a hair oh i know what one would do for kateit had hung for him by a hair to break out with that which he felt he had really been kept from by an element in his consciousness stronger still the proof of the truth in question was precisely in his silence resisting the impulse to break out was what he was doing for kate this at the time moreover came and went quickly enough he was trying the next minute but to make millys allusion easy for herself of course i know what friends you areand of course i understand he permitted himself to add any amount of devotion to a person so charming thats the good turn then shell do us alli mean her working for your return  oh you dont know said milly how much im really on her hands  he could but accept the appearance of wondering how much he might show he knew ah shes very masterful  shes great yet i dont say she bullies me  nothats not the way at any rate it isnt hers he smiled he remembered however then that an undue acquaintance with kates ways was just what he mustnt show and he pursued the subject no further than to remark with a good intention that had the further merit of representing a truth i dont feel as if i knew herreally to call know  well if you come to that i dont either she laughed the words gave him as soon as they were uttered a sense of responsibility for his own though during a silence that ensued for a minute he had time to recognise that his own contained after all no element of falsity strange enough therefore was it that he could go too farif it was too farwithout being false his observation was one he would perfectly have made to kate herself and before he again spoke and before milly did he took time for more stillfor feeling how just here it was that he must break short off if his mind was really made up not to go further it was as if he had been at a cornerand fairly put there by his last speech so that it depended on him whether or no to turn it the silence if prolonged but an instant might even have given him a sense of her waiting to see what he would do it was filled for them the next thing by the sound rather voluminous for the august afternoon of the approach in the street below them of heavy carriagewheels and of horses trained to step a rumble a great shake a considerable effective clatter had been apparently succeeded by a pause at the door of the hotel which was in turn accompanied by a due display of diminished prancing and stamping youve a visitor densher laughed and it must be at least an ambassador  its only my own carriage it does thatisnt it wonderfulevery day but we find it mrs stringham and i in the innocence of our hearts very amusing she had got up as she spoke to assure herself of what she said and at the end of a few steps they were together on the balcony and looking down at her waiting chariot which made indeed a brave show is it very awful  it was to denshers eyessave for its absurd heavinessonly pleasantly pompous it seems to me delightfully rococo but how do i know youre mistress of these things in contact with the highest wisdom you occupy a position moreover thanks to which your carriagewell by this time in the eye of london also occupies one but she was going out and he mustnt stand in her way what had happened the next minute was first that she had denied she was going out so that he might prolong his stay and second that she had said she would go out with pleasure if he would like to drivethat in fact there were always things to do that there had been a question for her today of several in particular and that this in short was why the carriage had been ordered so early they perceived as she said these things that an enquirer had presented himself and coming back they found millys servant announcing the carriage and prepared to accompany her this appeared to have for her the effect of settling the matteron the basis that is of denshers happy response denshers happy response however had as yet hung fire the process we have described in him operating by this time with extreme intensity the system of not pulling up not breaking off had already brought him headlong he seemed to feel to where they actually stood and just now it was with a vengeance that he must do either one thing or the other he had been waiting for some moments which probably seemed to him longer than they were this was because he was anxiously watching himself wait he couldnt keep that up for ever and since one thing or the other was what he must do it was for the other that he presently became conscious of having decided if he had been drifting it settled itself in the manner of a bump of considerable violence against a firm object in the stream oh yes ill go with you with pleasure its a charming idea  she gave no look to thank himshe rather looked away she only said at once to her servant in ten minutes and then to her visitor as the man went out well go somewherei shall like that but i must ask of you timeas little as possibleto get ready she looked over the room to provide for him keep him there there are books and thingsplenty and i dress very quickly he caught her eyes only as she went on which he thought them pretty and touching  why especially touching at that instant he could certainly scarce have said it was involved it was lost in the sense of her wishing to oblige him clearly what had occurred was her having wished it so that she had made him simply wish in civil acknowledgement to oblige her which he had now fully done by turning his corner he was quite round it his corner by the time the door had closed upon her and he stood there alone alone he remained for three minutes moreremained with several very living little matters to think about one of these was the phenomenontypical highly american he would have saidof millys extreme spontaneity it was perhaps rather as if he had sought refugerefuge from another questionin the almost exclusive contemplation of this yet this in its way led him nowhere not even to a sound generalisation about american girls it was spontaneous for his young friend to have asked him to drive with her alonesince she hadnt mentioned her companion but she struck him after all as no more advanced in doing it than kate for instance who wasnt an american girl might have struck him in not doing it besides kate would have done it though kate wasnt at all in the same sense as milly spontaneous and then in addition kate had done itor things very like it furthermore he was engaged to kateeven if his ostensibly not being put her public freedom on other grounds on all grounds at any rate the relation between kate and freedom between freedom and kate was a different one from any he could associate or cultivate as to anything with the girl who had just left him to prepare to give herself up to him it had never struck him before and he moved about the room while he thought of it touching none of the books placed at his disposal milly was forward as might be said but not advanced whereas kate was backwardbackward still comparatively as an english girland yet advanced in a high degree howeverthough this didnt straighten it outkate was of course two or three years older which at their time of life considerably counted  thus ingeniously discriminating densher continued slowly to wander yet without keeping at bay for long the sense of having rounded his corner he had so rounded it that he felt himself lose even the option of taking advantage of millys absence to retrace his steps if he might have turned tail vulgarly speaking five minutes before he couldnt turn tail now he must simply wait there with his consciousness charged to the brim quickly enough moreover that issue was closed from without in the course of three minutes more miss theales servant had returned he preceded a visitor whom he had met obviously at the foot of the stairs and whom throwing open the door he loudly announced as miss croy kate on following him in stopped short at sight of densheronly after an instant as the young man saw with free amusement not from surprise and still less from discomfiture densher immediately gave his explanationmiss theale had gone to prepare to driveon receipt of which the servant effaced himself  and youre going with her kate asked  yeswith your approval which ive taken as you see for granted  oh she laughed my approvals complete she was thoroughly consistent and handsome about it  what i mean is of course he went onfor he was sensibly affected by her gaietyat your so lively instigation  she had looked about the roomshe might have been vaguely looking for signs of the duration of the character of his visit a momentary aid in taking a decision well instigation then as much as you like she treated it as pleasant the success of her plea with him she made a fresh joke of this direct impression of it so much so as that do you know i think i wont wait  not to see herafter coming  well with you in the field i came for news of her but she must be all right if she is  but he took her straight up ah how do i know he was moved to say more its not i who am responsible for her my dear it seems to me its you she struck him as making light of a matter that had been costing him sundry qualms so that they couldnt both be quite just either she was too easy or he had been too anxious he didnt want at all events to feel a fool for that im doing nothingand shall not i assure you do anything but what im told  their eyes met with some intensity over the emphasis he had given his words and he had taken it from her the next moment that he really neednt get into a state what in the world was the matter she asked it with interest for all answer isnt she betterif shes able to see you  she assures me shes in perfect health  kates interest grew i knew she would on which she added it wont have been really for illness that she stayed away last night  for what then  wellfor nervousness  nervousness about what  oh you know she spoke with a hint of impatience smiling however the next moment ive told you that  he looked at her to recover in her face what she had told him then it was as if what he saw there prompted him to say what have you told her  she gave him her controlled smile and it was all as if they remembered where they were liable to surprise talking with softened voices even stretching their opportunity by such talk beyond a quite right feeling millys room would be close at hand and yet they were saying things for a moment none the less they kept it up ask her if you like youre freeshell tell you act as you think best dont trouble about what you think i may or maynt have told im all right with her said kate so there you are  if you mean here i am he answered its unmistakeable if you also mean that her believing in you is all i have to do with youre so far right as that she certainly does believe in you  well then take example by her  shes really doing it for you densher continued shes driving me out for you  in that case said kate with her soft tranquillity you can do it a little for her im not afraid she smiled  he stood before her a moment taking in again the face she put on it and affected again as he had already so often been by more things in this face and in her whole person and presence than he was to his relief obliged to find words for it wasnt under such impressions a question of words i do nothing for any one in the world but you but for you ill do anything  good good said kate thats how i like you  he waited again an instant then you swear to it  to it to what  why that you do like me since its all for that you know that im letting you dowell god knows what with me  she gave at this with a stare a disheartened gesturethe sense of which she immediately further expressed if you dont believe in me then after all hadnt you better break off before youve gone further  break off with you  break off with milly you might go now she said and ill stay and explain to her why it is  he wonderedas if it struck him what would you say  why that you find you cant stand her and that theres nothing for me but to bear with you as i best may  he considered of this how much do you abuse me to her  exactly enough as much as you see by her attitude  again he thought it doesnt seem to me i ought to mind her attitude  well then just as you like ill stay and do my best for you  he saw she was sincere was really giving him a chance and that of itself made things clearer the feeling of how far he had gone came back to him not in repentance but in this very vision of an escape and it was not of what he had done but of what kate offered that he now weighed the consequence wont it make herher not finding me herebe rather more sure theres something between us  kate thought oh i dont know it will of course greatly upset her but you neednt trouble about that she wont die of it  do you mean she will densher presently asked  dont put me questions when you dont believe what i say you make too many conditions  she spoke now with a shade of rational weariness that made the want of pliancy the failure to oblige her look poor and ugly so that what it suddenly came back to for him was his deficiency in the things a man of any taste so engaged so enlisted would have liked to make sure of being able to showimagination tact positively even humour the circumstance is doubtless odd but the truth is none the less that the speculation uppermost with him at this juncture was what if i should begin to bore this creature and that within a few seconds had translated itself if youll swear again you love me  she looked about at door and window as if he were asking for more than he said here theres nothing between us here kate smiled  oh isnt there her smile itself with this had so settled something for him that he had come to her pleadingly and holding out his hands which she immediately seized with her own as if both to check him and to keep him it was by keeping him thus for a minute that she did check him she held him long enough while with their eyes deeply meeting they waited in silence for him to recover himself and renew his discretion he coloured as with a return of the sense of where they were and that gave her precisely one of her usual victories which immediately took further form by the time he had dropped her hands he had again taken hold as it were of millys it was not at any rate with milly he had broken ill do all you wish he declared as if to acknowledge the acceptance of his condition that he had practically after all drawn from hera declaration on which she then recurring to her first idea promptly acted  if you are as good as that i go youll tell her that finding you with her i wouldnt wait say that you know from yourself shell understand  she had reached the door with itshe was full of decision but he had before she left him one more doubt i dont see how she can understand enough you know without understanding too much  you dont need to see  he required then a last injunction i must simply go it blind  you must simply be kind to her  and leave the rest to you  leave the rest to her said kate disappearing  it came back then afresh to that as it had come before milly three minutes after kate had gone returned in her arrayher big black hat so little superstitiously in the fashion her fine black garments throughout the swathing of her throat which densher vaguely took for an infinite number of yards of priceless lace and which its folded fabric kept in place by heavy rows of pearls hung down to her feet like the stole of a priestess he spoke to her at once of their friends visit and flight she hadnt known shed find me he saidand said at present without difficulty he had so rounded his corner that it wasnt a question of a word more or less  she took this account of the matter as quite sufficient she glossed over whatever might be awkward im sorrybut i of course often see her he felt the discrimination in his favour and how it justified kate this was millys tone when the matter was left to her well it should now be wholly left     book seventh  i  when kate and densher abandoned her to mrs stringham on the day of her meeting them together and bringing them to luncheon milly face to face with that companion had had one of those moments in which the warned the anxious fighter of the battle of life as if once again feeling for the sword at his side carries his hand straight to the quarter of his courage she laid hers firmly on her heart and the two women stood there showing each other a strange front susan shepherd had received their great doctors visit which had been clearly no small affair for her but milly had since then with insistence kept in place against communication and betrayal as she now practically confessed the barrier of their invited guests youve been too dear with what i see youre full of you treated them beautifully isnt kate charming when she wants to be  poor susies expression contending at first as in a high fine spasm with different dangers had now quite let itself go she had to make an effort to reach a point in space already so remote miss croy oh she was pleasant and clever she knew mrs stringham added she knew  milly braced herselfbut conscious above all at the moment of a high compassion for her mate she made her out as strugglingstruggling in all her nature against the betrayal of pity which in itself given her nature could only be a torment milly gathered from the struggle how much there was of the pity and how therefore it was both in her tenderness and in her conscience that mrs stringham suffered wonderful and beautiful it was that this impression instantly steadied the girl ruefully asking herself on what basis of ease with the drop of their barrier they were to find themselves together she felt the question met with a relief that was almost joy the basis the inevitable basis was that she was going to be sorry for susie who to all appearance had been condemned in so much more uncomfortable a manner to be sorry for her mrs stringhams sorrow would hurt mrs stringham but how could her own ever hurt she had the poor girl at all events on the spot five minutes of exaltation in which she turned the tables on her friend with a pass of the hand a gesture of an energy that made a wind in the air kate knew she asked that you were full of sir luke strett  she spoke of nothing but she was gentle and nice she seemed to want to help me through which the good lady had no sooner said however than she almost tragically gasped at herself she glared at milly with a pretended pluck what i mean is that she saw one had been taken up with something when i say she knows i should say shes a person who guesses and her grimace was also on its side heroic but she doesnt matter milly  the girl felt she by this time could face anything nobody matters susie nobody which her next words however rather contradicted did he take it ill that i wasnt here to see him wasnt it really just what he wantedto have it out so much more simply with you  we didnt have anything out milly mrs stringham delicately quavered  didnt he awfully like you milly went on and didnt he think you the most charming person i could possibly have referred him to for an account of me didnt you hit it off tremendously together and in fact fall quite in love so that it will really be a great advantage for you to have me as a common ground youre going to make i can see no end of a good thing of me  my own child my own child mrs stringham pleadingly murmured yet showing as she did so that she feared the effect even of deprecation  isnt he beautiful and good too himselfaltogether whatever he may say a lovely acquaintance to have made youre just the right people for mei see it now and do you know what between you you must do then as susie still but stared wonderstruck and holding herself you must simply see me through any way you choose make it out together i on my side will be beautiful too and well bethe three of us with whatever others oh as many as the case requires any one you likea sight for the gods ill be as easy for you as carrying a feather susie took it for a moment in such silence that her young friend almost saw herand scarcely withheld the observationas taking it for a part of the disease this accordingly helped milly to be as she judged definite and wise hes at any rate awfully interesting isnt hewhich is so much to the good we havent at leastas we might have with the way we tumbled into itgot hold of one of the dreary  interesting dearestmrs stringham felt her feet firmer i dont know if hes interesting or not but i do know my own she continued to quaver that hes just as much interested as you could possibly desire  certainlythats it like all the world  no my precious not like all the world very much more deeply and intelligently  ah there you are milly laughed thats the way susie i want you so buck up my dear well have beautiful times with him dont worry  im not worrying milly and poor susies face registered the sublimity of her lie  it was at this that too sharply penetrated her companion went to her met by her with an embrace in which things were said that exceeded speech each held and clasped the other as if to console her for this unnamed woe the woe for mrs stringham of learning the torment of helplessness the woe for milly of having her at such a time to think of millys assumption was immense and the difficulty for her friend was that of not being able to gainsay it without bringing it more to the proof than tenderness and vagueness could permit nothing in fact came to the proof between them but that they could thus cling togetherexcept indeed that as we have indicated the pledge of protection and support was all the younger womans own i dont ask you she presently said what he told you for yourself nor what he told you to tell me nor how he took it really that i had left him to you nor what passed between you about me in any way it wasnt to get that out of you that i took my means to make sure of your meeting freelyfor there are things i dont want to know i shall see him again and again and shall know more than enough all i do want is that you shall see me through on his basis whatever it is which its enoughfor the purposethat you yourself should know that is with him to show you how ill make it charming for youthats what i mean ill keep you up to it in such a way that half the time you wont know youre doing it and for that youre to rest upon me there its understood we keep each other going and you may absolutely feel of me that i shant break down so with the way you havent so much as a dig of the elbow to fear how could you be safer  he told me i can help youof course he told me that susie on her side eagerly contended why shouldnt he and for what else have i come out with you but he told me nothing dreadfulnothing nothing nothing the poor lady passionately protested only that you must do as you like and as he tells youwhich is just simply to do as you like  i must keep in sight of him i must from time to time go to him but thats of course doing as i like its lucky milly smiled that i like going to him  mrs stringham was here in agreement she gave a clutch at the account of their situation that most showed it as workable thats what will be charming for me and what im sure he really wants of meto help you to do as you like  and also a little wont it be milly laughed to save me from the consequences of course she added there must first be things i like  oh i think youll find some mrs stringham more bravely said i think there are someas for instance just this one i mean she explained really having us so  milly thought just as if i wanted you comfortable about him and him the same about you yesi shall get the good of it  susan shepherd appeared to wander from this into a slight confusion which of them are you talking of  milly wondered an instantthen had a light im not talking of mr densher with which moreover she showed amusement though if you can be comfortable about mr densher too so much the better  oh you meant sir luke strett certainly hes a fine type do you know susie continued whom he reminds me of of our great mandr buttrick of boston  milly recognised dr buttrick of boston but she dropped him after a tributary pause what do you think now that youve seen him of mr densher  it was not till after consideration with her eyes fixed on her friends that susie produced her answer i think hes very handsome  milly remained smiling at her though putting on a little the manner of a teacher with a pupil well that will do for the first time i have done she went on what i wanted  then thats all we want you see there are plenty of things  milly shook her head for the plenty the best is not to knowthat includes them all i donti dont know nothing about anythingexcept that youre with me remember that please there wont be anything that on my side for you i shall forget so its all right  the effect of it by this time was fairly as intended to sustain susie who dropped in spite of herself into the reassuring most certainly its all right i think you ought to understand that he sees no reason  why i shouldnt have a grand long life milly had taken it straight up as to understand it and for a moment consider it but she disposed of it otherwise oh of course i know that she spoke as if her friends point were small  mrs stringham tried to enlarge it well what i mean is that he didnt say to me anything that he hasnt said to yourself  reallyi would in his place she might have been disappointed but she had her good humour he tells me to liveand she oddly limited the word  it left susie a little at sea then what do you want more  my dear the girl presently said i dont want as i assure you anything still she added i am living oh yes im living  it put them again face to face but it had wound mrs stringham up so am i then youll seeshe spoke with the note of her recovery yet it was her wisdom nowmeaning by it as much as she didnot to say more than that she had risen by millys aid to a certain command of what was before them the ten minutes of their talk had in fact made her more distinctly aware of the presence in her mind of a new idea it was really perhaps an old idea with a new value it had at all events begun during the last hour though at first but feebly to shine with a special light that was because in the morning darkness had so suddenly descendeda sufficient shade of night to bring out the power of a star the dusk might be thick yet but the sky had comparatively cleared and susan shepherds star from this time on continued to twinkle for her it was for the moment after her passage with milly the one spark left in the heavens she recognised as she continued to watch it that it had really been set there by sir luke stretts visit and that the impressions immediately following had done no more than fix it millys reappearance with mr densher at her heelsor so oddly perhaps at miss croys heels miss croy being at millyshad contributed to this effect though it was only with the lapse of the greater obscurity that susie made that out the obscurity had reigned during the hour of their friends visit faintly clearing indeed while in one of the rooms kate croys remarkable advance to her intensified the fact that milly and the young man were conjoined in the other if it hadnt acquired on the spot all the intensity of which it was capable this was because the poor lady still sat in her primary gloom the gloom the great benignant doctor had practically left behind him  the intensity the circumstance in question might wear to the informed imagination would have been sufficiently revealed for us no doubtand with other things to our purposein two or three of those confidential passages with mrs lowder that she now permitted herself she hadnt yet been so glad that she believed in her old friend for if she hadnt had at such a pass somebody or other to believe in she should certainly have stumbled by the way discretion had ceased to consist of silence silence was gross and thick whereas wisdom should taper however tremulously to a point she betook herself to lancaster gate the morning after the colloquy just noted and there in maud manninghams own sanctum she gradually found relief in giving an account of herself an account of herself was one of the things that she had long been in the habit of expecting herself regularly to givethe regularity depending of course much on such tests of merit as might by laws beyond her control rise in her path she never spared herself in short a proper sharpness of conception of how she had behaved and it was a statement that she for the most part found herself able to make what had happened at present was that nothing as she felt was left of her to report to she was all too sunk in the inevitable and the abysmal to give an account of herself she must give it to somebody else and her first instalment of it to her hostess was that she must please let her cry she couldnt cry with milly in observation at the hotel which she had accordingly left for that purpose and the power happily came to her with the good opportunity she cried and cried at firstshe confined herself to that it was for the time the best statement of her business mrs lowder moreover intelligently took it as such though knocking off a note or two more as she said while susie sat near her table she could resist the contagion of tears but her patience did justice to her visitors most vivid plea for it i shall never be able you know to cry againat least not ever with her so i must take it out when i can even if she does herself it wont be for me to give away for what would that be but a confession of despair im not with her for thatim with her to be regularly sublime besides milly wont cry herself  im sure i hope said mrs lowder that she wont have occasion to  she wont even if she does have occasion she wont shed a tear theres something that will prevent her  oh said mrs lowder  yes her pride mrs stringham explained in spite of her friends doubt and it was with this that her communication took consistent form it had never been pride maud manningham had hinted that kept her from crying when other things made for it it had only been that these same things at such times made still more for business arrangements correspondence the ringing of bells the marshalling of servants the taking of decisions i might be crying now she said if i werent writing lettersand this quite without harshness for her anxious companion to whom she allowed just the administrative margin for difference she had interrupted her no more than she would have interrupted the pianotuner it gave poor susie time and when mrs lowder to save appearances and catch the post had with her addressed and stamped notes met at the door of the room the footman summoned by the pressure of a knob the facts of the case were sufficiently ready for her it took but two or three however given their importance to lay the ground for the great onemrs stringhams interview of the day before with sir luke who had wished to see her about milly  he had wished it himself  i think he was glad of it clearly indeed he was he stayed a quarter of an hour i could see that for him it was long hes interested said mrs stringham  do you mean in her case  he says it isnt a case  what then is it  it isnt at least mrs stringham explained the case she believed it to bethought it at any rate might bewhen without my knowledge she went to see him she went because there was something she was afraid of and he examined her thoroughlyhe has made sure shes wrongshe hasnt what she thought  and what did she think mrs lowder demanded  he didnt tell me  and you didnt ask  i asked nothing said poor susiei only took what he gave me he gave me no more than he had tohe was beautiful she went on he is thank god interested  he must have been interested in you dear maud manningham observed with kindness  her visitor met it with candour yes love i think he is i mean that he sees what he can do with me  mrs lowder took it rightly for her  for her anything in the world he will or he must he can use me to the last bone and he likes at least that he says the great thing for her is to be happy  its surely the great thing for every one why therefore mrs lowder handsomely asked should we cry so hard about it  only poor susie wailed that its so strange so beyond us i mean if she cant be  she must be mrs lowder knew no impossibles she shall be  wellif youll help he thinks you know we can help  mrs lowder faced a moment in her massive way what sir luke strett thought she sat back there her knees apart not unlike a picturesque earringed matron at a marketstall while her friend before her dropped their items tossed the separate truths of the matter one by one into her capacious apron but is that all he came to you forto tell you she must be happy  that she must be made sothats the point it seemed enough as he told me mrs stringham went on he makes it somehow such a grand possible affair  ah well if he makes it possible  i mean especially he makes it grand he gave it to me that is as my part the rests his own  and whats the rest mrs lowder asked  i dont know his business he means to keep hold of her  then why do you say it isnt a case it must be very much of one  everything in mrs stringham confessed to the extent of it its only that it isnt the case she herself supposed  its another  its another  examining her for what she supposed he finds something else  something else  and what does he find  ah mrs stringham cried god keep me from knowing  he didnt tell you that  but poor susie had recovered herself what i mean is that if its there i shall know in time hes considering but i can trust him for itbecause he does i feel trust me hes considering she repeated  hes in other words not sure  well hes watching i think thats what he means shes to get away now but to come back to him in three months  then i think said maud lowder that he oughtnt meanwhile to scare us  it roused susie a little susie being already enrolled in the great doctors cause this came out at least in her glimmer of reproach does it scare us to enlist us for her happiness  mrs lowder was rather stiff for it yes it scares me im always scaredi may call it sotill i understand what happiness is he talking about  mrs stringham at this came straight oh you know  she had really said it so that her friend had to take it which the latter in fact after a moment showed herself as having done a strange light humour in the matter even perhaps suddenly aiding she met it with a certain accommodation well say one seems to see the point is but fairly too full now of her question she dropped  the point is will it cure  precisely is it absolutely a remedythe specific  well i should think we might know mrs stringham delicately declared  ah but we havent the complaint  have you never dearest been in love susan shepherd enquired  yes my child but not by the doctors direction  maud manningham had spoken perforce with a break into momentary mirth which operatedand happily tooas a challenge to her visitors spirit oh of course we dont ask his leave to fall but its something to know he thinks it good for us  my dear woman mrs lowder cried it strikes me we know it without him so that when thats all he has to tell us  ah mrs stringham interposed it isnt all i feel sir luke will have more he wont have put me off with anything inadequate im to see him again he as good as told me that hell wish it so it wont be for nothing  then what will it be for do you mean he has somebody of his own to propose do you mean you told him nothing  mrs stringham dealt with these questions i showed him i understood him that was all i could do i didnt feel at liberty to be explicit but i felt even though his visit so upset me the comfort of what i had from you night before last  what i spoke to you of in the carriage when we had left her with kate  you had seen apparently in three minutes and now that hes here now that ive met him and had my impression of him i feel said mrs stringham that youve been magnificent  of course ive been magnificent when asked maud manningham was i anything else but milly wont be you know if she marries merton densher  oh its always magnificent to marry the man one loves but were going fast mrs stringham woefully smiled  the thing is to go fast if i see the case right what had i after all but my instinct of that on coming back with you night before last to pick up kate i felt what i felti knew in my bones the man had returned  thats just where as i say youre magnificent but wait said mrs stringham till youve seen him  i shall see him immediatelymrs lowder took it up with decision what is then she asked your impression  mrs stringhams impression seemed lost in her doubts how can he ever care for her  her companion in her companions heavy manner sat on it by being put in the way of it  for gods sake then mrs stringham wailed put him in the way you have him one feels in your hand  maud lowders eyes at this rested on her friends is that your impression of him  its my impression dearest of you you handle every one  mrs lowders eyes still rested and susan shepherd now felt for a wonder not less sincere by seeing that she pleased her but there was a great limitation i dont handle kate  it suggested something that her visitor hadnt yet had from hersomething the sense of which made mrs stringham gasp do you mean kate cares for him  that fact the lady of lancaster gate had up to this moment as we know enshrouded and her friends quick question had produced a change in her face she blinkedthen looked at the question hard after which whether she had inadvertently betrayed herself or had only reached a decision and then been affected by the quality of mrs stringhams surprise she accepted all results what took place in her for susan shepherd was not simply that she made the best of them but that she suddenly saw more in them to her purpose than she could have imagined a certain impatience in fact marked in her this transition she had been keeping back very hard an important truth and wouldnt have liked to hear that she hadnt concealed it cleverly susie nevertheless felt herself pass as not a little of a fool with her for not having thought of it what susie indeed however most thought of at present in the quick new light of it was the wonder of kates dissimulation she had time for that view while she waited for an answer to her cry kate thinks she cares but shes mistaken and no one knows it these things distinct and responsible were mrs lowders retort yet they werent all of it you dont know itthat must be your line or rather your line must be that you deny it utterly  deny that she cares for him  deny that she so much as thinks that she does positively and absolutely deny that youve so much as heard of it  susie faced this new duty to milly you meanif she asks  to milly naturally no one else will ask  well said mrs stringham after a moment milly wont  mrs lowder wondered are you sure  yes the more i think of it and luckily for me i lie badly  i lie well thank god mrs lowder almost snorted when as sometimes will happen theres nothing else so good one must always do the best but without lies then she went on perhaps we can work it out her interest had risen her friend saw her as within some minutes more enrolled and inflamedpresently felt in her what had made the difference mrs stringham it was true descried this at the time but dimly she only made out at first that maud had found a reason for helping her the reason was that strangely she might help maud too for which she now desired to profess herself ready even to lying what really perhaps most came out for her was that her hostess was a little disappointed at her doubt of the social solidity of this appliance and that in turn was to become a steadier light the truth about kates delusion as her aunt presented it the delusion about the state of her affections which might be removedthis was apparently the ground on which they now might more intimately meet mrs stringham saw herself recruited for the removal of kates delusionby arts however in truth that she as yet quite failed to compass or was it perhaps to be only for the removal of mr densherssuccess in which indeed might entail other successes before that job unfortunately her heart had already failed she felt that she believed in her bones what milly believed and what would now make working for milly such a dreadful upward tug all this within her was confusedly presenta cloud of questions out of which maud manninghams large seated self loomed however as a mass more and more definite taking in fact for the consultative relation something of the form of an oracle from the oracle the sound did comeor at any rate the sense did a sense all accordant with the insufflation she had just seen working yes the sense was ill help you for milly because if that comes off i shall be helped by its doing so for katea view into which mrs stringham could now sufficiently enter she found herself of a sudden strange to say quite willing to operate to kates harm or at least to kates good as mrs lowder with a noble anxiety measured it she found herself in short not caring what became of kateonly convinced at bottom of the predominance of kates star kate wasnt in danger kate wasnt pathetic kate croy whatever happened would take care of kate croy she saw moreover by this time that her friend was travelling even beyond her own speed mrs lowder had already in mind drafted a rough plan of action a plan vividly enough thrown off as she said you must stay on a few days and you must immediately both of you meet him at dinner in addition to which maud claimed the merit of having by an instinct of pity of prescient wisdom done much two nights before to prepare that ground the poor child when i was with her there while you were getting your shawl quite gave herself away to me  oh i remember how you afterwards put it to me though it was nothing more susie did herself the justice to observe than what i too had quite felt  but mrs lowder fronted her so on this that she wondered what she had said i suppose i ought to be edified at what you can so beautifully give up  give up mrs stringham echoed why i give up nothingi cling  her hostess showed impatience turning again with some stiffness to her great brassbound cylinderdesk and giving a push to an object or two disposed there i give up then you know how little such a person as mr densher was to be my idea for her you know what ive been thinking perfectly possible  oh youve been greatsusie was perfectly fair a duke a duchess a princess a palace youve made me believe in them too but where we break down is that she doesnt believe in them luckily for heras it seems to be turning outshe doesnt want them so whats one to do i assure you ive had many dreams but ive only one dream now  mrs stringhams tone in these last words gave so fully her meaning that mrs lowder could but show herself as taking it in they sat a moment longer confronted on it her having what she does want  if it will do anything for her  mrs lowder seemed to think what it might do but she spoke for the instant of something else it does provoke me a bit you knowfor of course im a brute and i had thought of all sorts of things yet it doesnt prevent the fact that we must be decent  we must take hermrs stringham carried that outas she is  and we must take mr densher as he is with which mrs lowder gave a sombre laugh its a pity he isnt better  well if he were better her friend rejoined youd have liked him for your niece and in that case milly would interfere i mean susie added interfere with you  she interferes with me as it isnot that it matters now but i saw kate and herreally as soon as you came to meset up side by side i saw your girli dont mind tellingyou helping my girl and when i say that mrs lowder continued youll probably put in for yourself that it was part of the reason of my welcome to you so you see what i give up i do give it up but when i take that line she further set forth i take it handsomely so goodbye to it all goodday to mrs densher heavens she growled  susie held herself a minute even as mrs densher my girl will be somebody  yes she wont be nobody besides said mrs lowder were talking in the air  her companion sadly assented were leaving everything out  its nevertheless interesting and mrs lowder had another thought hes not quite nobody either it brought her back to the question she had already put and which her friend hadnt at the time dealt with what in fact do you make of him  susan shepherd at this for reasons not clear even to herself was moved a little to caution so she remained general hes charming  she had met mrs lowders eyes with that extreme pointedness in her own to which people resort when they are not quite candida circumstance that had its effect yes hes charming  the effect of the words however was equally marked they almost determined in mrs stringham a return of amusement i thought you didnt like him  i dont like him for kate  but you dont like him for milly either  mrs stringham rose as she spoke and her friend also got up i like him my dear for myself  then thats the best way of all  well its one way hes not good enough for my niece and hes not good enough for you ones an aunt ones a wretch and ones a fool  oh im notnot either susie declared  but her companion kept on one lives for others you do that if i were living for myself i shouldnt at all mind him  but mrs stringham was sturdier ah if i find him charming its however im living  well it broke mrs lowder down she hung fire but an instant giving herself away with a laugh of course hes all right in himself  thats all i contend susie said with more reserve and the note in questionwhat merton densher was in himselfclosed practically with some inconsequence this first of their councils   ii  it had at least made the difference for them they could feel of an informed state in respect to the great doctor whom they were now to take as watching waiting studying or at any rate as proposing to himself some such process before he should make up his mind mrs stringham understood him as considering the matter meanwhile in a spirit that on this same occasion at lancaster gate she had come back to a rough notation of before retiring she followed the course of his reckoning if what they had talked of could happenif milly that is could have her thoughts taken off herselfit wouldnt do any harm and might conceivably do much good if it couldnt happenif anxiously though tactfully working they themselves conjoined could do nothing to contribute to itthey would be in no worse a box than before only in this latter case the girl would have had her free range for the summer for the autumn she would have done her best in the sense enjoined on her and coming back at the end to her eminent man wouldbesides having more to show himfind him more ready to go on with her it was visible further to susan shepherdas well as being ground for a second report to her old friendthat milly did her part for a working view of the general case inasmuch as she mentioned frankly and promptly that she meant to go and say goodbye to sir luke strett and thank him she even specified what she was to thank him for his having been so easy about her behaviour  you see i didnt know thatfor the liberty i tooki shouldnt afterwards get a stiff note from him  so much milly had said to her and it had made her a trifle rash oh youll never get a stiff note from him in your life  she felt her rashness the next moment at her young friends question why not as well as any one else who has played him a trick  well because he doesnt regard it as a trick he could understand your action its all right you see  yesi do see it is all right hes easier with me than with any one else because thats the way to let me down hes only making believe and im not worth hauling up  rueful at having provoked again this ominous flare poor susie grasped at her only advantage do you really accuse a man like sir luke strett of trifling with you  she couldnt blind herself to the look her companion gave hera strange halfamused perception of what she made of it well so far as its trifling with me to pity me so much  he doesnt pity you susie earnestly reasoned he justthe same as any one elselikes you  he has no business then to like me hes not the same as any one else  why not if he wants to work for you  milly gave her another look but this time a wonderful smile ah there you are mrs stringham coloured for there indeed she was again but milly let her off work for me all the samework for me its of course what i want then as usual she embraced her friend im not going to be as nasty as this to him  im sure i hope notand mrs stringham laughed for the kiss ive no doubt however hed take it from you its you my dear who are not the same as any one else  millys assent to which after an instant gave her the last word no so that people can take anything from me and what mrs stringham did indeed resignedly take after this was the absence on her part of any account of the visit then paid it was the beginning in fact between them of an odd independencean independence positively of action and customon the subject of millys future they went their separate ways with the girls intense assent this being really nothing but what she had so wonderfully put in her plea for after mrs stringhams first encounter with sir luke she fairly favoured the idea that susie had or was to have other encountersprivate pointed personal she favoured every idea but most of all the idea that she herself was to go on as if nothing were the matter since she was to be worked for that would be her way and though her companions learned from herself nothing of it this was in the event her way with her medical adviser she put her visit to him on the simplest ground she had come just to tell him how touched she had been by his good nature that required little explaining for as mrs stringham had said he quite understood he could but reply that it was all right  i had a charming quarter of an hour with that clever lady youve got good friends  so each one of them thinks of all the others but so i also think milly went on of all of them together youre excellent for each other and its in that way i dare say that youre best for me  there came to her on this occasion one of the strangest of her impressions which was at the same time one of the finest of her alarmsthe glimmer of a vision that if she should go as it were too far she might perhaps deprive their relation of facility if not of value going too far was failing to try at least to remain simple he would be quite ready to hate her if she did by heading him off at every point embarrass his exercise of a kindness that no doubt rather constituted for him a high method susie wouldnt hate her since susie positively wanted to suffer for her susie had a noble idea that she might somehow so do her good such however was not the way in which the greatest of london doctors was to be expected to wish to do it he wouldnt have time even should he wish whereby in a word milly felt herself intimately warned face to face there with her smooth strong director she enjoyed at a given moment quite such another lift of feeling as she had known in her crucial talk with susie it came round to the same thing him too she would help to help her if that could possibly be but if it couldnt possibly be she would assist also to make this right  it wouldnt have taken many minutes more on the basis in question almost to reverse for her their characters of patient and physician what was he in fact but patient what was she but physician from the moment she embraced once for all the necessity adopted once for all the policy of saving him alarms about her subtlety she would leave the subtlety to him he would enjoy his use of it and she herself no doubt would in time enjoy his enjoyment she went so far as to imagine that the inward success of these reflexions flushed her for the minute to his eyes with a certain bloom a comparative appearance of health and what verily next occurred was that he gave colour to the presumption every little helps no doubthe noticed goodhumouredly her harmless sally but help or no help youre looking you know remarkably well  oh i thought i was she answered and it was as if already she saw his line only she wondered what he would have guessed if he had guessed anything at all it would be rather remarkable of him as for what there was to guess he couldntif this was present to himhave arrived at it save by his own acuteness that acuteness was therefore immense and if it supplied the subtlety she thought of leaving him to his portion would be none so bad neither for that matter would hers bewhich she was even actually enjoying she wondered if really then there mightnt be something for her she hadnt been sure in coming to him that she was better and he hadnt used he would be awfully careful not to use that compromising term about her in spite of all of which she would have been ready to say for the amiable sympathy of it yes i must be for he had this unaided sense of something that had happened to her it was a sense unaided because who could have told him of anything susie she was certain hadnt yet seen him again and there were things it was impossible she could have told him the first time since such was his penetration therefore why shouldnt she gracefully in recognition of it accept the new circumstance the one he was clearly wanting to congratulate her on as a sufficient cause if one nursed a cause tenderly enough it might produce an effect and this to begin with would be a way of nursing you gave me the other day she went on plenty to think over and ive been doing thatthinking it overquite as youll have probably wished me i think i must be pretty easy to treat she smiled since youve already done me so much good  the only obstacle to reciprocity with him was that he looked in advance so closely related to all ones possibilities that one missed the pleasure of really improving it oh no youre extremely difficult to treat ive need with you i assure you of all my wit  well i mean i do come up she hadnt meanwhile a bit believed in his answer convinced as she was that if she had been difficult it would be the last thing he would have told her im doing she said as i like  then its as i like but you must really though were having such a decent month get straight away in pursuance of which when she had replied with promptitude that her departurefor the tyrol and then for venicewas quite fixed for the fourteenth he took her up with alacrity for venice thats perfect for we shall meet there ive a dream of it for october when im hoping for three weeks off three weeks during which if i can get them clear my niece a young person who has quite the whip hand of me is to take me where she prefers i heard from her only yesterday that she expects to prefer venice  thats lovely then i shall expect you there and anything that in advance or in any way i can do for you  oh thank you my niece i seem to feel does for me but it will be capital to find you there  i think it ought to make you feel she said after a moment that i am easy to treat  but he shook his head again he wouldnt have it youve not come to that yet  one has to be so bad for it  well i dont think ive ever come to itto ease of treatment i doubt if its possible ive not if it is found any one bad enough the ease you see is for you  i seei see  they had an odd friendly but perhaps the least bit awkward pause on it after which sir luke asked and that clever ladyshe goes with you  mrs stringham oh dear yes shell stay with me i hope to the end  he had a cheerful blankness to the end of what  wellof everything  ah then he laughed youre in luck the end of everything is far off this you know im hoping said sir luke is only the beginning and the next question he risked might have been a part of his hope just you and she together  no two other friends two ladies of whom weve seen more here than of any one and who are just the right people for us  he thought a moment youll be four women together then  ah said milly were widows and orphans but i think she added as if to say what she saw would reassure him that we shall not be unattractive as we move to gentlemen when you talk of life i suppose you mean mainly gentlemen  when i talk of life he made answer after a moment during which he might have been appreciating her racinesswhen i talk of life i think i mean more than anything else the beautiful show of it in its freshness made by young persons of your age so go on as you are i see more and more how you are you cant he went so far as to say for pleasantness better it  she took it from him with a great show of peace one of our companions will be miss croy who came with me here first its in her that life is splendid and a part of that is even that shes devoted to me but shes above all magnificent in herself so that if youd like she freely threw out to see her  oh i shall like to see any one whos devoted to you for clearly it will be jolly to be in it so that if shes to be at venice i shall see her  we must arrange iti shant fail she moreover has a friend who may also be theremilly found herself going on to this hes likely to come i believe for he always follows her  sir luke wondered you mean theyre lovers  he is milly smiled but not she she doesnt care for him  sir luke took an interest whats the matter with him  nothing but that she doesnt like him  sir luke kept it up is he all right  oh hes very nice indeed hes remarkably so  and hes to be in venice  so she tells me she fears for if he is there hell be constantly about with her  and shell be constantly about with you  as were great friendsyes  well then said sir luke you wont be four women alone  oh no i quite recognise the chance of gentlemen but he wont milly pursued in the same wondrous way have come you see for me  noi see but cant you help him  cant you milly after a moment quaintly asked then for the joke of it she explained im putting you you see in relation with my entourage  it might have been for the joke of it too by this time that her eminent friend fell in but if this gentleman isnt of your entourage  i mean if hes ofwhat do you call hermiss croys unless indeed you also take an interest in him  oh certainly i take an interest in him  you think there may be then some chance for him  i like him said milly enough to hope so  then thats all right but what pray sir luke next asked have i to do with him  nothing said milly except that if youre to be there so may he be and also that we shant in that case be simply four dreary women  he considered her as if at this point she a little tried his patience youre the least dreary woman ive ever ever seen ever do you know theres no reason why you shouldnt have a really splendid life  so every one tells me she promptly returned  the convictionstrong already when i had seen you onceis strengthened in me by having seen your friend theres no doubt about it the worlds before you  what did my friend tell you milly asked  nothing that wouldnt have given you pleasure we talked about youand freely i dont deny that but it shows me i dont require of you the impossible  she was now on her feet i think i know what you require of me  nothing for you he went on is impossible so go on he repeated it againwanting her so to feel that today he saw it youre all right  well she smiledkeep me so  oh youll get away from me  keep me keep me she simply continued with her gentle eyes on him  she had given him her hand for goodbye and he thus for a moment did keep her something then while he seemed to think if there were anything more came back to him though something of which there wasnt too much to be made of course if theres anything i can do for your friend i mean the gentleman you speak of he gave out in short that he was ready  oh mr densher it was as if she had forgotten  mr densheris that his name  yesbut his case isnt so dreadful she had within a minute got away from that  no doubtif you take an interest she had got away but it was as if he made out in her eyesthough they also had rather got awaya reason for calling her back still if theres anything one can do  she looked at him while she thought while she smiled im afraid theres really nothing one can do   iii  not yet so much as this morning had she felt herself sink into possession gratefully glad that the warmth of the southern summer was still in the high florid rooms palatial chambers where hard cool pavements took reflexions in their lifelong polish and where the sun on the stirred seawater flickering up through open windows played over the painted subjects in the splendid ceilingsmedallions of purple and brown of brave old melancholy colour medals as of old reddened gold embossed and beribboned all toned with time and all flourished and scolloped and gilded about set in their great moulded and figured concavity a nest of white cherubs friendly creatures of the air and appreciated by the aid of that second tier of smaller lights straight openings to the front which did everything even with the baedekers and photographs of millys party dreadfully meeting the eye to make of the place an apartment of state this at last only though she had enjoyed the palace for three weeks seemed to count as effective occupation perhaps because it was the first time she had been alonereally to call alonesince she had left london it ministered to her first full and unembarrassed sense of what the great eugenio had done for her the great eugenio recommended by granddukes and americans had entered her service during the last hours of allhad crossed from paris after multiplied pourparlers with mrs stringham to whom she had allowed more than ever a free hand on purpose to escort her to the continent and encompass her there and had dedicated to her from the moment of their meeting all the treasures of his experience she had judged him in advancepolyglot and universal very dear and very deepas probably but a swindler finished to the fingertips for he was forever carrying one wellkept italian hand to his heart and plunging the other straight into her pocket which as she had instantly observed him to recognise fitted it like a glove the remarkable thing was that these elements of their common consciousness had rapidly gathered into an indestructible link formed the ground of a happy relation being by this time strangely grotesquely delightfully what most kept up confidence between them and what most expressed it  she had seen quickly enough what was happeningthe usual thing again yet once again eugenio had in an interview of five minutes understood her had got hold like all the world of the idea not so much of the care with which she must be taken up as of the care with which she must be let down all the world understood her all the world had got hold but for nobody yet she felt would the idea have been so close a tie or won from herself so patient a surrender gracefully respectfully consummately enoughalways with hands in position and the look in his thick neat white hair smooth fat face and black professional almost theatrical eyes as of some famous tenor grown too old to make love but with an art still to make moneydid he on occasion convey to her that she was of all the clients of his glorious career the one in whom his interest was most personal and paternal the others had come in the way of business but for her his sentiment was special confidence rested thus on her completely believing that there was nothing of which she felt more sure it passed between them every time they conversed he was abysmal but this intimacy lived on the surface he had taken his place already for her among those who were to see her through and meditation ranked him in the constant perspective for the final function side by side with poor susiewhom she was now pitying more than ever for having to be herself so sorry and to say so little about it eugenio had the general tact of a residuary legateewhich was a character that could be definitely worn whereas she could see susie in the event of her death in no character at all susie being insistently exclusively concerned in her mere makeshift duration this principle for that matter milly at present with a renewed flare of fancy felt she should herself have liked to believe in eugenio had really done for her more than he probably knewhe didnt after all know everythingin having for the windup of the autumn on a weak word from her so admirably so perfectly established her her weak word as a general hint had been at venice please if possible no dreadful no vulgar hotel but if it can be at all managedyou know what i meansome fine old rooms wholly independent for a series of months plenty of them too and the more interesting the better part of a palace historic and picturesque but strictly inodorous where we shall be to ourselves with a cook dont you knowwith servants frescoes tapestries antiquities the thorough makebelieve of a settlement  the proof of how he better and better understood her was in all the place as to his masterly acquisition of which she had from the first asked no questions she had shown him enough what she thought of it and her forbearance pleased him with the part of the transaction that mainly concerned her she would soon enough become acquainted and his connexion with such values as she would then find noted could scarce help growing as it were still more residuary charming people conscious venicelovers evidently had given up their house to her and had fled to a distance to other countries to hide their blushes alike over what they had however briefly alienated and over what they had however durably gained they had preserved and consecrated and she nowher part of it was shamelessappropriated and enjoyed palazzo leporelli held its history still in its great lap even like a painted idol a solemn puppet hung about with decorations hung about with pictures and relics the rich venetian past the ineffaceable character was here the presence revered and served which brings us back to our truth of a moment agothe fact that more than ever this october morning awkward novice though she might be milly moved slowly to and fro as the priestess of the worship certainly it came from the sweet taste of solitude caught again and cherished for the hour always a need of her nature moreover when things spoke to her with penetration it was mostly in stillness they spoke to her best amid voices she lost the sense voices had surrounded her for weeks and she had tried to listen had cultivated them and had answered back these had been weeks in which there were other things they might well prevent her from hearing more than the prospect had at first promised or threatened she had felt herself going on in a crowd and with a multiplied escort the four ladies pictured by her to sir luke strett as a phalanx comparatively closed and detached had in fact proved a rolling snowball condemned from day to day to cover more ground susan shepherd had compared this portion of the girls excursion to the empress catherines famous progress across the steppes of russia improvised settlements appeared at each turn of the road villagers waiting with addresses drawn up in the language of london old friends in fine were in ambush mrs lowders kate croys her own when the addresses werent in the language of london they were in the more insistent idioms of american centres the current was swollen even by susies social connexions so that there were days at hotels at dolomite picnics on lake steamers when she could almost repay to aunt maud and kate with interest the debt contracted by the london success to which they had opened the door  mrs lowders success and kates amid the shock of millys and mrs stringhams compatriots failed but little really of the concertpitch it had gone almost as fast as the boom over the sea of the last great native novel those ladies were so differentdifferent observably enough from the ladies so appraising them it being throughout a case mainly of ladies of a dozen at once sometimes in millys apartment pointing also at once that moral and many others millys companions were acclaimed not only as perfectly fascinating in themselves the nicest people yet known to the acclaimers but as obvious helping hands socially speaking for the eccentric young woman evident initiators and smoothers of her path possible subduers of her eccentricity short intervals to her own sense stood now for great differences and this renewed inhalation of her native air had somehow left her to feel that she already that she mainly struck the compatriot as queer and dissociated she moved such a critic it would appear as to rather an odd suspicion a benevolence induced by a want of complete trust all of which showed her in the light of a person too plain and too illclothed for a thorough good time and yet too rich and too befriendedan intuitive cunning within her managing this lastfor a thorough bad one the compatriots in short by what she made out approved her friends for their expert wisdom with her in spite of which judicial sagacity it was the compatriots who recorded themselves as the innocent parties she saw things in these days that she had never seen before and she couldnt have said why save on a principle too terrible to name whereby she saw that neither lancaster gate was what new york took it for nor new york what lancaster gate fondly fancied it in coquetting with the plan of a series of american visits the plan might have been humorously on mrs lowders part for the improvement of her social positionand it had verily in that direction lights that were perhaps but half a century too prompt at all of which kate croy assisted with the cool controlled facility that went so well as the others said with her particular kind of good looks the kind that led you to expect the person enjoying them would dispose of disputations speculations aspirations in a few very neatly and brightly uttered words so simplified in sense however that they sounded even when guiltless like rather aggravated slang it wasnt that kate hadnt pretended too that she should like to go to america it was only that with this young woman milly had constantly proceeded and more than ever of late on the theory of intimate confessions private frank ironies that made up for their public grimaces and amid which face to face they wearily put off the mask  these puttingsoff of the mask had finally quite become the form taken by their moments together moments indeed not increasingly frequent and not prolonged thanks to the consciousness of fatigue on millys side whenever as she herself expressed it she got out of harness they flourished their masks the independent pair as they might have flourished spanish fans they smiled and sighed on removing them but the gesture the smiles the sighs strangely enough might have been suspected the greatest reality in the business strangely enough we say for the volume of effusion in general would have been found by either on measurement to be scarce proportional to the paraphernalia of relief it was when they called each others attention to their ceasing to pretend it was then that what they were keeping back was most in the air there was a difference no doubt and mainly to kates advantage milly didnt quite see what her friend could keep back was possessed of in fine that would be so subject to retention whereas it was comparatively plain sailing for kate that poor milly had a treasure to hide this was not the treasure of a shy an abject affectionconcealment on that head belonging to quite another phase of such states it was much rather a principle of pride relatively bold and hard a principle that played up like a fine steel spring at the lightest pressure of too near a footfall thus insuperably guarded was the truth about the girls own conception of her validity thus was a wondering pitying sister condemned wistfully to look at her from the far side of the moat she had dug round her tower certain aspects of the connexion of these young women show for us such is the twilight that gathers about them in the likeness of some dim scene in a maeterlinck play we have positively the image in the delicate dusk of the figures so associated and yet so opposed so mutually watchful that of the angular pale princess ostrichplumed blackrobed hung about with amulets reminders relics mainly seated mainly still and that of the upright restless slowcircling lady of her court who exchanges with her across the black water streaked with evening gleams fitful questions and answers the upright lady with thick dark braids down her back drawing over the grass a more embroidered train makes the whole circuit and makes it again and the broken talk brief and sparingly allusive seems more to cover than to free their sense this is because when it fairly comes to not having others to consider they meet in an air that appears rather anxiously to wait for their words such an impression as that was in fact grave and might be tragic so that plainly enough systematically at last they settled to a care of what they said  there could be no gross phrasing to milly in particular of the probability that if she wasnt so proud she might be pitied with more comfortmore to the person pitying there could be no spoken proof no sharper demonstration than the consistently considerate attitude that this marvellous mixture of her weakness and of her strength her peril if such it were and her option made her kept her irresistibly interesting kates predicament in the matter was after all very much mrs stringhams own and susan shepherd herself indeed in our maeterlinck picture might well have hovered in the gloaming by the moat it may be declared for kate at all events that her sincerity about her friend through this time was deep her compassionate imagination strong and that these things gave her a virtue a good conscience a credibility for herself so to speak that were later to be precious to her she grasped with her keen intelligence the logic of their common duplicity went unassisted through the same ordeal as millys other hushed follower easily saw that for the girl to be explicit was to betray divinations gratitudes glimpses of the felt contrast between her fortune and her fearall of which would have contradicted her systematic bravado that was it kate wonderingly saw to recognise was to bring down the avalanchethe avalanche milly lived so in watch for and that might be started by the lightest of breaths though less possibly the breath of her own stifled plaint than that of the vain sympathy the mere helpless gaping inference of others with so many suppressions as these therefore between them their withdrawal together to unmask had to fall back as we have hinted on a nominal motivewhich was decently represented by a joy at the drop of chatter chatter had in truth all along attended their steps but they took the despairing view of it on purpose to have ready when face to face some view or other of something the relief of getting out of harnessthat was the moral of their meetings but the moral of this in turn was that they couldnt so much as ask each other why harness need be worn milly wore it as a general armour  she was out of it at present for some reason as she hadnt been for weeks she was always out of it that is when alone and her companions had never yet so much as just now affected her as dispersed and suppressed it was as if still again still more tacitly and wonderfully eugenio had understood her taking it from her without a word and just bravely and brilliantly in the name for instance of the beautiful day yes get me an hour alone take them offi dont care where absorb amuse detain them drown them kill them if you will so that i may just a little all by myself see where i am she was conscious of the dire impatience of it for she gave up susie as well as the others to himsusie who would have drowned her very self for her gave her up to a mercenary monster through whom she thus purchased respites strange were the turns of life and the moods of weakness strange the flickers of fancy and the cheats of hope yet lawful all the samewerent theythose experiments tried with the truth that consisted at the worst but in practising on ones self she was now playing with the thought that eugenio might inclusively assist her he had brought home to her and always by remarks that were really quite soundless the conception hitherto ungrasped of some complete use of her wealth itself some use of it as a countermove to fate it had passed between them as preposterous that with so much money she should just stupidly and awkwardly wantany more want a life a career a consciousness than want a house a carriage or a cook it was as if she had had from him a kind of expert professional measure of what he was in a position at a stretch to undertake for her the thoroughness of which for that matter she could closely compare with a looseness on sir luke stretts part thatat least in palazzo leporelli when mornings were fineshowed as almost amateurish sir luke hadnt said to her pay enough money and leave the rest to mewhich was distinctly what eugenio did say sir luke had appeared indeed to speak of purchase and payment but in reference to a different sort of cash those were amounts not to be named nor reckoned and such moreover as she wasnt sure of having at her command eugeniothis was the differencecould name could reckon and prices of his kind were things she had never suffered to scare her she had been willing goodness knew to pay enough for anything for everything and here was simply a new view of the sufficient quantity she amused herselffor it came to that since eugenio was there to sign the receiptwith possibilities of meeting the bill she was more prepared than ever to pay enough and quite as much as ever to pay too much what elseif such were points at which your most trusted servant failedwas the use of being as the dear susies of earth called you a princess in a palace  she made now alone the full circuit of the place noble and peaceful while the summer sea stirring here and there a curtain or an outer blind breathed into its veiled spaces she had a vision of clinging to it that perhaps eugenio could manage she was in it as in the ark of her deluge and filled with such a tenderness for it that why shouldnt this in common mercy be warrant enough she would never never leave itshe would engage to that would ask nothing more than to sit tight in it and float on and on the beauty and intensity the real momentary relief of this conceit reached their climax in the positive purpose to put the question to eugenio on his return as she had not yet put it though the design it must be added dropped a little when coming back to the great saloon from which she had started on her pensive progress she found lord mark of whose arrival in venice she had been unaware and who had nowwhile a servant was following her through empty roomsbeen asked in her absence to wait he had waited then lord mark he was waitingoh unmistakeably never before had he so much struck her as the man to do that on occasion with patience to do it indeed almost as with gratitude for the chance though at the same time with a sort of notifying firmness the odd thing as she was afterwards to recall was that her wonder for what had brought him was not immediate but had come at the end of five minutes and also quite incoherently that she felt almost as glad to see him and almost as forgiving of his interruption of her solitude as if he had already been in her thought or acting at her suggestion he was somehow at the best the end of a respite one might like him very much and yet feel that his presence tempered precious solitude more than any other known to one in spite of all of which as he was neither dear susie nor dear kate nor dear aunt maud nor even for the least dear eugenio in person the sight of him did no damage to her sense of the dispersal of her friends she hadnt been so thoroughly alone with him since those moments of his showing her the great portrait at matcham the moments that had exactly made the highwatermark of her security the moments during which her tears themselves those she had been ashamed of were the sign of her consciously rounding her protective promontory quitting the blue gulf of comparative ignorance and reaching her view of the troubled sea his presence now referred itself to his presence then reminding her how kind he had been altogether at matcham and telling her unexpectedly at a time when she could particularly feel it that for such kindness and for the beauty of what they remembered together she hadnt lost himquite the contrary to receive him handsomely to receive him there to see him interested and charmed as well clearly as delighted to have found her without some other person to spoil itthese things were so pleasant for the first minutes that they might have represented on her part some happy foreknowledge she gave an account of her companions while he on his side failed to press her about them even though describing his appearance so unheralded as the result of an impulse obeyed on the spot he had been shivering at carlsbad belated there and blue when taken by it so that knowing where they all were he had simply caught the first train he explained how he had known where they were he had heardwhat more naturalfrom their friends millys and his he mentioned this betimes but it was with his mention singularly that the girl became conscious of her inner question about his reason she noticed his plural which added to mrs lowder or added to kate but she presently noticed also that it didnt affect her as explaining aunt maud had written to him kate apparentlyand this was interestinghad written to him but their design presumably hadnt been that he should come and sit there as if rather relieved so far as they were concerned at postponements he only said oh and again oh when she sketched their probable morning for him under eugenios care and mrs stringhamssounding it quite as if any suggestion that he should overtake them at the rialto or the bridge of sighs would leave him temporarily cold this precisely it was that after a little operated for milly as an obscure but still fairly direct check to confidence he had known where they all were from the others but it was not for the others that in his actual dispositions he had come that strange to say was a pity for stranger still to say she could have shown him more confidence if he himself had had less intention his intention so chilled her from the moment she found herself divining it that just for the pleasure of going on with him fairly just for the pleasure of their remembrance together of matcham and the bronzino the climax of her fortune she could have fallen to pleading with him and to reasoning to undeceiving him in time there had been for ten minutes with the directness of her welcome to him and the way this clearly pleased him something of the grace of amends made even though he couldnt know itamends for her not having been originally sure for instance at that first dinner of aunt mauds that he was adequately human that first dinner of aunt mauds added itself to the hour at matcham added itself to other things to consolidate for her present benevolence the ease of their relation making it suddenly delightful that he had thus turned up he exclaimed as he looked about on the charm of the place what a temple to taste and an expression of the pride of life yet with all that what a jolly homeso that for his entertainment she could offer to walk him about though she mentioned that she had just been for her own purposes in a general prowl taking everything in more susceptibly than before he embraced her offer without a scruple and seemed to rejoice that he was to find her susceptible   iv  she couldnt have said what it was in the conditions that renewed the whole solemnity but by the end of twenty minutes a kind of wistful hush had fallen upon them as before something poignant in which her visitor also participated that was nothing verily but the perfection of the charmor nothing rather but their excluded disinherited state in the presence of it the charm turned on them a face that was cold in its beauty that was full of a poetry never to be theirs that spoke with an ironic smile of a possible but forbidden life it all rolled afresh over milly oh the impossible romance the romance for her yet once more would be to sit there for ever through all her time as in a fortress and the idea became an image of never going down of remaining aloft in the divine dustless air where she would hear but the plash of the water against stone the great floor on which they moved was at an altitude and this prompted the rueful fancy ah not to go downnever never to go down she strangely sighed to her friend  but why shouldnt you he asked with that tremendous old staircase in your court there ought of course always to be people at top and bottom in veronese costumes to watch you do it  she shook her head both lightly and mournfully enough at his not understanding not even for people in veronese costumes i mean that the positive beauty is that one neednt go down i dont move in fact she addednow ive not been out you know i stay up thats how you happily found me  lord mark wonderedhe was oh yes adequately human you dont go about  she looked over the place the storey above the apartments in which she had received him the sala corresponding to the sala below and fronting the great canal with its gothic arches the casements between the arches were open the ledge of the balcony broad the sweep of the canal so overhung admirable and the flutter toward them of the loose white curtain an invitation to she scarce could have said what but there was no mystery after a moment she had never felt so invited to anything as to make that and that only just where she was her adventure it would beto this it kept coming backthe adventure of not stirring i go about just here  do you mean lord mark presently asked that youre really not well  they were at the window pausing lingering with the fine old faded palaces opposite and the slow adriatic tide beneath but after a minute and before she answered she had closed her eyes to what she saw and unresistingly dropped her face into her arms which rested on the coping she had fallen to her knees on the cushion of the windowplace and she leaned there in a long silence with her forehead down she knew that her silence was itself too straight an answer but it was beyond her now to say that she saw her way she would have made the question itself impossible to othersimpossible for example to such a man as merton densher and she could wonder even on the spot what it was a sign of in her feeling for lord mark that from his lips it almost tempted her to break down this was doubtless really because she cared for him so little to let herself go with him thus suffer his touch to make her cup overflow would be the reliefsince it was actually for her nerves a question of reliefthat would cost her least if he had come to her moreover with the intention she believed or even if this intention had but been determined in him by the spell of their situation he mustnt be mistaken about her valuefor what value did she now have it throbbed within her as she knelt there that she had none at all though holding herself not yet speaking she tried even in the act to recover what might be possible of it with that there came to her a light wouldnt her value for the man who should marry her be precisely in the ravage of her disease she mightnt last but her money would for a man in whom the vision of her money should be intense in whom it should be most of the ground for making up to her any prospective failure on her part to be long for this world might easily count as a positive attraction such a man proposing to please persuade secure her appropriate her for such a time shorter or longer as nature and the doctors should allow would make the best of her ill damaged disagreeable though she might be for the sake of eventual benefits she being clearly a person of the sort esteemed likely to do the handsome thing by a stricken and sorrowing husband  she had said to herself betimes in a general way that whatever habits her youth might form that of seeing an interested suitor in every bush should certainly never grow to be one of theman attitude she had early judged as ignoble as poisonous she had had accordingly in fact as little to do with it as possible and she scarce knew why at the present moment she should have had to catch herself in the act of imputing an ugly motive it didnt sit the ugly motive in lord marks cool english eyes the darker side of it at any rate showed to her imagination but briefly suspicion moreover with this simplified itself there was a beautiful reasonindeed there were twowhy her companions motive shouldnt matter one was that even should he desire her without a penny she wouldnt marry him for the world the other was that she felt him after all perceptively kindly very pleasantly and humanly concerned for her they were also two things his wishing to be well to be very well with her and his beginning to feel her as threatened haunted blighted but they were melting together for him making him by their combination only the more sure that as he probably called it to himself he liked her that was presently what remained with herhis really doing it and with the natural and proper incident of being conciliated by her weakness would she really have had himshe could ask herself thatdisconcerted or disgusted by it if he could only be touched enough to do what she preferred not to raise not to press any question he might render her a much better service than by merely enabling her to refuse him again again it was strange but he figured to her for the moment as the one safe sympathiser it would have made her worse to talk to others but she wasnt afraid with him of how he might wince and look pale she would keep him that is her one easy relationin the sense of easy for himself their actual outlook had meanwhile such charm what surrounded them within and without did so much toward making appreciative stillness as natural as at the opera that she could consider she hadnt made him hang on her lips when at last instead of saying if she were well or ill she repeated i go about here i dont get tired of it i never shouldit suits me so i adore the place she went on and i dont want in the least to give it up  neither should i if i had your luck still with that luck for ones all should you positively like to live here  i think i should like said poor milly after an instant to die here  which made him precisely laugh that was what she wantedwhen a person did care it was the pleasant human way without depths of darkness oh its not good enough for that that requires picking but cant you keep it it is you know the sort of place to see you in you carry out the note fill it people it quite by yourself and you might do much worsei mean for your friendsthan show yourself here a while three or four months every year but its not my notion for the rest of the time one has quite other uses for you  what sort of a use for me is it she smilingly enquired to kill me  do you mean we should kill you in england  well ive seen you and im afraid youre too much for metoo many england bristles with questions this is more as you say there my form  oho ohohe laughed again as if to humour her cant you then buy itfor a price depend upon it theyll treat for money that is for money enough  ive exactly she said been wondering if they wont i think i shall try but if i get it i shall cling to it they were talking sincerely it will be my lifepaid for as that it will become my great gilded shell so that those who wish to find me must come and hunt me up  ah then you will be alive said lord mark  well not quite extinct perhaps but shrunken wasted wizened rattling about here like the dried kernel of a nut  oh lord mark returned we much as you mistrust us can do better for you than that  in the sense that youll feel it better for me really to have it over  he let her see now that she worried him and after a look at her of some duration without his glasseswhich always altered the expression of his eyeshe resettled the nippers on his nose and went back to the view but the view in turn soon enough released him do you remember something i said to you that day at matchamor at least fully meant to  oh yes i remember everything at matcham its another life  certainly it will bei mean the kind of thing what i then wanted it to represent for you matcham you know he continued is symbolic i think i tried to rub that into you a little  she met him with the full memory of what he had triednot an inch not an ounce of which was lost to her what i meant is that it seems a hundred years ago  oh for me it comes in better perhaps a part of what makes me remember it he pursued is that i was quite aware of what might have been said about what i was doing i wanted you to take it from me that i should perhaps be able to look after youwell rather better rather better of course than certain other persons in particular  preciselythan mrs lowder than miss croy even than mrs stringham  oh mrs stringhams all right lord mark promptly amended  it amused her even with what she had else to think of and she could show him at all events how little in spite of the hundred years she had lost what he alluded to the way he was with her at this moment made in fact the other moment so vivid as almost to start again the tears it had started at the time you could do so much for me yes i perfectly understood you  i wanted you see he despite this explained to fix your confidence i mean you know in the right place  well lord mark you didits just exactly now my confidence where you put it then the only difference said milly is that i seem now to have no use for it besides she then went on i do seem to feel you disposed to act in a way that would undermine it a little  he took no more notice of these last words than if she hadnt said them only watching her at present as with a gradual new light are you really in any trouble  to this on her side she gave no heed making out his light was a little a light for herself dont say dont try to say anything thats impossible there are much better things you can do  he looked straight at it and then straight over it its too monstrous that one cant ask you as a friend what one wants so to know  what is it you want to know she spoke as by a sudden turn with a slight hardness do you want to know if im badly ill  the sound of it in truth though from no raising of her voice invested the idea with a kind of terror but a terror all for others lord mark winced and flushedclearly couldnt help it but he kept his attitude together and spoke even with unwonted vivacity do you imagine i can see you suffer and not say a word  you wont see me sufferdont be afraid i shant be a public nuisance thats why i should have liked this its so beautiful in itself and yet its out of the gangway you wont know anything about anything she added and then as if to make with decision an end and you dont no not even you he faced her through it with the remains of his expression and she saw him as clearlyfor himbewildered which made her wish to be sure not to have been unkind she would be kind once for all that would be the end im very badly ill  and you dont do anything  i do everything everythings this she smiled im doing it now one cant do more than live  ah than live in the right way no but is that what you do why havent you advice  he had looked about at the rococo elegance as if there were fifty things it didnt give her so that he suggested with urgency the most absent but she met his remedy with a smile ive the best advice in the world im acting under it now i act upon it in receiving you in talking with you thus one cant as i tell you do more than live  oh live lord mark ejaculated  well its immense for me she finally spoke as if for amusement now that she had uttered her truth that he had learnt it from herself as no one had yet done her emotion had by the fact dried up there she was but it was as if she would never speak again i shant she added have missed everything  why should you have missed anything she felt as he sounded this to what within the minute he had made up his mind youre the person in the world for whom thats least necessary for whom one would call it in fact most impossible for whom missing at all will surely require an extraordinary amount of misplaced good will since you believe in advice for gods sake take mine i know what you want  oh she knew he would know it but she had brought it on herselfor almost yet she spoke with kindness i think i want not to be too much worried  you want to be adored it came at last straight nothing would worry you less i mean as i shall do it it is sohe firmly kept it up youre not loved enough  enough for what lord mark  why to get the full good of it  well she didnt after all mock at him i see what you mean that full good of it which consists in finding ones self forced to love in return she had grasped it but she hesitated your idea is that i might find myself forced to love you  oh forced he was so fine and so expert so awake to anything the least ridiculous and of a type with which the preaching of passion somehow so ill consortedhe was so much all these things that he had absolutely to take account of them himself and he did so in a single intonation beautifully milly liked him again liked him for such shades as that liked him so that it was woeful to see him spoiling it and still more woeful to have to rank him among those minor charms of existence that she gasped at moments to remember she must give up is it inconceivable to you that you might try  to be so favourably affected by you  to believe in me to believe in me lord mark repeated  again she hesitated to try in return for your trying  oh i shouldnt have to he quickly declared the prompt neat accent however his manner of disposing of her question failed of real expression as he himself the next moment intelligently helplessly almost comically sawa failure pointed moreover by the laugh into which milly was immediately startled as a suggestion to her of a healing and uplifting passion it was in truth deficient it wouldnt do as the communication of a force that should sweep them both away and the beauty of him was that he too even in the act of persuasion of selfpersuasion could understand that and could thereby show but the better as fitting into the pleasant commerce of prosperity the way she let him see that she looked at him was a thing to shut him out of itself from services of danger a thing that made a discrimination against him never yet mademade at least to any consciousness of his own born to float in a sustaining air this would be his first encounter with a judgement formed in the sinister light of tragedy the gathering dusk of her personal world presented itself to him in her eyes as an element in which it was vain for him to pretend he could find himself at home since it was charged with depressions and with dooms with the chill of the losing game almost without her needing to speak and simply by the fact that there could be in such a case no decent substitute for a felt intensity he had to take it from her that practically he was afraidwhether afraid to protest falsely enough or only afraid of what might be eventually disagreeable in a compromised alliance being a minor question she believed she made out besides wonderful girl that he had never quite expected to have to protest about anything beyond his natural conveniencemore in fine than his disposition and habits his education as well his personal moyens in short permitted his predicament was therefore one he couldnt like and also one she willingly would have spared him hadnt he brought it on himself no man she was quite aware could enjoy thus having it from her that he wasnt good for what she would have called her reality it wouldnt have taken much more to enable her positively to make out in him that he was virtually capable of hintinghad his innermost feeling spokenat the propriety rather in his interest of some cutting down some dressing up of the offensive real he would meet that halfway but the real must also meet him millys sense of it for herself which was so conspicuously so financially supported couldnt or wouldnt so accommodate him and the perception of that fairly showed in his face after a moment like the smart of a blow it had marked the one minute during which he could again be touching to her by the time he had tried once more after all to insist he had quite ceased to be so  by this time she had turned from their window to make a diversion had walked him through other rooms appealing again to the inner charm of the place going even so far for that purpose as to point afresh her independent moral to repeat that if one only had such a house for ones own and loved it and cherished it enough it would pay one back in kind would close one in from harm he quite grasped for the quarter of an hour the perch she held out to himgrasped it with one hand that is while she felt him attached to his own clue with the other he was by no means either so sore or so stupid to do him all justice as not to be able to behave more or less as if nothing had happened it was one of his merits to which she did justice too that both his native and his acquired notion of behaviour rested on the general assumption that nothingnothing to make a deadly difference for himever could happen it was socially a working view like another and it saw them easily enough through the greater part of the rest of their adventure downstairs again however with the limit of his stay in sight the sign of his smarting when all was said reappeared for herbreaking out moreover with an effect of strangeness in another quite possibly sincere allusion to her state of health he might for that matter have been seeing what he could do in the way of making it a grievance that she should snub him for a charity on his own part exquisitely roused its true you know all the same and i dont care a straw for your trying to freeze one up he seemed to show her poor man bravely how little he cared everybody knows affection often makes things out when indifference doesnt notice and thats why i know that i notice  are you sure youve got it right the girl smiled i thought rather that affection was supposed to be blind  blind to faults not to beauties lord mark promptly returned  and are my extremely private worries my entirely domestic complications which im ashamed to have given you a glimpse ofare they beauties  yes for those who care for youas every one does everything about you is a beauty besides which i dont believe he declared in the seriousness of what you tell me its too absurd you should have any trouble about which something cant be done if you cant get the right thing who can in all the world i should like to know youre the first young woman of your time i mean what i say he looked to do him justice quite as if he did not ardent but clearsimply so competent in such a position to compare that his quiet assertion had the force not so much perhaps of a tribute as of a warrant were all in love with you ill put it that way dropping any claim of my own if you can bear it better i speak as one of the lot you werent born simply to torment usyou were born to make us happy therefore you must listen to us  she shook her head with her slowness but this time with all her mildness no i mustnt listen to youthats just what i mustnt do the reason is please that it simply kills me i must be as attached to you as you will since you give that lovely account of yourselves i give you in return the fullest possible belief of what it would be and she pulled up a little i give and give and givethere you are stick to me as close as you like and see if i dont only i cant listen or receive or accepti cant agree i cant make a bargain i cant really you must believe that from me its all ive wanted to say to you and why should it spoil anything  he let her question fallthough clearly it might have seemed because for reasons or for none there was so much that was spoiled you want somebody of your own he came back whether in good faith or in bad to that and it made her repeat her headshake he kept it up as if his faith were of the best you want somebody you want somebody  she was to wonder afterwards if she hadnt been at this juncture on the point of saying something emphatic and vulgarwell i dont at all events want you what somehow happened nevertheless the pity of it being greater than the irritationthe sadness to her vivid sense of his being so painfully astray wandering in a desert in which there was nothing to nourish himwas that his error amounted to positive wrongdoing she was moreover so acquainted with quite another sphere of usefulness for him that her having suffered him to insist almost convicted her of indelicacy why hadnt she stopped him off with her first impression of his purpose she could do so now only by the allusion she had been wishing not to make do you know i dont think youre doing very rightand as a thing quite apart i mean from my listening to you thats not right eitherexcept that im not listening you oughtnt to have come to venice to see meand in fact youve not come and you mustnt behave as if you had youve much older friends than i and ever so much better really if youve come at all you can only have comeproperly and if i may say so honourablyfor the best friend as i believe her to be that you have in the world  when once she had said it he took it oddly enough as if he had been more or less expecting it still he looked at her very hard and they had a moment of this during which neither pronounced a name each apparently determined that the other should it was millys fine coercion in the event that was the stronger miss croy lord mark asked  it might have been difficult to make out that she smiled mrs lowder he did make out something and then fairly coloured for its attestation of his comparative simplicity i call her on the whole the best i cant imagine a mans having a better  still with his eyes on her he turned it over do you want me to marry mrs lowder  at which it seemed to her that it was he who was almost vulgar but she wouldnt in any way have that you know lord mark what i mean one isnt in the least turning you out into the cold world theres no cold world for you at all i think she went on nothing but a very warm and watchful and expectant world thats waiting for you at any moment you choose to take it up  he never budged but they were standing on the polished concrete and he had within a few minutes possessed himself again of his hat do you want me to marry kate croy  mrs lowder wants iti do no wrong i think in saying that and she understands moreover that you know she does  well he showed how beautifully he could take it and it wasnt obscure to her on her side that it was a comfort to deal with a gentleman its ever so kind of you to see such opportunities for me but whats the use of my tackling miss croy  milly rejoiced on the spot to be so able to point out because shes the handsomest and cleverest and most charming creature i ever saw and because if i were a man i should simply adore her in fact i do as it is it was a luxury of response  oh my dear lady plenty of people adore her but that cant further the case of all  ah she went on i know about people if the case of ones bad the case of anothers good i dont see what you have to fear from any one else she said save through your being foolish this way about me  so she said but she was aware the next moment of what he was making of what she didnt see is it your ideasince were talking of these things in these waysthat the young lady you describe in such superlative terms is to be had for the asking  well lord mark try she is a great person but dont be humble she was almost gay  it was this apparently at last that was too much for him but dont you really know  as a challenge practically to the commonest intelligence she could pretend to it made her of course wish to be fair i know yes that a particular persons very much in love with her  then you must know by the same token that shes very much in love with a particular person  ah i beg your pardonand milly quite flushed at having so crude a blunder imputed to her youre wholly mistaken  its not true  its not true  his stare became a smile are you very very sure  as sure as one can beand millys manner could match itwhen one has every assurance i speak on the best authority  he hesitated mrs lowders  no i dont call mrs lowders the best  oh i thought you were just now saying he laughed that everything about hers so good  good for youshe was perfectly clear for you she went on let her authority be the best she doesnt believe what you mention and you must know yourself how little she makes of it so you can take it from her i take it but milly with the positive tremor of her emphasis pulled up  you take it from kate  from kate herself  that shes thinking of no one at all  of no one at all then with her intensity she went on she has given me her word for it  oh said lord mark to which he next added and what do you call her word  it made milly on her side starethough perhaps partly but with the instinct of gaining time for the consciousness that she was already a little further in than she had designed why lord mark what should you call her word  ah im not obliged to say ive not asked her you apparently have  well it threw her on her defencea defence that she felt however especially as of kate were very intimate she said in a moment so that without prying into each others affairs she naturally tells me things  lord mark smiled as at a lame conclusion you mean then she made you of her own movement the declaration you quote  milly thought again though with hindrance rather than help in her sense of the way their eyes now metmet as for their each seeing in the other more than either said what she most felt that she herself saw was the strange disposition on her companions part to disparage kates veracity she could be only concerned to stand up for that  i mean what i say that when she spoke of her having no private interest  she took her oath to you lord mark interrupted  milly didnt quite see why he should so catechise her but she met it again for kate she left me in no doubt whatever of her being free  at this lord mark did look at her though he continued to smile and thereby in no doubt of your being too it was as if as soon as he had said it however he felt it as something of a mistake and she couldnt herself have told by what queer glare at him she had instantly signified that he at any rate gave her glare no time to act further he fell back on the spot and with a light enough movement within his rights thats all very well but why in the world dear lady should she be swearing to you  she had to take this dear lady as applying to herself which disconcerted her when he might now so gracefully have used it for the aspersed kate once more it came to her that she must claim her own part of the aspersion because as ive told you were such tremendous friends  oh said lord mark who for the moment looked as if that might have stood rather for an absence of such rigours he was going however as if he had in a manner at the last got more or less what he wanted milly felt while he addressed his next few words to leavetaking that she had given rather more than she intended or than she should be able when once more getting herself into hand theoretically to defend strange enough in fact that he had had from her about herselfand under the searching spell of the place infinitely straightwhat no one else had had neither kate nor aunt maud nor merton densher nor susan shepherd he had made her within a minute in particular she was aware lose her presence of mind and she now wished he would take himself off so that she might either recover it or bear the loss better in solitude if he paused however she almost at the same time saw it was because of his watching the approach from the end of the sala of one of the gondoliers who whatever excursions were appointed for the party with the attendance of the others always as the most decorative most sashed and starched remained at the palace on the theory that she might whimsically want himwhich she never in her caged freedom had yet done brown pasquale slipping in white shoes over the marble and suggesting to her perpetually charmed vision she could scarce say what either a mild hindoo too noiseless almost for her nerves or simply a barefooted seaman on the deck of a shippasquale offered to sight a small salver which he obsequiously held out to her with its burden of a visitingcard lord markand as if also for admiration of himdelayed his departure to let her receive it on which she read it with the instant effect of another blow to her presence of mind this precarious quantity was indeed now so gone that even for dealing with pasquale she had to do her best to conceal its disappearance the effort was made none the less by the time she had asked if the gentleman were below and had taken in the fact that he had come up he had followed the gondolier and was waiting at the top of the staircase  ill see him with pleasure to which she added for her companion while pasquale went off mr merton densher  oh said lord markin a manner that making it resound through the great cool hall might have carried it even to denshers ear as a judgement of his identity heard and noted once before     book eighth    i  densher became aware afresh that he disliked his hoteland all the more promptly that he had had occasion of old to make the same discrimination the establishment choked at that season with the polyglot herd cockneys of all climes mainly german mainly american mainly english it appeared as the corresponding sensitive nerve was touched sounded loud and not sweet sounded anything and everything but italian but venetian the venetian was all a dialect he knew yet it was pure attic beside some of the dialects at the bustling inn it made abroad both for his pleasure and his pain that he had to feel at almost any point how he had been through every thing before he had been three or four times in venice during other visits through this pleasant irritation of paddling awayaway from the concert of false notes in the vulgarised hall away from the amiable american families and overfed german porters he had in each case made terms for a lodging more private and not more costly and he recalled with tenderness these shabby but friendly asylums the windows of which he should easily know again in passing on canal or through campo the shabbiest now failed of an appeal to him but he found himself at the end of fortyeight hours forming views in respect to a small independent quartiere far down the grand canal which he had once occupied for a month with a sense of pomp and circumstance and yet also with a growth of initiation into the homelier venetian mysteries the humour of those days came back to him for an hour and what further befell in this interval to be brief was that emerging on a traghetto in sight of the recognised house he made out on the green shutters of his old of his young windows the strips of white pasted paper that figure in venice as an invitation to tenants this was in the course of his very first walk apart a walk replete with impressions to which he responded with force he had been almost without cessation since his arrival at palazzo leporelli where as happened a turn of bad weather on the second day had kept the whole party continuously at home the episode had passed for him like a series of hours in a museum though without the fatigue of that and it had also resembled something that he was still with a stirred imagination to find a name for he might have been looking for the name while he gave himself up subsequently to the ramblehe saw that even after years he couldnt lose his waycrowned with his stare across the water at the little white papers  he was to dine at the palace in an hour or two and he had lunched there at an early luncheon that morning he had then been out with the three ladies the three being mrs lowder mrs stringham and kate and had kept afloat with them under a sufficient venetian spell until aunt maud had directed him to leave them and return to miss theale of two circumstances connected with this disposition of his person he was even now not unmindful the first being that the lady of lancaster gate had addressed him with high publicity and as if expressing equally the sense of her companions who had not spoken but who might have been takenyes susan shepherd quite equally with katefor inscrutable parties to her plan what he could as little contrive to forget was that he had before the two others as it struck himthat was to say especially before katedone exactly as he was bidden gathered himself up without a protest and retraced his way to the palace present with him still was the question of whether he looked a fool for it of whether the awkwardness he felt as the gondola rocked with the business of his leaving itthey could but make in submission for a landingplace that was none of the besthad furnished his friends with such entertainment as was to cause them behind his back to exchange intelligent smiles he had found milly theale twenty minutes later alone and he had sat with her till the others returned to tea the strange part of this was that it had been very easy extraordinarily easy he knew it for strange only when he was away from her because when he was away from her he was in contact with particular things that made it so at the time in her presence it was as simple as sitting with his sister might have been and not if the point were urged very much more thrilling he continued to see her as he had first seen herthat remained ineffaceably behind mrs lowder susan shepherd his own kate might each in proportion see her as a princess as an angel as a star but for himself luckily she hadnt as yet complications to any point of discomfort the princess the angel the star were muffled over ever so lightly and brightly with the little american girl who had been kind to him in new york and to whom certainlythough without making too much of it for either of themhe was perfectly willing to be kind in return she appreciated his coming in on purpose but there was nothing in thatfrom the moment she was always at homethat they couldnt easily keep up the only note the least bit high that had even yet sounded between them was this admission on her part that she found it best to remain within she wouldnt let him call it keeping quiet for she insisted that her palacewith all its romance and art and historyhad set up round her a whirlwind of suggestion that never dropped for an hour it wasnt therefore within such walls confinement it was the freedom of all the centuries in respect to which densher granted goodhumouredly that they were then blown together she and he as much as she liked through space  kate had found on the present occasion a moment to say to him that he suggested a clever cousin calling on a cousin afflicted and bored for his pains and though he denied on the spot the bored he could so far see it as an impression he might make that he wondered if the same image wouldnt have occurred to milly as soon as kate appeared again the difference came upthe oddity as he then instantly felt it of his having sunk so deep it was sinking because it was all doing what kate had conceived for him it wasnt in the least doingand that had been his notion of his lifeanything he himself had conceived the difference accordingly renewed sharp sore was the irritant under which he had quitted the palace and under which he was to make the best of the business of again dining there he said to himself that he must make the best of everything that was in his mind at the traghetto even while with his preoccupation about changing quarters he studied across the canal the look of his former abode it had done for the past would it do for the present would it play in any manner into the general necessity of which he was conscious that necessity of making the best was the instinctas he indeed himself knewof a man somehow aware that if he let go at one place he should let go everywhere if he took off his hand the hand that at least helped to hold it together the whole queer fabric that built him in would fall away in a minute and admit the light it was really a matter of nerves it was exactly because he was nervous that he could go straight yet if that condition should increase he must surely go wild he was walking in short on a high ridge steep down on either side where the proprietiesonce he could face at all remaining therereduced themselves to his keeping his head it was kate who had so perched him and there came up for him at moments as he found himself planting one foot exactly before another a sensible sharpness of irony as to her management of him it wasnt that she had put him in dangerto be in real danger with her would have had another quality there glowed for him in fact a kind of rage at what he wasnt having an exasperation a resentment begotten truly by the very impatience of desire in respect to his postponed and relegated his so extremely manipulated state it was beautifully done of her but what was the real meaning of it unless that he was perpetually bent to her will his idea from the first from the very first of his knowing her had been to be as the french called it bon prince with her mindful of the good humour and generosity the contempt in the matter of confidence for small outlays and small savings that belonged to the man who wasnt generally afraid there were things enough goodness knewfor it was the moral of his plightthat he couldnt afford but what had had a charm for him if not the notion of living handsomely to make up for it in another way of not at all events reading the romance of his existence in a cheap edition all he had originally felt in her came back to him was indeed actually as present as everhow he had admired and envied what he called to himself her pure talent for life as distinguished from his own a poor weak thing of the occasion amateurishly patched up only it irritated him the more that this was exactly what was now ever so characteristically standing out in her  it was thanks to her pure talent for life verily that he was just where he was and that he was above all just how he was the proof of a decent reaction in him against so much passivity was with no great richness that he at least knewknew that is how he was and how little he liked it as a thing accepted in mere helplessness he was for the moment wistfulthat above all described it that was so large a part of the force that as the autumn afternoon closed in kept him on his traghetto positively throbbing with his question his question connected itself even while he stood with his special smothered soreness his sense almost of shame and the soreness and the shame were less as he let himself with the help of the conditions about him regard it as serious it was born for that matter partly of the conditions those conditions that kate had so almost insolently braved had been willing without a pang to see him ridiculouslyridiculously so far as just complacentlyexposed to how little it could be complacently he was to feel with the last thoroughness before he had moved from his point of vantage his question as we have called it was the interesting question of whether he had really no will left how could he knowthat was the pointwithout putting the matter to the test it had been right to be bon prince and the joy something of the pride of having lived in spirit handsomely was even now compatible with the impulse to look into their account but he held his breath a little as it came home to him with supreme sharpness that whereas he had done absolutely everything that kate had wanted she had done nothing whatever that he had so it was in fine that his idea of the test by which he must try that possibility kept referring itself in the warm early dusk the approach of the southern nightconditions these such as we just spoke ofto the glimmer more and more ghostly as the light failed of the little white papers on his old green shutters by the time he looked at his watch he had been for a quarter of an hour at this post of observation and reflexion but by the time he walked away again he had found his answer to the idea that had grown so importunate since a proof of his will was wanted it was indeed very exactly in wait for himit lurked there on the other side of the canal a ferryman at the little pier had from time to time accosted him but it was a part of the play of his nervousness to turn his back on that facility he would go over but he walked very quickly round and round crossing finally by the rialto the rooms in the event were unoccupied the ancient padrona was there with her smile all a radiance but her recognition all a fable the ancient rickety objects too refined in their shabbiness amiable in their decay as to which on his side demonstrations were tenderly veracious so that before he took his way again he had arranged to come in on the morrow  he was amusing about it that evening at dinnerin spite of an odd first impulse which at the palace quite melted away to treat it merely as matter for his own satisfaction this need this propriety he had taken for granted even up to the moment of suddenly perceiving in the course of talk that the incident would minister to innocent gaiety such was quite its effect with the aid of his picturean evocation of the quaint of the humblest rococo of a venetian interior in the true old note he made the point for his hostess that her own high chambers though they were a thousand grand things werent really this made it in fact with such success that she presently declared it his plain duty to invite her on some near day to tea she had expressed as yethe could feel it as felt among them allno such clear wish to go anywhere not even to make an effort for a parish feast or an autumn sunset nor to descend her staircase for titian or gianbellini it was constantly denshers view that as between himself and kate things were understood without saying so that he could catch in her as she but too freely could in him innumerable signs of it the whole soft breath of consciousness meeting and promoting consciousness this view was so far justified tonight as that millys offer to him of her company was to his sense taken up by kate in spite of her doing nothing to show it it fell in so perfectly with what she had desired and foretold that she wasand this was what most struck himsufficiently gratified and blinded by it not to know from the false quality of his response from his tone and his very look which for an instant instinctively sought her own that he had answered inevitably almost shamelessly in a mere timegaining sense it gave him on the spot her failure of perception almost a beginning of the advantage he had been planning forthat is at least if she too were not darkly dishonest she might he was not unaware have made out from some deep part of her the bearing in respect to herself of the little fact he had announced for she was after all capable of that capable of guessing and yet of simultaneously hiding her guess it wound him up a turn or two further none the less to impute to her now a weakness of vision by which he could himself feel the stronger whatever apprehension of his motive in shifting his abode might have brushed her with its wings she at all events certainly didnt guess that he was giving their friend a hollow promise that was what she had herself imposed on him there had been in the prospect from the first a definite particular point at which hollowness to call it by its least compromising name would have to begin therefore its hour had now charmingly sounded whatever in life he had recovered his old rooms for he had not recovered them to receive milly theale which made no more difference in his expression of happy readiness than if he had beenjust what he was trying not to befully hardened and fully base so rapid in fact was the rhythm of his inward drama that the quick vision of impossibility produced in him by his hostesss direct and unexpected appeal had the effect slightly sinister of positively scaring him it gave him a measure of the intensity the reality of his now mature motive it prompted in him certainly no quarrel with these things but it made them as vivid as if they already flushed with success it was before the flush of success that his heart beat almost to dread the dread was but the dread of the happiness to be compassed only that was in itself a symptom that a visit from milly should in this projection of necessities strike him as of the last incongruity quite as a hateful idea and above all as spoiling should one put it grossly his gamethe adoption of such a view might of course have an identity with one of those numerous ways of being a fool that seemed so to abound for him it would remain none the less the way to which he should be in advance most reconciled his mature motive as to which he allowed himself no grain of illusion had thus in an hour taken imaginative possession of the place that precisely was how he saw it seated there already unpacked and settled for millys innocence for millys beauty no matter how short a time to be housed with there were things she would never recognise never feel never catch in the air but this made no difference in the fact that her brushing against them would do nobody any good the discrimination and the scruple were for him so he felt all the parts of the case together while kate showed admirably as feeling none of them of course howeverwhen hadnt it to be his last wordkate was always sublime  that came up in all connexions during the rest of these first days came up in especial under pressure of the fact that each time our plighted pair snatched in its passage at the good fortune of half an hour together they were doomedthough densher felt it as all by his actto spend a part of the rare occasion in wonder at their luck and in study of its queer character this was the case after he might be supposed to have got in a manner used to it it was the case after the girlready always as we say with the last wordhad given him the benefit of her righting of every wrong appearance a support familiar to him now in reference to other phases it was still the case after he possibly might with a little imagination as she freely insisted have made out by the visible working of the crisis what idea on mrs lowders part had determined it such as the idea wasand that it suited kates own book she openly professedhe had only to see how things were turning out to feel it strikingly justified denshers reply to all this vividness was that of course aunt mauds intervention hadnt been occult even for his vividness from the moment she had written him with characteristic concentration that if he should see his way to come to venice for a fortnight she should engage he would find it no blunder it took aunt maud really to do such things in such ways just as it took him he was ready to confess to do such others as he must now strike them alldidnt heas committed to mrs lowders admonition had been of course a direct reference to what she had said to him at lancaster gate before his departure the night milly had failed them through illness only it had at least matched that remarkable outbreak in respect to the quantity of good nature it attributed to him the young mans discussions of his situationwhich were confined to kate he had none with aunt maud herselfsuffered a little it may be divined by the sense that he couldnt put everything off as he privately expressed it on other people his ears in solitude were apt to burn with the reflexion that mrs lowder had simply tested him seen him as he was and made out what could be done with him she had had but to whistle for him and he had come if she had taken for granted his good nature she was as justified as kate declared this awkwardness of his conscience both in respect to his general plasticity the fruit of his feeling plasticity within limits to be a mode of life like anothercertainly better than some and particularly in respect to such confusion as might reign about what he had really come forthis inward ache was not wholly dispelled by the style charming as that was of kates poetic versions even the high wonder and delight of kate couldnt set him right with himself when there was something quite distinct from these things that kept him wrong  in default of being right with himself he had meanwhile for one thing the interest of seeingand quite for the first time in his lifewhether on a given occasion that might be quite so necessary to happiness as was commonly assumed and as he had up to this moment never doubted he was engaged distinctly in an adventurehe who had never thought himself cut out for them and it fairly helped him that he was able at moments to say to himself that he mustnt fall below it at his hotel alone by night or in the course of the few late strolls he was finding time to take through dusky labyrinthine alleys and empty campi overhung with mouldering palaces where he paused in disgust at his want of ease and where the sound of a rare footstep on the enclosed pavement was like that of a retarded dancer in a banquethall desertedduring these interludes he entertained cold views even to the point at moments on the principle that the shortest follies are the best of thinking of immediate departure as not only possible but as indicated he had however only to cross again the threshold of palazzo leporelli to see all the elements of the business compose as painters called it differently it began to strike him then that departure wouldnt curtail but would signally coarsen his folly and that above all as he hadnt really begun anything had only submitted consented but too generously indulged and condoned the beginnings of others he had no call to treat himself with superstitious rigour the single thing that was clear in complications was that whatever happened one was to behave as a gentlemanto which was added indeed the perhaps slightly less shining truth that complications might sometimes have their tedium beguiled by a study of the question of how a gentleman would behave this question i hasten to add was not in the last resort denshers greatest worry three women were looking to him at once and though such a predicament could never be from the point of view of facility quite the ideal it yet had thank goodness its immediate workable law the law was not to be a brutein return for amiabilities he hadnt come all the way out from england to be a brute he hadnt thought of what it might give him to have a fortnight however handicapped with kate in venice to be a brute he hadnt treated mrs lowder as if in responding to her suggestion he had understood herhe hadnt done that either to be a brute and what he had prepared least of all for such an anticlimax was the prompt and inevitable the achieved surrenderas a gentleman oh that indubitablyto the unexpected impression made by poor pale exquisite milly as the mistress of a grand old palace and the dispenser of an hospitality more irresistible thanks to all the conditions than any ever known to him  this spectacle had for him an eloquence an authority a felicityhe scarce knew by what strange name to call itfor which he said to himself that he had not consciously bargained her welcome her frankness sweetness sadness brightness her disconcerting poetry as he made shift at moments to call it helped as it was by the beauty of her whole setting and by the perception at the same time on the observers part that this element gained from her in a manner for effect and harmony as much as it gaveher whole attitude had to his imagination meanings that hung about it waiting upon her hovering dropping and quavering forth again like vague faint snatches mere ghosts of sound of oldfashioned melancholy music it was positively well for him he had his times of reflecting that he couldnt put it off on kate and mrs lowder as a gentleman so conspicuously wouldnt thatwell that he had been rather taken in by not having known in advance there had been now five days of it all without his risking even to kate alone any hint of what he ought to have known and of what in particular therefore had taken him in the truth was doubtless that really when it came to any free handling and naming of things they were living together the five of them in an air in which an ugly effect of blurting out might easily be produced he came back with his friend on each occasion to the blest miracle of renewed propinquity which had a double virtue in that favouring air he breathed on it as if he could scarcely believe it yet the time had passed in spite of this privilege without his quite committing himself for her ear to any such comment on millys high style and state as would have corresponded with the amount of recognition it had produced in him behind everything for him was his renewed remembrance which had fairly become a habit that he had been the first to know her this was what they had all insisted on in her absence that day at mrs lowders and this was in especial what had made him feel its influence on his immediately paying her a second visit its influence had been all there been in the highhung rumbling carriage with them from the moment she took him to drive covering them in together as if it had been a rug of softest silk it had worked as a clear connexion with something lodged in the past something already their own he had more than once recalled how he had said to himself even at that moment at some point in the drive that he was not there not just as he was in so doing it through kate and kates idea but through milly and millys own and through himself and his own unmistakeablyas well as through the little facts whatever they had amounted to of his time in new york   ii  there was at last with everything that made for it an occasion when he got from kate on what she now spoke of as his eternal refrain an answer of which he was to measure afterwards the precipitating effect his eternal refrain was the way he came back to the riddle of mrs lowders view of her profita view so hard to reconcile with the chances she gave them to meet impatiently at this the girl denied the chances wanting to know from him with a fine irony that smote him rather straight whether he felt their opportunities as anything so grand he looked at her deep in the eyes when she had sounded this note it was the least he could let her off with for having made him visibly flush for some reason then with it the sharpness dropped out of her tone which became sweet and sincere meet my dear man she expressively echoed does it strike you that we get after all so very much out of our meetings  on the contrarytheyre starvation diet all i mean isand its all ive meant from the day i camethat we at least get more than aunt maud  ah but you see kate replied you dont understand what aunt maud gets  exactly soand its what i dont understand that keeps me so fascinated with the question she gives me no light shes prodigious she takes everything as of a natural  she takes it as of a natural that at this rate i shall be making my reflexions about you theres every appearance for her kate went on that what she had made her mind up to as possible is possible that what she had thought more likely than not to happen is happening the very essence of her as you surely by this time have made out for yourself is that when she adopts a view shewell to her own sense really brings the thing about fairly terrorizes with her view any other any opposite view and those not less who represent that ive often thought success comes to herkate continued to study the phenomenonby the spirit in her that dares and defies her idea not to prove the right one one has seen it so again and again in the face of everything become the right one  densher had for this as he listened a smile of the largest response ah my dear child if you can explain i of course neednt not understand im condemned to that he on his side presently explained only when understanding fails he took a moment then he pursued does she think she terrorises us to which he added while without immediate speech kate but looked over the place does she believe anything so stiff as that youve really changed about me he knew now that he was probing the girl deepsomething told him so but that was a reason the more has she got it into her head that you dislike me  to this of a sudden kates answer was strong you could yourself easily put it there  he wondered by telling her so  no said kate as with amusement at his simplicity i dont ask that of you  oh my dear densher laughed when you ask you know so little  there was a full irony in this on his own part that he saw her resist the impulse to take up im perfectly justified in what ive asked she quietly returned its doing beautifully for you their eyes again intimately met and the effect was to make her proceed youre not a bit unhappy  oh aint i he brought out very roundly  it doesnt practically showwhich is enough for aunt maud youre wonderful youre beautiful kate said and if you really want to know whether i believe youre doing it you may take from me perfectly that i see it coming with which by a quick transition as if she had settled the case she asked him the hour  oh only twelvetenhe had looked at his watch weve taken but thirteen minutes weve time yet  then we must walk we must go toward them  densher from where they had been standing measured the long reach of the square theyre still in their shop theyre safe for half an hour  that shows then that shows said kate  this colloquy had taken place in the middle of piazza san marco always as a great social saloon a smoothfloored blueroofed chamber of amenity favourable to talk or rather to be exact not in the middle but at the point where our pair had paused by a common impulse after leaving the great mosquelike church it rose now domed and pinnacled but a little way behind them and they had in front the vast empty space enclosed by its arcades to which at that hour movement and traffic were mostly confined venice was at breakfast the venice of the visitor and the possible acquaintance and except for the parties of importunate pigeons picking up the crumbs of perpetual feasts their prospect was clear and they could see their companions hadnt yet been and werent for a while longer likely to be disgorged by the laceshop in one of the loggie where shortly before they had left them for a lookinthe expression was artfully denshersat saint marks their morning had happened to take such a turn as brought this chance to the surface yet his allusion just made to kate hadnt been an overstatement of their general opportunity the worst that could be said of their general opportunity was that it was essentially in presencein presence of every one every one consisting at this juncture in a peopled world of susan shepherd aunt maud and milly but the proof how even in presence the opportunity could become special was furnished precisely by this view of the compatibility of their comfort with a certain amount of lingering the others had assented to their not waiting in the shop it was of course the least the others could do what had really helped them this morning was the fact that on his turning up as he always called it at the palace milly had not as before been able to present herself custom and use had hitherto seemed fairly established on his coming round day after dayeight days had been now so conveniently markedtheir friends millys and his conveniently dispersed and left him to sit with her till luncheon such was the perfect operation of the scheme on which he had been as he phrased it to himself had out so that certainly there was that amount of justification for kates vision of success he had for mrs lowderhe couldnt help it while sitting therethe air which was the thing to be desired of no absorption in kate sufficiently deep to be alarming he had failed their young hostess each morning as little as she had failed him it was only today that she hadnt been well enough to see him  that had made a mark all round the mark was in the way in which gathered in the room of state with the place from the right time all bright and cool and beflowered as always to receive her descent theythe rest of themsimply looked at each other it was luridlurid in all probability for each of them privatelythat they had uttered no common regrets it was strange for our young man above all that if the poor girl was indisposed to that degree the hush of gravity of apprehension of significance of some sort should be the most the casethat of the guestscould permit itself the hush for that matter continued after the party of four had gone down to the gondola and taken their places in it milly had sent them word that she hoped they would go out and enjoy themselves and this indeed had produced a second remarkable look a look as of their knowing one quite as well as the other what such a message meant as provision for the alternative beguilement of densher she wished not to have spoiled his morning and he had therefore in civility to take it as pleasantly patched up mrs stringham had helped the affair out mrs stringham who when it came to that knew their friend better than any of them she knew her so well that she knew herself as acting in exquisite compliance with conditions comparatively obscure approximately awful to them by not thinking it necessary to stay at home she had corrected that element of the perfunctory which was the slight fault for all of them of the occasion she had invented a preference for mrs lowder and herself she had remembered the fond dreams of the visitation of lace that had hitherto always been brushed away by accidents and it had come up as well for her that kate had the day before spoken of the part played by fatality in her own failure of real acquaintance with the inside of saint marks denshers sense of susan shepherds conscious intervention had by this time a corner of his mind all to itself something that had begun for them at lancaster gate was now a sentiment clothed in a shape her action ineffably discreet had at all events a way of affecting him as for the most part subtly even when not superficially in his own interest they were not as a pair as a team really united there were too many persons at least three and too many things between them but meanwhile something was preparing that would draw them closer he scarce knew what probably nothing but his finding at some hour when it would be a service to do so that she had all the while understood him he even had a presentiment of a juncture at which the understanding of every one else would fail and this deep little persons alone survive  such was today in its freshness the moral air as we may say that hung about our young friends these had been the small accidents and quiet forces to which they owed the advantage we have seen them in some sort enjoying it seemed in fact fairly to deepen for them as they stayed their course again the splendid square which had so notoriously in all the years witnessed more of the joy of life than any equal area in europe furnished them in their remoteness from earshot with solitude and security it was as if being in possession they could say what they liked and it was also as if in consequence of that each had an apprehension of what the other wanted to say it was most of all for them moreover as if this very quantity seated on their lips in the bright historic air where the only sign for their ears was the flutter of the doves begot in the heart of each a fear there might have been a betrayal of that in the way densher broke the silence resting on her last words what did you mean just now that i can do to make mrs lowder believe for myself stupidly if you will i dont see from the moment i cant lie to her what else there is but lying  well she could tell him you can say something both handsome and sincere to her about millywhom you honestly like so much that wouldnt be lying and coming from you it would have an effect you dont you know say much about her  and kate put before him the fruit of observation you dont you know speak of her at all  and has aunt maud densher asked told you so then as the girl for answer only seemed to bethink herself you must have extraordinary conversations he exclaimed  yes she had bethought herself we have extraordinary conversations  his look while their eyes met marked him as disposed to hear more about them but there was something in her own apparently that defeated the opportunity he questioned her in a moment on a different matter which had been in his mind a week yet in respect to which he had had no chance so good as this do you happen to know then as such wonderful things pass between you what she makes of the incident the other day of lord marks so very superficial visithis having spent here as i gather but the two or three hours necessary for seeing our friend and yet taken no time at all since he went off by the same nights train for seeing any one else what can she make of his not having waited to see you or to see herselfwith all he owes her  oh of course said kate she understands he came to make milly his offer of marriagehe came for nothing but that as milly wholly declined it his business was for the time at an end he couldnt quite on the spot turn round to make up to us  kate had looked surprised that as a matter of taste on such an adventurers part densher shouldnt see it but densher was lost in another thought do you mean that when turning up myself i found him leaving her that was what had been taking place between them  didnt you make it out my dear kate enquired  what sort of a blundering weathercock then is he the young man went on in his wonder  oh dont make too little of him kate smiled do you pretend that milly didnt tell you  how great an ass he had made of himself  kate continued to smile you are in love with her you know  he gave her another long look why since she has refused him should my opinion of lord mark show it im not obliged however to think well of him for such treatment of the other persons ive mentioned and i feel i dont understand from you why mrs lowder should  she doesntbut she doesnt care kate explained you know perfectly the terms on which lots of london people live together even when theyre supposed to live very well hes not committed to ushe was having his try maynt an unsatisfied man she asked always have his try  and come back afterwards with confidence in a welcome to the victim of his inconstancy  kate consented as for argument to be thought of as a victim oh but he has had his try at me so its all right  through your also having you mean refused him  she balanced an instant during which densher might have just wondered if pure historic truth were to suffer a slight strain but she dropped on the right side i havent let it come to that ive been too discouraging aunt maud she went onnow as lucid as everconsiders no doubt that she has a pledge from him in respect to me a pledge that would have been broken if milly had accepted him as the case stands that makes no difference  densher laughed out it isnt his merit that he has failed  its still his merit my dear that hes lord mark hes just what he was and what he knew he was its not for me either to reflect on him after ive so treated him  oh said densher impatiently youve treated him beautifully  im glad she smiled that you can still be jealous but before he could take it up she had more to say i dont see why it need puzzle you that millys so marked line gratifies aunt maud more than anything else can displease her what does she see but that milly herself recognises her situation with you as too precious to be spoiled such a recognition as that cant but seem to her to involve in some degree your own recognition out of which she therefore gets it that the more you have for milly the less you have for me  there were moments againwe know that from the first they had been numerouswhen he felt with a strange mixed passion the mastery of her mere way of putting things there was something in it that bent him at once to conviction and to reaction and this effect however it be named now broke into his tone oh if she began to know what i have for you  it wasnt ambiguous but kate stood up to it luckily for us we may really consider she doesnt so successful have we been  well he presently said i take from you what you give me and i suppose that to be consistentto stand on my feet where i do stand at alli ought to thank you only you know what you give me seems to me more than anything else the larger and larger size of my job it seems to me more than anything else what you expect of me it never seems to me somehow what i may expect of you theres so much you dont give me  she appeared to wonder and pray what is it i dont  i give you proof said densher you give me none  what then do you call proof she after a moment ventured to ask  your doing something for me  she considered with surprise am i not doing this for you do you call this nothing  nothing at all  ah i risk my dear everything for it  they had strolled slowly further but he was brought up short i thought you exactly contend that with your aunt so bamboozled you risk nothing  it was the first time since the launching of her wonderful idea that he had seen her at a loss he judged the next instant moreover that she didnt like iteither the being so or the being seen for she soon spoke with an impatience that showed her as wounded an appearance that produced in himself he no less quickly felt a sharp pang of indulgence what then do you wish me to risk  the appeal from danger touched him but all to make him as he would have said worse what i wish is to be loved how can i feel at this rate that i am oh she understood him for all she might so bravely disguise it and that made him feel straighter than if she hadnt deep always was his sense of life with herdeep as it had been from the moment of those signs of life that in the dusky london of two winters ago they had originally exchanged he had never taken her for unguarded ignorant weak and if he put to her a claim for some intenser faith between them this was because he believed it could reach her and she could meet it i can go on perhaps he said with help but i cant go on without  she looked away from him now and it showed him how she understood we ought to be therei mean when they come out  they wont come outnot yet and i dont care if they do to which he straightway added as if to deal with the charge of selfishness that his words sounding for himself struck him as enabling her to make why not have done with it all and face the music as we are it broke from him in perfect sincerity good god if youd only take me  it brought her eyes round to him again and he could see how after all somewhere deep within she felt his rebellion more sweet than bitter its effect on her spirit and her sense was visibly to hold her an instant weve gone too far she none the less pulled herself together to reply do you want to kill her  he had an hesitation that wasnt all candid kill you mean aunt maud  you know whom i mean weve told too many lies  oh at this his head went up i my dear have told none  he had brought it out with a sharpness that did him good but he had naturally none the less to take the look it made her give him thank you very much  her expression however failed to check the words that had already risen to his lips rather than lay myself open to the least appearance of it ill go this very night  then go said kate croy  he knew after a little while they walked on again together that what was in the air for him and disconcertingly was not the violence but much rather the cold quietness of the way this had come from her they walked on together and it was for a minute as if their difference had become of a sudden in all truth a splitas if the basis of his departure had been settled then incoherently and still more suddenly recklessly moreover since they now might easily from under the arcades be observed he passed his hand into her arm with a force that produced for them another pause ill tell any lie you want any your idea requires if youll only come to me  come to you  come to me  how where  she spoke low but there was somehow for his uncertainty a wonder in her being so equal to him to my rooms which are perfectly possible and in taking which the other day i had you as you must have felt in view we can arrange itwith two grains of courage people in our case always arrange it she listened as for the good information and there was support for himsince it was a question of his going step by stepin the way she took no refuge in showing herself shocked he had in truth not expected of her that particular vulgarity but the absence of it only added the thrill of a deeper reason to his sense of possibilities for the knowledge of what she was he had absolutely to see her now incapable of refuge stand there for him in all the light of the day and of his admirable merciless meaning her mere listening in fact made him even understand himself as he hadnt yet done idea for idea his own was thus already and in the germ beautiful theres nothing for me possible but to feel that im not a fool its all i have to say but you must know what it means with you i can do itill go as far as you demand or as you will yourself without youill be hanged and i must be sure  she listened so well that she was really listening after he had ceased to speak he had kept his grasp of her drawing her close and though they had again for the time stopped walking his talkfor others at a distancemight have been in the matchless place that of any impressed tourist to any slightly more detached companion on possessing himself of her arm he had made her turn so that they faced afresh to saint marks over the great presence of which his eyes moved while she twiddled her parasol she now however made a motion that confronted them finally with the opposite end then only she spokeplease take your hand out of my arm he understood at once she had made out in the shade of the gallery the issue of the others from their place of purchase so they went to them side by side and it was all right the others had seen them as well and waited for them complacent enough under one of the arches they themselves toohe argued that kate would arguelooked perfectly ready decently patient properly accommodating they themselves suggested nothing worsealways by kates systemthan a pair of the children of a supercivilised age making the best of an awkwardness they didnt nevertheless hurrythat would overdo it so he had time to feel as it were what he felt he felt ever so distinctlyit was with this he faced mrs lowderthat he was already in a sense possessed of what he wanted there was more to comeeverything he had by no means with his companion had it all out yet what he was possessed of was realthe fact that she hadnt thrown over his lucidity the horrid shadow of cheap reprobation of this he had had so sore a fear that its being dispelled was in itself of the nature of bliss the danger had droppedit was behind him there in the great sunny space so far she was good for what he wanted   iii  she was good enough as it proved for him to put to her that evening and with further ground for it the next sharpest question that had been on his lips in the morningwhich his other preoccupation had then to his consciousness crowded out his opportunity was again made as befell by his learning from mrs stringham on arriving as usual with the close of day at the palace that milly must fail them again at dinner but would to all appearance be able to come down later he had found susan shepherd alone in the great saloon where even more candles than their friends large common allowanceshe grew daily more splendid they were all struck with it and chaffed her about itlighted up the pervasive mystery of style he had thus five minutes with the good lady before mrs lowder and kate appearedminutes illumined indeed to a longer reach than by the number of millys candles  may she come downought she if she isnt really up to it  he had asked that in the wonderment always stirred in him by glimpsesrare as were theseof the inner truth about the girl there was of course a question of healthit was in the air it was in the ground he trod in the food he tasted in the sounds he heard it was everywhere but it was everywhere with the effect of a request to himto his very delicacy to the common discretion of others as well as his ownthat no allusion to it should be made there had practically been none that morning on her explained nonappearancethe absence of it as we know quite monstrous and awkward and this passage with mrs stringham offered him his first licence to open his eyes he had gladly enough held them closed all the more that his doing so performed for his own spirit a useful function if he positively wanted not to be brought up with his nose against millys facts what better proof could he have that his conduct was marked by straightness it was perhaps pathetic for her and for himself was perhaps even ridiculous but he hadnt even the amount of curiosity that he would have had about an ordinary friend he might have shaken himself at moments to try for a sort of dry decency to have it but that too it appeared wouldnt come in what therefore was the duplicity he was at least sure about his feelingsit being so established that he had none at all they were all for kate without a feathers weight to spare he was acting for katenot by the deviation of an inch for her friend he was accordingly not interested for had he been interested he would have cared and had he cared he would have wanted to know had he wanted to know he wouldnt have been purely passive and it was his pure passivity that had to represent his dignity and his honour his dignity and his honour at the same time let us add fortunately fell short tonight of spoiling his little talk with susan shepherd one glimpseit was as if she had wished to give him that and it was as if for himself on current terms he could oblige her by accepting it she not only permitted she fairly invited him to open his eyes im so glad youre here it was no answer to his question but it had for the moment to serve and the rest was fully to come  he smiled at her and presently found himself as a kind of consequence of communion with her talking her own language its a very wonderful experience  welland her raised face shone up at himthats all i want you to feel about it if i werent afraid she added there are things i should like to say to you  and what are you afraid of please he encouragingly asked  of other things that i may possibly spoil besides i dont you know seem to have the chance youre always you know with her  he was strangely supported it struck him in his fixed smile which was the more fixed as he felt in these last words an exact description of his course it was an odd thing to have come to but he was always with her ah he none the less smiled im not with her now  noand im so glad since i get this from it shes ever so much better  better then she has been worse  mrs stringham waited she has been marvellousthats what she has been she is marvellous but shes really better  oh then if shes really better but he checked himself wanting only to be easy about it and above all not to appear engaged to the point of mystification we shall miss her the more at dinner  susan shepherd however was all there for him shes keeping herself youll see youll not really need to miss anything theres to be a little party  ah i do seeby this aggravated grandeur  well it is lovely isnt it i want the whole thing shes lodged for the first time as she ought from her type to be and doing iti mean bringing out all the glory of the placemakes her really happy its a veronese picture as near as can bewith me as the inevitable dwarf the small blackamoor put into a corner of the foreground for effect if i only had a hawk or a hound or something of that sort i should do the scene more honour the old housekeeper the woman in charge here has a big red cockatoo that i might borrow and perch on my thumb for the evening these explanations and sundry others mrs stringham gave though not all with the result of making him feel that the picture closed him in what part was there for him with his attitude that lacked the highest style in a composition in which everything else would have it they wont however be at dinner the few people she expectsthey come round afterwards from their respective hotels and sir luke strett and his niece the principal ones will have arrived from london but an hour or two ago its for him she has wanted to do somethingto let it begin at once we shall see more of him because she likes him and im so gladshell be glad toothat youre to see him the good lady in connexion with it was urgent was almost unnaturally bright so i greatly hope but her hope fairly lost itself in the wide light of her cheer  he considered a little this appearance while she let him he thought into still more knowledge than she uttered what is it you hope  well that youll stay on  do you mean after dinner she meant he seemed to feel so much that he could scarce tell where it ended or began  oh that of course why were to have musicbeautiful instruments and songs and not tasso declaimed as in the guidebooks either she has arranged itor at least i have that is eugenio has besides youre in the picture  ohi said densher almost with the gravity of a real protest  youll be the grand young man who surpasses the others and holds up his head and the winecup what we hope mrs stringham pursued is that youll be faithful to usthat youve not come for a mere foolish few days  denshers more private and particular shabby realities turned without comfort he was conscious at this touch in the artificial repose he had in his anxiety about them but halfmanaged to induce the way smooth ladies travelling for their pleasure and housed in veronese pictures talked to plain embarrassed workingmen engaged in an unprecedented sacrifice of time and of the opportunity for modest acquisition the things they took for granted and the general misery of explaining he couldnt tell them how he had tried to work how it was partly what he had moved into rooms for only to find himself almost for the first time in his life stricken and sterile because that would give them a false view of the source of his restlessness if not of the degree of it it would operate indirectly perhaps but infallibly to add to that weight as of expected performance which these very moments with mrs stringham caused more and more to settle on his heart he had incurred it the expectation of performance the thing was done and there was no use talking again again the cold breath of it was in the air so there he was and at best he floundered im afraid you wont understand when i say ive very tiresome things to consider botherations necessities at home the pinch the pressure in london  but she understood in perfection she rose to the pinch and the pressure and showed how they had been her own very element oh the daily task and the daily wage the golden guerdon or reward no one knows better than i how they haunt one in the flight of the precious deceiving days arent they just what i myself have given up ive given up all to follow her i wish you could feel as i do and cant you she asked write about venice  he very nearly wished for the minute that he could feel as she did and he smiled for her kindly do you write about venice  no but i wouldoh wouldnt iif i hadnt so completely given up shes you know my princess and to ones princess  one makes the whole sacrifice  precisely there you are  it pressed on him with this that never had a man been in so many places at once i quite understand that shes yours only you see shes not mine he felt he could somehow for honesty risk that as he had the moral certainty she wouldnt repeat it and least of all to mrs lowder who would find in it a disturbing implication this was part of what he liked in the good lady that she didnt repeat and also that she gave him a delicate sense of her shyly wishing him to know it that was in itself a hint of possibilities between them of a relation beneficent and elastic for him which wouldnt engage him further than he could see yet even as he afresh made this out he felt how strange it all was she wanted susan shepherd then as appeared the same thing kate wanted only wanted it as still further appeared in so different a way and from a motive so different even though scarce less deep then mrs lowder wanted by so odd an evolution of her exuberance exactly what each of the others did and he was between them all he was in the midst such perceptions made occasionswell occasions for fairly wondering if it mightnt be best just to consent luxuriously to be the ass the whole thing involved trying not to be and yet keeping in it was of the two things the more asinine he was glad there was no male witness it was a circle of petticoats he shouldnt have liked a man to see him he only had for a moment a sharp thought of sir luke strett the great master of the knife whom kate in london had spoken of milly as in commerce with and whose renewed intervention at such a distance just announced to him required some accounting for he had a vision of great london surgeonsif this one was a surgeonas incisive all round so that he should perhaps after all not wholly escape the ironic attention of his own sex the most he might be able to do was not to care while he was trying not to he could take that in it was a train however that brought up the vision of lord mark as well lord mark had caught him twice in the factthe fact of his absurd posture and that made a second male but it was comparatively easy not to mind lord mark  his companion had before this taken him up and in a tone to confirm her discretion on the matter of millys not being his princess of course shes not you must do something first  densher gave it his thought wouldnt it be rather she who must  it had more than he intended the effect of bringing her to a stand i see no doubt if one takes it so her cheer was for the time in eclipse and she looked over the place avoiding his eyes as in the wonder of what milly could do and yet she has wanted to be kind  it made him on the spot feel a brute of course she has no one could be more charming she has treated me as if i were somebody call her my hostess as ive never had nor imagined a hostess and im with you altogether of course he added in the right spirit for her i do see that its quite court life  she promptly showed how this was almost all she wanted of him thats all i mean if you understand it of such a court as never was one of the courts of heaven the court of a reigning seraph a sort of a vicequeen of an angel that will do perfectly  oh well then i grant it only court life as a general thing you know he observed isnt supposed to pay  yes one has read but this is beyond any book thats just the beauty here its why shes the great and only princess with her at her court said mrs stringham it does pay then as if she had quite settled it for him youll see for yourself  he waited a moment but said nothing to discourage her i think you were right just now one must do something first  well youve done something  noi dont see that i can do more  oh well she seemed to say if he would have it so you can do everything you know  everything was rather too much for him to take up gravely and he modestly let it alone speaking the next moment to avert fatuity of a different but a related matter why has she sent for sir luke strett if as you tell me shes so much better  she hasnt sent he has come of himself mrs stringham explained he has wanted to come  isnt that rather worse thenif it means he maynt be easy  he was coming from the first for his holiday she has known that these several weeks after which mrs stringham added you can make him easy  i can he candidly wondered it was truly the circle of petticoats what have i to do with it for a man like that  how do you know said his friend what hes like hes not like any one youve ever seen hes a great beneficent being  ah then he can do without me ive no call as an outsider to meddle  tell him all the same mrs stringham urged what you think  what i think of miss theale densher stared it was as they said a large order but he found the right note its none of his business  it did seem a moment for mrs stringham too the right note she fixed him at least with an expression still bright but searching that showed almost to excess what she saw in it though what this might be he was not to make out till afterwards say that to him then anything will do for him as a means of getting at you  and why should he get at me  give him a chance to let him talk to you then youll see  all of which on mrs stringhams part sharpened his sense of immersion in an element rather more strangely than agreeably warma sense that was moreover during the next two or three hours to be fed to satiety by several other impressions milly came down after dinner half a dozen friendsobjects of interest mainly it appeared to the ladies of lancaster gatehaving by that time arrived and with this call on her attention the further call of her musicians ushered by eugenio but personally and separately welcomed and the supreme opportunity offered in the arrival of the great doctor who came last of all he felt her diffuse in wide warm waves the spell of a general a beatific mildness there was a deeper depth of it doubtless for some than for others what he in particular knew of it was that he seemed to stand in it up to his neck he moved about in it and it made no plash he floated he noiselessly swam in it and they were all together for that matter like fishes in a crystal pool the effect of the place the beauty of the scene had probably much to do with it the golden grace of the high rooms chambers of art in themselves took care as an influence of the general manner and made people bland without making them solemn they were only people as mrs stringham had said staying for the week or two at the inns people who during the day had fingered their baedekers gaped at their frescoes and differed over fractions of francs with their gondoliers but milly let loose among them in a wonderful white dress brought them somehow into relation with something that made them more finely genial so that if the veronese picture of which he had talked with mrs stringham was not quite constituted the comparative prose of the previous hours the traces of insensibility qualified by beating down were at last almost nobly disowned there was perhaps something for him in the accident of his seeing her for the first time in white but she hadnt yet had occasioncirculating with a clearness intensifiedto strike him as so happily pervasive she was different younger fairer with the colour of her braided hair more than ever a not altogether lucky challenge to attention yet he was loth wholly to explain it by her having quitted this once for some obscure yet doubtless charming reason her almost monastic her hitherto inveterate black much as the change did for the value of her presence she had never yet when all was said made it for him and he was not to fail of the further amusement of judging her determined in the matter by sir luke stretts visit if he could in this connexion have felt jealous of sir luke strett whose strong face and type less assimilated by the scene perhaps than any others he was anon to study from the other side of the saloon that would doubtless have been most amusing of all but he couldnt be invidious even to profit by so high a tide he felt himself too much in it as he might have said a moments reflexion put him more in than any one the way milly neglected him for other cares while kate and mrs lowder without so much as the attenuation of a joke introduced him to english ladiesthat was itself a proof for nothing really of so close a communion had up to this time passed between them as the single bright look and the three gay words all ostensibly of the last lightness with which her confessed consciousness brushed by him  she was acquitting herself tonight as hostess he could see under some supreme idea an inspiration which was half her nerves and half an inevitable harmony but what he especially recognised was the character that had already several times broken out in her and that she so oddly appeared able by choice or by instinctive affinity to keep down or to display she was the american girl as he had originally found herfound her at certain moments it was true in new york more than at certain others she was the american girl as still more than then he had seen her on the day of her meeting him in london and in kates company it affected him as a large though queer social resource in hersuch as a man for instance to his diminution would never in the world be able to command and he wouldnt have known whether to see it in an extension or a contraction of personality taking it as he did most directly for a confounding extension of surface clearly too it was the right thing this evening all round that came out for him in a word from kate as she approached him to wreak on him a second introduction he had under cover of the music melted away from the lady toward whom she had first pushed him and there was something in her to affect him as telling evasively a tale of their talk in the piazza to what did she want to coerce him as a form of penalty for what he had done to her there it was thus in contact uppermost for him that he had done something not only caused her perfect intelligence to act in his interest but left her unable to get away by any mere private effort from his inattackable logic with him thus in presence and near himand it had been as unmistakeable through dinnerthere was no getting away for her at all there was less of it than ever so she could only either deal with the question straight either frankly yield or ineffectually struggle or insincerely argue or else merely express herself by following up the advantage she did possess it was part of that advantage for the houra brief fallacious makeweight to his pressurethat there were plenty of things left in which he must feel her will they only told him these indications how much she was in such close quarters feeling his and it was enough for him again that her very aspect as great a variation in its way as millys own gave him back the sense of his action it had never yet in life been granted him to know almost materially to taste as he could do in these minutes the state of what was vulgarly called conquest he had lived long enough to have been on occasion liked but it had never begun to be allowed him to be liked to any such tune in any such quarter it was a liking greater than millysor it would be he felt it in him to answer for that so at all events he read the case while he noted that kate was somehowfor katewanting in lustre as a striking young presence she was practically superseded of the mildness that milly diffused she had assimilated all her share she might fairly have been dressed tonight in the little black frock superficially indistinguishable that milly had laid aside this represented he perceived the opposite pole from such an effect as that of her wonderful entrance under her aunts eyeshe had never forgotten itthe day of their younger friends failure at lancaster gate she was in her accepted effacementit was actually her acceptance that made the beauty and repaired the damageunder her aunts eyes now but whose eyes were not effectually preoccupied it struck him none the less certainly that almost the first thing she said to him showed an exquisite attempt to appear if not unconvinced at least selfpossessed  dont you think her good enough now almost heedless of the danger of overt freedoms she eyed milly from where they stood noted her in renewed talk over her further wishes with the members of her little orchestra who had approached her with demonstrations of deference enlivened by native humoursthings quite in the line of old venetian comedy the girls idea of music had been happya real solvent of shyness yet not drastic thanks to the intermissions discretions a general habit of mercy to gathered barbarians that reflected the good manners of its interpreters representatives though these might be but of the order in which taste was natural and melody rank it was easy at all events to answer kate ah my dear you know how good i think her  but shes too nice kate returned with appreciation everything suits her soespecially her pearls they go so with her old lace ill trouble you really to look at them densher though aware he had seen them before had perhaps not really looked at them and had thus not done justice to the embodied poetryhis mind for millys aspects kept coming back to thatwhich owed them part of its style kates face as she considered them struck him the long priceless chain wound twice round the neck hung heavy and pure down the front of the wearers breastso far down that millys trick evidently unconscious of holding and vaguely fingering and entwining a part of it conduced presumably to convenience shes a dove kate went on and one somehow doesnt think of doves as bejewelled yet they suit her down to the ground  yesdown to the ground is the word densher saw now how they suited her but was perhaps still more aware of something intense in his companions feeling about them milly was indeed a dove this was the figure though it most applied to her spirit yet he knew in a moment that kate was just now for reasons hidden from him exceptionally under the impression of that element of wealth in her which was a power which was a great power and which was dovelike only so far as one remembered that doves have wings and wondrous flights have them as well as tender tints and soft sounds it even came to him dimly that such wings could in a given casehad truly in the case with which he was concernedspread themselves for protection hadnt they for that matter lately taken an inordinate reach and werent kate and mrs lowder werent susan shepherd and he wasnt he in particular nestling under them to a great increase of immediate ease all this was a brighter blur in the general light out of which he heard kate presently going on  pearls have such a magic that they suit every one  they would uncommonly suit you he frankly returned  oh yes i see myself  as she saw herself suddenly he saw hershe would have been splendid and with it he felt more what she was thinking of millys royal ornament hadunder pressure now not wholly occulttaken on the character of a symbol of differences differences of which the vision was actually in kates face it might have been in her face too that well as she certainly would look in pearls pearls were exactly what merton densher would never be able to give her wasnt that the great difference that milly tonight symbolised she unconsciously represented to kate and kate took it in at every pore that there was nobody with whom she had less in common than a remarkably handsome girl married to a man unable to make her on any such lines as that the least little present of these absurdities however it was not till afterwards that densher thought he could think now to any purpose only of what mrs stringham had said to him before dinner he could but come back to his friends question of a minute ago shes certainly good enough as you call it in the sense that im assured shes better mrs stringham an hour or two since was in great feather to me about it she evidently believes her better  well if they choose to call it so  and what do you call itas against them  i dont call it anything to any one but you im not against them kate added as with just a fresh breath of impatience for all he had to be taught  thats what im talking about he said what do you call it to me  it made her wait a little she isnt better shes worse but that has nothing to do with it  nothing to do he wondered  but she was clear nothing to do with us except of course that were doing our best for her were making her want to live and kate again watched her tonight she does want to live she spoke with a kindness that had the strange property of striking him as inconsequentso much and doubtless so unjustly had all her clearness been an implication of the hard its wonderful its beautiful  its beautiful indeed  he hated somehow the helplessness of his own note but she had given it no heed shes doing it for himand she nodded in the direction of millys medical visitor she wants to be for him at her best but she cant deceive him  densher had been looking too which made him say in a moment and do you think you can i mean if hes to be with us here about your sentiments if aunt mauds so thick with him  aunt maud now occupied in fact a place at his side and was visibly doing her best to entertain him though this failed to prevent such a direction of his own eyesdetermined in the way such things happen precisely by the attention of the othersas densher became aware of and as kate promptly marked hes looking at you he wants to speak to you  so mrs stringham the young man laughed advised me he would  then let him be right with him i dont need kate went on in answer to the previous question to deceive him aunt maud if its necessary will do that i mean that knowing nothing about me he can see me only as she sees me she sees me now so well he has nothing to do with me  except to reprobate you densher suggested  for not caring for you perfectly as a brilliant young man driven by it into your relation with millyas all that i leave you to him  well said densher sincerely enough i think i can thank you for leaving me to some one easier perhaps with me than yourself  she had been looking about again meanwhile the lady having changed her place for the friend of mrs lowders to whom she had spoken of introducing him all the more reason why i should commit you then to lady wells  oh but wait it was not only that he distinguished lady wells from afar that she inspired him with no eagerness and that somewhere at the back of his head he was fairly aware of the question in germ of whether this was the kind of person he should be involved with when they were married it was furthermore that the consciousness of something he had not got from kate in the morning and that logically much concerned him had been made more keen by these very momentsto say nothing of the consciousness that with their general smallness of opportunity he must squeeze each stray instant hard if aunt maud over there with sir luke noted him as a little attentive that might pass for a futile demonstration on the part of a gentleman who had to confess to having not very gracefully changed his mind besides just now he didnt care for aunt maud except in so far as he was immediately to show how can mrs lowder think me disposed of with any finality if im disposed of only to a girl whos dying if youre right about that about the state of the case youre wrong about mrs lowders being squared if milly as you say he lucidly pursued cant deceive a great surgeon or whatever the great surgeon wont deceive other peoplenot those that is who are closely concerned he wont at any rate deceive mrs stringham whos millys greatest friend and it will be very odd if mrs stringham deceives aunt maud whos her own  kate showed him at this the cold glow of an idea that really was worth his having kept her for why will it be odd i marvel at your seeing your way so little  mere curiosity even about his companion had now for him its quick its slightly quaking intensities he had compared her once we know to a new book an uncut volume of the highest the rarest quality and his emotion to justify that was again and again like the thrill of turning the page well you know how deeply i marvel at the way you see it  it doesnt in the least follow kate went on that anything in the nature of what you call deception on mrs stringhams part will be what you call odd why shouldnt she hide the truth  from mrs lowder densher stared why should she  to please you  and how in the world can it please me  kate turned her head away as if really at last almost tired of his density but she looked at him again as she spoke well then to please milly and before he could question dont you feel by this time that theres nothing susan shepherd wont do for you  he had verily after an instant to take it in so sharply it corresponded with the good ladys recent reception of him it was queerer than anything again the way they all came together round him but that was an old story and kates multiplied lights led him on and on it was with a reserve however that he confessed this shes ever so kind only her view of the right thing may not be the same as yours  how can it be anything different if its the view of serving you  densher for an instant but only for an instant hung fire oh the difficulty is that i dont upon my honour even yet quite make out how yours does serve me  it helps youput it then said kate very simplyto serve me it gains you time  time for what  for everything she spoke at first once more with impatience then as usual she qualified for anything that may happen  densher had a smile but he felt it himself as strained youre cryptic love  it made her keep her eyes on him and he could thus see that by one of those incalculable motions in her without which she wouldnt have been a quarter so interesting they halffilled with tears from some source he had too roughly touched im taking a trouble for you i never dreamed i should take for any human creature  oh it went home making him flush for it yet he soon enough felt his reply on his lips well isnt my whole insistence to you now that i can conjure trouble away and he let it his insistence come out again it had so constantly had all the week but its step or two to make there need be none whatever between us there need be nothing but our sense of each other  it had only the effect at first that her eyes grew dry while she took up again one of the so numerous links in her close chain you can tell her anything you like anything whatever  mrs stringham i have nothing to tell her  you can tell her about us i mean she wonderfully pursued that you do still like me  it was indeed so wonderful that it amused him only not that you still like me  she let his amusement pass im absolutely certain she wouldnt repeat it  i see to aunt maud  you dont quite see neither to aunt maud nor to any one else kate then he saw was always seeing milly much more after all than he was and she showed it again as she went on there accordingly is your time  she did at last make him think and it was fairly as if light broke though not quite all at once you must let me say i do see time for something in particular that i understand you regard as possible time too that i further understand is time for you as well  time indeed for me as well and encouraged visibly by his glow of concentration she looked at him as through the air she had painfully made clear yet she was still on her guard dont think however ill do all the work for you if you want things named you must name them  he had quite within the minute been turning names over and there was only one which at last stared at him there dreadful that properly fitted since shes to die im to marry her  it struck him even at the moment as fine in her that she met it with no wincing nor mincing she might for the grace of silence for favour to their conditions have only answered him with her eyes but her lips bravely moved to marry her  so that when her death has taken place i shall in the natural course have money  it was before him enough now and he had nothing more to ask he had only to turn on the spot considerably cold with the thought that all alongto his stupidity his timidityit had been it had been only what she meant now that he was in possession moreover she couldnt forbear strangely enough to pronounce the words she hadnt pronounced they broke through her controlled and colourless voice as if she should be ashamed to the very end to have flinched youll in the natural course have money we shall in the natural course be free  oh oh oh densher softly murmured  yes yes yes but she broke off come to lady wells  he never budgedthere was too much else im to propose it thenmarriageon the spot  there was no ironic sound he needed to give it the more simply he spoke the more he seemed ironic but she remained consummately proof oh i cant go into that with you and from the moment you dont wash your hands of me i dont think you ought to ask me you must act as you like and as you can  he thought again im faras i sufficiently showed you this morningfrom washing my hands of you  then said kate its all right  all right his eagerness flamed youll come  but he had had to see in a moment that it wasnt what she meant youll have a free hand a clear field a chancewell quite ideal  your descriptionsher ideal was such a touchare prodigious and what i dont make out is how caring for me you can like it  i dont like it but im a person thank goodness who can do what i dont like  it wasnt till afterwards that going back to it he was to read into this speech a kind of heroic ring a note of character that belittled his own incapacity for action yet he saw indeed even at the time the greatness of knowing so well what one wanted at the time too moreover he next reflected that he after all knew what he did but something else on his lips was uppermost what i dont make out then is how you can even bear it  well when you know me better youll find out how much i can bear and she went on before he could take up as it were her too many implications that it was left to him to know her spiritually better after his long sacrifice to knowledgethis for instance was a truth he hadnt been ready to receive so full in the face she had mystified him enough heaven knew but that was rather by his own generosity than by hers and what with it did she seem to suggest she might incur at his hands in spite of these questions she was carrying him on all youll have to do will be to stay  and proceed to my business under your eyes  oh dear nowe shall go  go he wondered go when go where  in a day or twostraight home aunt maud wishes it now  it gave him all he could take in to think of then what becomes of miss theale  what i tell you she stays on and you stay with her  he stared all alone  she had a smile that was apparently for his tone youre old enoughwith plenty of mrs stringham  nothing might have been so odd for him now could he have measured it as his being able to feel quite while he drew from her these successive cues that he was essentially seeing what she would sayan instinct compatible for him therefore with that absence of a need to know her better to which she had a moment before done injustice if it hadnt been appearing to him in gleams that she would somewhere break down he probably couldnt have gone on still as she wasnt breaking down there was nothing for him but to continue is your going mrs lowders idea  very much indeed of course again you see what it does for us and i dont she added refer only to our going but to aunt mauds view of the general propriety of it  i see again as you say densher said after a moment it makes everything fit  everything  the word for a little held the air and he might have seemed the while to be looking by no means dimly now at all it stood for but he had in fact been looking at something else you leave her here then to die  ah she believes she wont die not if you stay i mean kate explained aunt maud believes  and thats all thats necessary  still indeed she didnt break down didnt we long ago agree that what she believes is the principal thing for us  he recalled it under her eyes but it came as from long ago oh yes i cant deny it then he added so that if i stay  it wontshe was promptbe our fault  if mrs lowder still you mean suspects us  if she still suspects us but she wont  kate gave it an emphasis that might have appeared to leave him nothing more and he might in fact well have found nothing if he hadnt presently found but what if she doesnt accept me  it produced in her a look of weariness that made the patience of her tone the next moment touch him you can but try  naturally i can but try only you see one has to try a little hard to propose to a dying girl  she isnt for you as if shes dying it had determined in kate the flash of justesse he could perhaps most on consideration have admired since her retort touched the truth there before him was the fact of how milly tonight impressed him and his companion with her eyes in his own and pursuing his impression to the depths of them literally now perched on the fact in triumph she turned her head to where their friend was again in range and it made him turn his so that they watched a minute in concert milly from the other side happened at the moment to notice them and she sent across toward them in response all the candour of her smile the lustre of her pearls the value of her life the essence of her wealth it brought them together again with faces made fairly grave by the reality she put into their plan kate herself grew a little pale for it and they had for a time only a silence the music however gay and vociferous had broken out afresh and protected more than interrupted them when densher at last spoke it was under cover  i might stay you know without trying  oh to stay is to try  to have for herself you mean the appearance of it  i dont see how you can have the appearance more  densher waited you think it then possible she may offer marriage  i cant thinkif you really want to knowwhat she may not offer  in the manner of princesses who do such things  in any manner you like so be prepared  well he looked as if he almost were it will be for me then to accept but thats the way it must come  kates silence so far let it pass but she presently said youll on your honour stay then  his answer made her wait but when it came it was distinct without you you mean  without us  and you yourselves go at latest  not later than thursday  it made three days well he said ill stay on my honour if youll come to me on your honour  again as before this made her momentarily rigid with a rigour out of which at a loss she vaguely cast about her her rigour was more to him nevertheless than all her readiness for her readiness was the woman herself and this other thing a mask a stopgap and a dodge she cast about however as happened and not for the instant in vain her eyes turned over the room caught at a pretext lady wells is tired of waiting shes comingseeto us  densher saw in fact but there was a distance for their visitor to cross and he still had time if you decline to understand me i wholly decline to understand you ill do nothing  nothing it was as if she tried for the minute to plead  ill do nothing ill go off before you ill go tomorrow  he was to have afterwards the sense of her having then as the phrase wasand for vulgar triumphs tooseen he meant it she looked again at lady wells who was nearer but she quickly came back and if i do understand  ill do everything  she found anew a pretext in her approaching friend he was fairly playing with her pride he had never he then knew tasted in all his relation with her of anything so sharptoo sharp for mere sweetnessas the vividness with which he saw himself master in the conflict well i understand  on your honour  on my honour  youll come  ill come     book ninth    i  it was after they had gone that he truly felt the difference which was most to be felt moreover in his faded old rooms he had recovered from the first a part of his attachment to this scene of contemplation within sight as it was of the rialto bridge on the hither side of that arch of associations and the left going up the canal he had seen it in a particular light to which more and more his mind and his hands adjusted it but the interest the place now wore for him had risen at a bound becoming a force that on the spot completely engaged and absorbed him and relief from whichif relief was the namehe could find only by getting away and out of reach what had come to pass within his walls lingered there as an obsession importunate to all his senses it lived again as a cluster of pleasant memories at every hour and in every object it made everything but itself irrelevant and tasteless it remained in a word a conscious watchful presence active on its own side for ever to be reckoned with in face of which the effort at detachment was scarcely less futile than frivolous kate had come to him it was only onceand this not from any failure of their need but from such impossibilities for bravery alike and for subtlety as there was at the last no blinking yet she had come that once to stay as people called it and what survived of her what reminded and insisted was something he couldnt have banished if he had wished luckily he didnt wish even though there might be for a man almost a shade of the awful in so unqualified a consequence of his act it had simply worked his idea the idea he had made her accept and all erect before him really covering the ground as far as he could see was the fact of the gained success that this represented it was otherwise but the fact of the idea as directly applied as converted from a luminous conception into an historic truth he had known it before but as desired and urged as convincingly insisted on for the help it would render so that at present with the help rendered it seemed to acknowledge its office and to set up for memory and faith an insistence of its own he had in fine judged his friends pledge in advance as an inestimable value and what he must now know his case for was that of a possession of the value to the full wasnt it perhaps even rather the value that possessed him kept him thinking of it and waiting on it turning round and round it and making sure of it again from this side and that  it played for himcertainly in this prime afterglowthe part of a treasure kept at home in safety and sanctity something he was sure of finding in its place when with each return he worked his heavy old key in the lock the door had but to open for him to be with it again and for it to be all there so intensely there that as we say no other act was possible to him than the renewed act almost the hallucination of intimacy wherever he looked or sat or stood to whatever aspect he gave for the instant the advantage it was in view as nothing of the moment nothing begotten of time or of chance could be or ever would it was in view as when the curtain has risen the play on the stage is in view night after night for the fiddlers he remained thus in his own theatre in his single person perpetual orchestra to the ordered drama the confirmed run playing low and slow moreover in the regular way for the situations of most importance no other visitor was to come to him he met he bumped occasionally in the piazza or in his walks against claimants to acquaintance remembered or forgotten at present mostly effusive sometimes even inquisitive but he gave no address and encouraged no approach he couldnt for his life he felt have opened his door to a third person such a person would have interrupted him would have profaned his secret or perhaps have guessed it would at any rate have broken the spell of what he conceived himselfin the absence of anything to showto be inwardly doing he was giving himself upthat was quite enoughto the general feeling of his renewed engagement to fidelity the force of the engagement the quantity of the article to be supplied the special solidity of the contract the way above all as a service for which the price named by him had been magnificently paid his equivalent office was to take effectsuch items might well fill his consciousness when there was nothing from outside to interfere never was a consciousness more rounded and fastened down over what filled it which is precisely what we have spoken of as in its degree the oppression of success the somewhat chilled statetending to the solitaryof supreme recognition if it was slightly awful to feel so justified this was by the loss of the warmth of the element of mystery the lucid reigned instead of it and it was into the lucid that he sat and stared he shook himself out of it a dozen times a day tried to break by his own act his constant still communion it wasnt still communion she had meant to bequeath him it was the very different business of that kind of fidelity of which the other name was careful action  nothing he perfectly knew was less like careful action than the immersion he enjoyed at home the actual grand queerness was that to be faithful to kate he had positively to take his eyes his arms his lips straight off herhe had to let her alone he had to remember it was time to go to the palacewhich in truth was a mercy since the check was not less effectual than imperative what it came to fortunately as yet was that when he closed the door behind him for an absence he always shut her in shut her outit came to that rather when once he had got a little away and before he reached the palace much more after hearing at his heels the bang of the greater portone he felt free enough not to know his position as oppressively false as kate was all in his poor rooms and not a ghost of her left for the grander it was only on reflexion that the falseness came out so long as he left it to the mercy of beneficent chance it offered him no face and made of him no claim that he couldnt meet without aggravation of his inward sense this aggravation had been his original horror yet whatin millys presence each daywas horror doing with him but virtually letting him off he shouldnt perhaps get off to the end there was time enough still for the possibility of shame to pounce still however he did constantly a little more what he liked best and that kept him for the time more safe what he liked best was in any case to know why things were as he felt them and he knew it pretty well in this case ten days after the retreat of his other friends he then fairly perceived thateven putting their purity of motive at its highestit was neither kate nor he who made his strange relation to milly who made her own so far as it might be innocent it was neither of them who practically purged itif practically purged it was milly herself did everythingso far at least as he was concernedmilly herself and millys house and millys hospitality and millys manner and millys character and perhaps still more than anything else millys imagination mrs stringham and sir luke indeed a little aiding whereby he knew the blessing of a fair pretext to ask himself what more he had to do something incalculable wrought for themfor him and kate something outside beyond above themselves and doubtless ever so much better than they which wasnt a reason howeverits being so much betterfor them not to profit by it not to profit by it so far as profit could be reckoned would have been to go directly against it and the spirit of generosity at present engendered in densher could have felt no greater pang than by his having to go directly against milly  to go with her was the thing so far as she could herself go which from the moment her tenure of her loved palace stretched on was possible but by his remaining near her this remaining was of course on the face of it the most marked of demonstrationswhich was exactly why kate had required it it was so marked that on the very evening of the day it had taken effect milly herself hadnt been able not to reach out to him with an exquisite awkwardness for some account of it it was as if she had wanted from him some name that now they were to be almost alone together they could for their further ease know it and call it byit being after all almost rudimentary that his presence of which the absence of the others made quite a different thing couldnt but have for himself some definite basis she only wondered about the basis it would have for himself and how he would describe it that would quite do for herit even would have done for her he could see had he produced some reason merely trivial had he said he was waiting for money or clothes for letters or for orders from fleet street without which as she might have heard newspaper men never took a step he hadnt in the event quite sunk to that but he had none the less had there with her that night on mrs stringhams leaving them alonemrs stringham proved really prodigioushis acquaintance with a shade of awkwardness darker than any milly could know he had supposed himself beforehand on the question of what he was doing or pretending in possession of some tone that would serve but there were three minutes of his feeling incapable of promptness quite in the same degree in which a gentleman whose pocket has been picked feels incapable of purchase it even didnt help him oddly that he was sure kate would in some way have spoken for himor rather not so much in some way as in one very particular way he hadnt asked her at the last what she might in the connexion have said nothing would have induced him to put such a question after she had been to see him his lips were so sealed by that passage his spirit in fact so hushed in respect to any charge upon her freedom there was something he could only therefore read back into the probabilities and when he left the palace an hour afterwards it was with a sense of having breathed there in the very air the truth he had been guessing  just this perception it was however that had made him for the time ugly to himself in his awkwardness it was horrible with this creature to be awkward it was odious to be seeking excuses for the relation that involved it any relation that involved it was by the very fact as much discredited as a dish would be at dinner if one had to take medicine as a sauce what kate would have said in one of the young womens last talks was thatif milly absolutely must have the truth about itmr densher was staying because she had really seen no way but to require it of him if he stayed he didnt follow heror didnt appear to her aunt to be doing so and when she kept him from following her mrs lowder couldnt pretend in scenes the renewal of which at this time of day was painful that she after all didnt snub him as she might she did nothing in fact but snub himwouldnt that have been part of the storyonly aunt mauds suspicions were of the sort that had repeatedly to be dealt with he had been by the same token reasonable enoughas he now for that matter well might he had consented to oblige them aunt and niece by giving the plainest sign possible that he could exist away from london to exist away from london was to exist away from kate croywhich was a gain much appreciated to the latters comfort there was a minute at this hour out of denshers three during which he knew the terror of millys uttering some such allusion to their friends explanation as he must meet with words that wouldnt destroy it to destroy it was to destroy everything to destroy probably kate herself to destroy in particular by a breach of faith still uglier than anything else the beauty of their own last passage he had given her his word of honour that if she would come to him he would act absolutely in her sense and he had done so with a full enough vision of what her sense implied what it implied for one thing was that tonight in the great saloon noble in its halflighted beauty and straight in the white face of his young hostess divine in her trust or at any rate inscrutable in her mercywhat it implied was that he should lie with his lips the single thing of all things that could save him from it would be millys letting him off after having thus scared him what made her mercy inscrutable was that if she had already more than once saved him it was yet apparently without knowing how nearly he was lost  these were transcendent motions not the less blest for being obscure whereby yet once more he was to feel the pressure lighten he was kept on his feet in short by the felicity of her not presenting him with kates version as aversion to adopt he couldnt stand up to liehe felt as if he should have to go down on his knees as it was he just sat there shaking a little for nervousness the leg he had crossed over the other she was sorry for his suffered snub but he had nothing more to subscribe to to perjure himself about than the three or four inanities he had on his own side feebly prepared for the crisis he scrambled a little higher than the reference to money and clothes letters and directions from his manager but he brought out the beauty of the chance for himthere before him like a temptress painted by titianto do a little quiet writing he was vivid for a moment on the difficulty of writing quietly in london and he was precipitate almost explosive on his idea long cherished of a book  the explosion lighted her face youll do your book here  i hope to begin it  its something you havent begun  well only just  and since you came  she was so full of interest that he shouldnt perhaps after all be too easily let off i tried to think a few days ago that i had broken ground  scarcely anything it was indeed clear could have let him in deeper im afraid weve made an awful mess of your time  of course you have but what im hanging on for now is precisely to repair that ravage  then you mustnt mind me you know  youll see he tried to say with ease how little i shall mind anything  youll wantmilly had thrown herself into itthe best part of your days  he thought a moment he did what he could to wreathe it in smiles oh i shall make shift with the worst part the best will be for you and he wished kate could hear him it didnt help him moreover that he visibly even pathetically imaged to her by such touches his quest for comfort against discipline he was to bury kates so signal snub and also the hard law she had now laid on him under a high intellectual effort this at least was his crucifixionthat milly was so interested she was so interested that she presently asked him if he found his rooms propitious while he felt that in just decently answering her he put on a brazen mask he should need it quite particularly were she to express again her imagination of coming to tea with himan extremity that he saw he was not to be spared we depend on you susie and i you know not to forget were comingthe extremity was but to face that remainder yet it demanded all his tact facing their visit itselfto that no matter what he might have to do he would never consent as we know to be pushed and this even though it might be exactly such a demonstration as would figure for him at the top of kates list of his proprieties he could wonder freely enough deep within if kates view of that especial propriety had not been modified by a subsequent occurrence but his deciding that it was quite likely not to have been had no effect on his own preference for tact it pleased him to think of tact as his present prop in doubt that glossed his predicament over for it was of application among the sensitive and the kind he wasnt inhuman in fine so long as it would serve it had to serve now accordingly to help him not to sweeten millys hopes he didnt want to be rude to them but he still less wanted them to flower again in the particular connexion so that casting about him in his anxiety for a middle way to meet her he put his foot with unhappy effect just in the wrong place will it be safe for you to break into your custom of not leaving the house  safe she had for twenty seconds an exquisite pale glare oh but he didnt need it by that time to wince he had winced for himself as soon as he had made his mistake he had done what so unforgettably she had asked him in london not to do he had touched all alone with her here the supersensitive nerve of which she had warned him he had not since the occasion in london touched it again till now but he saw himself freshly warned that it was able to bear still less so for the moment he knew as little what to do as he had ever known it in his life he couldnt emphasise that he thought of her as dying yet he couldnt pretend he thought of her as indifferent to precautions meanwhile too she had narrowed his choice you suppose me so awfully bad  he turned in his pain within himself but by the time the colour had mounted to the roots of his hair he had found what he wanted ill believe whatever you tell me  well then im splendid  oh i dont need you to tell me that  i mean im capable of life  ive never doubted it  i mean she went on that i want so to live  well he asked while she paused with the intensity of it  well that i know i can  whatever you do he shrank from solemnity about it  whatever i do if i want to  if you want to do it  if i want to live i can milly repeated  he had clumsily brought it on himself but he hesitated with all the pity of it ah then that i believe  i will i will she declared yet with the weight of it somehow turned for him to mere light and sound  he felt himself smiling through a mist you simply must  it brought her straight again to the fact well then if you say it why maynt we pay you our visit  will it help you to live  every little helps she laughed and its very little for me in general to stay at home only i shant want to miss it  yesshe had dropped again  well on the day you give us a chance  it was amazing what so brief an exchange had at this point done with him his great scruple suddenly broke giving way to something inordinately strange something of a nature to become clear to him only when he had left her you can come he said when you like  what had taken place for him howeverthe drop almost with violence of everything but a sense of her own realityapparently showed in his face or his manner and even so vividly that she could take it for something else i see how you feelthat im an awful bore about it and that sooner than have any such upset youll go so its no matter  no matter ohhe quite protested now  if it drives you away to escape us we want you not to go  it was beautiful how she spoke for mrs stringham whatever it was at any rate he shook his head i wont go  then i wont go she brightly declared  you mean you wont come to me  nonever now its over but its all right i mean apart from that she went on that i wont do anything i oughtnt or that im not forced to  oh who can ever force you he asked with his handtomouth way at all times of speaking for her encouragement youre the least coercible of creatures  because you think im so free  the freest person probably now in the world youve got everything  well she smiled call it so i dont complain  on which again in spite of himself it let him in no i know you dont complain  as soon as he had said it he had himself heard the pity in it his telling her she had everything was extravagant kind humour whereas his knowing so tenderly that she didnt complain was terrible kind gravity milly felt he could see the difference he might as well have praised her outright for looking death in the face this was the way she just looked him again and it was of no attenuation that she took him up more gently than ever it isnt a meritwhen one sees ones way  to peace and plenty well i dare say not  i mean to keeping what one has  oh thats success if what one has is good densher said at random its enough to try for  well its my limit im not trying for more to which then she added with a change and now about your book  my book he had got in a moment so far from it  the one youre now to understand that nothing will induce either susie or me to run the risk of spoiling  he cast about but he made up his mind im not doing a book  not what you said she asked in a wonder youre not writing  he already felt relieved i dont know upon my honour what im doing  it made her visibly grave so that disconcerted in another way he was afraid of what she would see in it she saw in fact exactly what he feared but again his honour as he called it was saved even while she didnt know she had threatened it taking his words for a betrayal of the sense that he on his side might complain what she clearly wanted was to urge on him some such patience as he should be perhaps able to arrive at with her indirect help still more clearly however she wanted to be sure of how far she might venture and he could see her make out in a moment that she had a sort of test  then if its not for your book  what am i staying for  i mean with your london workwith all you have to do isnt it rather empty for you  empty for me he remembered how kate had held that she might propose marriage and he wondered if this were the way she would naturally begin it it would leave him such an incident he already felt at a loss and the note of his finest anxiety might have been in the vagueness of his reply oh well  i ask too many questions she settled it for herself before he could protest you stay because youve got to  he grasped at it i stay because ive got to and he couldnt have said when he had uttered it if it were loyal to kate or disloyal it gave her in a manner away it showed the tip of the ear of her plan yet milly took it he perceived but as a plain statement of his truth he was waiting for what kate would have told her ofthe permission from lancaster gate to come any nearer to remain friends with either niece or aunt he mustnt stir without it all this densher read in the girls sense of the spirit of his reply so that it made him feel he was lying and he had to think of something to correct that what he thought of was in an instant isnt it enough whatever may be ones other complications to stay after all for you  oh you must judge  he was by this time on his feet to take leave and was also at last too restless the speech in question at least wasnt disloyal to kate that was the very tone of their bargain so was it by being loyal another kind of lie the lie of the uncandid profession of a motive he was staying so little for milly that he was staying positively against her he didnt none the less know and at last thank goodness didnt care the only thing he could say might make it either better or worse well then so long as i dont go you must think of me all as judging   ii  he didnt go home on leaving herhe didnt want to he walked instead through his narrow ways and his campi with gothic arches to a small and comparatively sequestered café where he had already more than once found refreshment and comparative repose together with solutions that consisted mainly and pleasantly of further indecisions it was a literal fact that those awaiting him there tonight while he leaned back on his velvet bench with his head against a florid mirror and his eyes not looking further than the fumes of his tobacco might have been regarded by him as a little less limp than usual this wasnt because before getting to his feet again there was a step he had seen his way to it was simply because the acceptance of his position took sharper effect from his sense of what he had just had to deal with when half an hour before at the palace he had turned about to milly on the question of the impossibility so inwardly felt turned about on the spot and under her eyes he had acted by the sudden force of his seeing much further seeing how little how not at all impossibilities mattered it wasnt a case for pedantry when people were at her pass everything was allowed and her pass was now as by the sharp click of a spring just completely his ownto the extent as he felt of her deep dependence on him anything he should do or shouldnt would have close reference to her life which was thus absolutely in his handsand ought never to have reference to anything else it was on the cards for him that he might kill herthat was the way he read the cards as he sat in his customary corner the fear in this thought made him let everything go kept him there actually all motionless for three hours on end he renewed his consumption and smoked more cigarettes than he had ever done in the time what had come out for him had come out with this first intensity as a terror so that action itself of any sort the right as well as the wrongif the difference even survivedhad heard in it a vivid hush the injunction to keep from that moment intensely still he thought in fact while his vigil lasted of several different ways for his doing so and the hour might have served him as a lesson in going on tiptoe  what he finally took home when he ventured to leave the place was the perceived truth that he might on any other system go straight to destruction destruction was represented for him by the idea of his really bringing to a point on millys side anything whatever nothing so brought he easily argued but must be in one way or another a catastrophe he was mixed up in her fate or her fate if that should be better was mixed up in him so that a single false motion might either way snap the coil they helped him it was true these considerations to a degree of eventual peace for what they luminously amounted to was that he was to do nothing and that fell in after all with the burden laid on him by kate he was only not to budge without the girls leavenot oddly enough at the last to move without it whether further or nearer any more than without kates it was to this his wisdom reduced itselfto the need again simply to be kind that was the same as being stillas studying to create the minimum of vibration he felt himself as he smoked shut up to a room on the wall of which something precious was too precariously hung a false step would bring it down and it must hang as long as possible he was aware when he walked away again that even fleet street wouldnt at this juncture successfully touch him his manager might wire that he was wanted but he could easily be deaf to his manager his money for the idle life might be none too much happily however venice was cheap and it was moreover the queer fact that milly in a manner supported him the greatest of his expenses really was to walk to the palace to dinner he didnt want in short to give that up and he should probably be able he felt to stay his breath and his hand he should be able to be still enough through everything  he tried that for three weeks with the sense after a little of not having failed there had to be a delicate art in it for he wasnt tryingquite the contraryto be either distant or dull that would not have been being nice which in its own form was the real law that too might just have produced the vibration he desired to avert so that he best kept everything in place by not hesitating or fearing as it were to let himself gogo in the direction that is to say of staying it depended on where he went which was what he meant by taking care when one went on tiptoe one could turn off for retreat without betraying the manoeuvre perfect tactthe necessity for which he had from the first as we know happily recognisedwas to keep all intercourse in the key of the absolutely settled it was settled thus for instance that they were indissoluble good friends and settled as well that her being the american girl was just in time and for the relation they found themselves concerned in a boon inappreciable if at least as the days went on she was to fall short of her prerogative of the great national the great maidenly ease if she didnt diviningly and responsively desire and labour to record herself as possessed of it this wouldnt have been for want of denshers keeping her with his idea well up to itwouldnt have been in fine for want of his encouragement and reminder he didnt perhaps in so many words speak to her of the quantity itself as of the thing she was least to intermit but he talked of it freely in what he flattered himself was an impersonal way and this held it there before hersince he was careful also to talk pleasantly it was at once their idea when all was said and the most marked of their conveniences the type was so elastic that it could be stretched to almost anything and yet not stretched it kept down remained normal remained properly within bounds and he had meanwhile thank goodness without being too much disconcerted the sense for the girls part of the business of the queerest conscious compliance of her doing very much what he wanted even though without her quite seeing why she fairly touched this once in saying oh yes you like us to be as we are because its a kind of facilitation to you that we dont quite measure i think one would have to be english to measure itand that too strangely enough without prejudice to her good nature she might have been conceived as doingthat is of beingwhat he liked in order perhaps only to judge where it would take them they really as it went on saw each other at the game she knowing he tried to keep her in tune with his conception and he knowing she thus knew it add that he again knew she knew and yet that nothing was spoiled by it and we get a fair impression of the line they found most completely workable the strangest fact of all for us must be that the success he himself thus promoted was precisely what figured to his gratitude as the something above and beyond him above and beyond kate that made for daily decency there would scarce have been felicitycertainly too little of the right lubricanthad not the national character so invoked been not less inscrutably than entirely in millys chords it made up her unity and was the one thing he could unlimitedly take for granted  he did so then daily for twenty days without deepened fear of the undue vibration that was keeping him watchful he knew in his nervousness that he was living at best from day to day and from hand to mouth yet he had succeeded he believed in avoiding a mistake all women had alternatives and millys would doubtless be shaky too but the national character was firm in her whether as all of her practically by this time or but as a part the national character that in a woman still so young made of the air breathed a virtual nonconductor it wasnt till a certain occasion when the twenty days had passed that going to the palace at teatime he was met by the information that the signorina padrona was not receiving the announcement met him in the court on the lips of one of the gondoliers met him he thought with such a conscious eye as the knowledge of his freedoms of access hitherto conspicuously shown could scarce fail to beget densher had not been at palazzo leporelli among the mere receivable but had taken his place once for all among the involved and included so that on being so flagrantly braved he recognised after a moment the propriety of a further appeal neither of the two ladies it appeared received and yet pasquale was not prepared to say that either was poco bene he was yet not prepared to say that either was anything and he would have been blank densher mentally noted if the term could ever apply to members of a race in whom vacancy was but a nest of darknessesnot a vain surface but a place of withdrawal in which something obscure something always ominous indistinguishably lived he felt afresh indeed at this hour the force of the veto laid within the palace on any mention any cognition of the liabilities of its mistress the state of her health was never confessed to there as a reason how much it might deeply be taken for one was another matter of which he grew fully aware on carrying his question further this appeal was to his friend eugenio whom he immediately sent for with whom for three rich minutes protected from the weather he was confronted in the gallery that led from the watersteps to the court and whom he always called in meditation his friend seeing it was so elegantly presumable he would have put an end to him if he could that produced a relation which required a name of its own an intimacy of consciousness in truth for eachan intimacy of eye of ear of general sensibility of everything but tongue it had been in other words for the five weeks far from occult to our young man that eugenio took a view of him not less finely formal than essentially vulgar but which at the same time he couldnt himself raise an eyebrow to prevent it was all in the air now again it was as much between them as ever while eugenio waited on him in the court  the weather from early morning had turned to storm the first seastorm of the autumn and densher had almost invidiously brought him down the outer staircasethe massive ascent the great feature of the court to millys piano nobile this was to pay himit was the one chancefor all imputations the imputation in particular that clever tanto bello and not rich the young man from london wasby the obvious waypressing miss theales fortune hard it was to pay him for the further ineffable intimation that a gentleman must take the young ladys most devoted servant interested scarcely less in the high attraction for a strangely casual appendage if he counted in such a connexion on impunity and prosperity these interpretations were odious to densher for the simple reason that they might have been so true of the attitude of an inferior man and three things alone accordingly had kept him from righting himself one of these was that his critic sought expression only in an impersonality a positive inhumanity of politeness the second was that refinements of expression in a friends servant were not a thing a visitor could take action on and the third was the fact that the particular attribution of motive did him after all no wrong it was his own fault if the vulgar view the view that might have been taken of an inferior man happened so incorrigibly to fit him he apparently wasnt so different from inferior men as that came to if therefore in fine eugenio figured to him as my friend because he was conscious of his seeing so much of him what he made him see on the same lines in the course of their present interview was ever so much more densher felt that he marked himself no doubt as insisting by dissatisfaction with the gondoliers answer on the pursuit taken for granted in him and yet felt it only in the augmented the exalted distance that was by this time established between them eugenio had of course reflected that a word to miss theale from such a pair of lips would cost him his place but he could also bethink himself that so long as the word never cameand it was on the basis he had arranged impossiblehe enjoyed the imagination of mounting guard he had never so mounted guard densher could see as during these minutes in the damp loggia where the stormgusts were strong and there came in fact for our young man as a result of his presence a sudden sharp sense that everything had turned to the dismal something had happenedhe didnt know what and it wasnt eugenio who would tell him what eugenio told him was that he thought the ladiesas if their liability had been equalwere a leetle fatigued just a leetle leetle and without any cause named for it it was one of the signs of what densher felt in him that by a profundity a true deviltry of resource he always met the latters italian with english and his english with italian he now as usual slightly smiled at him in the processbut ever so slightly this time his manner also being attuned our young man made out to the thing whatever it was that constituted the rupture of peace  this manner while they stood a long minute facing each other over all they didnt say played a part as well in the sudden jar to denshers protected state it was a venice all of evil that had broken out for them alike so that they were together in their anxiety if they really could have met on it a venice of cold lashing rain from a low black sky of wicked wind raging through narrow passes of general arrest and interruption with the people engaged in all the waterlife huddled stranded and wageless bored and cynical under archways and bridges our young mans mute exchange with his friend contained meanwhile such a depth of reference that had the pressure been but slightly prolonged they might have reached a point at which they were equally weak each had verily something in mind that would have made a hash of mutual suspicion and in presence of which as a possibility they were more united than disjoined but it was to have been a moment for densher that nothing could ease offnot even the formal propriety with which his interlocutor finally attended him to the portone and bowed upon his retreat nothing had passed about his coming back and the air had made itself felt as a nonconductor of messages densher knew of course as he took his way again that eugenios invitation to return was not what he missed yet he knew at the same time that what had happened to him was part of his punishment out in the square beyond the fondamenta that gave access to the landgate of the palace out where the wind was higher he fairly with the thought of it pulled his umbrella closer down it couldnt be his consciousness unseen enough by othersthe base predicament of having by a concatenation just to take such things such things as the fact that one very acute person in the world whom he couldnt dispose of as an interested scoundrel enjoyed an opinion of him that there was no attacking no disproving no what was worst of all even noticing one had come to a queer pass when a servants opinion so mattered eugenios would have mattered even if as founded on a low vision of appearances it had been quite wrong it was the more disagreeable accordingly that the vision of appearances was quite right and yet was scarcely less low  such as it was at any rate densher shook it off with the more impatience that he was independently restless he had to walk in spite of weather and he took his course through crooked ways to the piazza where he should have the shelter of the galleries here in the high arcade half venice was crowded close while on the molo at the limit of the expanse the old columns of the saint theodore and of the lion were the frame of a door wide open to the storm it was odd for him as he moved that it should have made such a differenceif the difference wasnt only that the palace had for the first time failed of a welcome there was more but it came from that that gave the harsh note and broke the spell the wet and the cold were now to reckon with and it was to densher precisely as if he had seen the obliteration at a stroke of the margin on a faith in which they were all living the margin had been his name for itfor the thing that though it had held out could bear no shock the shock in some form had come and he wondered about it while threading his way among loungers as vague as himself he dropped his eyes sightlessly on the rubbish in shops there were stretches of the gallery paved with squares of red marble greasy now with the salt spray and the whole place in its huge elegance the grace of its conception and the beauty of its detail was more than ever like a great drawingroom the drawingroom of europe profaned and bewildered by some reverse of fortune he brushed shoulders with brown men whose hats askew and the loose sleeves of whose pendent jackets made them resemble melancholy maskers the tables and chairs that overflowed from the cafés were gathered still with a pretence of service into the arcade and here and there a spectacled german with his coatcollar up partook publicly of food and philosophy these were impressions for densher too but he had made the whole circuit thrice before he stopped short in front of florians with the force of his sharpest his eye had caught a face within the caféhe had spotted an acquaintance behind the glass the person he had thus paused long enough to look at twice was seated well within range at a small table on which a tumbler halfemptied and evidently neglected still remained and though he had on his knee as he leaned back a copy of a french newspaperthe heading of the figaro was visiblehe stared straight before him at the little opposite rococo wall densher had him for a minute in profile had him for a time during which his identity produced however quickly all the effect of establishing connexionsconnexions startling and direct and then as if it were the one thing more needed seized the look determined by a turn of the head that might have been a prompt result of the sense of being noticed this wider view showed him all lord marklord mark as encountered several weeks before the day of the first visit of each to palazzo leporelli for it had been all lord mark that was going out on that occasion as he came inhe had felt it in the hall at the time and he was accordingly the less at a loss to recognise in a few seconds as renewed meeting brought it to the surface the same potential quantity  it was a matter the whole passageit could only bebut of a few seconds for as he might neither stand there to stare nor on the other hand make any advance from it he had presently resumed his walk this time to another pace it had been for all the world during his pause as if he had caught his answer to the riddle of the day lord mark had simply faced himas he had faced him not placed by him not at firstas one of the damp shuffling crowd recognition though hanging fire had then clearly come yet no light of salutation had been struck from these certainties acquaintance between them was scant enough for neither to take it up that neither had done so was not however what now mattered but that the gentleman at florians should be in the place at all he couldnt have been in it long densher as inevitably a haunter of the great meetingground would in that case have seen him before he paid short visits he was on the wing the question for him even as he sat there was of his train or of his boat he had come back for somethingas a sequel to his earlier visit and whatever he had come back for it had had time to be done he might have arrived but last night or that morning he had already made the difference it was a great thing for densher to get this answer he held it close he hugged it quite leaned on it as he continued to circulate it kept him going and goingit made him no less restless but it explainedand that was much for with explanations he might somehow deal the vice in the air otherwise was too much like the breath of fate the weather had changed the rain was ugly the wind wicked the sea impossible because of lord mark it was because of him a fortiori that the palace was closed densher went round again twice he found the visitor each time as he had found him first once that is he was staring before him the next time he was looking over his figaro which he had opened out densher didnt again stop but left him apparently unconscious of his passageon another repetition of which lord mark had disappeared he had spent but the day he would be off that night he had now gone to his hotel for arrangements these things were as plain to densher as if he had had them in words the obscure had cleared for himif cleared it was there was something he didnt see the great thing but he saw so round it and so close to it that this was almost as good he had been looking at a man who had done what he had come for and for whom as done it temporarily sufficed the man had come again to see milly and milly had received him his visit would have taken place just before or just after luncheon and it was the reason why he himself had found her door shut  he said to himself that evening he still said even on the morrow that he only wanted a reason and that with this perception of one he could now mind as he called it his business his business he had settled as we know was to keep thoroughly still and he asked himself why it should prevent this that he could feel in connexion with the crisis so remarkably blameless he gave the appearances before him all the benefit of being critical so that if blame were to accrue he shouldnt feel he had dodged it but it wasnt a bit he who that day had touched her and if she was upset it wasnt a bit his act the ability so to think about it amounted for densher during several hours to a kind of exhilaration the exhilaration was heightened fairly besides by the visible conditionssharp striking ugly to himof lord marks return his constant view of it for all the next hours of which there were many was as a demonstration on the face of it sinister even to his own actual ignorance he didnt need for seeing it as evil seeing it as to a certainty in a high degree nasty to know more about it than he had so easily and so wonderfully picked up you couldnt drop on the poor girl that way without by the fact being brutal such a visit was a descent an invasion an aggression constituting precisely one or other of the stupid shocks he himself had so decently sought to spare her densher had indeed drifted by the next morning to the reflexionwhich he positively with occasion might have brought straight outthat the only delicate and honourable way of treating a person in such a state was to treat her as he merton densher did with time actuallyfor the impression but deepenedthis sense of the contrast to the advantage of merton densher became a sense of relief and that in turn a sense of escape it was for all the worldand he drew a long breath on itas if a special danger for him had passed lord mark had without in the least intending such a service got it straight out of the way it was he the brute who had stumbled into just the wrong inspiration and who had therefore produced for the very person he had wished to hurt an impunity that was comparative innocence that was almost like purification the person he had wished to hurt could only be the person so unaccountably hanging about to keep still meanwhile was for this person more comprehensively to keep it all up and to keep it all up was if that seemed on consideration best not for the day or two to go back to the palace  the day or two passedstretched to three days and with the effect extraordinarily that densher felt himself in the course of them washed but the more clean some sign would come if his return should have the better effect and he was at all events in absence without the particular scruple it wouldnt have been meant for him by either of the women that he was to come back but to face eugenio that was impossiblethe being again denied for it made him practically answerable and answerable was what he wasnt there was no neglect either in absence inasmuch as from the moment he didnt get in the one message he could send up would be some hope on the score of health since accordingly that sort of expression was definitely forbidden him he had only to waitwhich he was actually helped to do by his feeling with the lapse of each day more and more wound up to it the days in themselves were anything but sweet the wind and the weather lasted the fireless cold hinted at worse the broken charm of the world about was broken into smaller pieces he walked up and down his rooms and listened to the windlistened also to tinkles of bells and watched for some servant of the palace he might get a note but the note never came there were hours when he stayed at home not to miss it when he wasnt at home he was in circulation again as he had been at the hour of his seeing lord mark he strolled about the square with the herd of refugees he raked the approaches and the cafés on the chance the brute as he now regularly imaged him might be still there he could only be there he knew to be received afresh and thatone had but to think of itwould be indeed stiff he had gone howeverit was proved though denshers care for the question either way only added to what was most acrid in the taste of his present ordeal it all came round to what he was doing for millyspending days that neither relief nor escape could purge of a smack of the abject what was it but abject for a man of his parts to be reduced to such pastimes what was it but sordid for him shuffling about in the rain to have to peep into shops and to consider possible meetings what was it but odious to find himself wondering what as between him and another man a possible meeting would produce there recurred moments when in spite of everything he felt no straighter than another man and yet even on the third day when still nothing had come he more than ever knew that he wouldnt have budged for the world  he thought of the two women in their silence at lasthe at all events thought of millyas probably for her reasons now intensely wishing him to go the cold breath of her reasons was with everything else in the air but he didnt care for them any more than for her wish itself and he would stay in spite of her stay in spite of odium stay in spite perhaps of some final experience that would be for the pain of it all but unbearable that would be his one way purified though he was to mark his virtue beyond any mistake it would be accepting the disagreeable and the disagreeable would be a proof a proof of his not having stayed for the thingthe agreeable as it werethat kate had named the thing kate had named was not to have been the odium of staying in spite of hints it was part of the odium as actual too that kate was for her comfort just now well aloof these were the first hours since her flight in which his sense of what she had done for him on the eve of that event was to incur a qualification it was strange it was perhaps base to be thinking such things so soon but one of the intimations of his solitude was that she had provided for herself she was out of it all by her act as much as he was in it and this difference grew positively as his own intensity increased she had said in their last sharp snatch of talksharp though thickly muffled and with every word in it final and deep unlike even the deepest words they had ever yet spoken letters nevernow think of it impossible so that as he had sufficiently caught her senseinto which he read all the same a strange inconsequencethey had practically wrapped their understanding in the breach of their correspondence he had moreover on losing her done justice to her law of silence for there was doubtless a finer delicacy in his not writing to her than in his writing as he must have written had he spoken of themselves that would have been a turbid strain and her idea had been to be noble which in a degree was a manner only it left her for the pinch comparatively at ease and it left him in the conditions peculiarly alone he was alone that is till on the afternoon of his third day in gathering dusk and renewed rain with his shabby rooms looking doubtless in their confirmed dreariness for the mere eyes of others at their worst the grinning padrona threw open the door and introduced mrs stringham that made at a bound a difference especially when he saw that his visitor was weighted it appeared part of her weight that she was in a wet waterproof that she allowed her umbrella to be taken from her by the good woman without consciousness or care and that her face under her veil richly rosy with the driving wind wasand the veil tooas splashed as if the rain were her tears   iii  they came to it almost immediately he was to wonder afterwards at the fewness of their steps she has turned her face to the wall  you mean shes worse  the poor lady stood there as she had stopped densher had in the instant flare of his eagerness his curiosity all responsive at sight of her waved away on the spot the padrona who had offered to relieve her of her mackintosh she looked vaguely about through her wet veil intensely alive now to the step she had taken and wishing it not to have been in the dark but clearly as yet seeing nothing i dont know how she isand its why ive come to you  im glad enough youve come he said and its quiteyou make me feelas if i had been wretchedly waiting for you  she showed him again her blurred eyesshe had caught at his word have you been wretched  now however on his lips the word expired it would have sounded for him like a complaint and before something he already made out in his visitor he knew his own trouble as small hers under her damp draperies which shamed his lack of a fire was great and he felt she had brought it all with her he answered that he had been patient and above all that he had been still as still as a mouseyoull have seen it for yourself stiller for three days together than ive ever been in my life it has seemed to me the only thing  this qualification of it as a policy or a remedy was straightway for his friend he saw a light that her own light could answer it has been best ive wondered for you but it has been best she said again  yet it has done no good  i dont know ive been afraid you were gone then as he gave a headshake which though slow was deeply mature you wont go  is to go he asked to be still  oh i mean if youll stay for me  ill do anything for you isnt it for you alone now i can  she thought of it and he could see even more of the relief she was taking from him his presence his face his voice the old rooms themselves so meagre yet so charged where kate had admirably been to himthese things counted for her now she had them as the help she had been wanting so that she still only stood there taking them all in with it however popped up characteristically a throb of her conscience what she thus tasted was almost a personal joy it told densher of the three days she on her side had spent well anything you do for meis for her too only only  only nothing now matters  she looked at him a minute as if he were the fact itself that he expressed then you know  is she dying he asked for all answer  mrs stringham waitedher face seemed to sound him then her own reply was strange she hasnt so much as named you we havent spoken  not for three days  no more she simply went on than if it were all over not even by the faintest allusion  oh said densher with more light you mean you havent spoken about me  about what else no more than if you were dead  well he answered after a moment i am dead  then i am said susan shepherd with a drop of her arms on her waterproof  it was a tone that for the minute imposed itself in its dry despair it represented in the bleak place which had no life of its own none but the life kate had leftthe sense of which for that matter by mystic channels might fairly be reaching the visitorthe very impotence of their extinction and densher had nothing to oppose it withal nothing but again is she dying  it made her however as if these were crudities almost material pangs only say as before then you know  yes he at last returned i know but the marvel to me is that you do ive no right in fact to imagine or to assume that you do  you may said susan shepherd all the same i know  everything  her eyes through her veil kept pressing him nonot everything thats why ive come  that i shall really tell you with which as she hesitated and it affected him he brought out in a groan a doubting oh oh it turned him from her to the place itself which was a part of what was in him was the abode the worn shrine more than ever of the fact in possession the fact now a thick association for which he had hired it that was not for telling but susan shepherd was none the less so decidedly wonderful that the sense of it might really have begun by an effect already operating to be a part of her knowledge he saw and it stirred him that she hadnt come to judge him had come rather so far as she might dare to pity this showed him her own abasementthat at any rate of grief and made him feel with a rush of friendliness that he liked to be with her the rush had quickened when she met his groan with an attenuation  we shall at all eventsif thats anythingbe together  it was his own good impulse in herself its what ive ventured to feel its much she replied in effect silently that it was whatever he liked on which so far as he had been afraid for anything he knew his fear had dropped the comfort was huge for it gave back to him something precious over which in the effort of recovery his own hand had too imperfectly closed kate he remembered had said to him with her sole and single boldnessand also on grounds he hadnt then measuredthat mrs stringham was a person who wouldnt at a pinch in a stretch of confidence wince it was but another of the cases in which kate was always showing you dont think then very horridly of me  and her answer was the more valuable that it came without nervous effusionquite as if she understood what he might conceivably have believed she turned over in fact what she thought and that was what helped him oh youve been extraordinary  it made him aware the next moment of how they had been planted there she took off her cloak with his aid though when she had also accepting a seat removed her veil he recognised in her personal ravage that the words she had just uttered to him were the one flower she had to throw they were all her consolation for him and the consolation even still depended on the event she sat with him at any rate in the grey clearance as sad as a winter dawn made by their meeting the image she again evoked for him loomed in it but the larger she has turned her face to the wall  he saw with the last vividness and it was as if in their silences they were simply so leaving what he saw she doesnt speak at all i dont mean not of me  of nothingof no one and she went on susan shepherd giving it out as she had had to take it she doesnt want to die think of her age think of her goodness think of her beauty think of all she is think of all she has she lies there stiffening herself and clinging to it all so i thank god the poor lady wound up with a wan inconsequence  he wondered you thank god  that shes so quiet  he continued to wonder is she so quiet  shes more than quiet shes grim its what she has never been so you seeall these days i cant tell youbut its better so it would kill me if she were to tell me  to tell you he was still at a loss  how she feels how she clings how she doesnt want it  how she doesnt want to die of course she doesnt want it he had a long pause and they might have been thinking together of what they could even now do to prevent it this however was not what he brought out millys grimness and the great hushed palace were present to him present with the little woman before him as she must have been waiting there and listening only what harm have you done her  mrs stringham looked about in her darkness i dont know i come and talk of her here with you  it made him again hesitate does she utterly hate me  i dont know how can i no one ever will  shell never tell  shell never tell  once more he thought she must be magnificent  she is magnificent  his friend after all helped him and he turned it so far as he could all over would she see me again  it made his companion stare should you like to see her  you mean as you describe her he felt her surprise and it took him some time no  ah then mrs stringham sighed  but if she could bear it id do anything  she had for the moment her vision of this but it collapsed i dont see what you can do  i dont either but she might  mrs stringham continued to think its too late  too late for her to see  too late  the very decision of her despairit was after all so lucidkindled in him a heat but the doctor all the while  tacchini oh hes kind he comes hes proud of having been approved and coached by a great london man he hardly in fact goes away so that i scarce know what becomes of his other patients he thinks her justly enough a great personage he treats her like royalty hes waiting on events but she has barely consented to see him and though she has told him generouslyfor she thinks of me dear creaturethat he may come that he may stay for my sake he spends most of his time only hovering at her door prowling through the rooms trying to entertain me in that ghastly saloon with the gossip of venice and meeting me in doorways in the sala on the staircase with an agreeable intolerable smile we dont said susan shepherd talk of her  by her request  absolutely i dont do what she doesnt wish we talk of the price of provisions  by her request too  absolutely she named it to me as a subject when she said the first time that if it would be any comfort to me he might stay as much as we liked  densher took it all in but he isnt any comfort to you  none whatever that however she added isnt his fault nothings any comfort  certainly densher observed as i but too horribly feel im not  no but i didnt come for that  you came for me  well then call it that but she looked at him a moment with eyes filled full and something came up in her the next instant from deeper still i came at bottom of course  you came at bottom of course for our friend herself but if its as you say too late for me to do anything  she continued to look at him and with an irritation which he saw grow in her from the truth itself so i did say but with you hereand she turned her vision again strangely about herwith you here and with everything i feel we mustnt abandon her  god forbid we should abandon her  then you wont his tone had made her flush again  how do you mean i wont if she abandons me what can i do if she wont see me  but you said just now you wouldnt like it  i said i shouldnt like it in the light of what you tell me i shouldnt like it only to see her as you make me i should like it if i could help her but even then densher pursued without faith she would have to want it first herself and there he continued to make out is the devil of it she wont want it herself she cant  he had got up in his impatience of it and she watched him while he helplessly moved theres one thing you can do theres only that and even for that there are difficulties but there is that he stood before her with his hands in his pockets and he had soon enough from her eyes seen what was coming she paused as if waiting for his leave to utter it and as he only let her wait they heard in the silence on the canal the renewed downpour of rain she had at last to speak but as if still with her fear she only halfspoke i think you really know yourself what it is  he did know what it was and with it even as she saidratherthere were difficulties he turned away on them on everything for a moment he moved to the other window and looked at the sheeted channel wider like a river where the houses opposite blurred and belittled stood at twice their distance mrs stringham said nothing was as mute in fact for the minute as if she had had him and he was the first again to speak when he did so however it was not in straight answer to her last remarkhe only started from that he said as he came back to her let me you know seeone must understand almost as if he had for the time accepted it and what he wished to understand was where on the essence of the question was the voice of sir luke strett if they talked of not giving her up shouldnt he be the one least of all to do it arent we at the worst in the dark without him  oh said mrs stringham its he who has kept me going i wired the first night and he answered like an angel hell come like one only he cant arrive at the nearest till thursday afternoon  well then thats something  she considered somethingyes she likes him  rather i can see it still the face with which when he was here in octoberthat night when she was in white when she had people there and those musiciansshe committed him to my care it was beautiful for both of usshe put us in relation she asked me for the time to take him about i did so and we quite hit it off that proved densher said with a quick sad smile that she liked him  he liked you susan shepherd presently risked  ah i know nothing about that  you ought to then he went with you to galleries and churches you saved his time for him showed him the choicest things and you perhaps will remember telling me myself that if he hadnt been a great surgeon he might really have been a great judge i mean of the beautiful  well the young man admitted thats what he isin having judged her he hasnt he went on judged her for nothing his interest in herwhich we must make the most ofcan only be supremely beneficent  he still roamed while he spoke with his hands in his pockets and she saw him on this as her eyes sufficiently betrayed trying to keep his distance from the recognition he had a few moments before partly confessed to im glad she dropped you like him  there was something for him in the sound of it well i do no more dear lady than you do yourself surely you like him surely when he was here we all liked him  yes but i seem to feel i know what he thinks and i should think with all the time you spent with him youd know it she said yourself  densher stopped short though at first without a word we never spoke of her neither of us mentioned her even to sound her name and nothing whatever in connexion with her passed between us  mrs stringham stared up at him surprised at this picture but she had plainly an idea that after an instant resisted it that was his professional propriety  precisely but it was also my sense of that virtue in him and it was something more besides and he spoke with sudden intensity i couldnt talk to him about her  oh said susan shepherd  i cant talk to any one about her  except to me his friend continued  except to you the ghost of her smile a gleam of significance had waited on her words and it kept him for honesty looking at her for honesty toothat is for his own wordshe had quickly coloured he was sinking so at a stroke the burden of his discourse with kate his visitor for the minute while their eyes met might have been watching him hold it down and he had to hold it downthe effort of which precisely made him red he couldnt let it come up at least not yet she might make what she would of it he attempted to repeat his statement but he really modified it sir luke at all events had nothing to tell me and i had nothing to tell him makebelieve talk was impossible for us and  and realshe had taken him right up with a huge emphasiswas more impossible still no doubthe didnt deny it and she had straightway drawn her conclusion then that proves what i saythat there were immensities between you otherwise youd have chattered  i dare say densher granted we were both thinking of her  you were neither of you thinking of any one else thats why you kept together  well that too if she desired he took from her but he came straight back to what he had originally said i havent a notion all the same of what he thinks she faced him visibly with the question into which he had already observed that her special shade of earnestness was perpetually flowering right and leftare you very sureand he could only note her apparent difference from himself you i judge believe that he thinks shes gone  she took it but she bore up it doesnt matter what i believe  well we shall seeand he felt almost basely superficial more and more for the last five minutes had he known she had brought something with her and never in respect to anything had he had such a wish to postpone he would have liked to put everything off till thursday he was sorry it was now tuesday he wondered if he were afraid yet it wasnt of sir luke who was coming nor of milly who was dying nor of mrs stringham who was sitting there it wasnt strange to say of kate either for kates presence affected him suddenly as having swooned or trembled away susan shepherds thus prolonged had cast on it some influence under which it had ceased to act she was as absent to his sensibility as she had constantly been since her departure absent as an echo or a reference from the palace and it was the first time among the objects now surrounding him that his sensibility so noted her he knew soon enough that it was of himself he was afraid and that even if he didnt take care he should infallibly be more so meanwhile he added for his companion it has been everything for me to see you she slowly rose at the words which might almost have conveyed to her the hint of his taking care she stood there as if she had in fact seen him abruptly moved to dismiss her but the abruptness would have been in this case so marked as fairly to offer ground for insistence to her imagination of his state it would take her moreover she clearly showed him she was thinking but a minute or two to insist besides she had already said it will you do it if he asks you i mean if sir luke himself puts it to you and will you give himoh she was earnest nowthe opportunity to put it to you  the opportunity to put what  that if you deny it to her that may still do something  densher felt himselfas had already once befallen him in the quarter of an hourturn red to the top of his forehead turning red had however for him as a sign of shame been so to speak discounted his consciousness of it at the present moment was rather as a sign of his fear it showed him sharply enough of what he was afraid if i deny what to her  hesitation on the demand revived in her for hadnt he all along been letting her see that he knew why what lord mark told her  and what did lord mark tell her  mrs stringham had a look of bewildermentof seeing him as suddenly perverse ive been judging that you yourself know and it was she who now blushed deep  it quickened his pity for her but he was beset too by other things then you know  of his dreadful visit she stared why its what has done it  yesi understand that but you also know  he had faltered again but all she knew she now wanted to say im speaking she said soothingly of what he told her its that that ive taken you as knowing  oh he sounded in spite of himself  it appeared to have for her he saw the next moment the quality of relief as if he had supposed her thinking of something else thereupon straightway that lightened it oh you thought ive known it for true  her light had heightened her flush and he saw that he had betrayed himself not however that it mattered as he immediately saw still better there it was now all of it at last and this at least there was no postponing they were left with her ideathe one she was wishing to make him recognise he had expressed ten minutes before his need to understand and she was acting after all but on that only what he was to understand was no small matter it might be larger even than as yet appeared  he took again one of his turns not meeting what she had last said he mooned a minute as he would have called it at a window and of course she could see that she had driven him to the wall she did clearly without delay see it on which her sense of having caught him became as promptly a scruple which she spoke as if not to press what i mean is that he told her youve been all the while engaged to miss croy  he gave a jerk round it was almostto hear itthe touch of a lash and he saididiotically as he afterwards knewthe first thing that came into his head all what while  oh its not i who say it she spoke in gentleness i only repeat to you what he told her  densher from whom an impatience had escaped had already caught himself up pardon my brutality of course i know what youre talking about i saw him toward the evening he further explained in the piazza only just saw himthrough the glass at florianswithout any words in fact i scarcely know himthere wouldnt have been occasion it was but once moreoverhe must have gone that night but i knew he wouldnt have come for nothing and i turned it overwhat he would have come for  oh so had mrs stringham he came for exasperation  densher approved he came to let her know that he knows better than she for whom it was she had a couple of months before in her fools paradise refused him  how you do knowand mrs stringham almost smiled  i know thatbut i dont know the good it does him  the good he thinks if he has patiencenot too muchmay be to come he doesnt know what he has done to her only we you see do that  he saw but he wondered she kept from himwhat she felt  she was ableim sure of itnot to show anything he dealt her his blow and she took it without a sign mrs stringham it was plain spoke by book and it brought into play again her appreciation of what she related shes magnificent  densher again gravely assented magnificent  and he she went on is an idiot of idiots  an idiot of idiots for a moment on it all on the stupid doom in it they looked at each other yet hes thought so awfully clever  so awfullyits maud lowders own view and he was nice in london said mrs stringham to me one could almost pity himhe has had such a good conscience  thats exactly the inevitable ass  yes but it wasnti could see from the only few things she first told methat he meant her the least harm he intended none whatever  thats always the ass at his worst densher returned he only of course meant harm to me  and good to himselfhe thought that would come he had been unable to swallow mrs stringham pursued what had happened on his other visit he had been then too sharply humiliated  oh i saw that  yes and he also saw you he saw you received as it were while he was turned away  perfectly densher saidive filled it out and also that he has known meanwhile for what i was then received for a stay of all these weeks he had had it to think of  preciselyit was more than he could bear but he has it said mrs stringham to think of still  only after all asked densher who himself somehow at this point was having more to think of even than he had yet hadonly after all how has he happened to know that is to know enough  what do you call enough mrs stringham enquired  he can only have actedit would have been his sole safetyfrom full knowledge  he had gone on without heeding her question but face to face as they were something had none the less passed between them it was this that after an instant made her again interrogative what do you mean by full knowledge  densher met it indirectly where has he been since october  i think he has been back to england he came in fact ive reason to believe straight from there  straight to do this job all the way for his halfhour  well to try againwith the help perhaps of a new fact to make himself possibly right with hera different attempt from the other he had at any rate something to tell her and he didnt know his opportunity would reduce itself to half an hour or perhaps indeed half an hour would be just what was most effective it has been said susan shepherd  her companion took it in understanding but too well yet as she lighted the matter for him more really than his own courage had quite daredputting the absent dots on several ishe saw new questions swarm they had been till now in a bunch entangled and confused and they fell apart each showing for itself the first he put to her was at any rate abrupt have you heard of late from mrs lowder  oh yes two or three times she depends naturally upon news of milly  he hesitated and does she depend naturally upon news of me  his friend matched for an instant his deliberation  ive given her none that hasnt been decently good this will have been the first  this densher was thinking  lord marks having been here and her being as she is  he thought a moment longer what has mrs lowder written about him has she written that he has been with them  she has mentioned him but onceit was in her letter before the last then she said something  and what did she say  mrs stringham produced it with an effort well it was in reference to miss croy that she thought kate was thinking of him or perhaps i should say rather that he was thinking of heronly it seemed this time to have struck maud that he was seeing the way more open to him  densher listened with his eyes on the ground but he presently raised them to speak and there was that in his face which proved him aware of a queerness in his question does she mean he has been encouraged to propose to her niece  i dont know what she means  of course nothe recovered himself and i oughtnt to seem to trouble you to piece together what i cant piece myself only i guess he added i can piece it  she spoke a little timidly but she risked it i dare say i can piece it too  it was one of the things in herand his conscious face took it from her as suchthat from the moment of her coming in had seemed to mark for him as to what concerned him the long jump of her perception they had parted four days earlier with many things between them deep down but these things were now on their troubled surface and it wasnt he who had brought them so quickly up women were wonderfulat least this one was but so not less was milly was aunt maud so most of all was his very kate well he already knew what he had been feeling about the circle of petticoats they were all such petticoats it was just the fineness of his tangle the sense of that in its turn for us too might have been not unconnected with his putting to his visitor a question that quite passed over her remark has miss croy meanwhile written to our friend  oh mrs stringham amended her friend also but not a single word that i know of  he had taken it for certain she hadntthe thing being after all but a shade more strange than his having himself with milly never for six weeks mentioned the young lady in question it was for that matter but a shade more strange than millys not having mentioned her in spite of which and however inconsequently he blushed anew for kates silence he got away from it in fact as quickly as possible and the furthest he could get was by reverting for a minute to the man they had been judging how did he manage to get at her she had onlywith what had passed between them beforeto say she couldnt see him  oh she was disposed to kindness she was easier the good lady explained with a slight embarrassment than at the other time  easier  she was off her guard there was a difference  yes but exactly not the difference  exactly not the difference of her having to be harsh perfectly she could afford to be the opposite with which as he said nothing she just impatiently completed her sense she had had you here for six weeks  oh densher softly groaned  besides i think he must have written her firstwritten i mean in a tone to smooth his way that it would be a kindness to himself then on the spot  on the spot densher broke in he unmasked the horrid little beast  it made susan shepherd turn slightly pale though quickening as for hope the intensity of her look at him oh he went off without an alarm  and he must have gone off also without a hope  ah that certainly  then it was mere base revenge hasnt he known her into the bargain the young man askeddidnt he weeks before see her judge her feel her as having for such a suit as his not more perhaps than a few months to live  mrs stringham at first for reply but looked at him in silence and it gave more force to what she then remarkably added he has doubtless been aware of what you speak of just as you have yourself been aware  he has wanted her you mean just because  just because said susan shepherd  the hound merton densher brought out he moved off however with a hot face as soon as he had spoken conscious again of an intention in his visitors reserve dusk was now deeper and after he had once more taken counsel of the dreariness without he turned to his companion shall we have lightsa lamp or the candles  not for me  nothing  not for me  he waited at the window another moment and then faced his friend with a thought he will have proposed to miss croy thats what has happened  her reserve continued its you who must judge  well i do judge mrs lowder will have done so tooonly she poor lady wrong miss croys refusal of him will have struck himdensher continued to make it outas a phenomenon requiring a reason  and youve been clear to him as the reason  not too clearsince im sticking here and since that has been a fact to make his descent on miss theale relevant but clear enough he has believed said densher bravely that i may have been a reason at lancaster gate and yet at the same time have been up to something in venice  mrs stringham took her courage from his own up to something up to what  god knows to some game as they say to some deviltry to some duplicity  which of course mrs stringham observed is a monstrous supposition her companion after a stiff minutesensibly long for eachfell away from her again and then added to it another minute which he spent once more looking out with his hands in his pockets this was no answer he perfectly knew to what she had dropped and it even seemed to state for his own ears that no answer was possible she left him to himself and he was glad she had declined for their further colloquy the advantage of lights these would have been an advantage mainly to herself yet she got her benefit too even from the absence of them it came out in her very tone when at last she addressed himso differently for confidencein words she had already used if sir luke himself asks it of you as something you can do for him will you deny to milly herself what she has been made so dreadfully to believe  oh how he knew he hung back but at last he said youre absolutely certain then that she does believe it  certain she appealed to their whole situation judge  he took his time again to judge do you believe it  he was conscious that his own appeal pressed her hard it eased him a little that her answer must be a pain to her discretion she answered none the less and he was truly the harder pressed what i believe will inevitably depend more or less on your action you can perfectly settle itif you care i promise to believe you down to the ground if to save her life you consent to a denial  but a denial when it comes to thatconfound the whole thing dont you seeof exactly what  it was as if he were hoping she would narrow but in fact she enlarged of everything  everything had never even yet seemed to him so incalculably much oh he simply moaned into the gloom   iv  the near thursday coming nearer and bringing sir luke strett brought also blessedly an abatement of other rigours the weather changed the stubborn storm yielded and the autumn sunshine baffled for many days but now hot and almost vindictive came into its own again and with an almost audible paean a suffusion of bright sound that was one with the bright colour took large possession venice glowed and plashed and called and chimed again the air was like a clap of hands and the scattered pinks yellows blues seagreens were like a hangingout of vivid stuffs a layingdown of fine carpets densher rejoiced in this on the occasion of his going to the station to meet the great doctor he went after consideration which as he was constantly aware was at present his imposed his only way of doing anything that was where the event had landed himwhere no event in his life had landed him before he had thought no doubt from the day he was born much more than he had acted except indeed that he remembered thoughtsa few of themwhich at the moment of their coming to him had thrilled him almost like adventures but anything like his actual state he had not as to the prohibition of impulse accident rangethe prohibition in other words of freedomhitherto known the great oddity was that if he had felt his arrival so few weeks back especially as an adventure nothing could now less resemble one than the fact of his staying it would be an adventure to break away to depart to go back above all to london and tell kate croy he had done so but there was something of the merely the almost meanly obliged and involved sort in his going on as he was that was the effect in particular of mrs stringhams visit which had left him as with such a taste in his mouth of what he couldnt do it had made this quantity clear to him and yet had deprived him of the sense the other sense of what for a refuge he possibly could  it was but a small makebelieve of freedom he knew to go to the station for sir luke nothing equally free at all events had he yet turned over so long what then was his odious position but that again and again he was afraid he stiffened himself under this consciousness as if it had been a tax levied by a tyrant he hadnt at any time proposed to himself to live long enough for fear to preponderate in his life such was simply the advantage it had actually got of him he was afraid for instance that an advance to his distinguished friend might prove for him somehow a pledge or a committal he was afraid of it as a current that would draw him too far yet he thought with an equal aversion of being shabby being poor through fear what finally prevailed with him was the reflexion that whatever might happen the great man had after that occasion at the palace their young womans brief sacrifice to societyand the hour of mrs stringhams appeal had brought it well to the surfaceshown him marked benevolence mrs stringhams comments on the relation in which milly had placed them made himit was unmistakeablefeel things he perhaps hadnt felt it was in the spirit of seeking a chance to feel again adequately whatever it was he had missedit was no doubt in that spirit so far as it went a stroke for freedom that densher arriving betimes paced the platform before the train came in only after it had come and he had presented himself at the door of sir lukes compartment with everything that followedonly as the situation developed the sense of an anticlimax to so many intensities deprived his apprehensions and hesitations even of the scant dignity they might claim he could scarce have said if the visitors manner less showed the remembrance that might have suggested expectation or made shorter work of surprise in presence of the fact  sir luke had clean forgottenso densher readthe rather remarkable young man he had formerly gone about with though he picked him up again on the spot with one large quiet look the young man felt himself so picked and the thing immediately affected him as the proof of a splendid economy opposed to all the waste with which he was now connected the exhibition was of a nature quite nobly to admonish him the eminent pilgrim in the train all the way had used the hours as he needed thinking not a moment in advance of what finally awaited him an exquisite case awaited himof which in this queer way the remarkable young man was an outlying part but the single motion of his face the motion into which densher from the platform lightly stirred its stillness was his first renewed cognition if however he had suppressed the matter by leaving victoria he would at once suppress now in turn whatever else suited the perception of this became as a symbol of the whole pitch so far as one might ones self be concerned of his visit one saw our friend further meditated everything that in contact he appeared to acceptif only for much not to trouble to sink it what one missed was the inward use he made of it densher began wondering at the great watersteps outside what use he would make of the anomaly of their having there to separate eugenio had been on the platform in the respectful rear and the gondola from the palace under his direction bestirred itself with its attaching mixture of alacrity and dignity on their coming out of the station together densher didnt at all mind now that he himself of necessity refusing a seat on the deep black cushions beside the guest of the palace he had millys three emissaries for spectators and this susceptibility he also knew it was something to have left behind all he did was to smile down vaguely from the stepsthey could see him the donkeys as shut out as they would i dont he said with a sad headshake go there now  oh sir luke strett returned and made no more of it so that the thing was splendid densher fairly thought as an inscrutability quite inevitable and unconscious his friend appeared not even to make of it that he supposed it might be for respect to the crisis he didnt moreover afterwards make much more of anythingafter the classic craft that is obeying in the main pasquales inimitable stroke from the poop had performed the manoeuvre by which it presented receding a back so to speak rendered positively graceful by the high black hump of its felze densher watched the gondola out of sighthe heard pasquales cry borne to him across the water for the sharp firm swerve into a sidecanal a short cut to the palace he had no gondola of his own it was his habit never to take one and he humblyas in venice it is humblewalked away though not without having for some time longer stood as if fixed where the guest of the palace had left him it was strange enough but he found himself as never yet and as he couldnt have reckoned in presence of the truth that was the truest about milly he couldnt have reckoned on the force of the difference instantly madefor it was all in the air as he heard pasquales cry and saw the boat disappearby the mere visibility on the spot of the personage summoned to her aid he hadnt only never been near the facts of her conditionwhich counted so as a blessing for him he hadnt only with all the world hovered outside an impenetrable ring fence within which there reigned a kind of expensive vagueness made up of smiles and silences and beautiful fictions and priceless arrangements all strained to breaking but he had also with every one else as he now felt actively fostered suppressions which were in the direct interest of every ones good manner every ones pity every ones really quite generous ideal it was a conspiracy of silence as the cliché went to which no one had made an exception the great smudge of mortality across the picture the shadow of pain and horror finding in no quarter a surface of spirit or of speech that consented to reflect it the mere aesthetic instinct of mankind our young man had more than once in the connexion said to himself letting the rest of the proposition drop but touching again thus sufficiently on the outrage even to taste involved in ones having to see so then it had beena general conscious fools paradise from which the specified had been chased like a dangerous animal what therefore had at present befallen was that the specified standing all the while at the gate had now crossed the threshold as in sir luke stretts person and quite on such a scale as to fill out the whole precinct denshers nerves absolutely his heartbeats too had measured the change before he on this occasion moved away  the facts of physical suffering of incurable pain of the chance grimly narrowed had been made at a stroke intense and this was to be the way he was now to feel them the clearance of the air in short making vision not only possible but inevitable the one thing left to be thankful for was the breadth of sir lukes shoulders which should one be able to keep in line with them might in some degree interpose it was however far from plain to densher for the first day or two that he was again to see his distinguished friend at all that he couldnt on any basis actually serving return to the palacethis was as solid to him every whit as the other feature of his case the fact of the publicity attaching to his proscription through his not having taken himself off he had been seen often enough in the leporelli gondola as accordingly he was not on any presumption destined to meet sir luke about the town where the latter would have neither time nor taste to lounge nothing more would occur between them unless the great man should surprisingly wait upon him his doing that densher further reflected wouldnt even simply depend on mrs stringhams having decided toas they might sayturn him on it would depend as wellfor there would be practically some difference to heron her actually attempting it and it would depend above all on what sir luke would make of such an overture densher had for that matter his own view of the amount to say nothing of the particular sort of response it might expect from him he had his own view of the ability of such a personage even to understand such an appeal to what extent could he be prepared and what importance in fine could he attach densher asked himself these questions in truth to put his own position at the worst he should miss the great man completely unless the great man should come to see him and the great man could only come to see him for a purpose unsupposable therefore he wouldnt come at all and consequently there was nothing to hope  it wasnt in the least that densher invoked this violence to all probability but it pressed on him that there were few possible diversions he could afford now to miss nothing in his predicament was so odd as that incontestably afraid of himself he was not afraid of sir luke he had an impression which he clung to based on a previous taste of the visitors company that he would somehow let him off the truth about milly perched on his shoulders and sounded in his tread became by the fact of his presence the name and the form for the time of everything in the place but it didnt for the difference sit in his face the face so squarely and easily turned to densher at the earlier season his presence on the first occasion not as the result of a summons but as a friendly whim of his own had had quite another value and though our young man could scarce regard that value as recoverable he yet reached out in imagination to a renewal of the old contact he didnt propose as he privately and forcibly phrased the matter to be a hog but there was something he after all did want for himself it was somethingthis stuck to himthat sir luke would have had for him if it hadnt been impossible these were his worst days the two or three those on which even the sense of the tension at the palace didnt much help him not to feel that his destiny made but light of him he had never been as he judged it so down in mean conditions without books without society almost without money he had nothing to do but to wait his main support really was his original idea which didnt leave him of waiting for the deepest depth his predicament could sink him to fate would invent if he but gave it time some refinement of the horrible it was just inventing meanwhile this suppression of sir luke when the third day came without a sign he knew what to think he had given mrs stringham during her call on him no such answer as would have armed her faith and the ultimatum she had described as ready for him when he should be ready was thereforeif on no other ground than her want of this power to answer for himnot to be presented the presentation heaven knew was not what he desired  that was not either we hasten to declareas densher then soon enough sawthe idea with which sir luke finally stood before him again for stand before him again he finally did just when our friend had gloomily embraced the belief that the limit of his power to absent himself from london obligations would have been reached four or five days exclusive of journeys represented the largest supposable sacrificeto a head not crownedon the part of one of the highest medical lights in the world so that really when the personage in question following up a tinkle of the bell solidly rose in the doorway it was to impose on densher a vision that for the instant cut like a knife it spoke the fact and in a single dreadful word of the magnitudehe shrank from calling it anything elseof millys case the great man had not gone then and an immense surrender to her immense need was so expressed in it that some effect some help some hope were flagrantly part of the expression it was for densher with his reaction from disappointment as if he were conscious of ten things at oncethe foremost being that just conceivably since sir luke was still there she had been saved close upon its heels however and quite as sharply came the sense that the crisisplainly even now to be prolonged for himwas to have none of that sound simplicity not only had his visitor not dropped in to gossip about milly he hadnt dropped in to mention her at all he had dropped in fairly to show that during the brief remainder of his stay the end of which was now in sight as little as possible of that was to be looked for the demonstration such as it was was in the key of their previous acquaintance and it was their previous acquaintance that had made him come he was not to stop longer than the saturday next at hand but there were things of interest he should like to see again meanwhile it was for these things of interest for venice and the opportunity of venice for a prowl or two as he called it and a turn about that he had looked his young man upproducing on the latters part as soon as the case had with the lapse of a further twentyfour hours so defined itself the most incongruous yet most beneficent revulsion nothing could in fact have been more monstrous on the surfaceand densher was well aware of itthan the relief he found during this short period in the tacit drop of all reference to the palace in neither hearing news nor asking for it that was what had come out for him on his visitors entrance even in the very seconds of suspense that were connecting the fact also directly and intensely with millys state he had come to say he had saved herhe had come as from mrs stringham to say how she might be savedhe had come in spite of mrs stringham to say she was lost the distinct throbs of hope of fear simultaneous for all their distinctness merged their identity in a bound of the heart just as immediate and which remained after they had passed it simply did wonders for himthis was the truththat sir luke was as he would have said quiet  the result of it was the oddest consciousness as of a blest calm after a storm he had been trying for weeks as we know to keep superlatively still and trying it largely in solitude and silence but he looked back on it now as on the heat of fever the real the right stillness was this particular form of society they walked together and they talked looked up pictures again and recovered impressionssir luke knew just what he wanted haunted a little the dealers in old wares sat down at florians for rest and mild drinks blessed above all the grand weather a bath of warm air a pageant of autumn light once or twice while they rested the great man closed his eyeskeeping them so for some minutes while his companion the more easily watching his face for it made private reflexions on the subject of lost sleep he had been up at night with herhe in person for hours but this was all he showed of it and was apparently to remain his nearest approach to an allusion the extraordinary thing was that densher could take it in perfectly as evidence could turn cold at the image looking out of it and yet that he could at the same time not intermit a throb of his response to accepted liberation the liberation was an experience that held its own and he continued to know why in spite of his deserts in spite of his folly in spite of everything he had so fondly hoped for it he had hoped for it had sat in his room there waiting for it because he had thus divined in it should it come some power to let him off he was being let off dealt with in the only way that didnt aggravate his responsibility the beauty was also that this wasnt on system or on any basis of intimate knowledge it was just by being a man of the world and by knowing life by feeling the real that sir luke did him good there had been in all the case too many women a mans sense of it another mans changed the air and he wondered what man had he chosen would have been more to his purpose than this one he was large and easythat was the benediction he knew what mattered and what didnt he distinguished between the essence and the shell the just grounds and the unjust for fussing one was thusif one were concerned with him or exposed to him at allin his hands for whatever he should do and not much less affected by his mercy than one might have been by his rigour the grand thingit did come to thatwas the way he carried off as one might fairly call it the business of making odd things natural nothing if they hadnt taken it so could have exceeded the unexplained oddity between them of denshers now complete detachment from the poor ladies at the palace nothing could have exceeded the no less marked anomaly of the great mans own abstentions of speech he made as he had done when they met at the station nothing whatever of anything and the effect of it densher would have said was a relation with him quite resembling that of doctor and patient one took the cue from him as one might have taken a doseexcept that the cue was pleasant in the taking  that was why one could leave it to his tacit discretion why for the three or four days densher again and again did so leave it merely wondering a little at the most on the eve of saturday the announced term of the episode waiting once more on this latter occasion the saturday morning for sir lukes reappearance at the station our friend had to recognise the drop of his own borrowed ease the result naturally enough of the prospect of losing a support the difficulty was that on such lines as had served them the support was sir lukes personal presence would he go without leaving some substitute for thatand without breaking either his silence in respect to his errand densher was in still deeper ignorance than at the hour of his call and what was truly prodigious at so supreme a moment was thatas had immediately to appearno gleam of light on what he had been living with for a week found its way out of him what he had been doing was proof of a huge interest as well as of a huge fee yet when the leporelli gondola again and somewhat tardily approached his companion watching from the watersteps studied his fine closed face as much as ever in vain it was like a lesson from the highest authority on the subject of the relevant so that its blankness affected densher of a sudden almost as a cruelty feeling it quite awfully compatible as he did with millys having ceased to exist and the suspense continued after they had passed together as time was short directly into the station where eugenio in the field early was mounting guard over the compartment he had secured the strain though probably lasting at the carriagedoor but a couple of minutes prolonged itself so for our poor gentlemans nerves that he involuntarily directed a long look at eugenio who met it however as only eugenio could sir lukes attention was given for the time to the right bestowal of his numerous effects about which he was particular and densher fairly found himself so far as silence could go questioning the representative of the palace it didnt humiliate him now it didnt humiliate him even to feel that that personage exactly knew how little he satisfied him eugenio resembled to that extent sir luketo the extent of the extraordinary things with which his facial habit was compatible by the time however that densher had taken from it all its possessor intended sir luke was free and with a hand out for farewell he offered the hand at first without speech only on meeting his eyes could our young man see that they had never yet so completely looked at him it was never with sir luke that they looked harder at one time than at another but they looked longer and this even a shade of it might mean on his part everything it meant densher for ten seconds believed that milly theale was dead so that the word at last spoken made him start  i shall come back  then shes better  i shall come back within the month sir luke repeated without heeding the question he had dropped denshers hand but he held him otherwise still i bring you a message from miss theale he said as if they hadnt spoken of her im commissioned to ask you from her to go and see her  denshers rebound from his supposition had a violence that his stare betrayed she asks me  sir luke had got into the carriage the door of which the guard had closed but he spoke again as he stood at the window bending a little but not leaning out she told me shed like it and i promised that as i expected to find you here id let you know  densher on the platform took it from him but what he took brought the blood into his face quite as what he had had to take from mrs stringham and he was also bewildered then she can receive  she can receive you  and youre coming back  oh because i must shes not to move shes to stay i come to her  i see i see said densher who indeed did seesaw the sense of his friends words and saw beyond it as well what mrs stringham had announced and what he had yet expected not to have to face had then come sir luke had kept it for the last but there it was and the colourless compact form it was now takingthe tone of one man of the world to another who after what had happened would understandwas but the characteristic manner of his appeal densher was to understand remarkably much and the great thing certainly was to show that he did im particularly obliged ill go today he brought that out but in his pause while they continued to look at each other the train had slowly creaked into motion there was time but for one more word and the young man chose it out of twenty with intense concentration then shes better  sir lukes face was wonderful yes shes better and he kept it at the window while the train receded holding him with it still it was to be his nearest approach to the utter reference they had hitherto so successfully avoided if it stood for everything never had a face had to stand for more so densher held after the train had gone sharply reflected so he reflected asking himself into what abyss it pushed him even while conscious of retreating under the maintained observation of eugenio     book tenth    i  then it has beenwhat do you say a whole fortnightwithout your making a sign  kate put that to him distinctly in the december dusk of lancaster gate and on the matter of the time he had been back but he saw with it straightway that she was as admirably true as ever to her instinctwhich was a system as wellof not admitting the possibility between them of small resentments of trifles to trip up their general trust that by itself the renewed beauty of it would at this fresh sight of her have stirred him to his depths if something else something no less vivid but quite separate hadnt stirred him still more it was in seeing her that he felt what their interruption had been and that they met across it even as persons whose adventures on either side in time and space of the nature of perils and exiles had had a peculiar strangeness he wondered if he were as different for her as she herself had immediately appeared which was but his way indeed of taking in with his thrill thateven going by the mere first lookshe had never been so handsome that fact bloomed for him in the firelight and lamplight that glowed their welcome through the london fog as the flower of her difference just as her difference itselfpart of which was her striking him as older in a degree for which no mere couple of months could accountwas the fruit of their intimate relation if she was different it was because they had chosen together that she should be and she might now as a proof of their wisdom their success of the reality of what had happenedof what in fact for the spirit of each was still happeningbeen showing it to him for pride his having returned and yet kept for numbered days so still had been he was quite aware the first point he should have to tackle with which consciousness indeed he had made a clean breast of it in finally addressing mrs lowder a note that had led to his present visit he had written to aunt maud as the finer way and it would doubtless have been to be noted that he needed no effort not to write to kate venice was three weeks behind himhe had come up slowly but it was still as if even in london he must conform to her law that was exactly how he was able with his faith in her steadiness to appeal to her feeling for the situation and explain his stretched delicacy he had come to tell her everything so far as occasion would serve them and if nothing was more distinct than that his slow journey his waits his delay to reopen communication had kept pace with this resolve so the inconsequence was doubtless at bottom but one of the elements of intensity he was gathering everything up everything he should tell her that took time and the proof was that as he felt on the spot he couldnt have brought it all with him before this afternoon he had brought it to the last syllable and out of the quantity it wouldnt be hardas he in fact foundto produce for kates understanding his first reason  a fortnight yesit was a fortnight friday but ive only been keeping in you see with our wonderful system he was so easily justified as that this of itself plainly enough prevented her saying she didnt see their wonderful system was accordingly still vivid for her and such a gage of its equal vividness for himself was precisely what she must have asked he hadnt even to dot his is beyond the remark that on the very face of it she would remember their wonderful system attached no premium to rapidities of transition i couldnt quitedont you knowtake my rebound with a rush and i suppose ive been instinctively hanging off to minimise for you as well as for myself the appearances of rushing theres a sort of fitness but i knew youd understand it was presently as if she really understood so well that she almost appealed from his insistenceyet looking at him too he was not unconscious as if this mastery of fitnesses was a strong sign for her of what she had done to him he might have struck her as expert for contingencies in the very degree of her having in venice struck him as expert he smiled over his plea for a renewal with stages and steps a thing shaded as they might say and graduated thoughfinely as she must respondshe met the smile but as she had met his entrance five minutes before her soft gravity at that momentwhich was yet not solemnity but the look of a consciousness charged with life to the brim and wishing not to overflowhad not qualified her welcome what had done this being much more the presence in the room for a couple of minutes of the footman who had introduced him and who had been interrupted in preparing the teatable  mrs lowders reply to denshers note had been to appoint the teahour five oclock on sunday for his seeing them kate had thereafter wired him without a signature come on sunday before teaabout a quarter of an hour which will help us and he had arrived therefore scrupulously at twenty minutes to five kate was alone in the room and hadnt delayed to tell him that aunt maud as she had happily gathered was to be for the intervalnot long but preciousengaged with an old servant retired and pensioned who had been paying her a visit and who was within the hour to depart again for the suburbs they were to have the scrap of time after the withdrawal of the footman to themselves and there was a moment when in spite of their wonderful system in spite of the proscription of rushes and the propriety of shades it proclaimed itself indeed precious and all without prejudicethat was what kept it nobleto kates high sobriety and her beautiful selfcommand if he had his discretion she had her perfect manner which was her decorum mrs stringham he had to finish with the question of his delay furthermore observed mrs stringham would have written to mrs lowder of his having quitted the place so that it wasnt as if he were hoping to cheat them theyd know he was no longer there  yes weve known it  and you continue to hear  from mrs stringham certainly by which i mean aunt maud does  then youve recent news  her face showed a wonder up to within a day or two i believe but havent you  noive heard nothing and it was now that he felt how much he had to tell her i dont get letters but ive been sure mrs lowder does with which he added then of course you know he waited as if she would show what she knew but she only showed in silence the dawn of a surprise that she couldnt control there was nothing but for him to ask what he wanted is miss theale alive  kates look at this was large dont you know  how should i my dearin the absence of everything and he himself stared as for light shes dead then as with her eyes on him she slowly shook her head he uttered a strange not yet  it came out in kates face that there were several questions on her lips but the one she presently put was is it very terrible  the manner of her so consciously and helplessly dying he had to think a moment well yessince you ask me very terrible to meso far as before i came away i had any sight of it but i dont think he went on thatthough ill tryi can quite tell you what it was what it is for me thats why i probably just sounded to you he explained as if i hoped it might be over  she gave him her quietest attention but he by this time saw that so far as telling her all was concerned she would be divided between the wish and the reluctance to hear it between the curiosity that not unnaturally would consume her and the opposing scruple of a respect for misfortune the more she studied him tooand he had never so felt her closely attached to his facethe more the choice of an attitude would become impossible to her there would simply be a feeling uppermost and the feeling wouldnt be eagerness this perception grew in him fast and he even with his imagination had for a moment the quick forecast of her possibly breaking out at him should he go too far with a wonderful what horrors are you telling me it would have the soundwouldnt it be open to him fairly to bring that out himselfof a repudiation for pity and almost for shame of everything that in venice had passed between them not that she would confess to any return upon herself not that she would let compunction or horror give her away but it was in the air for himyesthat she wouldnt want details that she positively wouldnt take them and that if he would generously understand it from her she would prefer to keep him down nothing however was more definite for him than that at the same time he must remain down but so far as it suited him something rose strong within him against his not being free with her she had been free enough about it all three months before with him that was what she was at present only in the sense of treating him handsomely i can believe she said with perfect consideration how dreadful for you much of it must have been  he didnt however take this up there were things about which he wished first to be clear theres no other possibility by what you now know i mean for her life and he had just to insistshe would say as little as she could she is dying  shes dying  it was strange to him in the matter of milly that lancaster gate could make him any surer yet what in the world in the matter of milly wasnt strange nothing was so much so as his own behaviourhis present as well as his past he could but do as he must has sir luke strett he asked gone back to her  i believe hes there now  then said densher its the end  she took it in silence for whatever he deemed it to be but she spoke otherwise after a minute you wont know unless youve perhaps seen him yourself that aunt maud has been to him  oh densher exclaimed with nothing to add to it  for real news kate herself after an instant added  she hasnt thought mrs stringhams real  its perhaps only i who havent it was on aunt mauds trying again three days ago to see him that she heard at his house of his having gone he had started i believe some days before  and wont then by this time be back  kate shook her head she sent yesterday to know  he wont leave her thendensher had turned it overwhile she lives hell stay to the end hes magnificent  i think she is said kate  it had made them again look at each other long and what it drew from him rather oddly was oh you dont know  well shes after all my friend  it was somehow with her handsome demur the answer he had least expected of her and it fanned with its breath for a brief instant his old sense of her variety i see you would have been sure of it you were sure of it  of course i was sure of it  and a pause again with this fell upon them which densher however presently broke if you dont think mrs stringhams news real what do you think of lord marks  she didnt think anything lord marks  you havent seen him  not since he saw her  youve known then of his seeing her  certainly from mrs stringham  and have you known densher went on the rest  kate wondered what rest  why everything it was his visit that she couldnt standit was what then took place that simply killed her  oh kate seriously breathed but she had turned pale and he saw that whatever her degree of ignorance of these connexions it wasnt put on mrs stringham hasnt said that  he observed none the less that she didnt ask what had then taken place and he went on with his contribution to her knowledge the way it affected her was that it made her give up she has given up beyond all power to care again and thats why shes dying  oh kate once more slowly sighed but with a vagueness that made him pursue  one can see now that she was living by willwhich was very much what you originally told me of her  i remember that was it  well then her will at a given moment broke down and the collapse was determined by that fellows dastardly stroke he told her the scoundrel that you and i are secretly engaged  kate gave a quick glare but he doesnt know it  that doesnt matter she did by the time he had left her besides densher added he does know it when he continued did you last see him  but she was lost now in the picture before her that was what made her worse  he watched her take it init so added to her sombre beauty then he spoke as mrs stringham had spoken she turned her face to the wall  poor milly said kate  slight as it was her beauty somehow gave it style so that he continued consistently she learned it you see too soonsince of course ones idea had been that she might never even learn it at all and she had felt surethrough everything we had doneof there not being between us so far at least as you were concerned anything she need regard as a warning  she took another moment for thought it wasnt through anything you didwhatever that may have beenthat she gained her certainty it was by the conviction she got from me  oh its very handsome densher said for you to take your share  do you suppose kate asked that i think of denying it  her look and her tone made him for the instant regret his comment which indeed had been the first that rose to his lips as an effect absolutely of what they would have called between them her straightness her straightness visibly was all his own loyalty could ask still that was comparatively beside the mark of course i dont suppose anything but that were together in our recognitions our responsibilitieswhatever we choose to call them it isnt a question for us of apportioning shares or distinguishing invidiously among such impressions as it was our idea to give  it wasnt your idea to give impressions said kate  he met this with a smile that he himself felt in its strained character as queer dont go into that  it was perhaps not as going into it that she had another ideaan idea born she showed of the vision he had just evoked wouldnt it have been possible then to deny the truth of the information i mean of lord marks  densher wondered possible for whom  why for you  to tell her he lied  to tell her hes mistaken  densher staredhe was stupefied the possible thus glanced at by kate being exactly the alternative he had had to face in venice and to put utterly away from him nothing was stranger than such a difference in their view of it and to lie myself you mean to do it we are my dear child he said i suppose still engaged  of course were still engaged but to save her life  he took in for a little the way she talked of it of course it was to be remembered she had always simplified and it brought back his sense of the degree in which to her energy as compared with his own many things were easy the very sense that so often before had moved him to admiration well if you must knowand i want you to be clear about iti didnt even seriously think of a denial to her face the question of itas possibly saving herwas put to me definitely enough but to turn it over was only to dismiss it besides he added it wouldnt have done any good  you mean she would have had no faith in your correction she had spoken with a promptitude that affected him of a sudden as almost glib but he himself paused with the overweight of all he meant and she meanwhile went on did you try  i hadnt even a chance  kate maintained her wonderful manner the manner of at once having it all before her and yet keeping it all at its distance she wouldnt see you  not after your friend had been with her  she hesitated couldnt you write  it made him also think but with a difference she had turned her face to the wall  this again for a moment hushed her and they were both too grave now for parenthetic pity but her interest came out for at least the minimum of light she refused even to let you speak to her  my dear girl densher returned she was miserably prohibitively ill  well that was what she had been before  and it didnt prevent no densher admitted it didnt and i dont pretend that shes not magnificent  shes prodigious said kate croy  he looked at her a moment so are you my dear but thats how it is he wound up and there we are  his idea had been in advance that she would perhaps sound him much more deeply asking him above all two or three specific things he had fairly fancied her even wanting to know and trying to find out how far as the odious phrase was he and milly had gone and how near by the same token they had come he had asked himself if he were prepared to hear her do that and had had to take for answer that he was prepared of course for everything wasnt he prepared for her ascertaining if her two or three prophecies had found time to be made true he had fairly believed himself ready to say whether or no the overture on millys part promised according to the boldest of them had taken place but what was in fact blessedly coming to him was that so far as such things were concerned his readiness wouldnt be taxed kates pressure on the question of what had taken place remained so admirably general that even her present enquiry kept itself free of sharpness so then that after lord marks interference you never again met  it was what he had been all the while coming to no we met onceso far as it could be called a meeting i had stayedi didnt come away  that said kate was no more than decent  preciselyhe felt himself wonderful and i wanted to be no less she sent for me i went to her and that night i left venice  his companion waited wouldnt that then have been your chance  to refute lord marks story no not even if before her there i had wanted to what did it signify either she was dying  well kate in a manner persisted why not just because she was dying she had however all her discretion but of course i know that seeing her you could judge  of course seeing her i could judge and i did see her if i had denied you moreover densher said with his eyes on her id have stuck to it  she took for a moment the intention of his face you mean that to convince her youd have insisted or somehow proved  i mean that to convince you id have insisted or somehow proved  kate looked for her moment at a loss to convince me  i wouldnt have made my denial in such conditions only to take it back afterwards  with this quickly light came for her and with it also her colour flamed oh youd have broken with me to make your denial a truth youd have chucked meshe embraced it perfectlyto save your conscience  i couldnt have done anything else said merton densher so you see how right i was not to commit myself and how little i could dream of it if it ever again appears to you that i might have done so remember what i say  kate again considered but not with the effect at once to which he pointed youve fallen in love with her  well then say sowith a dying woman why need you mind and what does it matter  it came from him the question straight out of the intensity of relation and the facetoface necessity into which from the first from his entering the room they had found themselves thrown but it gave them their most extraordinary moment wait till she is dead mrs stringham kate added is to telegraph after which in a tone still different for what then she asked did milly send for you  it was what i tried to make out before i went i must tell you moreover that i had no doubt of its really being to give me as you say a chance she believed i suppose that i might deny and what to my own mind was before me in going to her was the certainty that shed put me to my test she wanted from my own lipsso i saw itthe truth but i was with her for twenty minutes and she never asked me for it  she never wanted the truthkate had a high headshake she wanted you she would have taken from you what you could give her and been glad of it even if she had known it false you might have lied to her from pity and she have seen you and felt you lie and yetsince it was all for tendernessshe would have thanked you and blessed you and clung to you but the more for that was your strength my dear manthat she loves you with passion  oh my strength densher coldly murmured  otherwise since she had sent for you what was it to ask of you and thenquite without ironyas he waited a moment to say was it just once more to look at you  she had nothing to ask of menothing that is but not to stay any longer she did to that extent want to see me she had supposed at firstafter he had been with herthat i had seen the propriety of taking myself off then since i hadntseeing my propriety as i did in another wayshe found days later that i was still there this said densher affected her  of course it affected her  again she struck him for all her dignity as glib if it was somehow for her i was still staying she wished that to end she wished me to know how little there was need of it and as a manner of farewell she wished herself to tell me so  and she did tell you so  facetoface yes personally as she desired  and as you of course did  no kate he returned with all their mutual consideration not as i did i hadnt desired it in the least  you only went to oblige her  to oblige her and of course also to oblige you  oh for myself certainly im glad  gladhe echoed vaguely the way it rang out  i mean you did quite the right thing you did it especially in having stayed but that was all kate went on that you mustnt wait  that was really alland in perfect kindness  ah kindness naturally from the moment she asked of you such awell such an effort that you mustnt waitthat was the point kate addedto see her die  that was the point my dear densher said  and it took twenty minutes to make it  he thought a little i didnt time it to a second i paid her the visitjust like another  like another person  like another visit  oh said kate which had apparently the effect of slightly arresting his speechan arrest she took advantage of to continue making with it indeed her nearest approach to an enquiry of the kind against which he had braced himself did she receive youin her conditionin her room  not she said merton densher she received me just as usual in that glorious great salone in the dress she always wears from her inveterate corner of her sofa and his face for the moment conveyed the scene just as hers equally embraced it do you remember what you originally said to me of her  ah ive said so many things  that she wouldnt smell of drugs that she wouldnt taste of medicine well she didnt  so that it was really almost happy  it took him a long time to answer occupied as he partly was in feeling how nobody but kate could have invested such a question with the tone that was perfectly right she meanwhile however patiently waited i dont think i can attempt to say now what it was some dayperhaps for it would be worth it for us  some daycertainly she seemed to record the promise yet she spoke again abruptly shell recover  well said densher youll see  she had the air an instant of trying to did she show anything of her feeling i mean kate explained of her feeling of having been misled  she didnt press hard surely but he had just mentioned that he would have rather to glide she showed nothing but her beauty and her strength  then his companion asked whats the use of her strength  he seemed to look about for a use he could name but he had soon given it up she must die my dear in her own extraordinary way  naturally but i dont see then what proof you have that she was ever alienated  i have the proof that she refused for days and days to see me  but she was ill  that hadnt prevented heras you yourself a moment ago saidduring the previous time if it had been only illness it would have made no difference with her  she would still have received you  she would still have received me  oh well said kate if you know  of course i know i know moreover as well from mrs stringham  and what does mrs stringham know  everything  she looked at him longer everything  everything  because youve told her  because she has seen for herself ive told her nothing shes a person who does see  kate thought thats by her liking you too she as well is prodigious you see what interest in a man does it does it all round so you neednt be afraid  im not afraid said densher  kate moved from her place then looking at the clock which marked five she gave her attention to the teatable where aunt mauds huge silver kettle which had been exposed to its lamp and which she had not soon enough noticed was hissing too hard well its all most wonderful she exclaimed as she rather too profuselya sign her friend noticedladled tea into the pot he watched her a moment at this occupation coming nearer the table while she put in the steaming water youll have some  he hesitated hadnt we better wait  for aunt maud she saw what he meantthe deprecation by their old law of betrayals of the intimate note oh you neednt mind now weve done it  humbugged her  squared her youve pleased her  densher mechanically accepted his tea he was thinking of something else and his thought in a moment came out what a brute then i must be  a brute  to have pleased so many people  ah said kate with a gleam of gaiety youve done it to please me but she was already with her gleam reverting a little what i dont understand iswont you have any sugar  yes please  what i dont understand she went on when she had helped him is what it was that had occurred to bring her round again if she gave you up for days and days what brought her back to you  she asked the question with her own cup in her hand but it found him ready enough in spite of his sense of the ironic oddity of their going into it over the teatable it was sir luke strett who brought her back his visit his presence there did it  he brought her back then to life  well to what i saw  and by interceding for you  i dont think he interceded i dont indeed know what he did  kate wondered didnt he tell you  i didnt ask him i met him again but we practically didnt speak of her  kate stared then how do you know  i see i feel i was with him again as i had been before  oh and you pleased him too that was it  he understood said densher  but understood what  he waited a moment that i had meant awfully well  ah and made her understand i see she went on as he said nothing but how did he convince her  densher put down his cup and turned away you must ask sir luke  he stood looking at the fire and there was a time without sound the great thing kate then resumed is that shes satisfied which she continued looking across at him is what ive worked for  satisfied to die in the flower of her youth  well at peace with you  oh peace he murmured with his eyes on the fire  the peace of having loved  he raised his eyes to her is that peace  of having been loved she went on that is of having she wound up realised her passion she wanted nothing more she has had all she wanted  lucid and always grave she gave this out with a beautiful authority that he could for the time meet with no words he could only again look at her though with the sense in so doing that he made her more than he intended take his silence for assent quite indeed as if she did so take it she quitted the table and came to the fire you may think it hideous that i should now that i should yetshe made a point of the wordpretend to draw conclusions but weve not failed  oh he only again murmured  she was once more close to him close as she had been the day she came to him in venice the quickly returning memory of which intensified and enriched the fact he could practically deny in such conditions nothing that she said and what she said was with it visibly a fruit of that knowledge weve succeeded she spoke with her eyes deep in his own she wont have loved you for nothing it made him wince but she insisted and you wont have loved me   ii  he was to remain for several days under the deep impression of this inclusive passage so luckily prolonged from moment to moment but interrupted at its climax as may be said by the entrance of aunt maud who found them standing together near the fire the bearings of the colloquy however sharp as they were were less sharp to his intelligence strangely enough than those of a talk with mrs lowder alone for which she soon gave himor for which perhaps rather kate gave himfull occasion what had happened on her at last joining them was to conduce he could immediately see to her desiring to have him to herself kate and he no doubt at the opening of the door had fallen apart with a certain suddenness so that she had turned her hard fine eyes from one to the other but the effect of this lost itself to his mind the next minute in the effect of his companions rare alertness she instantly spoke to her aunt of what had first been uppermost for herself inviting her thereby intimately to join them and doing it the more happily also no doubt because the fact she resentfully named gave her ample support had you quite understood my dear that its full three weeks and she effaced herself as if to leave mrs lowder to deal from her own point of view with this extravagance densher of course straightway noted that his cue for the protection of kate was to make no less all of it he could and their tracks as he might have said were fairly covered by the time their hostess had taken afresh on his renewed admission the measure of his scant eagerness kate had moved away as if no great showing were needed for her personal situation to be seen as delicate she had been entertaining their visitor on her aunts behalfa visitor she had been at one time suspected of favouring too much and who had now come back to them as the stricken suitor of another person it wasnt that the fate of the other person her exquisite friend didnt in its tragic turn also concern herself it was only that her acceptance of mr densher as a source of information could scarcely help having an awkwardness she invented the awkwardness under denshers eyes and he marvelled on his side at the instant creation it served her as the fine cloud that hangs about a goddess in an epic and the young man was but vaguely to know at what point of the rest of his visit she had for consideration melted into it and out of sight  he was taken up promptly with another matterthe truth of the remarkable difference neither more nor less that the events of venice had introduced into his relation with aunt maud and that these weeks of their separation had caused quite richly to ripen for him she had not sat down to her teatable before he felt himself on terms with her that were absolutely new nor could she press on him a second cup without her seeming herself and quite wittingly so to define and establish them she regretted but she quite understood that what was taking place had obliged him to hang off they hadafter hearing of him from poor susan as gonebeen hoping for an early sight of him they would have been interested naturally in his arriving straight from the scene yet she needed no reminder that the scene preciselyby which she meant the tragedy that had so detained and absorbed him the memory the shadow the sorrow of itwas what marked him for unsociability she thus presented him to himself as it were in the guise in which she had now adopted him and it was the element of truth in the character that he found himself for his own part adopting she treated him as blighted and ravaged as frustrate and already bereft and for him to feel that this opened for him a new chapter of frankness with her he scarce had also to perceive how it smoothed his approaches to kate it made the latter accessible as she hadnt yet begun to be it set up for him at lancaster gate an association positively hostile to any other legend it was quickly vivid to him that were he minded he could work this association he had but to use the house freely for his prescribed attitude and he need hardly ever be out of it stranger than anything moreover was to be the way that by the end of a week he stood convicted to his own sense of a surrender to mrs lowders view he had somehow met it at a point that had brought him onbrought him on a distance that he couldnt again retrace he had private hours of wondering what had become of his sincerity he had others of simply reflecting that he had it all in use his only want of candour was aunt mauds wealth of sentiment she was hugely sentimental and the worst he did was to take it from her he wasnt so himselfeverything was too real but it was none the less not false that he had been through a mill  it was in particular not false for instance that when she had said to him on the sunday almost cosily from her sofa behind the tea i want you not to doubt you poor dear that im with you to the end his meeting her halfway had been the only course open to him she was with him to the endor she might bein a way kate wasnt and even if it literally made her society meanwhile more soothing he must just brush away the question of why it shouldnt was he professing to her in any degree the possession of an aftersense that wasnt real how in the world could he when his aftersense day by day was his greatest reality such only was at bottom what there was between them and two or three times over it made the hour pass these were occasionstwo and a scrapon which he had come and gone without mention of kate now that almost as never yet he had licence to ask for her the queer turn of their affair made it a false note it was another queer turn that when he talked with aunt maud about milly nothing else seemed to come up he called upon her almost avowedly for that purpose and it was the queerest turn of all that the state of his nerves should require it he liked her better he was really behaving he had occasion to say to himself as if he liked her best the thing was absolutely that she met him halfway nothing could have been broader than her vision than her loquacity than her sympathy it appeared to gratify to satisfy her to see him as he was that too had its effect it was all of course the last thing that could have seemed on the cards a change by which he was completely free with this lady and it wouldnt indeed have come about iffor another monstrosityhe hadnt ceased to be free with kate thus it was that on the third time in especial of being alone with her he found himself uttering to the elder woman what had been impossible of utterance to the younger mrs lowder gave him in fact on the ground of what he must keep from her but one uneasy moment that was when on the first sunday after kate had suppressed herself she referred to her regret that he mightnt have stayed to the end he found his reason difficult to give her but she came after all to his help  you simply couldnt stand it  i simply couldnt stand it besides you see but he paused  besides what he had been going to say morethen he saw dangers luckily however she had again assisted him besidesoh i knowmen havent in many relations the courage of women  they havent the courage of women  kate or i would have stayed she declaredif we hadnt come away for the special reason that you so frankly appreciated  densher had said nothing about his appreciation hadnt his behaviour since the hour itself sufficiently shown it but he presently saidhe couldnt help going so far i dont doubt certainly that miss croy would have stayed and he saw again into the bargain what a marvel was susan shepherd she did nothing but protect himshe had done nothing but keep it up in copious communication with the friend of her youth she had yet it was plain favoured this lady with nothing that compromised him millys act of renouncement she had described but as a change for the worse she had mentioned lord marks descent as even without her it might be known so that she mustnt appear to conceal it but she had suppressed explanations and connexions and indeed for all he knew blessed puritan soul had invented commendable fictions thus it was absolutely that he was at his ease thus it was that shaking for ever in the unrest that didnt drop his crossed leg he leaned back in deep yellow satin chairs and took such comfort as came she asked it was true aunt maud questions that kate hadnt but this was just the difference that from her he positively liked them he had taken with himself on leaving venice the resolution to regard milly as already dead to himthat being for his spirit the only thinkable way to pass the time of waiting he had left her because it was what suited her and it wasnt for him to go as they said in america behind this which imposed on him but the sharper need to arrange himself with his interval suspense was the ugliest ache to him and he would have nothing to do with it the last thing he wished was to be unconscious of herwhat he wished to ignore was her own consciousness tortured for all he knew crucified by its pain knowingly to hang about in london while the pain went onwhat would that do but make his days impossible his scheme was accordingly to convince himselfand by some art about which he was vaguethat the sense of waiting had passed what in fact he restlessly reflected have i any further to do with it let me assume the thing actually overas it at any moment may beand i become good again for something at least to somebody im good as it is for nothing to anybody least of all to her he consequently tried so far as shutting his eyes and stalking grimly about was a trial but his plan was carried out it may well be guessed neither with marked success nor with marked consistency the days whether lapsing or lingering were a stiff reality the suppression of anxiety was a thin idea the taste of life itself was the taste of suspense that he was waiting was in short at the bottom of everything and it required no great sifting presently to feel that if he took so much more as he called it to mrs lowder this was just for that reason  she helped him to hold out all the while that she was subtle enoughand he could see her divine it as what he wantednot to insist on the actuality of their tension his nearest approach to success was thus in being good for something to aunt maud in default of any one better her company eased his nerves even while they pretended together that they had seen their tragedy out they spoke of the dying girl in the past tense they said no worse of her than that she had been stupendous on the other hand howeverand this was what wasnt for densher pure peacethey insisted enough that stupendous was the word it was the thing this recognition that kept him most quiet he came to it with her repeatedly talking about it against time and in particular we have noted speaking of his supreme personal impression as he hadnt spoken to kate it was almost as if she herself enjoyed the perfection of the pathos she sat there before the scene as he couldnt help giving it out to her very much as a stout citizens wife might have sat during a play that made people cry in the pit or the familycircle what most deeply stirred her was the way the poor girl must have wanted to live  ah yes indeedshe did she did why in pity shouldnt she with everything to fill her world the mere money of her the darling if it isnt too disgusting at such a time to mention that  aunt maud mentioned itand densher quite understoodbut as fairly giving poetry to the life milly clung to a view of the might have been before which the good lady was hushed anew to tears she had had her own vision of these possibilities and her own social use for them and since millys spirit had been after all so at one with her about them what was the cruelty of the event but a cruelty of a sort to herself that came out when he named as the horrible thing to know the fact of their young friends unapproachable terror of the end keep it down though she would coming out therefore often since in so naming it he found the strangest of reliefs he allowed it all its vividness as if on the principle of his not at least spiritually shirking milly had held with passion to her dream of a future and she was separated from it not shrieking indeed but grimly awfully silent as one might imagine some noble young victim of the scaffold in the french revolution separated at the prisondoor from some object clutched for resistance densher in a cold moment so pictured the case for mrs lowder but no moment cold enough had yet come to make him so picture it to kate and it was the front so presented that had been in milly heroic presented with the highest heroism aunt maud by this time knew on the occasion of his taking leave of her he had let her know absolutely for the girls glory how he had been received on that occasion with a positive effectsince she was indeed so perfectly the princess that mrs stringham always called herof princely state  before the fire in the great room that was all arabesques and cherubs all gaiety and gilt and that was warm at that hour too with a wealth of autumn sun the state in question had been maintained and the situationwell densher said for the convenience of exquisite london gossip sublime the gossipfor it came to as much at lancaster gatewasnt the less exquisite for his use of the silver veil nor on the other hand was the veil so touched too much drawn aside he himself for that matter took in the scene again at moments as from the page of a book he saw a young man far off and in a relation inconceivable saw him hushed passive staying his breath but half understanding yet dimly conscious of something immense and holding himself painfully together not to lose it the young man at these moments so seen was too distant and too strange for the right identity and yet outside afterwards it was his own face densher had known he had known then at the same time what the young man had been conscious of and he was to measure after that day by day how little he had lost at present there with mrs lowder he knew he had gathered allthat passed between them mutely as in the intervals of their associated gaze they exchanged looks of intelligence this was as far as association could go but it was far enough when she knew the essence the essence was that something had happened to him too beautiful and too sacred to describe he had been to his recovered sense forgiven dedicated blessed but this he couldnt coherently express it would have required an explanationfatal to mrs lowders faith in himof the nature of millys wrong so as to the wonderful scene they just stood at the door they had the sense of the presence withinthey felt the charged stillness after which their association deepened by it they turned together away  that itself indeed for our restless friend became by the end of a week the very principle of reaction so that he woke up one morning with such a sense of having played a part as he needed selfrespect to gainsay he hadnt in the least stated at lancaster gate that as a haunted mana man haunted with a memoryhe was harmless but the degree to which mrs lowder accepted admired and explained his new aspect laid upon him practically the weight of a declaration what he hadnt in the least stated her own manner was perpetually stating it was as haunted and harmless that she was constantly putting him down there offered itself however to his purpose such an element as plain honesty and he had embraced by the time he dressed his proper corrective they were on the edge of christmas but christmas this year was as in the london of so many other years disconcertingly mild the still air was soft the thick light was grey the great town looked empty and in the park where the grass was green where the sheep browsed where the birds multitudinously twittered the straight walks lent themselves to slowness and the dim vistas to privacy he held it fast this morning till he had got out his sacrifice to honour and then went with it to the nearest postoffice and fixed it fast in a telegram thinking of it moreover as a sacrifice only because he had for reasons felt it as an effort its character of effort it would owe to kates expected resistance not less probable than on the occasion of past appeals which was precisely why heperhaps innocentlymade his telegram persuasive it had as a recall of tender hours to be for the young woman at the counter a trifle cryptic but there was a good deal of it in one way and another representing as it did a rich impulse and costing him a couple of shillings there was also a moment later on that day when in the park as he measured watchfully one of their old alleys he might have been supposed by a cynical critic to be reckoning his chance of getting his money back he was waitingbut he had waited of old lancaster gate as a danger was practically at handbut she had risked that danger before besides it was smaller now with the queer turn of their affair in spite of which indeed he was graver as he lingered and looked out  kate came at last by the way he had thought least likely came as if she had started from the marble arch but her advent was responsethat was the great matter response marked in her face and agreeable to him even after aunt mauds responses as nothing had been since his return to london she had not it was true answered his wire and he had begun to fear as she was late that with the instinct of what he might be again intending to press upon her she had decidedthough not with easeto deprive him of his chance he would have of course she knew other chances but she perhaps saw the present as offering her special danger this in fact densher could himself feel was exactly why he had so prepared it and he had rejoiced even while he waited in all that the conditions had to say to him of their simpler and better time the shortest day of the year though it might be it was in the same place by a whim of the weather almost as much to their purpose as the days of sunny afternoons when they had taken their first trysts this and that tree within sight on the grass stretched bare boughs over the couple of chairs in which they had sat of old and in whichfor they really could sit down againthey might recover the clearness of their prime it was to all intents however this very reference that showed itself in kates face as with her swift motion she came toward him it helped him her swift motion when it finally brought her nearer helped him for that matter at first if only by showing him afresh how terribly well she looked it had been all along he certainly remembered a phenomenon of no rarity that he had felt her at particular moments handsomer than ever before one of these for instance being still present to him as her entrance under her aunts eyes at lancaster gate the day of his dinner there after his return from america and another her aspect on the same spot two sundays agothe light in which she struck the eyes he had brought back from venice in the course of a minute or two now he got as he had got it the other times his apprehension of the special stamp of the fortune of the moment  whatever it had been determined by as the different hours recurred to him it took on at present a prompt connexion with an effect produced for him in truth more than once during the past week only now much intensified this effect he had already noted and named it was that of the attitude assumed by his friend in the presence of the degree of response on his part to mrs lowders welcome which she couldnt possibly have failed to notice she had noticed it and she had beautifully shown him so wearing in its honour the finest shade of studied serenity a shade almost of gaiety over the workings of time everything of course was relative with the shadow they were living under but her condonation of the way in which he now for confidence distinguished aunt maud had almost the note of cheer she had so by her own air consecrated the distinction invidious in respect to herself though it might be and nothing really more than this demonstration could have given him had he still wanted it the measure of her superiority it was doubtless for that matter this superiority alone that on the winter noon gave smooth decision to her step and charming courage to her eyesa courage that deepened in them when he had presently got to what he did want he had delayed after she had joined him not much more than long enough for him to say to her drawing her hand into his arm and turning off where they had turned of old that he wouldnt pretend he hadnt lately had moments of not quite believing he should ever again be so happy she answered passing over the reasons whatever they had been of his doubt that her own belief was in high happiness for them if they would only have patience though nothing at the same time could be dearer than his idea for their walk it was only makebelieve of course with what had taken place for them that they couldnt meet at home she spoke of their opportunities as suffering at no point he had at any rate soon let her know that he wished the present one to suffer at none and in a quiet spot beneath a great wintry tree he let his entreaty come sharp  weve played our dreadful game and weve lost we owe it to ourselves we owe it to our feeling for ourselves and for each other not to wait another day our marriage willfundamentally somehow dont you seeright everything thats wrong and i cant express to you my impatience weve only to announce itand it takes off the weight  to announce it kate asked she spoke as if not understanding though she had listened to him without confusion  to accomplish it thentomorrow if you will do it and announce it as done thats the least part of itafter it nothing will matter we shall be so right he said that we shall be strong we shall only wonder at our past fear it will seem an ugly madness it will seem a bad dream  she looked at him without flinchingwith the look she had brought at his call but he felt now the strange chill of her brightness my dear man what has happened to you  well that i can bear it no longer thats simply what has happened something has snapped has broken in me and here i am its as i am that you must have me  he saw her try for a time to appear to consider it but he saw her also not consider it yet he saw her felt her furtherhe heard her with her clear voicetry to be intensely kind with him i dont see you know what has changed she had a large strange smile weve been going on together so well and you suddenly desert me  it made him helplessly gaze you call it so well youve touches upon my soul  i call it perfectfrom my original point of view im just where i was and you must give me some better reason than you do my dear for your not being it seems to me she continued that were only right as to what has been between us so long as we do wait i dont think we wish to have behaved like fools he took in while she talked her imperturbable consistency which it was quietly queerly hopeless to see her stand there and breathe into their mild remembering air he had brought her there to be moved and she was only immoveablewhich was not moreover either because she didnt understand she understood everything and things he refused to and she had reasons deep down the sense of which nearly sickened him she had too again most of all her strange significant smile of course if its that you really know something it was quite conceivable and possible to her he could see that he did but he didnt even know what she meant and he only looked at her in gloom his gloom however didnt upset her you do i believe only youve a delicacy about saying it your delicacy to me my dear is a scruple too much i should have no delicacy in hearing it so that if you can tell me you know  well he asked as she still kept what depended on it  why then ill do what you want we neednt i grant you in that case wait and i can see what you mean by thinking it nicer of us not to i dont even ask you she continued for a proof im content with your moral certainty  by this time it had come over himit had the force of a rush the point she made was clear as clear as that the blood while he recognised it mantled in his face i know nothing whatever  youve not an idea  ive not an idea  id consent she saidid announce it tomorrow today id go home this moment and announce it to aunt maud for an idea i mean an idea straight from you i mean as your own given me in good faith there my dearand she smiled again i call that really meeting you  if it was then what she called it it disposed of his appeal and he could but stand there with his wasted passionfor it was in high passion that he had from the morning actedin his face she made it all out bent upon herthe idea he didnt have and the idea he had and his failure of insistence when it brought up that challenge and his sense of her personal presence and his horror almost of her lucidity they made in him a mixture that might have been rage but that was turning quickly to mere cold thought thought which led to something else and was like a new dim dawn it affected her then and she had one of the impulses in all sincerity that had before this between them saved their position when she had come nearer to him when putting her hand upon him she made him sink with her as she leaned to him into their old pair of chairs she prevented irresistibly she forestalled the waste of his passion she had an advantage with his passion now   iii  he had said to her in the park when challenged on it that nothing had happened to him as a cause for the demand he there made of herhappened he meant since the account he had given after his return of his recent experience but in the course of a few daysthey had brought him to christmas morninghe was conscious enough in preparing again to seek her out of a difference on that score something had in this case happened to him and after his taking the night to think of it he felt that what it most if not absolutely first involved was his immediately again putting himself in relation with her the fact itself had met him therein his own small quarterson christmas eve and had not then indeed at once affected him as implying that consequence so far as he on the spot and for the next hours took its measurea process that made his night mercilessly wakefulthe consequences possibly implied were numerous to distraction his spirit dealt with them in the darkness as the slow hours passed his intelligence and his imagination his soul and his sense had never on the whole been so intensely engaged it was his difficulty for the moment that he was face to face with alternatives and that it was scarce even a question of turning from one to the other they were not in a perspective in which they might be compared and considered they were by a strange effect as close as a pair of monsters of whom he might have felt on either cheek the hot breath and the huge eyes he saw them at once and but by looking straight before him he wouldnt for that matter in his cold apprehension have turned his head by an inch so it was that his agitation was stillwas not for the slow hours a matter of restless motion he lay long after the event on the sofa where extinguishing at a touch the white light of convenience that he hated he had thrown himself without undressing he stared at the buried day and wore out the time with the arrival of the christmas dawn moreover late and grey he felt himself somehow determined the common wisdom had had its say to himthat safety in doubt was not action and perhaps what most helped him was this very commonness in his case there was nothing of thatin no case in his life had there ever been less which association from one thing to another now worked for him as a choice he acted after his bath and his breakfast in the sense of that marked element of the rare which he felt to be the sign of his crisis and that is why dressed with more state than usual and quite as if for church he went out into the soft christmas day  action for him on coming to the point it appeared carried with it a certain complexity we should have known walking by his side that his final prime decision hadnt been to call at the door of sir luke strett and yet that this step though subordinate was none the less urgent his prime decision was for another matter to which impatience once he was on the way had now added itself but he remained sufficiently aware that he must compromise with the perhaps excessive earliness this and the ferment set up within him were together a reason for not driving to say nothing of the absence of cabs in the dusky festal desert sir lukes great square was not near but he walked the distance without seeing a hansom he had his interval thus to turn over his viewthe view to which what had happened the night before had not sharply reduced itself but the complexity just mentioned was to be offered within the next few minutes another item to assimilate before sir lukes house when he reached it a brougham was drawn upat the sight of which his heart had a lift that brought him for the instant to a stand this pause wasnt long but it was long enough to flash upon him a revelation in the light of which he caught his breath the carriage so possibly at such an hour and on such a day sir lukes own had struck him as a sign that the great doctor was back this would prove something else in turn still more intensely and it was in the act of the double apprehension that densher felt himself turn pale his mind rebounded for the moment like a projectile that has suddenly been met by another he stared at the strange truth that what he wanted more than to see kate croy was to see the witness who had just arrived from venice he wanted positively to be in his presence and to hear his voicewhich was the spasm of his consciousness that produced the flash fortunately for him on the spot there supervened something in which the flash went out he became aware within this minute that the coachman on the box of the brougham had a face known to him whereas he had never seen before to his knowledge the great doctors carriage the carriage as he came nearer was simply mrs lowders the face on the box was just the face that in coming and going at lancaster gate he would vaguely have noticed outside in attendance with this the rest came the lady of lancaster gate had on a prompting not wholly remote from his own presented herself for news and news in the house she was clearly getting since her brougham had stayed sir luke was then backonly mrs lowder was with him  it was under the influence of this last reflexion that densher again delayed and it was while he delayed that something else occurred to him it was all round visiblygiven his own new contributiona case of pressure and in a case of pressure kate for quicker knowledge might have come out with her aunt the possibility that in this event she might be sitting in the carriagethe thing most likelyhad had the effect before he could check it of bringing him within range of the window it wasnt there he had wished to see her yet if she was there he couldnt pretend not to what he had however the next moment made out was that if some one was there it wasnt kate croy it was with a sensible shock for him the person who had last offered him a conscious face from behind the clear plate of a café in venice the great glass at florians was a medium less obscure even with the window down than the air of the london christmas yet at present also none the less between the two men an exchange of recognitions could occur densher felt his own look a gaping arrestwhich he disgustedly remembered his back as quickly turned appeared to repeat itself as his special privilege he mounted the steps of the house and touched the bell with a keen consciousness of being habitually looked at by kates friend from positions of almost insolent vantage he forgot for the time the moment when in venice at the palace the encouraged young man had in a manner assisted at the departure of the disconcerted since lord mark was not looking disconcerted now any more than he had looked from his bench at his café densher was thinking that he seemed to show as vagrant while another was ensconced he was thinking of the other asin spite of the difference of situationmore ensconced than ever he was thinking of him above all as the friend of the person with whom his recognition had the minute previous associated him the man was seated in the very place in which beside mrs lowders he had looked to find kate and that was a sufficient identity meanwhile at any rate the door of the house had opened and mrs lowder stood before him it was something at least that she wasnt kate she was herself on the spot in all her affluence with presence of mind both to decide at once that lord mark in the brougham didnt matter and to prevent sir lukes butler by a firm word thrown over her shoulder from standing there to listen to her passage with the gentleman who had rung ill tell mr densher you neednt wait and the passage promptly and richly took place on the steps  he arrives travelling straight tomorrow early i couldnt not come to learn  no more said densher simply could i on my way he added to lancaster gate  sweet of you she beamed on him dimly and he saw her face was attuned it made him with what she had just before said know all and he took the thing in while he met the air of portentous of almost functional sympathy that had settled itself as her medium with him and that yet had now a fresh glow so you have had your message  he knew so well what she meant and so equally with it what he had had no less than what he hadnt that with but the smallest hesitation he strained the point yesmy message  our dear dove then as kate calls her has folded her wonderful wings  yesfolded them  it rather racked him but he tried to receive it as she intended and she evidently took his formal assent for selfcontrol unless its more true she accordingly added that she has spread them the wider  he again but formally assented though strangely enough the words fitted a figure deep in his own imagination rather yesspread them the wider  for a flight i trust to some happiness greater  exactly greater densher broke in but now with a look he feared that did a little warn her off  you were certainly she went on with more reserve entitled to direct news ours came late last night im not sure otherwise i shouldnt have gone to you but youre coming she asked to me  he had had a minute by this time to think further and the window of the brougham was still within range her rich me reaching him moreover through the mild damp had the effect of a thump on his chest squared aunt maud she was indeed squared and the extent of it just now perversely enough took away his breath his look from where they stood embraced the aperture at which the person sitting in the carriage might have shown and he saw his interlocutress on her side understand the question in it which he moreover then uttered shall you be alone it was as an immediate instinctive parley with the image of his condition that now flourished in her almost hypocritical it sounded as if he wished to come and overflow to her yet this was exactly what he didnt the need to overflow had suddenlysince the night beforedried up in him and he had never been aware of a deeper reserve  but she had meanwhile largely responded completely alone i should otherwise never have dreamed feeling dear friend but too much failing on her lips what she felt came out for him in the offered hand with which she had the next moment condolingly pressed his own dear friend dear friendshe was deeply with him and she wished to be still more so which was what made her immediately continue or wouldnt you this evening for the sad christmas it makes us dine with me têteàtête  it put the thing off the question of a talk with hermaking the difference to his relief of several hours but it also rather mystified him this however didnt diminish his need of caution shall you mind if i dont tell you at once  not in the leastleave it open it shall be as you may feel and you neednt even send me word i only will mention that today of all days i shall otherwise sit there alone  now at least he could ask without miss croy  without miss croy miss croy said mrs lowder is spending her christmas in the bosom of her more immediate family  he was afraid even while he spoke of what his face might show you mean she has left you  aunt mauds own face for that matter met the enquiry with a consciousness in which he saw a reflexion of events he was made sure by it even at the moment and as he had never been before that since he had known these two women no confessed nor commented tension no crisis of the cruder sort would really have taken form between them which was precisely a high proof of how kate had steered her boat the situation exposed in mrs lowders present expression lighted up by contrast that superficial smoothness which afterwards with his time to think of it was to put before him again the art the particular gift in the girl now so placed and classed so intimately familiar for him as her talent for life the peace within a day or twosince his seeing her lasthad clearly been broken differences deep down kept there by a diplomacy on kates part as deep had been shaken to the surface by some exceptional jar with which in addition he felt lord marks odd attendance at such an hour and season vaguely associated the talent for life indeed it at the same time struck him would probably have shown equally in the breach or whatever had occurred aunt maud having suffered he judged a strain rather than a stroke of these quick thoughts at all events that lady was already abreast she went yesterday morningand not with my approval i dont mind telling youto her sister mrs condrip if you know who i mean who lives somewhere in chelsea my other niece and her affairsthat i should have to say such things todayare a constant worry so that kate in consequencewell of eventshas simply been called in my own idea im bound to say was that with such events she need have in her situation next to nothing to do  but she differed with you  she differed with me and when kate differs with you  oh i can imagine he had reached the point in the scale of hypocrisy at which he could ask himself why a little more or less should signify besides with the intention he had had he must know kates move if he didnt know might simply disconcert him and of being disconcerted his horror was by this time fairly superstitious i hope you dont allude to events at all calamitous  noonly horrid and vulgar  oh said merton densher  mrs lowders soreness it was still not obscure had discovered in free speech to him a momentary balm theyve the misfortune to have i suppose you know a dreadful horrible father  oh said densher again  hes too bad almost to name but he has come upon marian and marian has shrieked for help  densher wondered at this with intensity and his curiosity compromised for an instant with his discretion come upon herfor money  oh for that of course always but at this blessed season for refuge for safety for god knows what hes there the brute and kates with them and that mrs lowder wound up going down the steps is her christmas  she had stopped again at the bottom while he thought of an answer yours then is after all rather better  its at least more decent and her hand once more came out but why do i talk of our troubles come if you can  he showed a faint smile thanks if i can  and nowi dare sayyoull go to church  she had asked it with her good intention rather in the air and by way of sketching for him in the line of support something a little more to the purpose than what she had been giving him he felt it as finishing off their intensities of expression that he found himself to all appearance receiving her hint as happy why yesi think i will after which as the door of the brougham at her approach had opened from within he was free to turn his back he heard the door behind him sharply close again and the vehicle move off in another direction than his own  he had in fact for the time no direction in spite of which indeed he was at the end of ten minutes aware of having walked straight to the south that he afterwards recognised was very sufficiently because there had formed itself in his mind even while aunt maud finally talked an instant recognition of his necessary course nothing was open to him but to follow kate nor was anything more marked than the influence of the step she had taken on the emotion itself that possessed him her complications which had fairly with everything else an awful soundwhat were they a thousand times over but his own his present business was to see that they didnt escape an hour longer taking their proper place in his life he accordingly would have held his course hadnt it suddenly come over him that he had just lied to mrs lowdera term it perversely eased him to keep usingeven more than was necessary to what church was he going to what church in such a state of his nerves could he gohe pulled up short again as he had pulled up in sight of mrs lowders carriage to ask it and yet the desire queerly stirred in him not to have wasted his word he was just then however by a happy chance in the brompton road and he bethought himself with a sudden light that the oratory was at hand he had but to turn the other way and he should find himself soon before it at the door then in a few minutes his idea was reallyas it struck himconsecrated he was pushing in on the edge of a splendid servicethe flocking crowd told of itwhich glittered and resounded from distant depths in the blaze of altarlights and the swell of organ and choir it didnt match his own day but it was much less of a discord than some other things actual and possible the oratory in short to make him right would do   iv  the difference was thus that the dusk of afternoondusk thick from an early hourhad gathered when he knocked at mrs condrips door he had gone from the church to his club wishing not to present himself in chelsea at luncheontime and also remembering that he must attempt independently to make a meal this in the event he but imperfectly achieved he dropped into a chair in the great dim void of the club library with nobody up or down to be seen and there after a while closing his eyes recovered an hour of the sleep he had lost during the night before doing this indeed he had writtenit was the first thing he dida short note which in the christmas desolation of the place he had managed only with difficulty and doubt to commit to a messenger he wished it carried by hand and he was obliged rather blindly to trust the hand as the messenger for some reason was unable to return with a gage of delivery when at four oclock he was face to face with kate in mrs condrips small drawingroom he found to his relief that his notification had reached her she was expectant and to that extent prepared which simplified a littleif a little at the present pass counted her conditions were vaguely vivid to him from the moment of his coming in and vivid partly by their difference a difference sharp and suggestive from those in which he had hitherto constantly seen her he had seen her but in places comparatively great in her aunts pompous house under the high trees of kensington and the storied ceilings of venice he had seen her in venice on a great occasion as the centre itself of the splendid piazza he had seen her there on a still greater one in his own poor rooms which yet had consorted with her having state and ancientry even in their poorness but mrs condrips interior even by this best view of it and though not flagrantly mean showed itself as a setting almost grotesquely inapt pale grave and charming she affected him at once as a distinguished strangera stranger to the little chelsea streetwho was making the best of a queer episode and a place of exile the extraordinary thing was that at the end of three minutes he felt himself less appointedly a stranger in it than she  a part of the queernessthis was to come to him in glimpsessprang from the air as of a general large misfit imposed on the narrow room by the scale and mass of its furniture the objects the ornaments were for the sisters clearly relics and survivals of what would in the case of mrs condrip at least have been called better days the curtains that overdraped the windows the sofas and tables that stayed circulation the chimneyornaments that reached to the ceiling and the florid chandelier that almost dropped to the floor were so many mementoes of earlier homes and so many links with their unhappy mother whatever might have been in itself the quality of these elements densher could feel the effect proceeding from them as they lumpishly blocked out the decline of the dim day to be ugly almost to the point of the sinister they failed to accommodate or to compromise they asserted their differences without tact and without taste it was truly having a sense of kates own quality thus promptly to see them in reference to it but that densher had this sense was no new thing to him nor did he in strictness need for the hour to be reminded of it he only knew by one of the tricks his imagination so constantly played him that he was so far as her present tension went very specially sorry for herwhich was not the view that had determined his start in the morning yet also that he himself would have taken it all as he might say less hard he could have lived in such a place but it wasnt given to those of his complexion so to speak to be exiled anywhere it was by their comparative grossness that they could somehow make shift his natural his inevitable his ultimate homeleft that is to itselfwasnt at all unlikely to be as queer and impossible as what was just round them though doubtless in less ample masses as he took in moreover how kate wouldnt have been in the least the creature she was if what was just round them hadnt mismatched her hadnt made for her a medium involving compunction in the spectator so by the same stroke that became the very fact of her relation with her companions there such a fact as filled him at once oddly both with assurance and with suspense if he himself on this brief vision felt her as alien and as ever so unwittingly ironic how must they not feel her and how above all must she not feel them  densher could ask himself that even after she had presently lighted the tall candles on the mantelshelf this was all their illumination but the fire and she had proceeded to it with a quiet dryness that yet left play visibly to her implication between them in their trouble and failing anything better of the presumably genial christmas hearth so far as the genial went this had in strictness given their conditions to be all their geniality he had told her in his note nothing but that he must promptly see her and that he hoped she might be able to make it possible but he understood from the first look at her that his promptitude was already having for her its principal reference i was prevented this morning in the few minutes he explained asking mrs lowder if she had let you know though i rather gathered she had and its what ive been in fact since then assuming it was because i was so struck at the moment with your having as she did tell me so suddenly come here  yes it was sudden enough very neat and fine in the contracted firelight with her hands in her lap kate considered what he had said he had spoken immediately of what had happened at sir luke stretts door she has let me know nothing but that doesnt matterif its what you mean  its part of what i mean densher said but what he went on with after a pause during which she waited was apparently not the rest of that she had had her telegram from mrs stringham late last night but to me the poor lady hasnt wired the event he added will have taken place yesterday and sir luke starting immediately one can see and travelling straight will get back tomorrow morning so that mrs stringham i judge is left to face in some solitude the situation bequeathed to her but of course he wound up sir luke couldnt stay  her look at him might have had in it a vague betrayal of the sense that he was gaining time was your telegram from sir luke  noive had no telegram  she wondered but not a letter  not from mrs stringhamno he failed again however to develop thisfor which her forbearance from another question gave him occasion from whom then had he heard he might at last confronted with her really have been gaining time and as if to show that she respected this impulse she made her enquiry different should you like to go out to herto mrs stringham  about that at least he was clear not at all shes alone but shes very capable and very courageous besides he had been going on but he dropped  besides she said theres eugenio yes of course one remembers eugenio  she had uttered the words as definitely to show them for not untender and he showed equally every reason to assent one remembers him indeed and with every ground for it hell be of the highest value to herhes capable of anything what i was going to say he went on is that some of their people from america must quickly arrive  on this as happened kate was able at once to satisfy him mr someoneorother the person principally in charge of millys affairsher first trustee i supposehad just got there at mrs stringhams last writing  ah that then was after your aunt last spoke to mei mean the last time before this morning im relieved to hear it so he said theyll do  oh theyll do and it came from each still as if it wasnt what each was most thinking of kate presently got however a step nearer to that but if you had been wired to by nobody what then this morning had taken you to sir luke  oh something elsewhich ill presently tell you its what made me instantly need to see you its what ive come to speak to you of but in a minute i feel too many things he went on at seeing you in this place he got up as he spoke she herself remained perfectly still his movement had been to the fire and leaning a little with his back to it to look down on her from where he stood he confined himself to his point is it anything very bad that has brought you  he had now in any case said enough to justify her wish for more so that passing this matter by she pressed her own challenge do you mean if i may ask that she dying her face wondering pressed it more than her words  certainly you may ask he after a moment said what has come to me is what as i say i came expressly to tell you i dont mind letting you know he went on that my decision to do this took for me last night and this morning a great deal of thinking of but here i am and he indulged in a smile that couldnt he was well aware but strike her as mechanical  she went straighter with him she seemed to show than he really went with her you didnt want to come  it would have been simple my dearand he continued to smileif it had been one way or the other only a question of wanting it took i admit it the idea of what i had best do all sorts of difficult and portentous forms it came up for me reallywell not at all for my happiness  this word apparently puzzled hershe studied him in the light of it you look upsetyouve certainly been tormented youre not well  ohwell enough  but she continued without heeding you hate what youre doing  my dear girl you simplifyand he was now serious enough it isnt so simple even as that  she had the air of thinking what it then might be i of course cant with no clue know what it is she remained none the less patient and still if at such a moment she could write you ones inevitably quite at sea one doesnt with the best will in the world understand and then as densher had a pause which might have stood for all the involved explanation that to his discouragement loomed before him you havent decided what to do  she had said it very gently almost sweetly and he didnt instantly say otherwise but he said so after a look at her oh yesi have only with this sight of you here and what i seem to see in it for you and his eyes as at suggestions that pressed turned from one part of the room to another  horrible place isnt it said kate  it brought him straight back to his enquiry is it for anything awful youve had to come  oh that will take as long to tell you as anything you may have dont mind she continued the sight of me here nor whateverwhich is more than i yet know myselfmay be in it for me and kindly consider too that after all if youre in trouble i can a little wish to help you perhaps i can absolutely even do it  my dear child its just because of the sense of your wish i suppose im in troublei suppose thats it he said this with so odd a suddenness of simplicity that she could only stare for itwhich he as promptly saw so he turned off as he could his vagueness and yet i oughtnt to be which sounded indeed vaguer still  she waited a moment is it as you say for my own business anything very awful  well he slowly replied youll tell me if you find it so i mean if you find my idea  he was so slow that she took him up awful a sound of impatiencethe form of a laughat last escaped her i cant find it anything at all till i know what youre talking about  it brought him then more to the point though it did so at first but by making him on the hearthrug before her with his hands in his pockets turn awhile to and fro there rose in him even with this movement a recall of another timethe hour in venice the hour of gloom and storm when susan shepherd had sat in his quarters there very much as kate was sitting now and he had wondered in pain even as now what he might say and mightnt yet the present occasion after all was somehow the easier he tried at any rate to attach that feeling to it while he stopped before his companion the communication i speak of cant possibly belongso far as its date is concernedto these last days the postmark which is legible does but it isnt thinkable for anything else that she wrote he dropped looking at her as if shed understand  it was easy to understand on her deathbed but kate took an instants thought arent we agreed that there was never any one in the world like her  yes and looking over her head he spoke clearly enough there was never any one in the world like her  kate from her chair always without a movement raised her eyes to the unconscious reach of his own then when the latter again dropped to her she added a question and wont it further depend a little on what the communication is  a little perhapsbut not much its a communication said densher  do you mean a letter  yes a letter addressed to me in her handin hers unmistakeably  kate thought do you know her hand very well  oh perfectly  it was as if his tone for this promptedwith a slight strangenessher next demand have you had many letters from her  no only three notes he spoke looking straight at her and very very short ones  ah said kate the number doesnt matter three lines would be enough if youre sure you remember  im sure i remember besides densher continued ive seen her hand in other ways i seem to recall how you once before she went to venice showed me one of her notes precisely for that and then she once copied me something  oh said kate almost with a smile i dont ask you for the detail of your reasons one good ones enough to which however she added as if precisely not to speak with impatience or with anything like irony and the writing has its usual look  densher answered as if even to better that description of it its beautiful  yesit was beautiful well kate to defer to him still further remarked its not news to us now that she was stupendous anythings possible  yes anythings possiblehe appeared oddly to catch at it thats what i say to myself its what ive been believing you he a trifle vaguely explained still more certain to feel  she waited for him to say more but he only with his hands in his pockets turned again away going this time to the single window of the room where in the absence of lamplight the blind hadnt been drawn he looked out into the lamplit fog lost himself in the small sordid london streetfor sordid with his other association he felt itas he had lost himself with mrs stringhams eyes on him in the vista of the grand canal it was present then to his recording consciousness that when he had last been driven to such an attitude the very depth of his resistance to the opportunity to give kate away was what had so driven him his waiting companion had on that occasion waited for him to say he would and what he had meantime glowered forth at was the inanity of such a hope kates attention on her side during these minutes rested on the back and shoulders he thus familiarly presentedrested as with a view of their expression a reference to things unimparted links still missing and that she must ever miss try to make them out as she would the result of her tension was that she again took him up you receivedwhat you spoke oflast night  it made him turn round coming in from fleet streetearlier by an hour than usuali found it with some other letters on my table but my eyes went straight to it in an extraordinary way from the door i recognised it knew what it was without touching it  one can understand she listened with respect his tone however was so singular that she presently added you speak as if all this while you hadnt touched it  oh yes ive touched it i feel as if ever since id been touching nothing else i quite firmly he pursued as if to be plainer took hold of it  then where is it  oh i have it here  and youve brought it to show me  ive brought it to show you  so he said with a distinctness that had among his other oddities almost a sound of cheer yet making no movement that matched his words she could accordingly but offer again her expectant face while his own to her impatience seemed perversely to fill with another thought but now that youve done so you feel you dont want to  i want to immensely he said only you tell me nothing  she smiled at him with this finally as if he were an unreasonable child it seems to me i tell you quite as much as you tell me you havent yet even told me how it is that such explanations as you require dont come from your document itself then as he answered nothing she had a flash you mean you havent read it  i havent read it  she stared then how am i to help you with it  again leaving her while she never budged he paced five strides and again he was before her by telling me this its something you know that you wouldnt tell me the other day  she was vague the other day  the first time after my returnthe sunday i came to you whats he doing densher went on at that hour of the morning with her what does his having been with her there mean  of whom are you talking  of that manlord mark of course what does it represent  oh with aunt maud  yes my dearand with you it comes more or less to the same thing and its what you didnt tell me the other day when i put you the question  kate tried to remember the other day you asked me nothing about any hour  i asked you when it was you last saw himprevious i mean to his second descent at venice you wouldnt say and as we were talking of a matter comparatively more important i let it pass but the fact remains you know my dear that you havent told me  two things in this speech appeared to have reached kate more distinctly than the others i wouldnt sayand you let it pass she looked just coldly blank you really speak as if i were keeping something back  well you see densher persisted youre not even telling me now all i want to know he nevertheless explained is whether there was a connexion between that proceeding on his part which was practicallyoh beyond all doubtthe shock precipitating for her what has now happened and anything that had occurred with him previously for yourself how in the world did he know were engaged   v  kate slowly rose it was since she had lighted the candles and sat down the first movement she had made are you trying to fix it on me that i must have told him  she spoke not so much in resentment as in pale dismaywhich he showed he immediately took in my dear child im not trying to fix anything but im extremely tormented and i seem not to understand what has the brute to do with us anyway  what has he indeed kate asked  she shook her head as if in recovery within the minute of some mild allowance for his unreason there was in itand for his reason reallyone of those halfinconsequent sweetnesses by which she had often before made over some point of difference her own terms with him practically she was making them now and essentially he was knowing it yet inevitably all the same he was accepting it she stood there close to him with something in her patience that suggested her having supposed when he spoke more appealingly that he was going to kiss her he hadnt been it appeared but his continued appeal was none the less the quieter whats he doing from ten oclock on christmas morning with mrs lowder  kate looked surprised didnt she tell you hes staying there  at lancaster gate denshers surprise met it stayingsince when  since day before yesterday he was there before i came away and then she explainedconfessing it in fact anomalous its an accidentlike aunt mauds having herself remained in town for christmas but it isnt after all so monstrous we stayedand with my having come here shes sorry nowbecause we neither of us waiting from day to day for the news you brought seemed to want to be with a lot of people  you stayed for thinking ofvenice  of course we did for what else and even a little kate wonderfully addedits true at least of aunt maudfor thinking of you  he appreciated i see nice of you every way but whom he enquired has lord mark stayed for thinking of  his being in london i believe is a very commonplace matter he has some rooms which he has had suddenly some rather advantageous chance to letsuch as with his confessed his decidedly proclaimed want of money he hasnt had it in him in spite of everything not to jump at  denshers attention was entire in spite of everything in spite of what  well i dont know in spite say of his being scarcely supposed to do that sort of thing  to try to get money  to try at any rate in little thrifty ways apparently however he has had for some reason to do what he can he turned at a couple of days notice out of his place making it over to his tenant and aunt maud whos deeply in his confidence about all such matters said come then to lancaster gateto sleep at leasttill like all the world you go to the country he was to have gone to the countryi think to matchamyesterday afternoon aunt maud that is told me he was  kate had been somehow for her companion through this statement beautifully quite soothingly suggestive told you you mean so that you neednt leave the house  yesso far as she had taken it into her head that his being there was part of my reason  and was it part of your reason  a little if you like yet theres plenty hereas i knew there would bewithout it so that she said candidly doesnt matter im glad i am here even if for all the good i do she implied however that that didnt matter either he didnt as you tell me get off then to matcham though he may possibly if it is possible be going this afternoon but what strikes me as most probableand its really im bound to say quite amiable of himis that he has declined to leave aunt maud as ive been so ready to do to spend her christmas alone if moreover he has given up matcham for her its a procédé that wont please her less its small wonder therefore that she insists on a dull day in driving him about i dont pretend to know she wound up what may happen between them but thats all i see in it  you see in everything and you always did densher returned something that while im with you at least i always take from you as the truth itself  she looked at him as if consciously and even carefully extracting the sting of his reservation then she spoke with a quiet gravity that seemed to show how fine she found it thank you it had for him like everything else its effect they were still closely face to face and yielding to the impulse to which he hadnt yielded just before he laid his hands on her shoulders held her hard a minute and shook her a little far from untenderly as if in expression of more mingled things all difficult than he could speak then bending his head he applied his lips to her cheek he fell after this away for an instant resuming his unrest while she kept the position in which all passive and as a statue she had taken his demonstration it didnt prevent her however from offering him as if what she had had was enough for the moment a further indulgence she made a quiet lucid connexion and as she made it sat down again ive been trying to place exactly as to its date something that did happen to me while you were in venice i mean a talk with him he spoke to mespoke out  ah there you are said densher who had wheeled round  well if im there as you so gracefully call it by having refused to meet him as he wantedas he pressedi plead guilty to being so would you have liked me she went on to give him an answer that would have kept him from going  it made him a little awkwardly think did you know he was going  never for a moment but im afraid thateven if it doesnt fit your strange suppositionsi should have given him just the same answer if i had known if its a matter i havent since your return thrust upon you thats simply because its not a matter in the memory of which i find a particular joy i hope that if ive satisfied you about it she continued its not too much to ask of you to let it rest  certainly said densher kindly ill let it rest but the next moment he pursued he saw something he guessed  if you mean she presently returned that he was unfortunately the one person we hadnt deceived i cant contradict you  noof course not but why densher still risked was he unfortunately the one person hes not really a bit intelligent  intelligent enough apparently to have seen a mystery a riddle in anything so unnatural asall things considered and when it came to the pointmy attitude so he gouged out his conviction and on his conviction he acted  densher seemed for a little to look at lord marks conviction as if it were a blot on the face of nature do you mean because you had appeared to him to have encouraged him  of course i had been decent to him otherwise where were we  where  you and i what i appeared to him however hadnt mattered what mattered was how i appeared to aunt maud besides you must remember that he has had all along his impression of you you cant help it she said but youre after allwell yourself  as much myself as you please but when i took myself to venice and kept myself therewhat densher asked did he make of that  your being in venice and liking to bewhich is never on any ones part a monstrositywas explicable for him in other ways he was quite capable moreover of seeing it as dissimulation  in spite of mrs lowder  no said kate not in spite of mrs lowder now aunt maud before what you call his second descent hadnt convinced himall the more that my refusal of him didnt help but he came back convinced and then as her companion still showed a face at a loss i mean after he had seen milly spoken to her and left her milly convinced him  milly densher again but vaguely echoed  that you were sincere that it was her you loved it came to him from her in such a way that he instantly once more turned found himself yet again at his window aunt maud on his return here she meanwhile continued had it from him and thats why youre now so well with aunt maud  he only for a minute looked out in silenceafter which he came away and why you are it was almost in its extremely affirmative effect between them the note of recrimination or it would have been perhaps rather if it hadnt been so much more the note of truth it was sharp because it was true but its truth appeared to impose it as an argument so conclusive as to permit on neither side a sequel that made while they faced each other over it without speech the gravity of everything it was as if there were almost danger which the wrong word might start densher accordingly at last acted to better purpose he drew standing there before her a pocketbook from the breast of his waistcoat and he drew from the pocketbook a folded letter to which her eyes attached themselves he restored then the receptacle to its place and with a movement not the less odd for being visibly instinctive and unconscious carried the hand containing his letter behind him what he thus finally spoke of was a different matter did i understand from mrs lowder that your fathers in the house  if it never had taken her long in such excursions to meet him it was not to take her so now in the house yes but we neednt fear his interruptionshe spoke as if he had thought of that hes in bed  do you mean with illness  she sadly shook her head fathers never ill hes a marvel hes onlyendless  densher thought can i in any way help you with him  yes she perfectly wearily almost serenely had it all by our making your visit as little of an affair as possible for himand for marian too  i see they hate so your seeing me yet i couldntcould inot have come  no you couldnt not have come  but i can only on the other hand go as soon as possible  quickly it almost upset her ah dont today put ugly words into my mouth ive enough of my trouble without it  i knowi know he spoke in instant pleading its all only that im as troubled for you when did he come  three days agoafter he hadnt been near her for more than a year after he had apparently and not regrettably ceased to remember her existence and in a state which made it impossible not to take him in  densher hesitated do you mean in such want  no not of food of necessary thingsnot even so far as his appearance went of money he looked as wonderful as ever but he waswell in terror  in terror of what  i dont know of somebodyof something he wants he says to be quiet but his quietness is awful  she suffered but he couldnt not question what does he do  it made kate herself hesitate he cries  again for a moment he hung fire but he risked it what has he done  it made her slowly rise and they were once more fully face to face her eyes held his own and she was paler than she had been if you love menowdont ask me about father  he waited again a moment i love you its because i love you that im here its because i love you that ive brought you this and he drew from behind him the letter that had remained in his hand  but her eyes onlythough he held it outmet the offer why youve not broken the seal  if i had broken the sealexactlyi should know whats within its for you to break the seal that i bring it  she lookedstill not touching the thinginordinately grave to break the seal of something to you from her  ah precisely because its from her ill abide by whatever you think of it  i dont understand said kate what do you yourself think and then as he didnt answer it seems to me i think you know you have your instinct you dont need to read its the proof  densher faced her words as if they had been an accusation an accusation for which he was prepared and which there was but one way to face i have indeed my instinct it came to me while i worried it out last night it came to me as an effect of the hour he held up his letter and seemed now to insist more than to confess this thing had been timed  for christmas eve  for christmas eve  kate had suddenly a strange smile the season of gifts after which as he said nothing she went on and had been written you mean while she could write and kept to be so timed  only meeting her eyes while he thought he again didnt reply what do you mean by the proof  why of the beauty with which youve been loved but i wont she said break your seal  you positively decline  positively never to which she added oddly i know without  he had another pause and what is it you know  that she announces to you she has made you rich  his pause this time was longer left me her fortune  not all of it no doubt for its immense but money to a large amount i dont care kate went on to know how much and her strange smile recurred i trust her  did she tell you densher asked  never kate visibly flushed at the thought that wouldnt on my part have been playing fair with her and i did she added play fair  densher who had believed herhe couldnt help itcontinued holding his letter to face her he was much quieter now as if his torment had somehow passed you played fair with me kate and thats whysince we talk of proofsi want to give you one ive wanted to let you seeand in preference even to myselfsomething i feel as sacred  she frowned a little i dont understand  ive asked myself for a tribute for a sacrifice by which i can peculiarly recognise  peculiarly recognise what she demanded as he dropped  the admirable nature of your own sacrifice you were capable in venice of an act of splendid generosity  and the privilege you offer me with that document is my reward  he made a movement its all i can do as a symbol of my attitude  she looked at him long your attitude my dear is that youre afraid of yourself youve had to take yourself in hand youve had to do yourself violence  so it is then you meet me  she bent her eyes hard a moment to the letter from which her hand still stayed itself you absolutely desire me to take it  i absolutely desire you to take it  to do what i like with it  short of course of making known its terms it must remainpardon my making the pointbetween you and me  she had a last hesitation but she presently broke it trust me taking from him the sacred script she held it a little while her eyes again rested on those fine characters of millys that they had shortly before discussed to hold it she brought out is to know  oh i know said merton densher  well then if we both do she had already turned to the fire nearer to which she had moved and with a quick gesture had jerked the thing into the flame he startedbut only halfas to undo her action his arrest was as prompt as the latter had been decisive he only watched with her the paper burn after which their eyes again met youll have it all kate said from new york  it was after he had in fact two months later heard from new york that she paid him a visit one morning at his own quarterscoming not as she had come in venice under his extreme solicitation but as a need recognised in the first instance by herself even though also as the prompt result of a missive delivered to her this had consisted of a note from densher accompanying a letter just to hand addressed him by an eminent american legal firm a firm of whose high character he had become conscious while in new york as of a thing in the air itself and whose head and front the principal executor of milly theales copious will had been duly identified at lancaster gate as the gentleman hurrying out by the straight southern course before the girls death to the support of mrs stringham denshers act on receipt of the document in questionan act as to which and to the bearings of which his resolve had had time to matureconstituted in strictness singularly enough the first reference to milly or to what milly might or might not have done that had passed between our pair since they had stood together watching the destruction in the little vulgar grate at chelsea of the undisclosed work of her hand they had at the time and in due deference now on his part to kates mention of her responsibility for his call immediately separated and when they met again the subject was made present to themat all events till some flare of new lightonly by the intensity with which it mutely expressed its absence they were not moreover in these weeks to meet often in spite of the fact that this had during january and a part of february actually become for them a comparatively easy matter kates stay at mrs condrips prolonged itself under allowances from her aunt which would have been a mystery to densher had he not been admitted at lancaster gate really in spite of himself to the esoteric view of them its her idea mrs lowder had there said to him as if she really despised ideaswhich she didnt and ive taken up with my own which is to give her her head till she has had enough of it she has had enough of it she had that soon enough but as shes as proud as the deuce shell come back when she has found some reasonhaving nothing in common with her disgustof which she can make a show she calls it her holiday which shes spending in her own waythe holiday to which once a year or so as she says the very maids in the scullery have a right so were taking it on that basis but we shall not soon i think take another of the same sort besides shes quite decent she comes oftenwhenever i make her a sign and she has been good on the whole this year or two so that to be decent myself i dont complain she has really been poor dear very much what one hoped though i neednt you know aunt maud wound up tell you after all you clever creature what that was  it had been partly in truth to keep down the opportunity for this that denshers appearances under the good ladys roof markedly after christmas interspaced themselves the phase of his situation that on his return from venice had made them for a short time almost frequent was at present quite obscured and with it the impulse that had then acted another phase had taken its place which he would have been painfully at a loss as yet to name or otherwise set on its feet but of which the steadily rising tide left mrs lowder for his desire quite high and dry there had been a moment when it seemed possible that mrs stringham returning to america under convoy would pause in london on her way and be housed with her old friend in which case he was prepared for some apparent zeal of attendance but this danger passedhe had felt it a danger and the person in the world whom he would just now have most valued seeing on his own terms sailed away westward from genoa he thereby only wrote to her having broken in this respect after millys death the silence as to the sense of which before that event their agreement had been so deep she had answered him from venice twice and had had time to answer him twice again from new york the last letter of her four had come by the same post as the document he sent on to kate but he hadnt gone into the question of also enclosing that his correspondence with millys companion was somehow already presenting itself to him as a featureas a factor he would have said in his newspaperof the time whatever it might be long or short in store for him but one of his acutest current thoughts was apt to be devoted to his not having yet mentioned it to kate she had put him no question no dont you ever hearso that he hadnt been brought to the point this he described to himself as a mercy for he liked his secret it was as a secret that in the same personal privacy he described his transatlantic commerce scarce even wincing while he recognised it as the one connexion in which he wasnt straight he had in fact for this connexion a vivid mental imagehe saw it as a small emergent rock in the waste of waters the bottomless grey expanse of straightness the fact that he had on several recent occasions taken with kate an outoftheway walk that was each time to define itself as more remarkable for what they didnt say than for what they didthis fact failed somehow to mitigate for him a strange consciousness of exposure there was something deep within him that he had absolutely shown to no oneto the companion of these walks in particular not a bit more than he could help but he was none the less haunted under its shadow with a dire apprehension of publicity it was as if he had invoked that ugliness in some stupid good faith and it was queer enough that on his emergent rock clinging to it and to susan shepherd he should figure himself as hidden from view that represented no doubt his belief in her power or in her delicate disposition to protect him only kate at all events knewwhat kate did know and she was also the last person interested to tell it in spite of which it was as if his act so deeply associated with her and never to be recalled nor recovered was abroad on the winds of the world his honesty as he viewed it with kate was the very element of that menace to the degree that he saw at moments as to their final impulse or their final remedy the need to bury in the dark blindness of each others arms the knowledge of each other that they couldnt undo  save indeed that the sense in which it was in these days a question of arms was limited this might have been the intimate expedient to which they were actually resorting it had its value in conditions that made everything count that thrice over in battersea parkwhere mrs lowder now never drovehe had adopted the usual means in sequestered alleys of holding her close to his side she could make absences on her present footing without having too inordinately to account for them at homewhich was exactly what gave them for the first time an appreciable margin he supposed she could always say in chelseathough he didnt press itthat she had been across the town in decency for a look at her aunt whereas there had always been reasons at lancaster gate for her not being able to plead the look at her other relatives it was therefore between them a freedom of a purity as yet untasted which for that matter also they made in various ways no little show of cherishing as such they made the show indeed in every way but the way of a large usean inconsequence that they almost equally gave time to helping each other to regard as natural he put it to his companion that the kind of favour he now enjoyed at lancaster gate the wonderful warmth of his reception there cut in a manner the ground from under their feet he was too horribly trustedthey had succeeded too well he couldnt in short make appointments with her without abusing aunt maud and he couldnt on the other hand haunt that lady without tying his hands kate saw what he meant just as he saw what she did when she admitted that she was herself to a degree scarce less embarrassing in the enjoyment of aunt mauds confidence it was special at presentshe was handsomely used she confessed accordingly to a scruple about misapplying her licence mrs lowder then finally had foundand all unconsciously nowthe way to baffle them it wasnt however that they didnt meet a little none the less in the southern quarter to point for their common benefit the moral of their defeat they crossed the river they wandered in neighbourhoods sordid and safe the winter was mild so that mounting to the top of trams they could rumble together to clapham or to greenwich if at the same time their minutes had never been so counted it struck densher that by a singular law their tonehe scarce knew what to call ithad never been so bland not to talk of what they might have talked of drove them to other ground it was as if they used a perverse insistence to make up what they ignored they concealed their pursuit of the irrelevant by the charm of their manner they took precautions for the courtesy they had formerly left to come of itself often when he had quitted her he stopped short walking off with the aftersense of their change he would have described their changehad he so far faced it as to describe itby their being so damned civil that had even with the intimate the familiar at the point to which they had brought them a touch almost of the droll what danger had there ever been of their becoming rudeafter each had long since made the other so tremendously tender such were the things he asked himself when he wondered what in particular he most feared  yet all the while too the tension had its charmsuch being the interest of a creature who could bring one back to her by such different roads it was her talent for life again which found in her a difference for the differing time she didnt give their tradition up she but made of it something new frankly moreover she had never been more agreeable nor in a wayto put it prosaicallybetter company he felt almost as if he were knowing her on that defined basiswhich he even hesitated whether to measure as reduced or as extended as if at all events he were admiring her as she was probably admired by people she met out he hadnt in fine reckoned that she would still have something fresh for him yet this was what she hadthat on the top of a tram in the borough he felt as if he were next her at dinner what a person she would be if they had been richwith what a genius for the socalled great life what a presence for the socalled great house what a grace for the socalled great positions he might regret at once while he was about it that they werent princes or billionaires she had treated him on their christmas to a softness that had struck him at the time as of the quality of fine velvet meant to fold thick but stretched a little thin at present however she gave him the impression of a contact multitudinous as only the superficial can be she had throughout never a word for what went on at home she came out of that and she returned to it but her nearest reference was the look with which each time she bade him goodbye the look was her repeated prohibition its what i have to see and to knowso dont touch it that but wakes up the old evil which i keep still in my way by sitting by it i go nowleave me aloneto sit by it again the way to pity meif thats what you wantis to believe in me if we could really do anything it would be another matter  he watched her when she went her way with the vision of what she thus a little stiffly carried it was confused and obscure but how with her head high it made her hold herself he really in his own person might at these moments have been swaying a little aloft as one of the objects in her poised basket it was doubtless thanks to some such consciousness as this that he felt the lapse of the weeks before the day of kates mounting of his stair almost swingingly rapid they contained for him the contradiction that whereas periods of waiting are supposed in general to keep the time slow it was the wait actually that made the pace trouble him the secret of that anomaly to be plain was that he was aware of how while the days melted something rare went with them this something was only a thought but a thought precisely of such freshness and such delicacy as made the precious of whatever sort most subject to the hunger of time the thought was all his own and his intimate companion was the last person he might have shared it with he kept it back like a favourite pang left it behind him so to say when he went out but came home again the sooner for the certainty of finding it there then he took it out of its sacred corner and its soft wrappings he undid them one by one handling them handling it as a father baffled and tender might handle a maimed child but so it was before himin his dread of who else might see it then he took to himself at such hours in other words that he should never never know what had been in millys letter the intention announced in it he should but too probably know only that would have been but for the depths of his spirit the least part of it the part of it missed for ever was the turn she would have given her act this turn had possibilities that somehow by wondering about them his imagination had extraordinarily filled out and refined it had made of them a revelation the loss of which was like the sight of a priceless pearl cast before his eyeshis pledge given not to save itinto the fathomless sea or rather even it was like the sacrifice of something sentient and throbbing something that for the spiritual ear might have been audible as a faint far wail this was the sound he cherished when alone in the stillness of his rooms he sought and guarded the stillness so that it might prevail there till the inevitable sounds of life once more comparatively coarse and harsh should smother and deaden itdoubtless by the same process with which they would officiously heal the ache in his soul that was somehow one with it it moreover deepened the sacred hush that he couldnt complain he had given poor kate her freedom  the great and obvious thing as soon as she stood there on the occasion we have already named was that she was now in high possession of it this would have marked immediately the differencehad there been nothing else to do itbetween their actual terms and their other terms the character of their last encounter in venice that had been his idea whereas her present step was her own the few marks they had in common were from the first moment to his conscious vision almost pathetically plain she was as grave now as before she looked around her to hide it as before she pretended as before in an air in which her words at the moment itself fell flat to an interest in the place and a curiosity about his things there was a recall in the way in which after she had failed a little to push up her veil symmetrically and he had said she had better take it off altogether she had acceded to his suggestion before the glass it was just these things that were vain and what was real was that his fancy figured her after the first few minutes as literally now providing the element of reassurance which had previously been his care it was she supremely who had the presence of mind she made indeed for that matter very prompt use of it you see ive not hesitated this time to break your seal  she had laid on the table from the moment of her coming in the long envelope substantially filled which he had sent her enclosed in another of still ampler make he had however not looked at ithis belief being that he wished never again to do so besides which it had happened to rest with its addressed side up so he saw nothing and it was only into her eyes that her remark made him look declining any approach to the object indicated its not my seal my dear and my intentionwhich my note tried to expresswas all to treat it to you as not mine  do you mean that its to that extent mine then  well let us call it if we like theirsthat of the good people in new york the authors of our communication if the seal is broken well and good but we might you know he presently added have sent it back to them intact and inviolate only accompanied he smiled with his heart in his mouth by an absolutely kind letter  kate took it with the mere brave blink with which a patient of courage signifies to the exploring medical hand that the tender place is touched he saw on the spot that she was prepared and with this signal sign that she was too intelligent not to be came a flicker of possibilities she wasmerely to put it at thatintelligent enough for anything is it what youre proposing we should do  ah its too late to do itwell ideally now with that sign that we know  but you dont know she said very gently  i refer he went on without noticing it to what would have been the handsome way its being dispatched again with no cognisance taken but ones assurance of the highest consideration and the proof of this in the state of the envelopethat would have been really satisfying  she thought an instant the state of the envelope proving refusal you mean not to be based on the insufficiency of the sum  densher smiled again as for the play however whimsical of her humour well yessomething of that sort  so that if cognisance has been takenso far as im concernedit spoils the beauty  it makes the difference that im disappointed in the hopewhich i confess i entertainedthat youd bring the thing back to me as you had received it  you didnt express that hope in your letter  i didnt want to i wanted to leave it to yourself i wantedoh yes if thats what you wish to ask meto see what youd do  you wanted to measure the possibilities of my departure from delicacy  he continued steady now a kind of easefrom the presence as in the air of something he couldnt yet have namedhad come to him well i wantedin so good a caseto test you  she was struckit showed in her faceby his expression it is a good case i doubt whether a better she said with her eyes on him has ever been known  the better the case then the better the test  how do you know she asked in reply to this what im capable of  i dont my dear only with the seal unbroken i should have known sooner  i seeshe took it in but i myself shouldnt have known at all and you wouldnt have known either what i do know  let me tell you at once he returned that if youve been moved to correct my ignorance i very particularly request you not to  she just hesitated are you afraid of the effect of the corrections can you only do it by doing it blindly  he waited a moment what is it that you speak of my doing  why the only thing in the world that i take you as thinking of not acceptingwhat she has done isnt there some regular name in such cases not taking up the bequest  theres something you forget in it he said after a moment my asking you to join with me in doing so  her wonder but made her softer yet at the same time didnt make her less firm how can i join in a matter with which ive nothing to do  how by a single word  and what word  your consent to my giving up  my consent has no meaning when i cant prevent you  you can perfectly prevent me understand that well he said  she seemed to face a threat in it you mean you wont give up if i dont consent  yes i do nothing  that as i understand is accepting  densher paused i do nothing formal  you wont i suppose you mean touch the money  i wont touch the money  it had a soundthough he had been coming to itthat made for gravity who then in such an event will  any one who wants or who can  again a little she said nothing she might say too much but by the time she spoke he had covered ground how can i touch it but through you  you cant any more he added than i can renounce it except through you  oh ever so much less theres nothing she explained in my power  im in your power merton densher said  in what way  in the way i showand the way ive always shown when have i shown he asked as with a sudden cold impatience anything else you surely must feelso that you neednt wish to appear to spare me in ithow you have me  its very good of you my dear she nervously laughed to put me so thoroughly up to it  i put you up to nothing i didnt even put you up to the chance that as i said a few moments ago i saw for you in forwarding that thing your liberty is therefore in every way complete  it had come to the point really that they showed each other pale faces and that all the unspoken between them looked out of their eyes in a dim terror of their further conflict something even rose between them in one of their short silencessomething that was like an appeal from each to the other not to be too true their necessity was somehow before them but which of them must meet it first thank you kate said for his word about her freedom but taking for the minute no further action on it it was blest at least that all ironies failed them and during another slow moment their very sense of it cleared the air  there was an effect of this in the way he soon went on you must intensely feel that its the thing for which we worked together  she took up the remark however no more than if it were commonplace she was already again occupied with a point of her own is it absolutely truefor if it is you know its tremendously interestingthat you havent so much as a curiosity about what she has done for you  would you like he asked my formal oath on it  nobut i dont understand it seems to me in your place  ah he couldnt help breaking in what do you know of my place pardon me he at once added my preference is the one i express  she had in an instant nevertheless a curious thought but wont the facts be published  publishedhe winced  i mean wont you see them in the papers  ah never i shall know how to escape that  it seemed to settle the subject but she had the next minute another insistence your desire is to escape everything  everything  and do you need no more definite sense of what it is you ask me to help you to renounce  my sense is sufficient without being definite im willing to believe that the amount of moneys not small  ah there you are she exclaimed  if she was to leave me a remembrance he quietly pursued it would inevitably not be meagre  kate waited as for how to say it its worthy of her its what she was herselfif you remember what we once said that was  he hesitatedas if there had been many things but he remembered one of them stupendous  stupendous a faint smile for itever so smallhad flickered in her face but had vanished before the omen of tears a little less uncertain had shown themselves in his own his eyes filledbut that made her continue she continued gently i think that what it really is must be that youre afraid i mean she explained that youre afraid of all the truth if youre in love with her without it what indeed can you be more and youre afraidits wonderfulto be in love with her  i never was in love with her said densher  she took it but after a little she met it i believe that nowfor the time she lived i believe it at least for the time you were there but your change cameas it might wellthe day you last saw her she died for you then that you might understand her from that hour you did with which kate slowly rose and i do now she did it for us densher rose to face her and she went on with her thought i used to call her in my stupidityfor want of anything bettera dove well she stretched out her wings and it was to that they reached they cover us  they cover us densher said  thats what i give you kate gravely wound up thats what ive done for you  his look at her had a slow strangeness that had dried on the moment his tears do i understand then  that i do consent she gravely shook her head nofor i see youll marry me without the money you wont marry me with it if i dont consent you dont  you lose me he showed though naming it frankly a sort of awe of her high grasp well you lose nothing else i make over to you every penny  prompt was his own clearness but she had no smile this time to spare preciselyso that i must choose  you must choose  strange it was for him then that she stood in his own rooms doing it while with an intensity now beyond any that had ever made his breath come slow he waited for her act theres but one thing that can save you from my choice  from your choice of my surrender to you  yesand she gave a nod at the long envelope on the tableyour surrender of that  what is it then  your word of honour that youre not in love with her memory  ohher memory  ahshe made a high gesturedont speak of it as if you couldnt be i could in your place and youre one for whom it will do her memorys your love you want no other  he heard her out in stillness watching her face but not moving then he only said ill marry you mind you in an hour  as we were  as we were  but she turned to the door and her headshake was now the end we shall never be again as we were   the end    the riverside press  cambridge  massachusetts  u  s  a
