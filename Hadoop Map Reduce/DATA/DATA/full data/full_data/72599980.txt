a stately lady and has presented me  we have exchanged the customary commonplaces and she i feel is waiting for me to say something clever original and tactful  and i dont know whether she is presbyterian or mormon a protectionist or a free trader whether she is engaged to be married or has lately been divorced  a friend of mine adopts the sensible plan of always providing you with a short history of the person to whom he is about to lead you  i want to introduce you to a mrs jones he whispers  clever woman  wrote a book two years ago  forget the name of it something about twins  keep

dying to know her  wants to talk about your book he explains  disagrees with you entirely on the subject of platonic friendship  sure youll be able to convince him  it saves us both a deal of trouble  i start at once on platonic friendship and ask her questions about twins avoiding sausages and coke  she thinks me an unusually interesting man and i am less bored than otherwise i might be  i have sometimes thought it would be a serviceable device if in society we all of us wore a neat cardpinned say upon our back setting forth such information as was necessary our name legibly written and how to be pronounced our age not necessarily in good faith but for purposes of conversation  once i seriously hurt a german lady by demanding of her information about the francogerman war  she looked to me as if she could not object to being taken for forty  it turned out she was thirtyseven  had i not been an englishman i might have had to fight a duel our religious and political beliefs together with a list of the subjects we were most at home upon and a few facts concerning our careersufficient to save the stranger from what is vulgarly termed putting his foot in it  before making jokes about dumping or discussing the question of chinese cheap labour one would glance behind and note whether ones companion was ticketed wholehogger or proboer  guests desirous of agreeable partnersan agreeable person according to the late lord beaconsfields definition being a person who agrees with youcould make their own selection  excuse me  would you mind turning round a minute  ah wagnerian crank  i am afraid we should not get on together i prefer the italian school  or how delightful  i see you dont believe in vaccination  may i take you into supper  those on the other hand fond of argument would choose a suitable opponent  a master of ceremonies might be provided who would stand in the centre of the room and call for partners  lady with strong views in favour of female franchise wishes to meet gentleman holding the opinions of st paul  with view to argument  an american lady a year or two ago wrote me a letter that did me real good  she appreciated my work with so much understanding criticised it with such sympathetic interest  she added that when in england the summer before she had been on the point of accepting an invitation to meet me but at the last moment she had changed her mind she felt so sureshe put it pleasantly but this is what it came tothat in my own proper person i should fall short of her expectations  for my own sake i felt sorry she had cried off it would have been worth something to have met so sensible a woman  an author introduced to people who have reador who say that they have readhis books feels always like a man taken for the first time to be shown to his future wifes relations  they are very pleasant they try to put him at his ease  but he knows instinctively they are disappointed with him  i remember when a very young man attending a party at which a famous american humorist was the chief guest  i was standing close behind a lady who was talking to her husband  he doesnt look a bit funny said the lady  great scott answered her husband  how did you expect him to look  did you think he would have a red nose and a patch over one eye  oh well he might look funnier than that anyhow retorted the lady highly dissatisfied  it isnt worth coming for  we all know the story of the hostess who leaning across the table during the dessert requested of the funny man that he would kindly say something amusing soon because the dear children were waiting to go to bed  children i suppose have no use for funny people who dont choose to be funny  i once invited a friend down to my house for a saturday to monday  he is an entertaining man and before he came i dilated on his powers of humoursomewhat foolishly perhaps in the presence of a certain youthful person who resides with me and who listens when she oughtnt to and never when she ought  he happened not to be in a humorous mood that evening  my young relation after dinner climbed upon my knee  for quite five minutes she sat silent  then she whispered  has he said anything funny  hush  no not yet dont be silly  five minutes later  was that funny  no of course not  why not  becausecant you hear  we are talking about old age pensions  whats that  oh itsoh never mind now  it isnt a subject on which one can be funny  then whats he want to talk about it for  she waited for another quarter of an hour  then evidently bored and much to my relief suggested herself that she might as well go to bed  she ran to me the next morning in the garden with an air of triumph  he said something so funny last night she told me  oh what was it i inquired  it seemed to me i must have missed it  well i cant exactly member it she explained not just at the moment  but it was so funny  i dreamed it you know  for folks not lions but closely related to lions introductions must be trying ordeals  you tell them that for years you have been yearning to meet them  you assure them in a voice trembling with emotion that this is indeed a privilege  you go on to add that when a boy   at this point they have to interrupt you to explain that they are not the mr soandso but only his cousin or his grandfather and all you can think of to say is  oh im so sorry  i had a nephew who was once the amateur longdistance bicycle champion  i have him still but he is stouter and has come down to a motor car  in sporting circles i was always introduced as shorlands uncle  closecropped young men would gaze at me with rapture and then inquire  and do you do anything yourself mr jerome  but my case was not so bad as that of a friend of mine a doctor  he married a leading actress and was known ever afterwards as miss b s husband  at public dinners where one takes ones seat for the evening next to someone that one possibly has never met before and is never likely to meet again conversation is difficult and dangerous  i remember talking to a lady at a vagabond club dinner  she asked me during the entreewith a light laugh as i afterwards recalledwhat i thought candidly of the last book of a certain celebrated authoress  i told her and a coldness sprang up between us  she happened to be the certain celebrated authoress she had changed her place at the last moment so as to avoid sitting next to another lady novelist whom she hated  one has to shift oneself sometimes on these occasions  a newspaper man came up to me last ninth of november at the mansion house  would you mind changing seats with me he asked  its a bit awkward  theyve put me next to my first wife  i had a troubled evening myself once long ago  i accompanied a young widow lady to a musical at home given by a lady who had more acquaintances than she knew  we met the butler at the top of the stairs  my friend spoke first  say mrs dash and  the butler did not wait for morehe was a youngish manbut shouted out  mr and mrs dash  my dear how very quiet you have kept cried our hostess delighted do let me congratulate you  the crush was too great and our hostess too distracted at the moment for any explanations  we were swept away and both of us spent the remainder of the evening feebly protesting our singleness  if it had happened on the stage it would have taken us the whole play to get out of it  stage people are not allowed to put things right when mistakes are made with their identity  if the light comedian is expecting a plumber the first man that comes into the drawingroom has got to be a plumber  he is not allowed to point out that he never was a plumber that he doesnt look like a plumber that no one not an idiot would mistake him for a plumber  he has got to be shut up in the bathroom and have water poured over him just as if he were a plumbera stage plumber that is  not till right away at the end of the last act is he permitted to remark that he happens to be the new curate  i sat out a play once at which most people laughed  it made me sad a dear old lady entered towards the end of the first act  we knew she was the aunt  nobody can possibly mistake the stage auntexcept the people on the stage  they of course mistook her for a circus rider and shut her up in a cupboard  it is what cupboards seem to be reserved for on the stage  nothing is ever put in them excepting the heros relations  when she wasnt in the cupboard she was in a clothes basket or tied up in a curtain  all she need have done was to hold on to something while remarking to the hero  if youll stop shouting and jumping about for just ten seconds and give me a chance to observe that i am your maiden aunt from devonshire all this tomfoolery can be avoided  that would have ended it  as a matter of fact that did end it five minutes past eleven  it hadnt occurred to her to say it before  in real life i never knew but of one case where a man suffered in silence unpleasantness he could have ended with a word and that was the case of the late corney grain  he had been engaged to give his entertainment at a country house  the lady was a nouvelle riche of snobbish instincts  she left instructions that corney grain when he arrived was to dine with the servants  the butler who knew better apologised but corney was a man not easily disconcerted  he dined well and after dinner rose and addressed the assembled company  well now my good friends said corney if we have all finished and if you are all agreeable i shall be pleased to present to you my little show  the servants cheered  the piano was dispensed with  corney contrived to amuse his audience very well for halfanhour without it  at ten oclock came down a message  would mr corney grain come up into the drawingroom  corney went  the company in the drawing room were waiting seated  we are ready mr grain remarked the hostess  ready for what demanded corney  for your entertainment answered the hostess  but i have given it already explained corney and my engagement was for one performance only  given it  where  when  an hour ago downstairs  but this is nonsense exclaimed the hostess  it seemed to me somewhat unusual corney replied but it has always been my privilege to dine with the company i am asked to entertain  i took it you had arranged a little treat for the servants  and corney left to catch his train  another entertainer told me the following story although a joke against himself  he and corney grain were sharing a cottage on the river  a man called early one morning to discuss affairs and was talking to corney in the parlour which was on the ground floor  the window was open  the other entertainerthe man who told me the storywas dressing in the room above  thinking he recognised the voice of the visitor below he leant out of his bedroom window to hear better  he leant too far and dived head foremost into a bed of flowers his bare legsand only his bare legsshowing through the open window of the parlour  good gracious exclaimed the visitor turning at the moment and seeing a pair of wriggling legs above the window sill whos that  corney fixed his eyeglass and strolled to the window  oh its only whatshisname he explained  wonderful spirits can be funny in the morning    should women be beautiful    pretty women are going to have a hard time of it later on  hitherto they have had things far too much their own way  in the future there are going to be no pretty girls for the simple reason there will be no plain girls against which to contrast them  of late i have done some systematic reading of ladies papers  the plain girl submits to a course of treatment  in eighteen months she bursts upon society an acknowledged beauty  and it is all done by kindness  one girl writes  only a little while ago i used to look at myself in the glass and cry  now i look at myself and laugh  the letter is accompanied by two photographs of the young lady  i should have cried myself had i seen her as she was at first  she was a stumpy flatheaded squatnosed crosseyed thing  she did not even look good  one virtue she appears to have had however  it was faith  she believed what the label said she did what the label told her  she is now a tall ravishing young person her only trouble being i should say to know what to do with her hairit reaches to her knees and must be a nuisance to her  she would do better to give some of it away  taking this young lady as a text it means that the girl who declines to be a dream of loveliness does so out of obstinacy  what the raw material may be does not appear to matter provided no feature is absolutely missing the result is one and the same  arrived at years of discretion the maiden proceeds to choose the style of beauty she prefers  will she be a juno a venus or a helen  will she have a grecian nose or one tiptilted like the petal of a rose  let her try the tiptilted style first  the professor has an idea it is going to be fashionable  if afterwards she does not like it there will be time to try the grecian  it is difficult to decide these points without experiment  would the lady like a high or a low forehead  some ladies like to look intelligent  it is purely a matter of taste  with the grecian nose the low broad forehead perhaps goes better  it is more according to precedent  on the other hand the high brainy forehead would be more original  it is for the lady herself to select  we come to the question of eyes  the lady fancies a delicate blue not too pronounced a colourone of those useful shades that go with almost everything  at the same time there should be depth and passion  the professor understands exactly the sort of eye the lady means  but it will be expensive  there is a cheap quality the professor does not recommend it  true that it passes muster by gaslight but the sunlight shows it up  it lacks tenderness and at the price you can hardly expect it to contain much hidden meaning the professor advises the melting ohgeorgetakemeinyourarms andstillmyfoolishfears brand  it costs a little more but it pays for itself in the end  perhaps it will be best now the eye has been fixed upon to discuss the question of the hair  the professor opens his book of patterns maybe the lady is of a wilful disposition  she loves to run laughing through the woods during exceptionally rainy weather or to gallop across the downs without a hat her fair ringlets streaming in the wind the old family coachman panting and expostulating in the rear if one may trust the popular novel extremely satisfactory husbands have often been secured in this way  you naturally look at a girl who is walking through a wood laughing heartily apparently for no other reason than because it is rainingwho rides at stretch gallop without a hat  if you have nothing else to do you follow her  it is always on the cards that such a girl may do something really amusing before she gets home  thus things begin  to a girl of this kind naturally curly hair is essential  it must be the sort of hair that looks better when it is soaking wet  the bottle of stuff that makes this particular hair to grow may be considered dear if you think merely of the price  but that is not the way to look at it  what is it going to do for me  that is what the girl has got to ask herself  it does not do to spoil the ship for a haporth of tar as the saying is  if you are going to be a dashing wilful beauty you must have the hair for it or the whole scheme falls to the ground  eyebrows and eyelashes the professor assumes the lady would like to match the hair  too much eccentricity the professor does not agree with  nature after all is the best guide neatness combined with taste that is the ideal to be aimed at  the eyebrows should be almost straight the professor thinks the eyelashes long and silky with just the suspicion of a curl  the professor would also suggest a little less cheekbone  cheekbones are being worn low this season  will the lady have a dimpled chin or does she fancy the squarecut jaw  maybe the squarecut jaw and the firm sweet mouth are more suitable for the married woman  they go well enough with the baby and the teaurn and the strong proud man in the background  for the unmarried girl the dimpled chin and the rosebud mouth are perhaps on the whole safer  some gentlemen are so nervous of that firm square jaw  for the present at all events let us keep to the rosebud and the dimple  complexion  well there is only one complexion worth consideringa creamy white relieved by delicate peach pink  it goes with everything and is always effective  rich olives striking pallors yes you hear of these things doing well  the professors experience however is that for allround work you will never improve upon the plain white and pink  it is less liable to get out of order and is the easiest at all times to renew  for the figure the professor recommends something lithe and supple five foot four is a good height but that is a point that should be discussed first with the dressmaker  for trains five foot six is perhaps preferable  but for the sporting girl who has to wear short frocks that height would of course be impossible  the bust and the waist are also points on which the dressmaker should be consulted  nothing should be done in a hurry  what is the fashion going to be for the next two or three seasons  there are styles demanding that beginning at the neck you should curve out like a pouter pigeon  there is apparently no difficulty whatever in obtaining this result  but if crinolines for instance are likely to come in again  the lady has only to imagine it for herself  the effect might be grotesque suggestive of a walking hourglass  so too with the waist  for some fashions it is better to have it just a foot from the neck  at other times it is more useful lower down the lady will kindly think over these details and let the professor know  while one is about it one may as well make a sound job  it is all so simple and when you come to think of it really not expensive  age apparently makes no difference  a woman is as old as she looks  in future i take it there will be no ladies over fiveandtwenty  wrinkles  why any lady should still persist in wearing them is a mystery to me  with a moderate amount of care any middleclass woman could save enough out of the housekeeping money in a month to get rid of every one of them  grey hair  well of course if you cling to grey hair there is no more to be said  but to ladies who would just as soon have rich wavybrown or a delicate shade of gold i would point out that there are one hundred and fortyseven inexpensive lotions on the market any one of which rubbed gently into the head with a toothbrush not too hard just before going to bed will to use a colloquialism do the trick  are you too stout or are you too thin  all you have to do is to say which and enclose stamps  but do not make a mistake and send for the wrong recipe  if you are already too thin you might in consequence suddenly disappear before you found out your mistake one very stout lady i knew worked at herself for eighteen months and got stouter every day  this discouraged her so much that she gave up trying  no doubt she had made a muddle and had sent for the wrong bottle but she would not listen to further advice  she said she was tired of the whole thing  in future years there will be no need for a young man to look about him for a wife he will take the nearest girl tell her his ideal and if she really care for him she will go to the shop and have herself fixed up to his pattern  in certain eastern countries i believe something of this kind is done  a gentleman desirous of adding to his family sends round the neighbourhood the weight and size of his favourite wife hinting that if another can be found of the same proportions there is room for her  fathers walk round among their daughters choose the most likely specimen and have her fattened up  that is their brutal eastern way  out west we shall be more delicate  matchmaking mothers will probably revive the old confession book  eligible bachelors will be invited to fill in a page  your favourite height in women your favourite measurement round the waist do you like brunettes or blondes  the choice will be left to the girls  i do think henry william just too sweet for words the maiden of the future will murmur to herself  gently coyly she will draw from him his ideal of what a woman should be  in from six months to a year she will burst upon him the perfect she height size weight right to a t  he will clasp her in his arms  at last he will cry i have found her the woman of my dreams  and if he does not change his mind and the bottles do not begin to lose their effect there will be every chance that they will be happy ever afterwards  might not science go even further  why rest satisfied with making a world of merely beautiful women  cannot science while she is about it make them all good at the same time  i do not apologise for the suggestion  i used to think all women beautiful and good  it is their own papers that have disillusioned me  i used to look at this lady or at thatshyly when nobody seemed to be noticing meand think how fair she was how stately  now i only wonder who is her chemist  they used to tell me when i was a little boy that girls were made of sugar and spice  i know better now  i have read the recipes in the answers to correspondents  when i was quite a young man i used to sit in dark corners and listen with swelling heart while people at the piano told me where little girl babies got their wonderful eyes from of the things they did to them in heaven that gave them dimples  ah me  i wish now i had never come across those ladies papers  i know the stuff that causes those bewitching eyes  i know the shop where they make those dimples i have passed it and looked in  i thought they were produced by angels kisses but there was not an angel about the place that i could see  perhaps i have also been deceived as regards their goodness  maybe all women are not so perfect as in the popular short story they appear to be  that is why i suggest that science should proceed still further and make them all as beautiful in mind as she is now able to make them in body  may we not live to see in the advertisement columns of the ladies paper of the future the portrait of a young girl sulking in a cornerbefore taking the lotion  the same girl dancing among her little brothers and sisters shedding sunlight through the homeafter the three first bottles  may we not have the caudle mixture  one tablespoonful at bedtime guaranteed to make the lady murmur goodnight dear hope youll sleep well and at once to fall asleep her lips parted in a smile  maybe some specialist of the future will advertise mind massage  warranted to remove from the most obstinate subject all traces of hatred envy and malice  and when science has done everything possible for women there might be no harm in her turning her attention to us men  her idea at present seems to be that we men are too beautiful physically and morally to need improvement  personally there are one or two points about which i should like to consult her    when is the best time to be merry    there is so much i could do to improve things generally in and about europe if only i had a free hand  i should not propose any great fundamental changes  these poor people have got used to their own ways it would be unwise to reform them all at once  but there are many little odds and ends that i could do for them so many of their mistakes i could correct for them  they do not know this  if they only knew there was a man living in their midst willing to take them in hand and arrange things for them how glad they would be  but the story is always the same  one reads it in the advertisements of the matrimonial column  a lady young said to be goodlookingshe herself is not sure on the point she feels that possibly she may be prejudiced she puts before you merely the current gossip of the neighbourhood people say she is beautiful they may be right they may be wrong  it is not for her to decidewelleducated of affectionate disposition possessed of means desires to meet gentleman with a view to matrimony  immediately underneath one reads of a gentleman of twentyeight tall fair considered agreeable  really the modesty of the matrimonial advertiser teaches to us ordinary mortals quite a beautiful lesson  i know instinctively that were anybody to ask me suddenly  do you call yourself an agreeable man i should answer promptly  an agreeable man  of course im an agreeable man  what silly questions you do ask  if he persisted in arguing the matter saying  but there are people who do not consider you an agreeable man  i should get angry with him  oh they think that do they i should say  well you tell them from me with my compliments that they are a set of blithering idiots  not agreeable  you show me the man who says im not agreeable  ill soon let him know whether im agreeable or not  these young men seeking a wife are silent on the subject of their own virtues  such are for others to discover  the matrimonial advertiser confines himself to a simple statement of fact  he is considered agreeable  he is domestically inclined and in receipt of a good income  he is desirous of meeting a lady of serious disposition with view to matrimony  if possessed of meanswell it is a trifle hardly worth considering one way or the other  he does not insist upon it on the other hand he does not exclude ladies of means the main idea is matrimony  it is sad to reflect upon a young lady said to be goodlooking let us say goodlooking and be done with it  a neighbourhood does not rise up and declare a girl goodlooking if she is not goodlooking that is only her modest way of putting it let us say a young lady goodlooking welleducated of affectionate dispositionit is undeniably sad to reflect that such an one matrimonially inclined should be compelled to have recourse to the columns of a matrimonial journal  what are the young men in the neighbourhood thinking of what more do they want  is it venus come to life again with ten thousand a year that they are waiting for  it makes me angry with my own sex reading these advertisements  and when one thinks of the girls that do get married  but life is a mystery  the fact remains  here is the ideal wife seeking in vain for a husband  and here immediately underneathi will not say the ideal husband he may have faults none of us are perfect but as men go a decided acquisition to any domestic hearth an agreeable gentleman fond of home life none of your gadabouts calls aloud to the four winds for a wifeany sort of a wife provided she be of a serious disposition  in his despair he has grown indifferent to all other considerations  is there in this world he has said to himself one unmarried woman willing to marry me an agreeable man in receipt of a good income  possibly enough this twain have passed one another in the street have sat side by side in the same tramcar never guessing each one that the other was the very article of which they were in want to make life beautiful  mistresses in search of a servant not so much with the idea of getting work out of her rather with the object of making her happy advertise on one page  on the opposite page domestic treasures disciples of carlyle apparently with a passionate love of work for its own sakeare seeking situations not so much with the desire of gain as with the hope of finding openings where they may enjoy the luxury of feeling they are leading useful lives  these philanthropic mistresses these toilloving handmaidens have lived side by side in the same town for years never knowing one another  so it is with these poor european peoples  they pass me in the street  they do not guess that i am ready and willing to take them under my care to teach them common sense with a smattering of intelligenceto be as one might say a father to them  they look at me  there is nothing about me to tell them that i know what is good for them better than they do themselves  in the fairy tales the wise man wore a conical hat and a long robe with twiddly things all round the edge  you knew he was a clever man  it avoided the necessity of explanation  unfortunately the fashion has gone out we wise men have to wear just ordinary clothes  nobody knows we are wise men  even when we tell them so they dont believe it  this it is that makes our task the more difficult  one of the first things i should take in hand were european affairs handed over to my control would be the rearrangement of the carnival  as matters are the carnival takes place all over europe in february  at nice in spain or in italy it may be occasionally possible to feel you want to dance about the streets in thin costume during february  but in more northern countries during carnival time i have seen only one sensible masker he was a man who had got himself up as a diver  it was in antwerp  the rain was pouring down in torrents a cheery boisterous john bull sort of an east wind was blustering through the streets at the rate of fifteen miles an hour pierrots with frozen hands were blowing blue noses  an elderly cupid had borrowed an umbrella from a cafe and was waiting for a tram  a very little devil was crying with the cold and wiping his eyes with the end of his own tail  every doorway was crowded with shivering maskers  the diver alone walked erect the water streaming from him  february is not the month for open air masquerading  the confetti which has come to be nothing but coloured paper cut into small discs is a sodden mass  when a lump of it strikes you in the eye your instinct is not to laugh gaily but to find out the man who threw it and to hit him back  this is not the true spirit of carnival  the marvel is that in spite of the almost invariably adverse weather these carnivals still continue  in belgium where romanism still remains the dominant religion carnival maintains itself stronger than elsewhere in northern europe  at one small town binche near the french border it holds uninterrupted sway for three days and two nights during which time the whole of the population swelled by visitors from twenty miles round shouts romps eats and drinks and dances  after which the visitors are packed like sardines into railway trains  they pin their tickets to their coats and promptly go to sleep  at every station the railway officials stumble up and down the trains with lanterns  the last feeble effort of the more wakeful reveller before he adds himself to the heap of snoring humanity on the floor of the railway carriage is to change the tickets of a couple of his unconscious companions  in this way gentlemen for the east are dragged out by the legs at junctions and packed into trains going west while southern fathers are shot out in the chill dawn at lonely northern stations to find themselves greeted with enthusiasm by other peoples families  at binche they sayi have not counted them myselfthat thirty thousand maskers can be seen dancing at the same time  when they are not dancing they are throwing oranges at one another  the houses board up their windows  the restaurants take down their mirrors and hide away the glasses  if i went masquerading at binche i should go as a man in armour period henry the seventh  doesnt it hurt i asked a lady who had been there having oranges thrown at you  which sort do they use speaking generally those fine juicy onesjavas i think you call themor the little hard brand with skins like a nutmeggrater  and if both sorts are used indiscriminately which do you personally prefer  the smart people she answered they are the same everywherethey must be extravagantthey use the java orange  if it hits you in the back i prefer the java orange  it is more messy than the other but it does not leave you with that curious sensation of having been temporarily stunned  most people of course make use of the small hard orange  if you duck in time and so catch it on the top of your head it does not hurt so much as you would think  if however it hits you on a tender placewell myself i always find that a little sal volatile with old cognachalf and half you understandis about the best thing  but it only happens once a year she added  nearly every town gives prizes for the best group of maskers  in some cases the first prize amounts to as much as two hundred pounds the butchers the bakers the candlestick makers join together and compete  they arrive in wagons each group with its band  free trade is encouraged  each neighbouring town and village dumps its load of picturesque merrymakers  it is in these smaller towns that the spirit of king carnival finds happiest expression  almost every third inhabitant takes part in the fun  in brussels and the larger towns the thing appears ridiculous a few hundred maskers force their way with difficulty through thousands of dullclad spectators looking like a spanish river in the summer time a feeble stream dribbling through acres of muddy bank  at charleroi the centre of the belgian black country the chief feature of the carnival is the dancing of the children  a space is specially roped off for them  if by chance the sun is kind enough to shine the sight is a pretty one  how they love the dressing up and the acting these small mites  one young hussyshe could hardly have been more than ten was gotten up as a haughty young lady  maybe some elder sister had served as a model  she wore a tremendous wig of flaxen hair a hat that i guarantee would have made its mark even at ascot on the cup day a skirt that trailed two yards behind her a pair of what had once been white kid gloves and a blue silk parasol  dignity  i have seen the offended barmaid i have met the chorus girlnot by appointment please dont misunderstand me merely as a spectatorup the river on sunday  but never have i witnessed in any human being so much hauteur to the pound avoirdupois as was carried through the streets of charleroi by that small brat  companions of other days mere vulgar boys and girls claimed acquaintance with her  she passed them with a stare of such utter disdain that it sent them tumbling over one another backwards  by the time they had recovered themselves sufficiently to think of an old tin kettle lying handy in the gutter she had turned the corner  two miserably clad urchins unable to scrape together the few sous necessary for the hire of a rag or two had nevertheless determined not to be altogether out of it  they had managed to borrow a couple of white blousesnot what you would understand by a white blouse dear madame a dainty thing of frills and laces but the coarse white sack the street sweeper wears over his clothes  they had also borrowed a couple of brooms  ridiculous little objects they looked the tiny head of each showing above the great white shroud as gravely they walked the one behind the other sweeping the mud into the gutter  they also were of the carnival playing at being scavengers  another quaint sight i witnessed  the serpentin is a feature of the belgian carnival  it is a strip of coloured paper some dozen yards long perhaps  you fling it as you would a lassoo entangling the head of some passerby  naturally the object most aimed at by the belgian youth is the belgian maiden  and naturally also the maiden who finds herself most entangled is the maiden whoto use again the language of the matrimonial advertiseris considered goodlooking  the serpentin about her head is the feather in her cap of the belgian maiden on carnival day  coming suddenly round the corner i almost ran into a girl  her back was towards me  it was a quiet street  she had half a dozen of these serpentins hurriedly with trembling hands she was twisting them round and round her own head  i looked at her as i passed  she flushed scarlet  poor little snubnosed pastyfaced woman  i wish she had not seen me  i could have bought sixpennyworth followed her and tormented her with them while she would have pretended indignation sought discreetly to escape from me  down south where the blood flows quicker king carnival is indeed a jolly old soul  in munich he reigns for six weeks the end coming with a mad two days revel in the streets  during the whole of the period folks in ordinary everyday costume are regarded as curiosities people wonder what they are up to  from the grafin to the dienstmadchen from the herr professor to the piccolo as they term the small artist that answers to our page boy the business of munich is dancing somewhere somehow in a fancy costume  every theatre clears away the stage every cafe crowds its chairs and tables into corners the very streets are cleared for dancing munich goes mad  munich is always a little mad  the maddest ball i ever danced at was in munich  i went there with a harvard university professor  he had been told what these balls were like  ever seeking knowledge of all things he determined to take the matter up for himself and examine it  the writer also must ever be learning  i agreed to accompany him  we had not intended to dance  our idea was that we could be indulgent spectators regarding from some coign of vantage the antics of the foolish crowd  the professor was clad as became a professor myself i wore a simplycut frockcoat with trousering in french grey  the doorkeeper explained to us that this was a costume ball he was sorry but gentlemen could only be admitted in evening dress or in masquerade  it was half past one in the morning  we had sat up late on purpose we had gone without our dinner we had walked two miles  the professor suggested pinning up the tails of his clericallycut coat and turning in his waistcoat  the doorkeeper feared it would not be quite the same thing  besides my french grey trousers refused to adapt themselves  the doorkeeper proposed our hiring a costumea little speculation of his own gentlemen found it simpler sometimes especially married gentlemen to hire a costume in this manner changing back into sober garments before returning home  it reduced the volume of necessary explanation  have you anything my good man said the professor anything that would effect a complete disguise  the doorkeeper had the very thinga chinese arrangement with combined mask and wig  it fitted neatly over the head and was provided with a simple but ingenious piece of mechanism by means of which much could be done with the pigtail  myself the doorkeeper hid from view under the cowl of a carmelite monk  i do hope nobody recognises us whispered my friend the professor as we entered  i can only hope sincerely that they did not  i do not wish to talk about myself  that would be egotism  but the mystery of the professor troubles me to this day  a grave earnest gentleman the father of a family i saw him with my own eyes put that ridiculous pasteboard mask over his head  later ona good deal later oni found myself walking again with him through silent starlit streets where he had been in the interval and who then was the strange creature under the chinamans mask will always remain to me an unsolved problem    do we lie abed too late    it was in paris many years ago that i fell by chance into this habit of early rising  my nightby reasons that i need not enter intohad been a troubled one  tired of the hot bed that gave no sleep i rose and dressed myself crept down the creaking stairs experiencing the sensations of a burglar new to his profession unbolted the great door of the hotel and passed out into an unknown silent city bathed in a mysterious soft light  since then this strange sweet city of the dawn has never ceased to call to me  it may be in london in paris again in brussels berlin vienna that i have gone to sleep but if perchance i wake before the returning tide of human life has dimmed its glories with the mists and vapours of the noisy day i know that beyond my window blind the fairy city as i saw it first so many years agothis city that knows no tears no sorrow through which there creeps no evil thing this city of quiet vistas fading into hope this city of faroff voices whispering peace this city of the dawn that still is younginvites me to talk with it awhile before the waking hours drive it before them and with a sigh it passes whence it came  it is the great citys one hour of purity of dignity  the very rag picker groping with her filthy hands among the ashes instead of an object of contempt moves from door to door an accusing figure her thin soiled garments her bent body her scarred face hideous with the wounds of poverty an eloquent indictment of smug injustice sleeping behind its deaf shutters  yet even into her dim brain has sunk the peace that fills for this brief hour the city  this too shall have its end my sister  men and women were not born to live on the husks that fill the pails outside the rich mans door courage a little while longer you and yours  your rheumy eyes once were bright your thin locks once soft and wavy your poor bent back once straight and maybe as they tell you in their gilded churches this bulging sack shall be lifted from your weary shoulders your misshapen limbs be straight again  you pass not altogether unheeded through these empty streets  not all the eyes of the universe are sleeping  the little seamstress hurrying to her early work  a little later she will be one of the foolish crowd joining in the foolish laughter in the coarse jests of the workroom  but as yet the hot day has not claimed her  the workroom is far beyond the home of mean cares and sordid struggles far behind  to her also in this moment are the sweet thoughts of womanhood  she puts down her bag rests herself upon a seat  if all the day were dawn this city of the morning always with us  a neighbouring clock chimes forth the hour  she starts up from her dream and hurries onto the noisy workroom  a pair of lovers cross the park holding each others hands  they will return later in the day but there will be another expression in their eyes another meaning in the pressure of their hands  now the purity of the morning is with them  some fat middleaged clerk comes puffing into view  his ridiculous little figure very podgy  he stops to take off his hat and mop his bald head with his handkerchief  even to him the morning lends romance  his fleshy face changes almost as one looks at him  one sees again the lad with his vague hopes his absurd ambitions  there is a statue of aphrodite in one of the smaller paris parks twice in the same week without particularly meaning it i found myself early in the morning standing in front of this statue gazing listlessly at it as one does when in dreamy mood and on both occasions turning to go i encountered the same man also gazing at it with apparently listless eyes  he was an uninteresting looking manpossibly he thought the same of me  from his dress he might have been a welltodo tradesman a minor government official doctor or lawyer  quite ten years later i paid my third visit to the same statue at about the same hour  this time he was there before me  i was hidden from him by some bushes  he glanced round but did not see me and then he did a curious thing  placing his hands on the top of the pedestal which may have been some seven feet in height he drew himself up and kissed very gently almost reverentially the foot of the statue begrimed though it was with the citys dirt  had he been some longhaired student of the latin quarter one would not have been so astonished  but he was such a very commonplace quite respectable looking man  afterwards he drew a pipe from his pocket carefully filled and lighted it took his umbrella from the seat where it had been lying and walked away  had it been their meetingplace long ago  had he been wont to tell her gazing at her with lovers eyes how like she was to the statue the french sculptor has not to consider mrs grundy  maybe the lady raising her eyes had been confused perhaps for a moment angrysome little milliner or governess one supposes  in france the jeune fille of good family does not meet her lover unattended what had happened  or was it but the vagrant fancy of a middleaged bourgeois seeking in imagination the romance that reality so rarely gives us weaving his love dream round his changeless statue  in one of ibsens bitter comedies the lovers agree to part while they are still young never to see each other in the flesh again  into the future each will bear away the image of the other godlike radiant with the glory of youth and love each will cherish the memory of a loved one who shall be beautiful always  that their parting may not appear such wild nonsense as at first it strikes us ibsen shows us other lovers who have married in the orthodox fashion she was all that a mistress should be  they speak of her as they first knew her fifteen years ago when every man was at her feet  he then was a young student burning with fine ideals with enthusiasm for all the humanities  they enter  what did you expect  fifteen years have passedfifteen years of struggle with the grim realities  he is fat and bald  eleven children have to be provided for  high ideals will not even pay the bootmaker  to exist you have to fight for mean ends with mean weapons  and the sweet girl heroine  now the worried mother of eleven brats  one rings down the curtain amid satanic laughter  that is why for one reason among so many i love this mystic morning light  it has a strange power of revealing the beauty that is hidden from us by the coarser beams of the full day  these worn men and women grown so foolish looking so unromantic these artisans and petty clerks plodding to their monotonous days work these dulleyed women of the people on their way to market to haggle over sous to argue and contend over paltry handfuls of food  in this magic morning light the disguising body becomes transparent  they have grown beautiful not ugly with the years of toil and hardship these lives lived so patiently are consecrated to the service of the world  joy hope pleasurethey have done with all such life for them is over  yet they labour ceaselessly uncomplainingly  it is for the children  one morning near brussels i encountered a cart of faggots drawn by a hound so lean that stroking him might have hurt a dainty hand  i was shockedangry till i noticed his fellow beast of burden pushing the cart from behind  such a scarecrow of an old woman  there was little to choose between them  i walked with them a little way  she lived near waterloo  all day she gathered wood in the great forest and starting at three oclock each morning the two lean creatures between them dragged the cart nine miles to brussels returning when they had sold their load  with luck she might reckon on a couple of francs  i asked her if she could not find something else to do  yes it was possible but for the little one her grandchild  folks will not employ old women burdened with grandchildren  you fair dainty ladies who would never know it was morning if somebody did not enter to pull up the blind and tell you so  you do well not to venture out in this magic morning light  you would look so plainalmost ugly by the side of these beautiful women  it is curious the attraction the church has always possessed for the marketing classes  christ drove them from the temple but still in every continental city they cluster round its outer walls  it makes a charming picture on a sunny morning the great cathedral with its massive shadow forming the background splashed about its feet like a parterre of gay flowers around the trunk of some old tree the women young girls in their many coloured costumes sitting before their piledup baskets of green vegetables of shining fruits  in brussels the chief market is held on the grande place  the great gilded houses have looked down upon much the same scene every morning these four hundred years  in summer time it commences about half past four by five oclock it is a roaring hive the great city round about still sleeping  here comes the thrifty housewife of the poor to whom the difference of a tenth of a penny in the price of a cabbage is allimportant and the much harassed keeper of the petty pension  there are houses in brussels where they will feed you light you sleep you wait on you for two francs a day  withered old ladies ancient governesses who will teach you for forty centimes an hour gather round these ricketty tables wolf up the thin soup grumble at the watery coffee help themselves with unladylike greediness to the potato pie  it must need careful housewifery to keep these poor creatures on two francs a day and make a profit for yourself  so madame the much grumbledat who has gone to bed about twelve rises a little before five makes her way down with her basket  thus a few sous may be saved upon the days economies  sometimes it is a mere child who is the little housekeeper  one thinks that perhaps this early training in the art of haggling may not be good for her  already there is a hard expression in the childish eyes mean lines about the little mouth  the finer qualities of humanity are expensive luxuries not to be afforded by the poor  they overwork their patient dogs and underfeed them  during the two hours market the poor beasts still fastened to their little chariots rest in the open space about the neighbouring bourse they snatch at what you throw them they do not even thank you with a wag of the tail  gratitude  politeness  what mean you  we have not heard of such  we only work  some of them amid all the din lie sleeping between their shafts  some are licking one anothers sores one would they were better treated alas their owners likewise are overworked and underfed housed in kennels no better  but if the majority in every society were not overworked and underfed and meanly housed why then the minority could not be underworked and overfed and housed luxuriously  but this is talk to which no respectable reader can be expected to listen  they are one babel of bargaining these markets  the purchaser selects a cauliflower  fortunately cauliflowers have no feelings or probably it would burst into tears at the expression with which it is regarded  it is impossible that any lady should desire such a cauliflower  still out of mere curiosity she would know the price that is if the owner of the cauliflower is not too much ashamed of it to name a price  the owner of the cauliflower suggests six sous  the thing is too ridiculous for argument  the purchaser breaks into a laugh  the owner of the cauliflower is stung  she points out the beauties of that cauliflower  apparently it is the cauliflower out of all her stock she loves the best a better cauliflower never lived if there were more cauliflowers in the world like this particular cauliflower things might be different  she gives a sketch of the cauliflowers career from its youth upwards  hard enough it will be for her when the hour for parting from it comes  if the other lady has not sufficient knowledge of cauliflowers to appreciate it will she kindly not paw it about but put it down and go away and never let the owner of the cauliflower see her again  the other lady more as a friend than as a purchaser points out the cauliflowers defects  she wishes well to the owner of the cauliflower and would like to teach her something about her business  a lady who thinks such a cauliflower worth six sous can never hope to succeed as a cauliflower vendor  has she really taken the trouble to examine the cauliflower for herself or has love made her blind to its shortcomings  the owner of the cauliflower is too indignant to reply  she snatches it away appears to be comforting it replaces it in the basket  the other lady is grieved at human obstinacy and stupidity in general if the owner of the cauliflower had had any sense she would have asked four sous  eventually business is done at five  it is the custom everywhere abroadasking the price of a thing is simply opening conversation  a lady told me that the first day she began housekeeping in florence she handed over to a poulterer for a chicken the price he had demandedwith protestations that he was losing on the transaction but wanted for family reasons apparently to get rid of the chicken  he stood for half a minute staring at her and then being an honest sort of man threw in a pigeon  foreign housekeepers starting business in london appear hurt when our tradesmen decline to accept halfacrown for articles marked three andsix  then why mark it only threeandsixpence is the foreign housekeepers argument    should married men play golf    that we englishmen attach too much importance to sport goes without sayingor rather it has been said so often as to have become a commonplace  one of these days some reforming english novelist will write a book showing the evil effects of overindulgence in sport the neglected business the ruined home the slow but sure sapping of the brainwhat there may have been of it in the beginningleading to semiimbecility and yearly increasing obesity  a young couple i once heard of went for their honeymoon to scotland  the poor girl did not know he was a golfer he had wooed and won her during a period of idleness enforced by a sprained shoulder or maybe she would have avoided scotland  the idea they started with was that of a tour  the second day the man went out for a stroll by himself  at dinnertime he observed with a faraway look in his eyes that it seemed a pretty spot they had struck and suggested their staying there another day  the next morning after breakfast he borrowed a club from the hotel porter and remarked that he would take a walk while she finished doing her hair  he said it amused him swinging a club while he walked  he returned in time for lunch and seemed moody all the afternoon  he said the air suited him and urged that they should linger yet another day  she was young and inexperienced and thought maybe it was liver she had heard much about liver from her father  the next morning he borrowed more clubs and went out this time before breakfast returning to a late and not over sociable dinner  that was the end of their honeymoon so far as she was concerned  he meant well but the thing had gone too far  the vice had entered into his blood and the smell of the links drove out all other considerations  we are most of us familiar i take it with the story of the golfing parson who could not keep from swearing when the balls went wrong  golf and the ministry dont seem to go together his friend told him  take my advice before its too late and give it up tammas  a few months later tammas met his friend again  you were right jamie cried the parson cheerily they didna run well in harness golf and the meenistry i hae followed your advice i hae gien it oop  then what are ye doing with that sack of clubs inquired jamie  what am i doing with them repeated the puzzled tammas  why i am going to play golf with them  a light broke upon him  great heavens man he continued ye didna think twas the golf id gien oop  the englishman does not understand play  he makes a lifelong labour of his sport and to it sacrifices mind and body  the health resorts of europeto paraphrase a famous saying that nobody appears to have saiddraw half their profits from the playing fields of eton and elsewhere  in swiss and german kurhausen enormously fat men bear down upon you and explain to you that once they were the champion sprinters or the highjump representatives of their universitymen who now hold on to the bannisters and groan as they haul themselves upstairs  consumptive men between paroxysms of coughing tell you of the goals they scored when they were halfbacks or forwards of extraordinary ability  exlightweight amateur pugilists with the figure now of an american rolltop desk butt you into a corner of the billiardroom and surprised they cannot get as near you as they would desire whisper to you the secret of avoiding the undercut by the swiftness of the backward leap  brokendown tennis players one legged skaters dropsical gentlemenriders are to be met with hobbling on crutches along every highway of the engadine  they are pitiable objects  never having learnt to read anything but the sporting papers books are of no use to them  they never wasted much of their youth on thought and apparently have lost the knack of it  they dont care for art and nature only suggests to them the things they can no longer do  the snowclad mountain reminds them that once they were daring tobogannists the undulating common makes them sad because they can no longer handle a golfclub by the riverside they sit down and tell you of the salmon they caught before they caught rheumatic fever birds only make them long for guns music raises visions of the local cricketmatch of long ago enlivened by the local band a picturesque estaminet with little tables spread out under the vines recalls bitter memories of ping pong  one is sorry for them but their conversation is not exhilarating  the man who has other interests in life beyond sport is apt to find their reminiscences monotonous while to one another they do not care to talk  one gathers that they do not altogether believe one another  the foreigner is taking kindly to our sports one hopes he will be forewarned by our example and not overdo the thing  at present one is bound to admit he shows no sign of taking sport too seriously football is gaining favour more and more throughout europe  but yet the frenchman has not got it out of his head that the coup to practise is kicking the ball high into the air and catching it upon his head  he would rather catch the ball upon his head than score a goal  if he can manoeuvre the ball away into a corner kick it up into the air twice running and each time catch it on his head he does not seem to care what happens after that  anybody can have the ball he has had his game and is happy  they talk of introducing cricket into belgium i shall certainly try to be present at the opening game  i am afraid that until he learns from experience the belgian fielder will stop cricket balls with his head  that the head is the proper thing with which to play ball appears to be in his blood  my head is round he argues and hard just like the ball itself what part of the human frame more fit and proper with which to meet and stop a ball  golf has not yet caught on but tennis is firmly established from st petersburg to bordeaux  the german with the thoroughness characteristic of him is working hard  university professors stout majors rising early in the morning hire boys and practise back handers and halfvolleys  but to the frenchman as yet it is a game  he plays it in a happy merry fashion that is shocking to english eyes  your partners service rather astonishes you  an occasional yard or so beyond the line happens to anyone but this mans object appears to be to break windows  you feel you really must remonstrate when the joyous laughter and tumultuous applause of the spectators explain the puzzle to you  he has not been trying to serve he has been trying to hit a man in the next court who is stooping down to tie up his shoelace  with his last ball he has succeeded  he has hit the man in the small of the back and has bowled him over  the unanimous opinion of the surrounding critics is that the ball could not possibly have been better placed  a doherty has never won greater applause from the crowd  even the man who has been hit appears pleased it shows what a frenchman can do when he does take up a game  but french honour demands revenge  he forgets his shoe he forgets his game  he gathers together all the balls that he can find his balls your balls anybodys balls that happen to be handy  and then commences the return match  at this point it is best to crouch down under shelter of the net  most of the players round about adopt this plan the more timid make for the clubhouse and finding themselves there order coffee and light up cigarettes  after a while both players appear to be satisfied  the other players then gather round to claim their balls  this makes a good game by itself  the object is to get as many balls as you can your own and other peoplesfor preference other peoplesand run off with them round the courts followed by whooping claimants  in the course of halfanhour or so when everybody is dead beat the gamethe original gameis resumed  you demand the score your partner promptly says it is fortyfifteen  both your opponents rush up to the net and apparently there is going to be a duel  it is only a friendly altercation they very much doubt its being fortyfifteen  fifteenforty they could believe they suggest it as a compromise  the discussion is concluded by calling it deuce as it is rare for a game to proceed without some such incident occurring in the middle of it the score generally is deuce  this avoids heartburning nobody wins a set and nobody loses  the one game generally suffices for the afternoon  to the earnest player it is also confusing to miss your partner occasionallyto turn round and find that he is talking to a man nobody but yourself takes the slightest objection to his absence the other side appear to regard it as a good opportunity to score five minutes later he resumes the game  his friend comes with him also the dog of his friend  the dog is welcomed with enthusiasm all balls are returned to the dog  until the dog is tired you do not get a look in  but all this will no doubt soon be changed  there are some excellent french and belgian players from them their compatriots will gradually learn higher ideals  the frenchman is young in the game  as the right conception of the game grows upon him he will also learn to keep the balls lower  i suppose it is the continental sky  it is so blue so beautiful it naturally attracts one  anyhow the fact remains that most tennis players on the continent whether english or foreign have a tendency to aim the ball direct at heaven  at an english club in switzerland there existed in my days a young englishman who was really a wonderful player  to get the ball past him was almost an impossibility  it was his return that was weak  he only had one stroke the ball went a hundred feet or so into the air and descended in his opponents court  the other man would stand watching it a little speck in the heavens growing gradually bigger and bigger as it neared the earth  newcomers would chatter to him thinking he had detected a balloon or an eagle  he would wave them aside explain to them that he would talk to them later after the arrival of the ball it would fall with a thud at his feet rise another twenty yards or so and again descend  when it was at the proper height he would hit it back over the net and the next moment it would be mounting the sky again  at tournaments i have seen that young man with tears in his eyes pleading to be given an umpire  every umpire had fled they hid behind trees borrowed silk hats and umbrellas and pretended they were visitorsany device however mean to avoid the task of umpiring for that young man  provided his opponent did not go to sleep or get cramp one game might last all day  anyone could return his balls but as i have said to get a ball past him was almost an impossibility  he invariably won the other man after an hour or so would get mad and try to lose  it was his only chance of dinner  it is a pretty sight generally speaking a tennis ground abroad the women pay more attention to their costumes than do our lady players  the men are usually in spotless white  the ground is often charmingly situated the clubhouse picturesque there is always laughter and merriment  the play may not be so good to watch but the picture is delightful  i accompanied a man a little while ago to his club on the outskirts of brussels  the ground was bordered by a wood on one side and surrounded on the other three by petites fermesallotments as we should call them in england worked by the peasants themselves  it was a glorious spring afternoon  the courts were crowded  the red earth and the green grass formed a background against which the women in their new parisian toilets under their bright parasols stood out like wondrous bouquets of moving flowers  the whole atmosphere was a delightful mingling of idle gaiety flirtation and graceful sensuousness  a modern watteau would have seized upon the scene with avidity  just beyondseparated by the almost invisible wire fencinga group of peasants were working in the field  an old woman and a young girl with ropes about their shoulders were drawing a harrow guided by a withered old scarecrow of a man  they paused for a moment at the wire fencing and looked through  it was an odd contrast the two worlds divided by that wire fencingso slight almost invisible the girl swept the sweat from her face with her hand the woman pushed back her grey locks underneath the handkerchief knotted about her head the old man straightened himself with some difficulty  so they stood for perhaps a minute gazing with quiet passionless faces through that slight fencing that a push from their work hardened hands might have levelled  was there any thought i wonder passing through their brains  the young girlshe was a handsome creature in spite of her disfiguring garments  the womanit was a wonderfully fine face  clear calm eyes deepset under a square broad brow  the withered old scarecrowever sowing the seed in the spring of the fruit that others shall eat  the old man bent again over the guiding ropes  gave the word  the team moved forward up the hill  it is anatole france i think who says  society is based upon the patience of the poor    are early marriages a mistake    i am chary nowadays of offering counsel in connection with subjects concerning which i am not and cannot be an authority  long ago i once took upon myself to write a paper about babies  it did not aim to be a textbook on the subject  it did not even claim to exhaust the topic  i was willing that others coming after me should continue the argumentthat is if upon reflection they were still of opinion there was anything more to be said  i was pleased with the article  i went out of my way to obtain an early copy of the magazine in which it appeared on purpose to show it to a lady friend of mine  she was the possessor of one or two babies of her own specimens in no way remarkable though she herself as was natural enough did her best to boom them  i thought it might be helpful to her  the views and observations not of a rival fancier who would be prejudiced but of an intelligent amateur  i put the magazine into her hands opened at the proper place  read it through carefully and quietly i said dont let anything distract you  have a pencil and a bit of paper ready at your side and note down any points upon which you would like further information  if there is anything you think i have missed out let me know  it may be that here and there you will be disagreeing with me if so do not hesitate to mention it i shall not be angry  if a demand arises i shall very likely issue an enlarged and improved edition of this paper in the form of a pamphlet in which case hints and suggestions that to you may appear almost impertinent will be of distinct help to me  i havent got a pencil she said whats it all about  its about babies i explained and i lent her a pencil  that is another thing i have learnt  never lend a pencil to a woman if you ever want to see it again  she has three answers to your request for its return  the first that she gave it back to you and that you put it in your pocket and that its there now and that if it isnt it ought to be  the second that you never lent it to her the third that she wishes people would not lend her pencils and then clamour for them back just when she has something else far more important to think about  what do you know about babies she demanded  if you will read the paper i replied you will see for yourself its all there  she flicked over the pages contemptuously  there doesnt seem much of it she retorted  it is condensed i pointed out to her  i am glad it is short  all right ill read it she agreed  i thought my presence might disturb her so went out into the garden i wanted her to get the full benefit of it  i crept back now and again to peep through the open window  she did not seem to be making many notes  but i heard her making little noises to herself  when i saw she had reached the last page i reentered the room  well i said  is it meant to be funny she demanded or is it intended to be taken seriously  there may be flashes of humour here and there  she did not wait for me to finish  because if its meant to be funny she said i dont think it is at all funny  and if it is intended to be serious theres one thing very clear and that is that you are not a mother  with the unerring instinct of the born critic she had divined my one weak point  other objections raised against me i could have met but that one stinging reproach was unanswerable  it has made me as i have explained chary of tendering advice on matters outside my own department of life  otherwise every year about valentines day there is much that i should like to say to my good friends the birds i want to put it to them seriously  is not the month of february just a little too early  of course their answer would be the same as in the case of my motherly friend  oh what do you know about it you are not a bird  i know i am not a bird but that is the very reason why they should listen to me  i bring a fresh mind to bear upon the subject  i am not tied down by bird convention  february my dear friendsin these northern climes of ours at all eventsis much too early  you have to build in a high wind and nothing believe me tries a ladys temper more than being blown about  nature is nature and womenfolk my dear sirs are the same all the world over whether they be birds or whether they be human  i am an older person than most of you and i speak with the weight of experience  if i were going to build a house with my wife i should not choose a season of the year when the bricks and planks and things were liable to be torn out of her hand her skirts blown over her head and she left clinging for dear life to a scaffolding pole  i know the feminine biped and you take it from me that is not her notion of a honeymoon  in april or may the sun shining the air balmywhen after carrying up to her a load or two of bricks and a hod or two of mortar we could knock off work for a few minutes without fear of the whole house being swept away into the next streetcould sit side by side on the top of a wall our legs dangling down and peck and morsel together after which i could whistle a bit to herthen housebuilding might be a pleasure  the swallows are wisest june is their idea and a very good idea too  in a mountain village in the tyrol early one summer i had the opportunity of watching very closely the building of a swallows nest  after coffee the first morning i stepped out from the great cool dark passage of the wirtschaft into the blazing sunlight and for no particular reason pulledto the massive door behind me while filling my pipe a swallow almost brushed by me then wheeled round again and took up a position on the fence only a few yards from me  he was carrying what to him was an exceptionally large and heavy brick  he put it down beside him on the fence and called out something which i could not understand  i did not move  he got quite excited and said some more  it was undoubtable he was addressing menobody else was by  i judged from his tone that he was getting cross with me  at this point my travelling companion his toilet unfinished put his head out of the window just above me  such an odd thing he called down to me  i never noticed it last night  a pair of swallows are building a nest here in the hall youve got to be careful you dont mistake it for a hatpeg  the old lady says they have built there regularly for the last three years  then it came to me what it was the gentleman had been saying to me i say sir you with the bit of wood in your mouth you have been and shut the door and i cant get in  now with the key in my possession it was so clear and understandable i really forgot for the moment he was only a bird  i beg your pardon i replied i had no idea  such an extraordinary place to build a nest  i opened the door for him and taking up his brick again he entered and i followed him in  there was a deal of talk  he shut the door i heard him say chap there sucking the bit of wood  thought i was never going to get in  i know was the answer it has been so dark in here if youll believe me ive hardly been able to see what ive been doing  fine brick isnt it  where will you have it  observing me sitting there they lowered their voices  evidently she wanted him to put the brick down and leave her to think  she was not quite sure where she would have it  he on the other hand was sure he had found the right place for it  he pointed it out to her and explained his views  other birds quarrel a good deal during nest building but swallows are the gentlest of little people  she let him put it where he wanted to and he kissed her and ran out  she cocked her eye after him watched till he was out of sight then deftly and quickly slipped it out and fixed it the other side of the door  poor dears i could see it in the toss of her head they will think they know best it is just as well not to argue with them  every summer i suffer much from indignation  i love to watch the swallows building  they build beneath the eaves outside my study window  such cheerful little chatterboxes they are  long after sunset when all the other birds are sleeping the swallows still are chattering softly  it sounds as if they were telling one another some pretty story and often i am sure there must be humour in it for every now and then one hears a little twittering laugh  i delight in having them there so close to me  the fancy comes to me that one day when my brain has grown more cunning i too listening in the twilight shall hear the stories that they tell  one or two phrases already i have come to understand  once upon a timelong long agoin a strange faroff land  i hear these words so constantly i am sure i have them right  i call it swallow street this row of six or seven nests  two or three like villas in their own grounds stand alone and others are semidetached  it makes me angry that the sparrows will come and steal them  the sparrows will hang about deliberately waiting for a pair of swallows to finish their nest and then with a brutal laugh that makes my blood boil drive the swallows away and take possession of it  and the swallows are so wonderfully patient  never mind old girl says tommy swallow after the first big cry is over to jenny swallow lets try again  and half an hour later full of fresh plans they are choosing another likely site chattering cheerfully once more  i watched the building of a particular nest for nearly a fortnight one year and when after two or three days absence i returned and found a pair of sparrows comfortably encsonced therein i just felt mad  i saw mrs sparrow looking out  maybe my anger was working upon my imagination but it seemed to me that she nodded to me  nice little house aint it  what i call well built  mr sparrow then flew up with a gaudy feather dyed blue which belonged to me  i recognised it  it had come out of the brush with which the girl breaks the china ornaments in our drawingroom  at any other time i should have been glad to see him flying off with the whole thing handle included  but now i felt the theft of that one feather as an added injury  mrs sparrow chirped with delight at sight of the gaudy monstrosity  having got the house cheap they were going to spend their small amount of energy upon internal decoration  that was their idea clearly a liberty interior  she looked more like a cockney sparrow than a country onehad been born and bred in regent street no doubt  there is not much justice in this world said i to myself but theres going to be some introduced into this businessthat is if i can find a ladder  i did find a ladder and fortunately it was long enough  mr and mrs sparrow were out when i arrived possibly on the hunt for cheap photo frames and japanese fans  i did not want to make a mess  i removed the house neatly into a dustpan and wiped the street clear of every trace of it  i had just put back the ladder when mrs sparrow returned with a piece of pink cottonwool in her mouth  that was her idea of a colour scheme  appleblossom pink and reckitts blue side by side  she dropped her wool and sat on the waterspout and tried to understand things  number one number two number four where the blazessparrows are essentially common and the women are as bad as the menis number three  mr sparrow came up from behind over the roof  he was carrying a piece of yellowfluff part of a lampshade as far as i could judge  move yourself he said whats the sense of sitting there in the rain  i went out just for a moment replied mrs sparrow i could not have been gone no not a couple of minutes  when i came back  oh get indoors said mr sparrow talk about it there  its what im telling you continued mrs sparrow if you would only listen  there isnt any door there isnt any house  isnt any mr sparrow holding on to the rim of the spout turned himself topsyturvy and surveyed the street  from where i was standing behind the laurel bushes i could see nothing but his back  he stood up again looking angry and flushed  what have you done with the house  cant i turn my back a minute  i aint done nothing with it  as i keep on telling you i had only just gone  oh bother where you had gone  wheres the darned house gone thats what i want to know  they looked at one another  if ever astonishment was expressed in the attitude of a bird it was told by the tails of those two sparrows  they whispered wickedly together  the idea occurred to them that by force or cunning they might perhaps obtain possession of one of the other nests  but all the other nests were occupied and even gentle jenny swallow once in her own home with the children round about her is not to be trifled with  mr sparrow called at number two put his head in at the door and then returned to the waterspout  lady says we dont live there he explained to mrs sparrow  there was silence for a while  not what i call a classy street commented mrs sparrow  if it were not for that terrible tired feeling of mine said mr sparrow blame if i wouldnt build a house of my own  perhaps said mrs sparrow i have heard it said that a little bit of work now and then does you good  all sorts of wild ideas about in the air nowadays said mr sparrow it dont do to listen to everybody  and it dont do to sit still and do nothing neither snapped mrs sparrow  i dont want to have to forget im a lady butwell any man who was a man would see things for himself  why did i every marry retorted mr sparrow  they flew away together quarrelling    do writers write too much    on a newspaper placard the other day i saw announced a new novel by a celebrated author  i bought a copy of the paper and turned eagerly to the last page  i was disappointed to find that i had missed the first six chapters  the story had commenced the previous saturday this was friday  i say i was disappointed and so i was at first  but my disappointment did not last long  the bright and intelligent subeditor according to the custom now in vogue had provided me with a short synopsis of those first six chapters so that without the trouble of reading them i knew what they were all about  the first instalment i learned introduces the reader to a brilliant and distinguished company assembled in the drawingroom of lady marys maisonette in park street  much smart talk is indulged in  i know that smart talk so well  had i not been lucky enough to miss that first chapter i should have had to listen to it once again possibly here and there it might have been new to me but it would have read i know so very like the old  a dear sweet whitehaired lady of my acquaintance is never surprised at anything that happens  something very much of the same kind occurred she will remember one winter when we were staying in brighton  only on that occasion the mans name i think was robinson  we do not live new storiesnor write them either  the mans name in the old story was robinson we alter it to jones  it happened in the old forgotten tale at brighton in the winter time we change it to eastbourne in the spring  it is new and originalto those who have not heard something very like it once before  much smart talk is indulged in so the subeditor has explained there is absolutely no need to ask for more than that  there is a duchess who says improper things  once she used to shock me  but i know her now  she is really a nice woman she doesnt mean them and when the heroine is in trouble towards the middle of the book she is just as amusing on the side of virtue  then there is a younger lady whose speciality is proverbs  apparently whenever she hears a proverb she writes it down and studies it with the idea of seeing into how many different forms it can be twisted  it looks clever as a matter of fact it is extremely easy  be virtuous and you will be happy  she jots down all the possible variations  be virtuous and you will be unhappy  too simple that one she tells herself  be virtuous and your friends will be happy if you are not  better but not wicked enough  let us think again  be happy and people will jump to the conclusion that you are virtuous  thats good ill try that one at tomorrows party  she is a painstaking lady  one feels that better advised she might have been of use in the world  there is likewise a disgraceful old peer who tells naughty stories but who is good at heart and one person so very rude that the wonder is who invited him  occasionally a slangy girl is included and a clergyman who takes the heroine aside and talks sense to her flavoured with epigram all these people chatter a mixture of lord chesterfield and oliver wendell holmes of heine voltaire madame de stael and the late lamented h j byron  how they do it beats me as i once overheard at a music hall a stout lady confess to her friend while witnessing the performance of a clever troup styling themselves the boneless wonders of the universe  the synopsis added that  ursula bart a charming and unsophisticated young american girl possessed of an elusive expression makes her first acquaintance with london society  here you have a weeks unnecessary work on the part of the author boiled down to its essentials  she was young  one hardly expects an elderly heroine  the young might have been dispensed with especially seeing it is told us that she was a girl  but maybe this is carping  there are young girls and old girls  perhaps it is as well to have it in black and white she was young  she was an american young girl  there is but one american young girl in english fiction  we know by heart the unconventional things that she will do the startlingly original things that she will say the fresh illuminating thoughts that will come to her as clad in a loose robe of some soft clinging stuff she sits before the fire in the solitude of her own room  to complete her she had an elusive expression  the days when we used to catalogue the heroines points are past  formerly it was possible  a man wrote perhaps some halfadozen novels during the whole course of his career  he could have a dark girl for the first a light girl for the second sketch a merry little wench for the third and draw you something stately for the fourth  for the remaining two he could go abroad  nowadays when a man turns out a novel and six short stories once a year description has to be dispensed with  it is not the writers fault  there is not sufficient variety in the sex  we used to introduce her thus  imagine to yourself dear reader an exquisite and gracious creature of five feet three  her golden hair of that peculiar shadehere would follow directions enabling the reader to work it out for himself  he was to pour some particular wine into some particular sort of glass and wave it about before some particular sort of a light  or he was to get up at five oclock on a march morning and go into a wood  in this way he could satisfy himself as to the particular shade of gold the heroines hair might happen to be  if he were a careless or lazy reader he could save himself time and trouble by taking the authors word for it  many of them did  her eyes  they were invariably deep and liquid  they had to be pretty deep to hold all the odds and ends that were hidden in them sunlight and shadow mischief unsuspected possibilities assorted emotions strange wild yearnings  anything we didnt know where else to put we said was hidden in her eyes  her nose  you could have made it for yourself out of a penorth of putty after reading our description of it  her forehead  it was always low and broad  i dont know why it was always low  maybe because the intellectual heroine was not then popular  for the matter of that i doubt if she be really popular now  the brainless doll one fears will continue for many years to come to be mans ideal womanand womans ideal of herself for precisely the same period one may be sure  her chin  a less degree of variety was permissible in her chin it had to be at an angle suggestive of piquancy and it had to contain at least the suspicion of a dimple  to properly understand her complexion you were expected to provide yourself with a collection of assorted fruits and flowers  there are seasons in the year when it must have been difficult for the conscientious reader to have made sure of her complexion  possibly it was for this purpose that wax flowers and fruit carefully kept from the dust under glass cases were common objects in former times upon the tables of the cultured  nowadays we content ourselvesand our readers also i am inclined to thinkwith dashing her off in a few bold strokes  we say that whenever she entered a room there came to one dreams of an old world garden the sound of faroff bells  or that her presence brought with it the scent of hollyhocks and thyme  as a matter of fact i dont think hollyhocks do smell  it is a small point about such we do not trouble ourselves  in the case of the homely type of girl i dont see why we should not borrow mr pickwicks expression and define her by saying that in some subtle way she always contrived to suggest an odour of chops and tomato sauce  if we desire to be exact we mention as this particular author seems to have done that she had an elusive expression or a penetrating fragrance  or we say that she moved the centre of an indefinable nuance  but it is not policy to bind oneself too closely to detail  a wise friend of mine who knows his business describes his hero invariably in the vaguest terms  he will not even tell you whether the man is tall or short clean shaven or bearded  make the fellow nice is his advice  let every woman reader picture him to herself as her particular man  then everything he says and does becomes of importance to her  she is careful not to miss a word  for the same reason he sees to it that his heroine has a bit of every girl in her  generally speaking she is a cross between romola and dora copperfield  his novels command enormous sales  the women say he draws a man to the life but does not seem to know much about women  the men like his women but think his men stupid  of another famous author no woman of my acquaintance is able to speak too highly  they tell me his knowledge of their sex is simply marvellous his insight his understanding of them almost uncanny thinking it might prove useful i made an exhaustive study of his books  i noticed that his women were without exception brilliant charming creatures possessed of the wit of a lady wortlay montagu combined with the wisdom of a george eliot  they were not all of them good women but all of them were clever and all of them were fascinating  i came to the conclusion that his lady critics were correct  he did understand women  but to return to our synopsis  the second chapter it appeared transported us to yorkshire where basil longleat a typical young englishman lately home from college resides with his widowed mother and two sisters  they are a delightful family  what a world of trouble to both writer and to reader is here saved a typical young englishman  the author probably wrote five pages elaborating  the five words of the subeditor present him to me more vividly  i see him positively glistening from the effects of soap and water  i see his clear blue eye his fair crisp locks the natural curliness of which annoys him personally though alluring to everybody else his frank winning smile  he is lately home from college  that tells me that he is a firstclass cricketer a first class oar that as a halfback he is incomparable that he swims like captain webb is in the first rank of tennis players that his half volley at pingpong has never been stopped  it doesnt tell me much about his brain power  the description of him as a typical young englishman suggests more information on this particular point  one assumes that the american girl with the elusive expression is going to have sufficient for both  they are a delightful family  the subeditor does not say so but i imagine the two sisters are likewise typical young englishwomen they ride and shoot and cook and make their own dresses have common sense and love a joke  the third chapter is taken up with the humours of a local cricket match  thank you mr subeditor  i feel i owe you gratitude  in the fourth ursula bart i was beginning to get anxious about her turns up again  she is staying at the useful lady marys place in yorkshire  she meets basil by accident one morning while riding alone  that is the advantage of having an american girl for your heroine  like the british army  it goes anywhere and does anything  in chapter five basil and ursula meet again this time at a picnic the subeditor does not wish to repeat himself otherwise he possibly would have summed up chapter five by saying it was taken up with the humours of the usual picnic  in chapter six something happens  basil returning home in the twilight comes across ursula bart in a lonely point of the moor talking earnestly to a roughlooking stranger  his approach over the soft turf being unnoticed he cannot help overhearing ursulas parting words to the forbiddinglooking stranger  i must see you again  tomorrow night at halfpast nine in the gateway of the ruined abbey  who is he  and why must ursula see him again at such an hour in such a spot  so here at cost of reading twenty lines i am landed so to speak at the beginning of the seventh chapter  why dont i set to work to read it  the subeditor has spoiled me  you read it i want to say to him  tell me tomorrow morning what it is all about  who was this bounder  why should ursula want to see him again  why choose a draughty place  why halfpast nine oclock at night which must have been an awkward time for both of themlikely to lead to talk  why should i wade though this seventh chapter of three columns and a half  its your work  what are you paid for  my fear is lest this sort of thing shall lead to a demand on the part of the public for condensed novels  what busy man is going to spend a week of evenings reading a book when a nice kind subeditor is prepared in five minutes to tell him what it is all about  then there will come a dayi feel itwhen the businesslike editor will say to himself  what in thunder is the sense of my paying one man to write a story of sixty thousand words and another man to read it and tell it again in sixteen hundred  we shall be expected to write our novels in chapters not exceeding twenty words  our short stories will be reduced to the formula little boy  pair of skates  broken ice heavens gates  formerly an author commissioned to supply a childs tragedy of this genre for a christmas number would have spun it out into five thousand words personally i should have commenced the previous springgiven the reader the summer and autumn to get accustomed to the boy  he would have been a good boy the sort of boy that makes a beeline for the thinnest ice  he would have lived in a cottage  i could have spread that cottage over two pages the things that grew in the garden the view from the front door  you would have known that boy before i had done with himfelt you had known him all your life  his quaint sayings his childish thoughts his great longings would have been impressed upon you  the father might have had a dash of humour in him the mothers early girlhood would have lent itself to pretty writing  for the ice we would have had a mysterious lake in the wood said to be haunted  the boy would have loved o twilights to stand upon its margin  he would have heard strange voices calling to him  you would have felt the thing was coming  so much might have been done  when i think of that plot wasted in nine words it makes me positively angry  and what is to become of us writers if this is to be the new fashion in literature  we are paid by the length of our manuscript at rates from halfacrown a thousand words and upwards  in the case of fellows like doyle and kipling i am told it runs into pounds  how are we to live on novels the serial rights of which to most of us will work out at four and ninepence  it cant be done  it is no good telling me you can see no reason why we should live  that is no answer  im talking plain business  and what about bookrights  who is going to buy novels of three pages  they will have to be printed as leaflets and sold at a penny a dozen  marie corelli and hall caineif all i hear about them is truewill possibly make their ten or twelve shillings a week  but what about the rest of us  this thing is worrying me    should soldiers be polite    my desire was once to pass a peaceful and pleasant winter in brussels attending to my work improving my mind  brussels is a bright and cheerful town and i think i could have succeeded had it not been for the belgian army  the belgian army would follow me about and worry me  judging of it from my own experience i should say it was a good army  napoleon laid it down as an axiom that your enemy never ought to be permitted to get away from younever ought to be allowed to feel even for a moment that he had shaken you off what tactics the belgian army might adopt under other conditions i am unable to say but against me personally that was the plan of campaign it determined upon and carried out with a success that was astonishing even to myself  i found it utterly impossible to escape from the belgian army  i made a point of choosing the quietest and most unlikely streets i chose all hoursearly in the morning in the afternoon late in the evening  there were moments of wild exaltation when i imagined i had given it the slip  i could not see it anywhere i could not hear it  now said i to myself now for five minutes peace and quiet  i had been doing it injustice  it had been working round me approaching the next corner i would hear the tattoo of its drum before i had gone another quarter of a mile it would be in full pursuit of me  i would jump upon a tram and travel for miles then thinking i had shaken it off i would alight and proceed upon my walk  five minutes later another detachment would be upon my heels  i would slink home the belgian army pursuing me with its exultant tattoo  vanquished shamed my insular pride for ever vanished i would creep up into my room and close the door  the victorious belgian army would then march back to barracks  if only it had followed me with a band  i like a band  i can loaf against a post listening to a band with anyone  i should not have minded so much had it come after me with a band  but the belgian army apparently doesnt run to a band  it has nothing but this drum  it has not even a real drumnot what i call a drum  it is a little boys drum the sort of thing i used to play myself at one time until people took it away from me and threatened that if they heard it once again that day they would break it over my own head it is cowardly going up and down playing a drum of this sort when there is nobody to stop you  the man would not dare to do it if his mother was about  he does not even play it  he walks along tapping it with a little stick  theres no tune theres no sense in it  he does not even keep time  i used to think at first hearing it in the distance that it was the work of some young gamin who ought to be at school or making himself useful taking the baby out in the perambulator  and i would draw back into dark doorways determined as he came by to dart out and pull his ear for him  to my astonishmentfor the first weeki learnt it was the belgian army getting itself accustomed one supposes to the horrors of war  it had the effect of making me a peaceatanyprice man  they tell me these armies are necessary to preserve the tranquility of europe  for myself i should be willing to run the risk of an occasional row  cannot someone tell them they are out of date with their bits of feathers and their odds and ends of ironmongerygrown men that cannot be sent out for a walk unless accompanied by a couple of nursemen blowing a tin whistle and tapping a drum out of a toy shop to keep them in order and prevent their running about  one might think they were chickens  a herd of soldiers with their pots and pans and parcels and all their deadly things tied on to them prancing about in time to a tune makes me think always of the white knight that alice met in wonderland  i take it that for practical purposesto fight for your country or to fight for somebody elses country which is generally speaking more popularthe thing essential is that a certain proportion of the populace should be able to shoot straight with a gun  how standing in a line and turning out your toes is going to assist you under modern conditions of warfare is one of the many things my intellect is incapable of grasping  in mediaeval days when men fought hand to hand there must have been advantage in combined and precise movement  when armies were mere iron machines the simple endeavour of each being to push the other off the earth then the striking simultaneously with a thousand arms was part of the game  now when we shoot from behind cover with smokeless powder brain not brute forceindividual sense not combined solidity is surely the result to be aimed at  cannot somebody as i have suggested explain to the military man that the proper place for the drill sergeant nowadays is under a glass case in some museum of antiquities  i lived once near the hyde park barracks and saw much of the drill sergeants method  generally speaking he is a stout man with the walk of an egotistical pigeon  his voice is one of the most extraordinary things in nature  if you can distinguish it from the bark of a dog you are clever  they tell me that the privates after a little practice canwhich gives one a higher opinion of their intelligence than otherwise one might form  but myself i doubt even this statement  i was the owner of a fine retriever dog about the time of which i am speaking and sometimes he and i would amuse ourselves by watching mr sergeant exercising his squad  one morning he had been shouting out the usual whough whough whough for about ten minutes and all had hitherto gone well  suddenly and evidently to his intense astonishment the squad turned their backs upon him and commenced to walk towards the serpentine  halt yelled the sergeant the instant his amazed indignation permitted him to speak which fortunately happened in time to save the detachment from a watery grave  the squad halted  who the thunder and the blazes and other things told you to do that  the squad looked bewildered but said nothing and were brought back to the place where they were before  a minute later precisely the same thing occurred again  i really thought the sergeant would burst  i was preparing to hasten to the barracks for medical aid but the paroxysm passed  calling upon the combined forces of heaven and hell to sustain him in his trouble he requested his squad as man to man to inform him of the reason why to all appearance they were dispensing with his services and drilling themselves  at this moment columbus barked again and the explanation came to him  please go away sir he requested me  how can i exercise my men with that dog of yours interfering every five minutes  it was not only on that occasion  it happened at other times  the dog seemed to understand and take a pleasure in it  sometimes meeting a soldier walking with his sweetheart columbus from behind my legs would bark suddenly  immediately the man would let go the girl and proceed involuntarily to perform military tricks  the war office authorities accused me of having trained the dog  i had not trained him  that was his natural voice  i suggested to the war office authorities that instead of quarrelling with my dog for talking his own language they should train their sergeants to use english  they would not see it  unpleasantness was in the air and living where i did at the time i thought it best to part with columbus  i could see what the war office was driving at and i did not desire that responsibility for the inefficiency of the british army should be laid at my door  some twenty years ago we in london were passing through a riotous period and a call was made to lawabiding citizens to enrol themselves as special constables  i was young and the hope of trouble appealed to me more than it does now  in company with some five or six hundred other more or less respectable citizens i found myself one sunday morning in the drill yard of the albany barracks it was the opinion of the authorities that we could guard our homes and protect our wives and children better if first of all we learned to roll our eyes right or left at the given word of command and to walk with our thumbs stuck out  accordingly a drill sergeant was appointed to instruct us on these points  he came out of the canteen wiping his mouth and flicking his leg according to rule with the regulation cane  but as he approached us his expression changed  we were stout pompouslooking gentlemen the majority of us in frock coats and silk hats  the sergeant was a man with a sense of the fitness of things  the idea of shouting and swearing at us fell from him  and that gone there seemed to be no happy medium left to him  the stiffness departed from his back  he met us with a defferential attitude and spoke to us in the language of social intercourse  good morning gentlemen said the sergeant  good morning we replied  and there was a pause  the sergeant fidgetted upon his feet  we waited  well now gentlemen said the sergeant with a pleasant smile what do you say to falling in  we agreed to fall in  he showed us how to do it  he cast a critical eye along the back of our rear line  a little further forward number three if you dont mind sir he suggested  number three who was an importantlooking gentleman stepped forward  the sergeant cast his critical eye along the front of the first line  a little further back if you dont mind sir he suggested addressing the third gentleman from the end  cant explained the third gentleman much as i can do to keep where i am  the sergeant cast his critical eye between the lines  ah said the sergeant a little fullchested some of us  we will make the distance another foot if you please gentlemen  in pleasant manner like to this the drill proceeded  now then gentlemen shall we try a little walk  quick march thank you gentlemen  sorry to trouble you but it may be necessary to runforward i mean of course  so if you really do not mind we will now do the double quick  halt  and if next time you can keep a little more in lineit has a more imposing appearance if you understand me  the breathing comes with practice  if the thing must be done at all why should it not be done in this way  why should not the sergeant address the new recruits politely  now then you young chaps are you all ready  dont hurry yourselves  no need to make hard work of what should be a pleasure to all of us  thats right thats very good indeedconsidering you are only novices  but there is still something to be desired in your attitude private bullyboy  you will excuse my being personal but are you knockkneed naturally  or could you with an effort do you think contrive to give yourself less the appearance of a marionette whose strings have become loose  thank you that is better  these little things appear trivial i know but after all we may as well try and look our best   dont you like your boots private montmorency  oh i beg your pardon  i thought from the way you were bending down and looking at them that perhaps their appearance was dissatisfying to you  my mistake  are you suffering from indigestion my poor fellow  shall i get you a little brandy  it isnt indigestion  then whats the matter with it  why are you trying to hide it  its nothing to be ashamed of weve all got one  let it come forward man  lets see it  having succeeded with a few such kindly words in getting his line into order he would proceed to recommend healthy exercise  shoulder arms  good gentlemen very good for a beginning  yet still if i may be critical not perfect  there is more in this thing than you might imagine gentlemen  may i point out to private henry thompson that a musket carried across the shoulder at right angles is apt to inconvenience the gentleman behind  even from the point of view of his own comfort i feel sure that private thompson would do better to follow the usual custom in this matter  i would also suggest to private st leonard that we are not here to practice the art of balancing a heavy musket on the outstretched palm of the hand  private st leonards performance with the musket is decidedly clever  but it is not war  believe me gentlemen this thing has been carefully worked out and no improvement is likely to result from individual effort  let our idea be uniformity  it is monotonous but it is safe  now then gentlemen once again  the drill yard would be converted into a source of innocent delight to thousands  officer and gentleman would become a phrase of meaning  i present the idea for what it may be worth with my compliments to pall mall  the fault of the military man is that he studies too much reads too much history is over reflective  if instead he would look about him more he would notice that things are changing  someone has told the british military man that waterloo was won upon the playing fields of eton  so he goes to eton and plays  one of these days he will be called upon to fight another waterloo  and afterwardswhen it is too latethey will explain to him that it was won not upon the play field but in the class room  from the mound on the old waterloo plain one can form a notion of what battles under former conditions must have been  the other battlefields of europe are rapidly disappearing  useful dutch cabbages as carlyle would have pointed out with justifiable satisfaction hiding the theatre of mans childish folly  you find generally speaking cobblers happily employed in cobbling shoes women gossipping cheerfully over the washtub on the spot where a hundred years ago according to the guidebook a thousand men dressed in blue and a thousand men dressed in red rushed together like quarrelsome foxterriers and worried each other to death  but the field of waterloo is little changed  the guide whose grandfather was present at the battlequite an extraordinary number of grandfathers must have fought at waterloo  there must have been whole regiments composed of grandfatherscan point out to you the ground across which every charge was delivered can show you every ridge still existing behind which the infantry crouched  the whole business was began and finished within a space little larger than a square mile  one can understand the advantage then to be derived from the perfect moving of the military machine the uses of the echelon the purposes of the linked battalion the manipulation of centre left wing and right wing  then it may have been worth while if war be ever worth the whilewhich grown men of sense are beginning to doubtto waste two years of a soldiers training teaching him the goosestep  in the twentieth century teaching soldiers the evolutions of the thirty years war is about as sensible as it would be loading our ironclads with canvas  i followed once a company of volunteers across blackfriars bridge on their way from southwark to the temple  at the bottom of ludgate hill the commanding officer a young but conscientious gentleman ordered left wheel  at once the vanguard turned down a narrow alleyi forget its namewhich would have led the troop into the purlieus of whitefriars where in all probability they would have been lost for ever  the whole company had to be halted rightabout faced and retired a hundred yards  then the order quick march was given  the vanguard shot across ludgate circus and were making for the meat market  at this point that young commanding officer gave up being a military man and talked sense  not that way he shouted  up fleet street and through middle temple lane  then without further trouble the army of the future went upon its way    ought stories to be true    there was once upon a time a charming young lady possessed of much taste who was asked by her anxious parent the years passing and family expenditure not decreasing which of the numerous and eligible young men then paying court to her she liked the best  she replied that was her difficulty she could not make up her mind which she liked the best  they were all so nice  she could not possibly select one to the exclusion of all the others  what she would have liked would have been to marry the lot but that she presumed was impracticable  i feel i resemble that young lady not so much in charm and beauty as in indecision of mind when the question is that of my favourite author or my favourite book  it is as if one were asked ones favourite food  there are times when one fancies an egg with ones tea  on other occasions one dreams of a kipper  today one clamours for lobsters  tomorrow one feels one never wishes to see a lobster again  one determines to settle down for a time to a diet of bread and milk and rice pudding  asked suddenly to say whether i preferred ices to soup or beefsteak to caviare i should be completely nonplussed  there may be readers who care for only one literary diet  i am a person of gross appetites requiring many authors to satisfy me there are moods when the savage strength of the bronte sisters is companionable to me  one rejoices in the unrelieved gloom of wuthering heights as in the lowering skies of a stormy autumn perhaps part of the marvel of the book comes from the knowledge that the authoress was a slight delicate young girl  one wonders what her future work would have been had she lived to gain a wider experience of life or was it well for her fame that nature took the pen so soon from her hand  her suppressed vehemence may have been better suited to those tangled yorkshire byways than to the more open cultivated fields of life  there is not much similarity between the two books yet when recalling emily bronte my thoughts always run on to olive schreiner here again was a young girl with the voice of a strong man  olive schreiner more fortunate has lived but i doubt if she will ever write a book that will remind us of her first  the story of an african farm is not a work to be repeated  we have advanced in literature of late  i can well remember the storm of indignation with which the african farm was received by mrs grundy and her then numerous but now happily diminishing school  it was a book that was to be kept from the hands of every young man and woman  but the hands of the young men and women stretched out and grasped it to their help  it is a curious idea this of mrs grundys that the young man and woman must never thinkthat all literature that does anything more than echo the conventions must be hidden away  then there are times when i love to gallop through history on sir walters broomstick  at other hours it is pleasant to sit in converse with wise george eliot  from her garden terrace i look down on loamshire and its commonplace people while in her quiet deep voice she tells me of the hidden hearts that beat and throb beneath these velveteen jackets and lace falls  who can help loving thackeray wittiest gentlest of men in spite of the faint suspicion of snobbishness that clings to him  there is something pathetic in the good mans horror of this snobbishness to which he himself was a victim  may it not have been an affectation born unconsciously of selfconsciousness  his heroes and heroines must needs be all fine folk fit company for lady and gentlemen readers  to him the livery was too often the man  under his stuffed calves even jeames de la pluche himself stood upon the legs of a man but thackeray could never see deeper than the silk stockings thackeray lived and died in clubland  one feels that the world was bounded for him by temple bar on the east and park lane on the west but what there was good in clubland he showed us and for the sake of the great gentlemen and sweet ladies that his kindly eyes found in that narrow region not too overpeopled with great gentlemen and sweet women let us honour him  tom jones peregrine pickle and tristram shandy are books a man is the better for reading if he read them wisely  they teach him that literature to be a living force must deal with all sides of life and that little help comes to us from that silly pretence of ours that we are perfect in all things leading perfect lives that only the villain of the story ever deviates from the path of rectitude  this is a point that needs to be considered by both the makers and the buyers of stories  if literature is to be regarded solely as the amusement of an idle hour then the less relationship it has to life the better  looking into a truthful mirror of nature we are compelled to think and when thought comes in at the window self satisfaction goes out by the door  should a novel or play call us to ponder upon the problems of existence or lure us from the dusty high road of the world for a while into the pleasant meadows of dreamland  if only the latter then let our heroes and our heroines be not what men and women are but what they should be  let angelina be always spotless and edwin always true  let virtue ever triumph over villainy in the last chapter and let us assume that the marriage service answers all the questions of the sphinx  very pleasant are these fairy tales where the prince is always brave and handsome where the princess is always the best and most beautiful princess that ever lived where one knows the wicked people at a glance by their ugliness and illtemper mistakes being thus rendered impossible where the good fairies are by nature more powerful than the bad where gloomy paths lead ever to fair palaces where the dragon is ever vanquished and where wellbehaved husbands and wives can rely upon living happily ever afterwards  the world is too much with us late and soon  it is wise to slip away from it at times to fairyland  but alas we cannot live in fairyland and knowledge of its geography is of little help to us on our return to the rugged country of reality  are not both branches of literature needful  by all means let us dream on midsummer nights of fond lovers led through devious paths to happiness by puck of virtuous dukesone finds such in fairyland of fate subdued by faith and gentleness  but may we not also in our more serious humours find satisfaction in thinking with hamlet or coriolanus  may not both dickens and zola have their booths in vanity fair  if literature is to be a help to us as well as a pastime it must deal with the ugly as well as with the beautiful it must show us ourselves not as we wish to appear but as we know ourselves to be  man has been described as a animal with aspirations reaching up to heaven and instincts rootedelsewhere  is literature to flatter him or reveal him to himself  of living writers it is not safe i suppose to speak except perhaps of those who have been with us so long that we have come to forget they are not of the past  has justice ever been done to ouidas undoubted genius by our shallow school of criticism always very clever in discovering faults as obvious as pimples on a fine face  her guardsmen toy with their food  her horses win the derby three years running  her wicked women throw guinea peaches from the windows of the star and garter into the thames at richmond  the distance being about three hundred and fifty yards it is a good throw  well well books are not made worth reading by the absence of absurdities  ouida possesses strength tenderness truth passion and these be qualities in a writer capable of carrying many more faults than ouida is burdened with  but that is the method of our little criticism  it views an artist as gulliver saw the brobdingnag ladies  it is too small to see them in their entirety a mole or a wart absorbs all its vision  why was not george gissing more widely read  if faithfulness to life were the key to literary success gissings sales would have been counted by the million instead of by the hundred  have mark twains literary qualities apart altogether from his humour been recognised in literary circles as they ought to have been huck finn would be a great work were there not a laugh in it from cover to cover  among the indians and some other savage tribes the fact that a member of the community has lost one of his senses makes greatly to his advantage he is then regarded as a superior person  so among a school of anglosaxon readers it is necessary to a man if he would gain literary credit that he should lack the sense of humour  one or two curious modern examples occur to me of literary success secured chiefly by this failing  all these authors are my favourites but such catholic taste is held nowadays to be no taste  one is told that if one loves shakespeare one must of necessity hate ibsen that one cannot appreciate wagner and tolerate beethoven that if we admit any merit in dore we are incapable of understanding whistler  how can i say which is my favourite novel  i can only ask myself which lives clearest in my memory which is the book i run to more often than to another in that pleasant half hour before the dinnerbell when with all apologies to good mr smiles it is useless to think of work  i find on examination that my david copperfield is more dilapidated than any other novel upon my shelves  as i turn its dog eared pages reading the familiar headlines mr micawber in difficulties mr micawber in prison i fall in love with dora mr barkis goes out with the tide my child wife traddles in a nest of rosespages of my own life recur to me so many of my sorrows so many of my joys are woven in my mind with this chapter or the other  that dayhow well i remember it when i read of davids wooing but doras death i was careful to skip  poor pretty little mrs copperfield at the gate holding up her baby in her arms is always associated in my memory with a childs cry long listened for i found the book face downwards on a chair weeks afterwards not moved from where i had hastily laid it  old friends all of you how many times have i not slipped away from my worries into your pleasant company  peggotty you dear soul the sight of your kind eyes is so good to me  our mutual friend mr charles dickens is prone we know just ever so slightly to gush good fellow that he is he can see no flaw in those he loves but you dear lady if you will permit me to call you by a name much abused he has drawn in true colours  i know you well with your big heart your quick temper your homely human ways of thought  you yourself will never guess your worthhow much the world is better for such as you  you think of yourself as of a commonplace person useful only for the making of pastry the darning of stockings and if a mannot a young man with only dim halfopened eyes but a man whom life had made keen to see the beauty that lies hidden beneath plain faceswere to kneel and kiss your red coarse hand you would be much astonished  but he would be a wise man peggotty knowing what things a man should take carelessly and for what things he should thank god who has fashioned fairness in many forms  mr wilkins micawber and you most excellent of faithful wives mrs emma micawber to you i also raise my hat  how often has the example of your philosophy saved me when i likewise have suffered under the temporary pressure of pecuniary liabilities when the sun of my prosperity too has sunk beneath the dark horizon of the worldin short when i also have found myself in a tight corner  i have asked myself what would the micawbers have done in my place  and i have answered myself  they would have sat down to a dish of lambs fry cooked and breaded by the deft hands of emma followed by a brew of punch concocted by the beaming wilkins and have forgotten all their troubles for the time being  whereupon seeing first that sufficient small change was in my pocket i have entered the nearest restaurant and have treated myself to a repast of such sumptuousness as the aforesaid small change would command emerging from that restaurant stronger and more fit for battle  and lo the sun of my prosperity has peeped at me from over the clouds with a sly wink as if to say cheer up i am only round the corner  cheery elastic mr and mrs micawber how would half the world face their fate but by the help of a kindly shallow nature such as yours i love to think that your sorrows can be drowned in nothing more harmful than a bowl of punch  heres to you emma and to you wilkins and to the twins  may you and such childlike folk trip lightly over the stones upon your path  may something ever turn up for you my dears  may the rain of life ever fall as april showers upon your simple bald head micawber  and you sweet dora let me confess i love you though sensible friends deem you foolish  ah silly dora fashioned by wise mother nature who knows that weakness and helplessness are as a talisman calling forth strength and tenderness in man trouble yourself not unduly about the oysters and the underdone mutton little woman good plain cooks at twenty pounds a year will see to these things for us  your work is to teach us gentleness and kindness  lay your foolish curls just here child  it is from such as you we learn wisdom  foolish wise folk sneer at you  foolish wise folk would pull up the laughing lilies the needless roses from the garden would plant in their places only useful wholesome cabbage  but the gardener knowing better plants the silly shortlived flowers foolish wise folk asking for what purpose  gallant traddles of the strong heart and the unruly hair sophy dearest of girls betsy trotwood with your gentlemanly manners and your womans heart you have come to me in shabby rooms making the dismal place seem bright  in dark hours your kindly faces have looked out at me from the shadows your kindly voices have cheered me  little emly and agnes it may be my bad taste but i cannot share my friend dickens enthusiasm for them  dickens good women are all too good for human natures daily food  esther summerson florence dombey little nellyou have no faults to love you by  scotts women were likewise mere illuminated texts  scott only drew one live heroinecatherine seton  his other women were merely the prizes the hero had to win in the end like the sucking pig or the leg of mutton for which the yokel climbs the greasy pole  that dickens could draw a woman to some likeness he proved by bella wilfer and estella in great expectations  but real women have never been popular in fiction  men readers prefer the false and women readers object to the truth  from an artistic point of view david copperfield is undoubtedly dickens best work  its humour is less boisterous its pathos less highly coloured  one of leechs pictures represents a cabman calmly sleeping in the gutter  oh poor dear hes ill says a tenderhearted lady in the crowd ill retorts a male bystander indignantly ill es ad too much of what i aint ad enough of  dickens suffered from too little of what some of us have too much of criticism  his work met with too little resistance to call forth his powers  too often his pathos sinks to bathos and this not from want of skill but from want of care  it is difficult to believe that the popular writer who allowed his sentimentalityor rather the publics sentimentalityto run away with him in such scenes as the death of paul dombey and little nell was the artist who painted the death of sidney carton and of barkis the willing  the death of barkis next to the passing of colonel newcome is to my thinking one of the most perfect pieces of pathos in english literature  no very deep emotion is concerned  he is a commonplace old man clinging foolishly to a commonplace box  his simple wife and the old boatmen stand by waiting calmly for the end  there is no straining after effect  one feels death enter dignifying all things and touched by that hand foolish old barkis grows great  in uriah heap and mrs gummidge dickens draws types rather than characters  pecksniff podsnap dolly varden mr bumble mrs gamp mark tapley turveydrop mrs jellybythese are not characters they are human characteristics personified  we have to go back to shakespeare to find a writer who through fiction has so enriched the thought of the people  admit all dickens faults twice over we still have one of the greatest writers of modern times  such people as these creations of dickens never lived says your little critic  nor was prometheus type of the spirit of man nor was niobe mother of all mothers a truthful picture of the citizen one was likely to meet often during a mornings stroll through athens  nor grew there ever a wood like to the forest of arden though every rosalind and orlando knows the path to glades having much resemblance thereto  steerforth upon whom dickens evidently prided himself i must confess never laid hold of me  he is a melodramatic young man  the worst i could have wished him would have been that he should marry rose dartle and live with his mother  it would have served him right for being so attractive  old peggotty and ham are of course impossible  one must accept them also as types  these brothers cheeryble these kits joe gargeries boffins garlands john peerybingles we will accept as types of the goodness that is in men though in real life the amount of virtue that dickens often wastes upon a single individual would by more economically minded nature be made to serve for fifty  to sum up david copperfield is a plain tale simply told and such are all books that live  eccentricities of style artistic trickery may please the critic of a day but literature is a story that interests us boys and girls men and women  it is a sad book and that again gives it an added charm in these sad later days humanity is nearing its old age and we have come to love sadness as the friend who has been longest with us  in the young days of our vigour we were merry  with ulysses boatmen we took alike the sunshine and the thunder with frolic welcome  the red blood flowed in our veins and we laughed and our tales were of strength and hope  now we sit like old men watching faces in the fire and the stories that we love are sad storieslike the stories we ourselves have lived    creatures that one day shall be men    i ought to like russia better than i do if only for the sake of the many good friends i am proud to possess amongst the russians  a large square photograph i keep always on my mantelpiece it helps me to maintain my head at that degree of distention necessary for the performance of all literary work  it presents in the centre a neatlywritten address in excellent english that i frankly confess i am never tired of reading around which are ranged some hundreds of names i am quite unable to read but which in spite of their strange lettering i know to be the names of good russian men and women to whom a year or two ago occurred the kindly idea of sending me as a christmas card this message of encouragement  the individual russian is one of the most charming creatures living  if he like you he does not hesitate to let you know it not only by every action possible but by what perhaps is just as useful in this grey old world by generous impulsive speech  we anglosaxons are apt to pride ourselves upon being undemonstrative  max adeler tells the tale of a boy who was sent out by his father to fetch wood  the boy took the opportunity of disappearing and did not show his face again beneath the paternal roof for over twenty years  then one evening a smiling well dressed stranger entered to the old couple and announced himself as their longlost child returned at last  well you havent hurried yourself grumbled the old man and blarm me if now you havent forgotten the wood  i was lunching with an englishman in a london restaurant one day  a man entered and took his seat at a table near by  glancing round and meeting my friends eyes he smiled and nodded  excuse me a minute said my friend i must just speak to my brotherhavent seen him for over five years  he finished his soup and leisurely wiped his moustache before strolling across and shaking hands  they talked for a while  then my friend returned to me  never thought to see him again observed my friend he was one of the garrison of that place in africawhats the name of itthat the mahdi attacked  only three of them escaped  always was a lucky beggar jim  but wouldnt you like to talk to him some more i suggested i can see you any time about this little business of ours  oh thats all right he answered we have just fixed it upshall be seeing him again tomorrow  i thought of this scene one evening while dining with some russian friends in a st petersburg hotel  one of the party had not seen his second cousin a mining engineer for nearly eighteen months  they sat opposite to one another and a dozen times at least during the course of the dinner one of them would jump up from his chair and run round to embrace the other  they would throw their arms about one another kissing one another on both cheeks and then sit down again with moist eyes  their behaviour among their fellow countrymen excited no astonishment whatever  but the russianss anger is as quick and vehement as his love  on another occasion i was supping with friends in one of the chief restaurants on the nevsky  two gentlemen at an adjoining table who up till the previous moment had been engaged in amicable conversation suddenly sprang to their feet and went for one another  one man secured the waterbottle which he promptly broke over the others head  his opponent chose for his weapon a heavy mahogany chair and leaping back for the purpose of securing a good swing lurched against my hostess  do please be careful said the lady  a thousand pardons madame returned the stranger from whom blood and water were streaming in equal copiousness and taking the utmost care to avoid interfering with our comfort he succeeded adroitly in flooring his antagonist by a welldirected blow  a policeman appeared upon the scene  he did not attempt to interfere but running out into the street communicated the glad tidings to another policeman  this is going to cost them a pretty penny observed my host who was calmly continuing his supper why couldnt they wait  it did cost them a pretty penny  some half a dozen policemen were round about before as many minutes had elapsed and each one claimed his bribe  then they wished both combatants goodnight and trooped out evidently in great good humour and the two gentlemen with wet napkins round their heads sat down again and laughter and amicable conversation flowed freely as before  they strike the stranger as a childlike people but you are possessed with a haunting sense of ugly traits beneath  the workersslaves it would be almost more correct to call themallow themselves to be exploited with the uncomplaining patience of intelligent animals yet every educated russian you talk to on the subject knows that revolution is coming  but he talks to you about it with the door shut for no man in russia can be sure that his own servants are not police spies  i was discussing politics with a russian official one evening in his study when his old housekeeper entered the rooma softeyed greyhaired woman who had been in his service over eight years and whose position in the household was almost that of a friend  he stopped abruptly and changed the conversation  so soon as the door was closed behind her again he explained himself  it is better to chat upon such matters when one is quite alone he laughed  but surely you can trust her i said she appears to be devoted to you all  it is safer to trust no one he answered  and then he continued from the point where we had been interrupted  it is gathering he said there are times when i almost smell blood in the air  i am an old man and may escape it but my children will have to suffersuffer as children must for the sins of their fathers  we have made brute beasts of the people and as brute beasts they will come upon us cruel and undiscriminating right and wrong indifferently going down before them  but it has to be  it is needed  it is a mistake to speak of the russian classes opposing to all progress a dead wall of selfishness  the history of russia will be the history of the french revolution over again but with this difference  that the educated classes the thinkers who are pushing forward the dumb masses are doing so with their eyes open  there will be no maribeau no danton to be appalled at a peoples ingratitude  the men who are today working for revolution in russia number among their ranks statesmen soldiers delicatelynurtured women rich landowners prosperous tradesmen students familiar with the lessons of history  they have no misconceptions concerning the blind monster into which they are breathing life  he will crush them they know it but with them he will crush the injustice and stupidity they have grown to hate more than they love themselves  the russian peasant when he rises will prove more terrible more pitiless than were the men of 1790  he is less intelligent more brutal  they sing a wild sad song these russian cattle the while they work  they sing it in chorus on the quays while hauling the cargo they sing it in the factory they chant on the weary endless steppes reaping the corn they may not eat  it is of the good time their masters are having of the feastings and the merrymakings of the laughter of the children of the kisses of the lovers  but the last line of every verse is the same  when you ask a russian to translate it for you he shrugs his shoulders  oh it means he says that their time will also comesome day  it is a pathetic haunting refrain  they sing it in the drawing rooms of moscow and st petersburg and somehow the light talk and laughter die away and a hush like a chill breath enters by the closed door and passes through  it is a curious song like the wailing of a tired wind and one day it will sweep over the land heralding terror  a scotsman i met in russia told me that when he first came out to act as manager of a large factory in st petersburg belonging to his scottish employers he unwittingly made a mistake the first week when paying his workpeople  by a miscalculation of the russian money he paid the men each one nearly a rouble short  he discovered his error before the following saturday and then put the matter right the men accepted his explanation with perfect composure and without any comment whatever  the thing astonished him  but you must have known i was paying you short he said to one of them  why didnt you tell me of it  oh answered the man we thought you were putting it in your own pocket and then if we had complained it would have meant dismissal for us  no one would have taken our word against yours  corruption appears to be so general throughout the whole of russia that all classes have come to accept it as part of the established order of things  a friend gave me a little dog to bring away with me  it was a valuable animal and i wished to keep it with me  it is strictly forbidden to take dogs into railway carriages  the list of the pains and penalties for doing so frightened me considerably  oh that will be all right my friend assured me have a few roubles loose in your pocket  i tipped the station master and i tipped the guard and started pleased with myself  but i had not anticipated what was in store for me  the news that an englishman with a dog in a basket and roubles in his pocket was coming must have been telegraphed all down the line  at almost every stoppingplace some enormous official wearing generally a sword and a helmet boarded the train  at first these fellows terrified me  i took them for fieldmarshals at least  visions of siberia crossed my mind  anxious and trembling i gave the first one a gold piece  he shook me warmly by the handi thought he was going to kiss me  if i had offered him my cheek i am sure he would have done so  with the next one i felt less apprehensive  for a couple of roubles he blessed me so i gathered and commending me to the care of the almighty departed  before i had reached the german frontier i was giving away the equivalent of english sixpences to men with the dress and carriage of major generals and to see their faces brighten up and to receive their heartfelt benediction was well worth the money  but to the man without roubles in his pocket russian officialdom is not so gracious  by the expenditure of a few more coins i got my dog through the customs without trouble and had leisure to look about me  a miserable object was being badgered by half a dozen men in uniform and hehis lean face puckered up into a snarlwas returning them snappish answers the whole scene suggested some half starved mongrel being worried by schoolboys  a slight informality had been discovered in his passport so a fellow traveller with whom i had made friends informed me  he had no roubles in his pocket and in consequence they were sending him back to st petersburgsome eighteen hours journeyin a wagon that in england would not be employed for the transport of oxen  it seemed a good joke to russian officialdom they would drop in every now and then look at him as he sat crouched in a corner of the waitingroom and pass out again laughing  the snarl had died from his face a dull listless indifference had taken its placethe look one sees on the face of a beaten dog after the beating is over when it is lying very still its great eyes staring into nothingness and one wonders whether it is thinking  the russian worker reads no newspaper has no club yet all things seem to be known to him  there is a prison on the banks of the neva in st petersburg  they say such things are done with now but up till very recently there existed a small cell therein below the level of the ice and prisoners placed there would be found missing a day or two afterwards nothing ever again known of them except perhaps to the fishes of the baltic  they talk of such like things among themselves  the sleighdrivers round their charcoal fire the fieldworkers going and coming in the grey dawn the factory workers their whispers deadened by the rattle of the looms  i was searching for a house in brussels some winters ago and there was one i was sent to in a small street leading out of the avenue louise  it was poorly furnished but rich in pictures large and small  they covered the walls of every room  these pictures explained to me the landlady an old haggard looking woman will not be left i am taking them with me to london they are all the work of my husband  he is arranging an exhibition  the friend who had sent me had told me the woman was a widow who had been living in brussels eking out a precarious existence as a lodginghouse keeper for the last ten years  you have married again i questioned her  the woman smiled  not again  i was married eighteen years ago in russia  my husband was transported to siberia a few days after we were married and i have never seen him since  i should have followed him she added only every year we thought he was going to be set free  he is really free now i asked  yes she answered  they set him free last week  he will join me in london  we shall be able to finish our honeymoon  she smiled revealing to me that once she had been a girl  i read in the english papers of the exhibition in london  it was said the artist showed much promise  so possibly a career may at last be opening out for him  nature has made life hard to russian rich and poor alike  to the banks of the neva with its ague and influenzabestowing fogs and mists one imagines that the devil himself must have guided peter the great  show me in all my dominions the most hopelessly unattractive site on which to build a city peter must have prayed and the devil having discovered the site on which st petersburg now stands must have returned to his master in high good feather  i think my dear peter i have found you something really unique it is a pestilent swamp to which a mighty river brings bitter blasts and marrowchilling fogs while during the brief summer time the wind will bring you sand  in this way you will combine the disadvantages of the north pole with those of the desert of sahara  in the winter time the russians light their great stoves and doubly barricade their doors and windows and in this atmosphere like to that of a greenhouse many of their women will pass six months never venturing out of doors  even the men only go out at intervals every office every shop is an oven  men of forty have white hair and parchment faces and the women are old at thirty  the farm labourers during the few summer months work almost entirely without sleep  they leave that for the winter when they shut themselves up like dormice in their hovels their store of food and vodka buried underneath the floor  for days together they sleep then wake and dig then sleep again  the russian party lasts all night  in an adjoining room are beds and couches half a dozen guests are always sleeping  an hour contents them then they rejoin the company and other guests take their places  the russian eats when he feels so disposed the table is always spread the guests come and go  once a year there is a great feast in moscow  the russian merchant and his friends sit down early in the day and a sort of thick sweet pancake is served up hot  the feast continues for many hours and the ambition of the russian merchant is to eat more than his neighbour  fifty or sixty of these hot cakes a man will consume at a sitting and a dozen funerals in moscow is often the result  an uncivilised people we call them in our lordly way but they are young  russian history is not yet three hundred years old  they will see us out i am inclined to think  their energy their intelligencewhen these show above the groundworkare monstrous  i have known a russian learn chinese within six months  english they learn it while you are talking to them  the children play at chess and study the violin for their own amusement  the world will be glad of russiawhen she has put her house in order    how to be happy though little    folks suffering from jingoism spreadeagleism chauvinismall such like isms to whatever country they belongwould be well advised to take a tour in holland  it is the idea of the moment that size spells happiness  the bigger the country the better one is for living there  the happiest frenchman cannot possibly be as happy as the most wretched britisher for the reason that britain owns many more thousands of square miles than france possesses  the swiss peasant compared with the russian serf must when he looks at the map of europe and asia feel himself to be a miserable creature  the reason that everybody in america is happy and good is to be explained by the fact that america has an area equal to that of the entire moon  the american citizen who has backed the wrong horse missed his train and lost his bag remembers this and feels bucked up again  according to this argument fishes should be the happiest of mortals the sea consistingat least so says my atlas  i have not measured it myselfof a hundred and fortyfour millions of square miles but maybe the sea is also divided in ways we wot not of  possibly the sardine who lives near the brittainy coast is sad and discontented because the norwegian sardine is the proud inhabitant of a larger sea  perhaps that is why he has left the brittainy coast ashamed of being a brittainy sardine he has emigrated to norway has become a naturalized norwegian sardine and is himself again  the happy londoner on foggy days can warm himself with the reflection that the sun never sets on the british empire  he does not often see the sun but that is a mere detail  he regards himself as the owner of the sun the sun begins his little day in the british empire ends his little day in the british empire  for all practical purposes the sun is part of the british empire  foolish people in other countries sit underneath it and feel warm but that is only their ignorance they do not know it is a british possession if they did they would feel cold  my views on this subject are i know heretical  i cannot get it into my unpatriotic head that size is the only thing worth worrying about  in england when i venture to express my outofdate opinions i am called a little englander  it fretted me at first i was becoming a mere shadow  but by now i have got used to it  it would be the same i feel wherever i went  in new york i should be a little american in constantinople a little turk  but i wanted to talk about holland  a holiday in holland serves as a corrective to exaggerated imperialistic notions  there are no poor in holland  they may be an unhappy people knowing what a little country it is they live in but if so they hide the fact  to all seeming the dutch peasant smoking his great pipe is as much a man as the whitechapel hawker or the moocher of the paris boulevard  i saw a beggar once in hollandin the townlet of enkhuisen  crowds were hurrying up from the side streets to have a look at him the idea at first seemed to be that he was doing it for a bet  he turned out to be a portuguese  they offered him work in the docksuntil he could get something better to doat wages equal in english money to about ten shillings a day  i inquired about him on my way back and was told he had borrowed a couple of forms from the foreman and had left by the evening train  it is not the country for the loafer  in holland work is easily found this takes away the charm of looking for it  a farm labourer in holland lives in a brickbuilt house of six rooms which generally belongs to him with an acre or so of ground and only eats meat once a day  the rest of his time he fills up on eggs and chicken and cheese and beer  but you rarely hear him grumble  his wife and daughter may be seen on sundays wearing gold and silver jewellery worth from fifty to one hundred pounds and there is generally enough old delft and pewter in the house to start a local museum anywhere outside holland  on high days and holidays of which in holland there are plenty the average dutch vrouw would be well worth running away with  the dutch peasant girl has no need of an illustrated journal once a week to tell her what the fashion is she has it in the portrait of her mother or of her grandmother hanging over the glittering chimneypiece  when the dutchwoman builds a dress she builds it to last it descends from mother to daughter but it is made of sound material in the beginning  a lady friend of mine thought the dutch costume would serve well for a fancydress ball so set about buying one but abandoned the notion on learning what it would cost her  a dutch girl in her sunday clothes must be worth fifty pounds before you come to ornaments  in certain provinces she wears a closefitting helmet made either of solid silver or of solid gold  the dutch gallant before making himself known walks on tiptoe a little while behind the loved one and looks at himself in her headdress just to make sure that his hat is on straight and his front curl just where it ought to be  in most other european countries national costume is dying out  the slopshop is year by year extending its hideous trade  but the country of rubens and rembrandt of teniers and gerard dow remains still true to art  the picture postcard does not exaggerate  the men in those wondrous baggy knickerbockers from the pockets of which you sometimes see a couple of chickens heads protruding in gaudy coloured shirts in worsted hose and mighty sabots smoking their great pipesthe women in their petticoats of many hues in gorgeously embroidered vest in chemisette of dazzling white crowned with a halo of many frills glittering in gold and silverare not the creatures of an artists fancy  you meet them in their thousands on holiday afternoons walking gravely arm in arm flirting with sober dutch stolidity  on colder days the women wear brightcoloured capes made of fine spun silk from underneath the ample folds of which you sometimes hear a little cry and sometimes a little hooded head peeps out regards with preternatural thoughtfulness the toylike world without then dives back into shelter  as for the childrenwomen in miniature the single difference in dress being the gay pinaforeyou can only say of them that they look like dutch dolls  but such plump contented cheerful little dolls  you remember the holloweyed palefaced dolls you see swarming in the great big and therefore should be happy countries and wish that mere land surface were of less importance to our statesmen and our able editors and the happiness and wellbeing of the mere human items worth a little more of their thought  the dutch peasant lives surrounded by canals and reaches his cottage across a drawbridge  i suppose it is in the blood of the dutch child not to tumble into a canal and the dutch mother never appears to anticipate such possibility  one can imagine the average english mother trying to bring up a family in a house surrounded by canals she would never have a minutes peace until the children were in bed but then the mere sight of a canal to the english child suggests the delights of a sudden and unexpected bath  i put it to a dutchman once  did the dutch child by any chance ever fall into a canal  yes he replied cases have been known  dont you do anything for it i enquired  oh yes he answered we haul them out again  but what i mean is i explained dont you do anything to prevent their falling into save them from falling in again  yes he answered we spank em  there is always a wind in holland it comes from over the sea  there is nothing to stay its progress  it leaps the low dykes and sweeps with a shriek across the sad soft dunes and thinks it is going to have a good time and play havoc in the land  but the dutchman laughs behind his great pipe as it comes to him shouting and roaring welcome my hearty welcome he chuckles come blustering and bragging the bigger you are the better i like you  and when it is once in the land behind the long straight dykes behind the waving line of sandy dunes he seizes hold of it and will not let it go till it has done its tale of work  the wind is the dutchmans servant before he lets it loose again it has turned ten thousand mills has pumped the water and sawn the wood has lighted the town and worked the loom and forged the iron and driven the great slow silent wherry and played with the children in the garden  it is a sober wind when it gets back to sea worn and weary leaving the dutchman laughing behind his everlasting pipe  there are canals in holland down which you pass as though a field of windblown corn a soft low rustling murmur ever in your ears  it is the ceaseless whirl of the great mill sails  far out at sea the winds are as foolish savages fighting shrieking tearing purposeless  here in the street of mills it is a civilized wind crooning softly while it labours  what charms one in holland is the neatness and cleanliness of all about one  maybe to the dutchman there are drawbacks  in a dutch household life must be one long springcleaning  no milkpail is considered fit that cannot just as well be used for a lookingglass the great brass pans hanging under the pent house roof outside the cottage door flash like burnished gold  you could eat your dinner off the redtiled floor but that the deal table scrubbed to the colour of cream cheese is more convenient  by each threshold stands a row of empty sabots and woebetide the dutchman who would dream of crossing it in anything but his stockinged feet  there is a fashion in sabots  every spring they are freshly painted one district fancies an orange yellow another a red a third white suggesting purity and innocence  members of the smart set indulge in ornamentation a frieze in pink a star upon the toe  walking in sabots is not as easy as it looks  attempting to run in sabots i do not recommend to the beginner  how do you run in sabots i asked a dutchman once  i had been experimenting and had hurt myself  we dont run answered the dutchman  and observation has proved to me he was right  the dutch boy when he runs puts them for preference on his hands and hits other dutch boys over the head with them as he passes  the roads in holland straight and level and shaded all the way with trees look from the railwaycarriage window as if they would be good for cycling but this is a delusion  i crossed in the boat from harwich once with a wellknown black and white artist and an equally wellknown and highly respected humorist  they had their bicycles with them intending to tour holland  i met them a fortnight later in delft or rather i met their remains  i was horrified at first  i thought it was drink  they could not stand still they could not sit still they trembled and shook in every limb their teeth chattered when they tried to talk  the humorist hadnt a joke left in him  the artist could not have drawn his own salary he would have dropped it on the way to his pocket  the dutch roads are paved their entire length with cobblesbig round cobbles over which your bicycle leaps and springs and plunges  if you would see holland outside the big towns a smattering of dutch is necessary  if you know german there is not much difficulty dutchi speak as an amateurappears to be very bad german mis pronounced  myself i find my german goes well in holland even better than in germany  the anglosaxon should not attempt the dutch g  it is hopeless to think of succeeding and the attempt has been known to produce internal rupture  the dutchman appears to keep his g in his stomach and to haul it up when wanted  myself i find the ordinary g preceded by a hiccough and followed by a sob the nearest i can get to it  but they tell me it is not quite right yet  one needs to save up beforehand if one desires to spend any length of time in holland  one talks of dear old england but the dearest land in all the world is little holland  the florin there is equal to the franc in france and to the shilling in england  they tell you that cigars are cheap in holland  a cheap dutch cigar will last you a day  it is not until you have forgotten the taste of it that you feel you ever want to smoke again  i knew a man who reckoned that he had saved hundreds of pounds by smoking dutch cigars for a month steadily  it was years before he again ventured on tobacco  watching building operations in holland brings home to you forcibly what previously you have regarded as a meaningless formulanamely that the country is built upon piles  a dozen feet below the level of the street one sees the labourers working in fishermens boots up to their knees in water driving the great wooden blocks into the mud  many of the older houses slope forward at such an angle that you almost fear to pass beneath them  i should be as nervous as a kitten living in one of the upper storeys  but the dutchman leans out of a window that is hanging above the street six feet beyond the perpendicular and smokes contentedly  they have a merry custom in holland of keeping the railway time twenty minutes ahead of the town timeor is it twenty minutes behind  i never can remember when im there and i am not sure now the dutchman himself never knows  youve plenty of time he says  but the train goes at ten you say the station is a mile away and it is now halfpast nine  yes but that means tentwenty he answers you have nearly an hour  five minutes later he taps you on the shoulder  my mistake its twenty to ten  i was thinking it was the other way about  another argues with him that his first idea was right  they work it out by scientific methods  meanwhile you have dived into a cab  the result is always the same  you are either forty minutes too soon or you have missed the train by twenty minutes  a dutch platform is always crowded with women explaining volubly to their husbands either that there was not any need to have hurried or else that the thing would have been to have started half an hour before they did the man in both cases being of course to blame  the men walk up and down and swear  the idea has been suggested that the railway time and the town time should be made to conform  the argument against the idea is that if it were carried out there would be nothing left to put the dutchman out and worry him    should we say what we think or think what we say    a mad friend of mine will have it that the characteristic of the age is makebelieve  he argues that all social intercourse is founded on makebelieve  a servant enters to say that mr and mrs bore are in the drawingroom  oh damn says the man  hush says the woman  shut the door susan  how often am i to tell you never to leave the door open  the man creeps upstairs on tiptoe and shuts himself in his study the woman does things before a lookingglass waits till she feels she is sufficiently mistress of herself not to show her feelings and then enters the drawingroom with outstretched hands and the look of one welcoming an angels visit  she says how delighted she is to see the boreshow good it was of them to come  why did they not bring more bores with them  where is naughty bore junior  why does he never come to see her now  she will have to be really angry with him  and sweet little flossie bore  too young to pay calls nonsense  an at home day is not worth having where all the bores are not  the bores who had hoped that she was outwho have only called because the etiquette book told them that they must call at least four times in the season explain how they have been trying and trying to come  this afternoon recounts mrs bore we were determined to come john dear i said this morning i shall go and see dear mrs bounder this afternoon no matter what happens  the idea conveyed is that the prince of wales on calling at the bores was told that he could not come in  he might call again in the evening or come some other day  that afternoon the bores were going to enjoy themselves in their own way they were going to see mrs bounder  and how is mr bounder demands mrs bore  mrs bounder remains mute for a moment straining her ears  she can hear him creeping past the door on his way downstairs  she hears the front door softly opened and closedto  she wakes as from a dream she has been thinking of the sorrow that will fall on bounder when he returns home later and learns what he has missed  and thus it is not only with the bores and bounders but even with us who are not bores or bounders  society in all ranks is founded on the makebelieve that everybody is charming that we are delighted to see everybody that everybody is delighted to see us that it is so good of everybody to come that we are desolate at the thought that they really must go now  which would we rather dostop and finish our cigar or hasten into the drawingroom to hear miss screecher sing  can you ask us  we tumble over each other in our hurry  miss screecher would really rather not sing but if we insistwe do insist  miss screecher with pretty reluctance consents  we are careful not to look at one another  we sit with our eyes fixed on the ceiling  miss screecher finishes and rises  but it was so short we say so soon as we can be heard above the applause  is miss screecher quite sure that was the whole of it  or has she been playing tricks upon us the naughty lady defrauding us of a verse  miss screecher assures us that the fault is the composers  but she knows another  at this hint our faces lighten again with gladness  we clamour for more  our hosts wine is always the most extraordinary we have ever tasted no not another glass we dare notdoctors orders very strict our hosts cigar  we did not know they made such cigars in this workaday world  no we really could not smoke another  well if he will be so pressing may we put it in our pocket  the truth is we are not used to high smoking  our hostesss coffee  would she confide to us her secret  the baby  we hardly trust ourselves to speak  the usual babywe have seen it  as a rule to be candid we never could detect much beauty in babieshave always held the usual gush about them to be insincere  but this baby  we are almost on the point of asking them where they got it  it is just the kind we wanted for ourselves  little janets recitation  a visit to the dentist  hitherto the amateur reciter has not appealed to us  but this is genius surely  she ought to be trained for the stage  her mother does not altogether approve of the stage  we plead for the stagethat it may not be deprived of such talent  every bride is beautiful  every bride looks charming in a simple costume offor further particulars see local papers  every marriage is a cause for universal rejoicing  with our wineglass in our hand we picture the ideal life we know to be in store for them  how can it be otherwise  she the daughter of her mother  cheers  he well we all know him  more cheers  also involuntary guffaw from illregulated young man at end of table promptly suppressed  we carry our makebelieve even into our religion  we sit in church and in voices swelling with pride mention to the almighty at stated intervals that we are miserable wormsthat there is no good in us this sort of thing we gather is expected of us it does us no harm and is supposed to please  we makebelieve that every woman is good that every man is honest until they insist on forcing us against our will to observe that they are not  then we become very angry with them and explain to them that they being sinners are not folk fit to mix with us perfect people  our grief when our rich aunt dies is hardly to be borne  drapers make fortunes helping us to express feebly our desolation  our only consolation is that she has gone to a better world  everybody goes to a better world when they have got all they can out of this one  we stand around the open grave and tell each other so  the clergyman is so assured of it that to save time they have written out the formula for him and had it printed in a little book  as a child it used to surprise methis fact that everybody went to heaven thinking of all the people that had died i pictured the place overcrowded  almost i felt sorry for the devil nobody ever coming his way so to speak  i saw him in imagination a lonely old gentleman sitting at his gate day after day hoping against hope muttering to himself maybe that it hardly seemed worth while from his point of view keeping the show open  an old nurse whom i once took into my confidence was sure if i continued talking in this sort of way that he would get me anyhow  i must have been an evil hearted youngster  the thought of how he would welcome me the only human being that he had seen for years had a certain fascination for me for once in my existence i should be made a fuss about  at every public meeting the chief speaker is always a jolly good fellow  the man from mars reading our newspapers would be convinced that every member of parliament was a jovial kindly high hearted generoussouled saint with just sufficient humanity in him to prevent the angels from carrying him off bodily  do not the entire audience moved by one common impulse declare him three times running and in stentorian voice to be this jolly good fellow  so say all of them  we have always listened with the most intense pleasure to the brilliant speech of our friend who has just sat down when you thought we were yawning we were drinking in his eloquence openmouthed  the higher one ascends in the social scale the wider becomes this necessary base of makebelieve  when anything sad happens to a very big person the lesser people round about him hardly care to go on living  seeing that the world is somewhat overstocked with persons of importance and that something or another generally is happening to them one wonders sometimes how it is the world continues to exist  once upon a time there occurred an illness to a certain good and great man  i read in my daily paper that the whole nation was plunged in grief  people dining in public restaurants on being told the news by the waiter dropped their heads upon the table and sobbed  strangers meeting in the street flung their arms about one another and cried like little children  i was abroad at the time but on the point of returning home  i almost felt ashamed to go  i looked at myself in the glass and was shocked at my own appearance it was that of a man who had not been in trouble for weeks  i felt that to burst upon this griefstricken nation with a countenance such as mine would be to add to their sorrow  it was borne in upon me that i must have a shallow egotistical nature  i had had luck with a play in america and for the life of me i could not look grief stricken  there were moments when if i was not keeping a watch over myself i found myself whistling  had it been possible i would have remained abroad till some stroke of illfortune had rendered me more in tune with my fellowcountrymen but business was pressing  the first man i talked to on dover pier was a customs house official  you might have thought sorrow would have made him indifferent to a mere matter of fortyeight cigars instead of which he appeared quite pleased when he found them  he demanded threeandfourpence and chuckled when he got it  on dover platform a little girl laughed because a lady dropped a handbox on a dog but then children are always callousor perhaps she had not heard the news  what astonished me most however was to find in the railway carriage a respectable looking man reading a comic journal  true he did not laugh much  he had got decency enough for that but what was a griefstricken citizen doing with a comic journal anyhow  before i had been in london an hour i had come to the conclusion that we english must be a people of wonderful selfcontrol  the day before according to the newspapers the whole country was in serious danger of pining away and dying of a broken heart  in one day the nation had pulled itself together  we have cried all day they had said to themselves we have cried all night  it does not seem to have done much good  now let us once again take up the burden of life some of themi noticed it in the hotel diningroom that evening were taking quite kindly to their food again  we make believe about quite serious things  in war each countrys soldiers are always the most courageous in the world  the other countrys soldiers are always treacherous and tricky that is why they sometimes win  literature is the art of makebelieve  now all of you sit round and throw your pennies in the cap says the author and i will pretend that there lives in bayswater a young lady named angelina who is the most beautiful young lady that ever existed  and in notting hill we will pretend there resides a young man named edwin who is in love with angelina  and then there being sufficient pennies in the cap the author starts away and pretends that angelina thought this and said that and that edwin did all sorts of wonderful things  we know he is making it all up as he goes along  we know he is making up just what he thinks will please us  he on the other hand has to makebelieve that he is doing it because he cannot help it he being an artist but we know well enough that were we to stop throwing the pennies into the cap he would find out precious soon that he could  the theatrical manager bangs his drum  walk up walk up he cries we are going to pretend that mrs johnson is a princess and old man johnson is going to pretend to be a pirate  walk up walk up and be in time  so mrs johnson pretending to be a princess comes out of a wobbly thing that we agree to pretend is a castle and old man johnson pretending to be a pirate is pushed up and down on another wobbly thing that we agree to pretend is the ocean  mrs johnson pretends to be in love with him which we know she is not  and johnson pretends to be a very terrible person and mrs johnson pretends till eleven oclock to believe it  and we pay prices varying from a shilling to halfasovereign to sit for two hours and listen to them  but as i explained at the beginning my friend is a mad sort of person    is the american husband made entirely of stained glass    i am glad i am not an american husband  at first sight this may appear a remark uncomplimentary to the american wife  it is nothing of the sort  it is the other way about  we in europe have plenty of opportunity of judging the american wife  in america you hear of the american wife you are told stories about the american wife you see her portrait in the illustrated journals  by searching under the heading foreign intelligence you can find out what she is doing but here in europe we know her meet her face to face talk to her flirt with her  she is charming delightful  that is why i say i am glad i am not an american husband  if the american husband only knew how nice was the american wife he would sell his business and come over here where now and then he could see her  years ago when i first began to travel about europe i argued to myself that america must be a deadly place to live in  how sad it is i thought to myself to meet thus wherever one goes american widows by the thousand  in one narrow bystreet of dresden i calculated fourteen american mothers possessing nineandtwenty american children and not a father among themnot a single husband among the whole fourteen  i pictured fourteen lonely graves scattered over the united states  i saw as in a vision those fourteen headstones of best material handcarved recording the virtues of those fourteen dead and buried husbands  odd thought i to myself decidedly odd  these american husbands they must be a delicate type of humanity  the wonder is their mothers ever reared them  they marry fine girls the majority of them two or three sweet children are born to them and after that there appears to be no further use for them as far as this world is concerned  can nothing be done to strengthen their constitutions would a tonic be of any help to them  not the customary tonic i dont mean the sort of tonic merely intended to make gouty old gentlemen feel they want to buy a hoop but the sort of tonic for which it was claimed that three drops poured upon a ham sandwich and the thing would begin to squeak  it struck me as pathetic the picture of these american widows leaving their native land coming over in shiploads to spend the rest of their blighted lives in exile  the mere thought of america i took it had for ever become to them distasteful  the ground that once his feet had pressed  the old familiar places once lighted by his smile  everything in america would remind them of him snatching their babes to their heaving bosoms they would leave the country where lay buried all the joy of their lives seek in the retirement of paris florence or vienna oblivion of the past  also it struck me as beautiful the noble resignation with which they bore their grief hiding their sorrow from the indifferent stranger  some widows make a fuss go about for weeks looking gloomy and depressed making not the slightest effort to be merry  these fourteen widowsi knew them personally all of them i lived in the same streetwhat a brave show of cheerfulness they put on  what a lesson to the common or european widow the humpy type of widow  one could spend whole days in their companyi had done itcommencing quite early in the morning with a sleighing excursion finishing up quite late in the evening with a little supper party followed by an impromptu dance and never detect from their outward manner that they were not thoroughly enjoying themselves  from the mothers i turned my admiring eyes towards the children this is the secret of american success said i to myself this high spirited courage this spartan contempt for suffering  look at them the gallant little men and women  who would think that they had lost a father  why i have seen a british child more upset at losing sixpence  talking to a little girl one day i enquired of her concerning the health of her father  the next moment i could have bitten my tongue out remembering that there wasnt such a thing as a fathernot an american fatherin the whole street  she did not burst into tears as they do in the storybooks  she said  he is quite well thank you simply pathetically just like that  i am sure of it i replied with fervour well and happy as he deserves to be and one day you will find him again you will go to him  ah yes she answered a shining light it seemed to me upon her fair young face  momma says she is getting just a bit tired of this onehorse sort of place  she is quite looking forward to seeing him again  it touched me very deeply  this weary woman tired of her long bereavement actually looking forward to the fearsome passage leading to where her loved one waited for her in a better land  for one bright breezy creature i grew to feel a real regard  all the months that i had known her seen her almost daily never once had i heard a single cry of pain escape her lips never once had i heard her cursing fate  of the many who called upon her in her charming flat not one had ever to my knowledge offered her consolation or condolence  it seemed to me cruel callous  the overburdened heart finding no outlet for its imprisoned grief finding no sympathetic ear into which to pour its tale of woe breaks we are told anyhow it isnt good for it  i decidedno one else seeming keenthat i would supply that sympathetic ear  the very next time i found myself alone with her i introduced the subject  you have been living here in dresden a long time have you not i asked  about five years she answered on and off  and all alone i commented with a sigh intended to invite to confidence  well hardly alone she corrected me while a look of patient resignation added dignity to her piquant features  you see there are the dear children always round about me during the holidays  besides she added the people here are real kind to me they hardly ever let me feel myself alone  we make up little parties you know picnics and excursions  and then of course there is the opera and the symphony concerts and the subscription dances  the dear old king has been doing a good deal this winter too and i must say the embassy folks have been most thoughtful so far as i am concerned  no it would not be right for me to complain of loneliness not now that i have got to know a few people as it were  but dont you miss your husband i suggested  a cloud passed over her usually sunny face  oh please dont talk of him she said it makes me feel real sad thinking about him  but having commenced i was determined that my sympathy should not be left to waste  what did he die of i asked  she gave me a look the pathos of which i shall never forget  say young man she cried are you trying to break it to me gently  because if so id rather you told me straight out  what did he die of  then isnt he dead i asked i mean so far as you know  never heard a word about his being dead till you started the idea she retorted  so far as i know hes alive and well  i said that i was sorry  i went on to explain that i did not mean i was sorry to hear that in all probability he was alive and well what i meant was i was sorry i had introduced a painful subject  whats a painful subject  why your husband i replied  but why should you call him a painful subject  i had an idea she was getting angry with me  she did not say so  i gathered it  but i had to explain myself somehow  well i answered i take it you didnt get on well together and i am sure it must have been his fault  now look here she said dont you breathe a word against my husband or we shall quarrel  a nicer dearer fellow never lived  then what did you divorce him for i asked  it was impertinent it was unjustifiable  my excuse is that the mystery surrounding the american husband had been worrying me for months  here had i stumbled upon the opportunity of solving it  instinctively i clung to my advantage  there hasnt been any divorce she said  there isnt going to be any divorce  youll make me cross in another minute  but i was becoming reckless  he is not dead  you are not divorced from him  where is he i demanded with some heat  where is he she replied astonished  where should he be  at home of course  i looked around the luxuriouslyfurnished room with its air of cosy comfort of substantial restfulness  what home i asked  what home  why our home in detroit  what is he doing there  i had become so much in earnest that my voice had assumed unconsciously an authoritative tone  presumably it hypnotised her for she answered my questions as though she had been in the witnessbox  how do i know  how can i possibly tell you what he is doing  what do people usually do at home  answer the questions madam dont ask them  what are you doing here  quite truthfully if you please  my eyes were fixed upon her  enjoying myself  he likes me to enjoy myself  besides i am educating the children  you mean they are here at boardingschool while you are gadding about  what is wrong with american education  when did you see your husband last  last  let me see  no last christmas i was in berlin  it must have been the christmas before i think  if he is the dear kind fellow you say he is how is it you havent seen him for two years  because as i tell you he is at home in detroit  how can i see him when i am here in dresden and he is in detroit  you do ask foolish questions  he means to try and come over in the summer if he can spare the time and then of course   answer my questions please  ive spoken to you once about it  do you think you are performing your duty as a wife enjoying yourself in dresden and berlin while your husband is working hard in detroit  he was quite willing for me to come  the american husband is a good fellow who likes his wife to enjoy herself  i am not asking for your views on the american husband  i am asking your views on the american wifeon yourself  the american husband appears to be a sort of stainedglass saint and you american wives are imposing upon him  it is doing you no good and it wont go on for ever  there will come a day when the american husband will wake up to the fact he is making a fool of himself and by over indulgence overdevotion turning the american woman into a heartless selfish creature  what sort of a home do you think it is in detroit with you and the children over here  tell me is the american husband made entirely of driven snow with blood distilled from moonbeams or is he composed of the ordinary ingredients because if the latter you take my advice and get back home  i take it that in america proper there are millions of real homes where the woman does her duty and plays the game  but also it is quite clear there are thousands of homes in america mere echoing rooms where the man walks by himself his wife and children scattered over europe  it isnt going to work it isnt right that it should work  you take the advice of a sincere friend  pack upyou and the childrenand get home  i left  it was growing late  i felt it was time to leave  whether she took my counsel i cannot say  i only know that there still remain in europe a goodly number of american wives to whom it is applicable    does the young man know everything worth knowing    i am told that american professors are mourning the lack of ideals at columbia universitypossibly also at other universities scattered through the united states  if it be any consolation to these mourning american professors i can assure them that they do not mourn alone  i live not far from oxford and enjoy the advantage of occasionally listening to the jeremiads of english university professors  more than once a german professor has done me the honour to employ me as an object on which to sharpen his english  he also has mourned similar lack of ideals at heidelberg at bonn  youth is youth all the world over it has its own ideals they are not those of the university professor  the explanation is tolerably simple youth is young and the university professor generally speaking is middleaged  i can sympathise with the mourning professor  i in my time have suffered like despair  i remember the day so well it was my twelfth birthday  i recall the unholy joy with which i reflected that for the future my unfortunate parents would be called upon to pay for me full railway fare it marked a decided step towards manhood  i was now in my teens  that very afternoon there came to visit us a relative of ours  she brought with her three small children  a girl aged six a precious goldenhaired thing in a lace collar that called itself a boy aged five and a third still smaller creature it might have been male it might have been female i could not have told you at the time i cannot tell you now  this collection of atoms was handed over to me  now show yourself a man said my dear mother remember you are in your teens  take them out for a walk and amuse them and mind nothing happens to them  to the children themselves their own mother gave instructions that they were to do everything that i told them and not to tear their clothes or make themselves untidy  these directions even to myself at the time appeared contradictory  but i said nothing  and out into the wilds the four of us departed  i was an only child  my own infancy had passed from my memory  to me at twelve the ideas of six were as incomprehensible as are those of twenty to the university professor of forty  i wanted to be a pirate  round the corner and across the road building operations were in progress  planks and poles lay ready to ones hand  nature in the neighbourhood had placed conveniently a shallow pond  it was saturday afternoon  the nearest publichouse was a mile away immunity from interference by the british workman was thus assured it occurred to me that by placing my three depressed looking relatives on one raft attacking them myself from another taking the eldest girls sixpence away from her disabling their raft and leaving them to drift without a rudder innocent amusement would be provided for half an hour at least  they did not want to play at pirates  at first sight of the pond the thing that called itself a boy began to cry  the sixyearold lady said she did not like the smell of it  not even after i had explained the game to them were they any the more enthusiastic for it  i proposed red indians  they could go to sleep in the unfinished building upon a sack of lime i would creep up through the grass set fire to the house and dance round it whooping and waving my tomahawk watching with fiendish delight the frantic but futile efforts of the palefaces to escape their doom  it did not catch onnot even that  the precious thing in the lace collar began to cry again  the creature concerning whom i could not have told you whether it was male or female made no attempt at argument but started to run it seemed to have taken a dislike to this particular field  it stumbled over a scaffolding pole and then it also began to cry  what could one do to amuse such people  i left it to them to propose something  they thought they would like to play at mothersnot in this field but in some other field  the eldest girl would be mother  the other two would represent her children  they had been taken suddenly ill  waterworks as i had christened him was to hold his hands to his middle and groan  his face brightened up at the suggestion  the nondescript had the toothache  it took up its part without a moments hesitation and set to work to scream  i could be the doctor and look at their tongues  that was their ideal game  as i have said remembering that afternoon i can sympathise with the university professor mourning the absence of university ideals in youth  possibly at six my own ideal game may have been mothers  looking back from the pile of birthdays upon which i now stand it occurs to me that very probably it was  but from the perspective of twelve the reflection that there were beings in the world who could find recreation in such fooling saddened me  eight years later his father not being able to afford the time i conducted master waterworks now a healthy uninteresting gawky lad to a school in switzerland  it was my first continental trip i should have enjoyed it better had he not been with me  he thought paris a beastly hole  he did not share my admiration for the frenchwoman he even thought her badly dressed  why shes so tied up she cant walk straight was the only impression she left upon him  we changed the subject it irritated me to hear him talk  the beautiful junolike creatures we came across further on in germany he said were too fat  he wanted to see them run  i found him utterly soulless  to expect a boy to love learning and culture is like expecting him to prefer old vintage claret to gooseberry wine  culture for the majority is an acquired taste  speaking personally i am entirely in agreement with the university professor  i find knowledge prompting to observation and leading to reflection the most satisfactory luggage with which a traveller through life can provide himself  i would that i had more of it  to be able to enjoy a picture is of more advantage than to be able to buy it  all that the university professor can urge in favour of idealism i am prepared to endorse  but then i amlet us say thirtynine  at fourteen my candid opinion was that he was talking rot  i looked at the old gentleman himselfa narrowchested spectacled old gentleman who lived up a by street  he did not seem to have much fun of any sort  it was not my ideal  he told me things had been written in a language called greek that i should enjoy reading but i had not even read all captain marryat  there were tales by sir walter scott and jack harkaways schooldays  i felt i could wait a while  there was a chap called aristophanes who had written comedies satirising the political institutions of a country that had disappeared two thousand years ago  i say without shame drury lane pantomime and barnums circus called to me more strongly  wishing to give the old gentleman a chance i dipped into translations  some of these old fellows were not as bad as i had imagined them  a party named homer had written some really interesting stuff  here and there maybe he was a bit longwinded but taking him as a whole there was go in him  there was another of themovid was his name  he could tell a story ovid could  he had imagination  he was almost as good as robinson crusoe  i thought it would please my professor telling him that i was reading these his favourite authors  reading them he cried but you dont know greek or latin  but i know english i answered they have all been translated into english  you never told me that  it appeared it was not the same thing  there were subtle delicacies of diction bound to escape even the best translator  these subtle delicacies of diction i could enjoy only by devoting the next seven or eight years of my life to the study of greek and latin  it will grieve the university professor to hear it but the enjoyment of those subtle delicacies of diction did not appear to mei was only fourteen at the time please rememberto be worth the time and trouble  the boy is materially inclinedthe mourning american professor has discovered it  i did not want to be an idealist living up a back street  i wanted to live in the biggest house in the best street of the town  i wanted to ride a horse wear a fur coat and have as much to eat and drink as ever i liked  i wanted to marry the most beautiful woman in the world to have my name in the newspaper and to know that everybody was envying me  mourn over it my dear professor as you willthat is the ideal of youth and so long as human nature remains what it is will continue to be so  it is a materialistic ideala sordid ideal  maybe it is necessary  maybe the world would not move much if the young men started thinking too early  they want to be rich so they fling themselves frenziedly into the struggle  they build the towns and make the railway tracks hew down the forests dig the ore out of the ground  there comes a day when it is borne in upon them that trying to get rich is a poor sort of gamethat there is only one thing more tiresome than being a millionaire and that is trying to be a millionaire  but meanwhile the world has got its work done  the american professor fears that the artistic development of america leaves much to be desired  i fear the artistic development of most countries leaves much to be desired  why the athenians themselves sandwiched their drama between wrestling competitions and boxing bouts  the plays of sophocles or euripides were given as side shows  the chief items of the fair were the games and races besides america is still a young man  it has been busy getting on in the world  it has not yet quite finished  yet there are signs that young america is approaching the thirtynines  he is finding a little time a little money to spare for art  one can almost hear young americanot quite so young as he wassaying to mrs europe as he enters and closes the shop door  well maam here i am and maybe youll be glad to hear ive a little money to spend  yes maam ive fixed things all right across the water we shant starve  so now maam you and i can have a chat concerning this art ive been hearing so much about lets have a look at it maam trot it out and dont you be afraid of putting a fair price upon it  i am inclined to think that mrs europe has not hesitated to put a good price upon the art she has sold to uncle sam  i am afraid mrs europe has occasionally unloaded on uncle sam  i talked to a certain dealer one afternoon now many years ago at the uwantit club  what is the next picture likely to be missing i asked him in the course of general conversation  thome little thing of hoppnerth if it mutht be he replied with confidence  hoppner i murmured i seem to have heard the name  yeth youll hear it a bit oftener during the next eighteen month or tho  you take care you dont get tired of hearing it thath all he laughed  yeth he continued thoughtfully reynoldth ith played out  nothing much to be made of gainthborough either  dealing in that lot now why itth like keeping a potht offith  hoppnerth the coming man  youve been buying hoppners up cheap i suggested  between uth he answered yeth i think weve got them all  maybe a few more  i dont think weve mithed any  you will sell them for more than you gave for them i hinted  youre thmart he answered regarding me admiringly you thee through everything you do  how do you work it i asked him  there is a time in the day when he is confidential  here is this man hoppner  i take it that you have bought him up at an average of a hundred pounds a picture and that at that price most owners were fairly glad to sell  few folks outside the art schools have ever heard of him  i bet that at the present moment there isnt one art critic who could spell his name without reference to a dictionary  in eighteen months you will be selling him for anything from one thousand to ten thousand pounds how is it done  how ith everything done thatth done well he answered  by earnetht effort  he hitched his chair nearer to me i get a chap one of your thort of chapthhe writth an article about hoppner  i get another to anthwer him  before ive done therell be a hundred articleth about hoppnerhith life hith early thruggie anecdoth about hith wife  then a hoppner will be thold at public auchtion for a thouthand guineath  but how can you be certain it will fetch a thousand guineas i interrupted  i happen to know the man whoth going to buy it  he winked and i understood  a fortnight later there will be a thale of halfadothen and the prithe will be gone up by that time  and after that i said  after that he replied rising the american millionaire  hell jutht be waiting on the doorthtep for the thaleroom to open  if by any chance i come across a hoppner i said laughing as i turned to go  dont you hold on to it too long thatth all was his advice    how many charms hath music would you say    the argument of the late herr wagner was that grand operathe music drama as he called itincluded and therefore did away with the necessity forall other arts  music in all its branches of course it provides  so much i will concede to the late herr wagner  there are times i confess when my musical yearnings might shock the late herr wagnertimes when i feel unequal to following three distinct themes at one and the same instant  listen whispers the wagnerian enthusiast to me the cornet has now the brunnhilda motive  it seems to me in my then state of depravity as if the cornet had even more than this the matter with him  the second violins continues the wagnerian enthusiast are carrying on the wotan theme  that they are carrying on goes without saying  the players faces are streaming with perspiration  the brass explains my friendhis object is to cultivate my ear is accompanying the singers  i should have said drowning them there are occasions when i can rave about wagner with the best of them  high class moods come to all of us  the difference between the really highclass man and us commonplace workaday men is the difference between say the eagle and the barnyard chicken  i am the barnyard chicken  i have my wings  there are ecstatic moments when i feel i want to spurn the sordid earth and soar into the realms of art  i do fly a little but my body is heavy and i only get as far as the fence  after a while i find it lonesome on the fence and i hop down again among my fellows  listening to wagner during such temporary philistinic mood my sense of fair play is outraged  a lone lorn woman stands upon the stage trying to make herself heard  she has to do this sort of thing for her living maybe an invalid mother younger brothers and sisters are dependent upon her  one hundred and forty men all armed with powerful instruments wellorganised and most of them looking well fed combine to make it impossible for a single note of that poor womans voice to be heard above their din  i see her standing there opening and shutting her mouth getting redder and redder in the face  she is singing one feels sure of it one could hear her if only those one hundred and forty men would ease up for a minute  she makes one mighty supreme effort above the banging of the drums the blare of the trumpets the shrieking of the strings that last despairing note is distinctly heard  she has won but the victory has cost her dear  she sinks down fainting on the stage and is carried off by supers  chivalrous indignation has made it difficult for me to keep my seat watching the unequal contest  my instinct was to leap the barrier hurl the bald headed chief of her enemies from his high chair and lay about me with the trombone or the clarionetwhichever might have come the easier to my snatch  you cowardly lot of bullies i have wanted to cry are you not ashamed of yourselves  a hundred and forty of you against one and that one a still beautiful and comparatively speaking young lady be quiet for a minutecant you  give the poor girl a chance  a lady of my acquaintance says that sitting out a wagnerian opera seems to her like listening to a singer accompanied by four orchestras playing different tunes at the same time  as i have said there are times when wagner carries me along with him when i exult in the crash and whirl of his contending harmonies  but alas there are those other moodsthose after dinner moodswhen my desire is for something distinctly resembling a tune  still there are other composers of grand opera besides wagner  i grant to the late herr wagner that in so far as music is concerned opera can supply us with all we can need  but it was also wagners argument that grand opera could supply us with acting and there i am compelled to disagree with him  wagner thought that the arts of acting and singing could be combined  i have seen artists the great man has trained himself  as singers they left nothing to be desired but the acting in grand opera has never yet impressed me  wagner never succeeded in avoiding the operatic convention and nobody else ever will  when the operatic lover meets his sweetheart he puts her in a corner and turning his back upon her comes down to the footlights and tells the audience how he adores her  when he has finished he in his turn retires into the corner and she comes down and tells the audience that she is simply mad about him  overcome with joy at finding she really cares for him he comes down right and says that this is the happiest moment of his life and she stands left twelve feet away from him and has the presentiment that all this sort of thing is much too good to last  they go off together backwards side by side  if there is any lovemaking such as i understand by the term it is done off  this is not my idea of acting  but i do not see how you are going to substitute for it anything more natural  when you are singing at the top of your voice you dont want a heavy woman hanging round your neck  when you are killing a man and warbling about it at the same time you dont want him fooling around you defending himself  you want him to have a little reasonable patience and to wait in his proper place till you have finished telling him or rather telling the crowd how much you hate and despise him  when the proper time comes and if he is where you expect to find him while thinking of your upper c you will hit him lightly on the shoulder with your sword and then he can die to his own particular tune  if you have been severely wounded in battle or in any other sort of row and have got to sing a long ballad before you finally expire you dont want to have to think how a man would really behave who knew he had only got a few minutes to live and was feeling bad about it  the chances are that he would not want to sing at all the woman who really loved him would not encourage him to sing  she would want him to keep quiet while she moved herself about a bit in case there was anything that could be done for him  if a mob is climbing the stairs thirsting for your blood you do not want to stand upright with your arms stretched out a good eighteen inches from the door while you go over at some length the varied incidents leading up to the annoyance  if your desire were to act naturally you would push against that door for all you were worth and yell for somebody to bring you a chest of drawers and a bedstead and things like that to pile up against it  if you were a king and were giving a party you would not want your guests to fix you up at the other end of the room and leave you there with nobody to talk to but your own wife while they turned their backs upon you and had a long and complicated dance all to themselves  you would want to be in it you would want to let them know that you were king  in acting all these little points have to be considered  in opera everything is rightly sacrificed to musical necessity  i have seen the young enthusiastic operasinger who thought that he or she could act and sing at the same time  the experienced artist takes the centre of the stage and husbands his resources  whether he is supposed to be indignant because somebody has killed his mother or cheerful because he is going out to fight his countrys foes who are only waiting until he has finished singing to attack the town he leaves it to the composer to make clear  also it was herr wagners idea that the back cloth would leave the operagoer indifferent to the picture gallery  the castle on the rock accessible only by balloon in which every window lights up simultaneously and instantaneously one minute after sunset while the full moon is rushing up the sky at the pace of a champion comet that wonderful sea that suddenly opens and swallows up the ship those snowclad mountains over which the shadow of the hero passes like a threatening cloudthe grand old chateau trembling in the windwhat need will ask the operagoer of the future of your turners and your corots when for prices ranging from a shilling upwards we can have a dozen pictures such as these rolled up and down before us every evening  but perhaps the most daring hope of all was the dream that came to herr wagner that his opera singers his grouped choruses would eventually satisfy the craving of the public for high class statuary i am not quite sure the general public does care for statuary  i do not know whether the idea has ever occurred to the anarchist but were i myself organising secret committee meetings for unholy purposes i should invite my comrades to meet in that section of the local museum devoted to statuary  i can conceive of no place where we should be freer from prying eyes and listening ears  a select few however do appreciate statuary and such i am inclined to think will not be weaned from their passion by the contemplation of the opera singer in his or her various quaint costumes  and even if the tenor always satisfied our ideal of apollo and the soprano were always as sylphlike as she is described in the libretto even then i should doubt the average operatic chorus being regarded by the connoisseur as a cheap and pleasant substitute for a bas relief from the elgin marbles  the great thing required of that operatic chorus is experience  the young and giddypated the chorus master has no use for  the sober honest industrious lady or gentleman with a knowledge of music is very properly his ideal  what i admire about the chorus chiefly is its unity  the whole village dresses exactly alike  in wicked worldly villages there is rivalry leading to heartburn and jealously  one lady comes out suddenly on say a bank holiday in a fetching blue that conquers every male heart  next holiday her rival cuts her out with a green hat  in the operatic village it must be that the girls gather together beforehand to arrange this thing  there is probably a meeting called  the dear counts wedding announces the chairwoman you will all be pleased to hear has been fixed for the fourteenth at eleven oclock in the morning  the entire village will be assembled at ten thirty to await the return of the bridal cortege from the church and offer its felicitations  married ladies will of course come accompanied by their husbands  unmarried ladies must each bring a male partner as near their own height as possible  fortunately in this village the number of males is exactly equal to that of females so that the picture need not be spoiled  the children will organise themselves into an independent body and will group themselves picturesquely  it has been thought advisable continues the chairwoman that the village should meet the dear count and his bride at some spot not too far removed from the local alehouse  the costume to be worn by the ladies will consist of a short pink skirt terminating at the knees and ornamented with festoons of flowers above will be worn a bolero in mauve silk without sleeves and cut decollete  the shoes should be of yellow satin over fleshcoloured stockings  ladies who are out will wear pearl necklaces and a simple device in emeralds to decorate the hair  thank god we can all of us afford it and provided the weather holds up and nothing unexpected happenshe is not what i call a lucky man our count and it is always as well to be prepared for possibilitieswell i think we may look forward to a really pleasant day  it cannot be done herr wagner believe me  you cannot substitute the music drama for all the arts combined  the object to be aimed at by the wise composer should be to make us while listening to his music forgetful of all remaining artistic considerations    the white mans burden  need it be so heavy    it is a delightful stroll on a sunny summer morning from the hague to the huis ten bosch the little house in the wood built for princess amalia widow of stadtholter frederick henry under whom holland escaped finally from the bondage of her foes and entered into the promised land of liberty  leaving the quiet streets the tree bordered canals with their creeping barges you pass through a pleasant park where the softeyed deer press round you hurt and indignant if you have brought nothing in your pocketnot even a piece of sugarto offer them  it is not that they are graspingit is the want of attention that wounds them  i thought he was a gentleman they seem to be saying to one another if you glance back he looked like a gentleman  their mild eyes haunt you on the next occasion you do not forget the park merges into the forest you go by winding ways till you reach the trim dutch garden moatencircled in the centre of which stands the prim oldfashioned villa which to the simple dutchman appears a palace  the concierge an old soldier bows low to you and introduces you to his wifea stately whitehaired dame who talks most languages a little so far as relates to all things within and appertaining to this tiny palace of the wood  to things without beyond the wood her powers of conversation do not extend apparently such matters do not interest her  she conducts you to the chinese room the sun streams through the windows illuminating the wondrous golden dragons standing out in bold relief from the burnished lacquer work decorating still further with light and shade the delicate silk embroideries thin taper hands have woven with infinite pains  the walls are hung with rice paper depicting the conventional scenes of the conventional chinese life  you find your thoughts wandering  these grotesque figures these caricatures of humanity  a comical creature surely this chinaman the pantaloon of civilization  how useful he has been to us for our farces our comic operas  this yellow baby in his ample pinafore who lived thousands of years ago who has now passed into this strange second childhood  but is he dyingor does the life of a nation wake again as after sleep  is he this droll harmless thing he here depicts himself and if not  suppose fresh sap be stirring through his three hundred millions  we thought he was so very dead we thought the time had come to cut him up and divide him the only danger being lest we should quarrel over his carcase among ourselves  suppose it turns out as the fable of the woodcutter and the bear the woodcutter found the bear lying in the forest  at first he was much frightened but the bear lay remarkably still  so the woodman crept nearer ventured to kick the bearvery gently ready to run if need be  surely the bear was dead  and parts of a bear are good to eat and bearskin to poor woodfolk on cold winter nights is grateful so the woodman drew his knife and commenced the necessary preliminaries  but the bear was not dead  if the chinaman be not dead  if the cuttingup process has only served to waken him  in a little time from now we shall know  from the chinese room the whitehaired dame leads us to the japanese room  had gentlelooking princess amalia some vague foreshadowing of the future in her mind when she planned these two rooms leading into one another  the japanese decorations are more grotesque the designs less cheerfully comical than those of cousin chinaman  these monstrous misshapen wrestlers these patientlooking gods with their inscrutable eyes  was it always there or is it only by the light of present events that one reads into the fantastic fancies of the artist working long ago in the doorway of his paper house a meaning that has hitherto escaped us  but the chief attraction of the huis ten bosch is the gorgeous orange saloon lighted by a cupola fifty feet above the floor the walls one blaze of pictures chiefly of the gorgeous jordaen schoolthe defeat of the vices time vanquishing slandermostly allegorical in praise of all the virtues in praise of enlightenment and progress  aptly enough in a room so decorated here was held the famous peace congress that closed the last century  one can hardly avoid smiling as one thinks of the solemn conclave of grandees assembled to proclaim the popularity of peace  it was in the autumn of the same year that europe decided upon the dividingup of china that soldiers were instructed by christian monarchs to massacre men women and children the idea being to impress upon the heathen chinee the superior civilization of the white man  the boer war followed almost immediately  since when the white man has been pretty busy all over the world with his expeditions and his missions  the world is undoubtedly growing more refined  we do not care for ugly words  even the burglar refers airily to the little job he has on hand  you would think he had found work in the country  i should not be surprised to learn that he says a prayer before starting telegraphs home to his anxious wife the next morning that his task has been crowned with blessing  until the faroff date of universal brotherhood war will continue matters considered unimportant by both parties willwith a mighty flourish of trumpetsbe referred to arbitration  i was talking of a famous financier a while ago with a man who had been his secretary amongst other anecdotes he told me of a certain agreement about which dispute had arisen  the famous financier took the paper into his own hands and made a few swift calculations  let it go he concluded it is only a thousand pounds at the outside  may as well be honest  concerning a dead fisherman or two concerning boundaries through unproductive mountain ranges we shall arbitrate and feel virtuous for gold mines and good pasture lands mixed up with a little honour to give respectability to the business we shall fight it out as previously  war being thus inevitable the humane man will rejoice that by one of those brilliant discoveries so simple when they are explained war in the future is going to be rendered equally satisfactory to victor and to vanquished  in byelections as a witty writer has pointed out there are no defeatsonly victories and moral victories  the idea seems to have caught on  war in the future is evidently going to be conducted on the same understanding  once upon a time from a faroff land a certain general telegraphed home congratulating his government that the enemy had shown no inclination whatever to prevent his running away  the whole country rejoiced  why they never even tried to stop him citizens meeting other citizens in the street told each other  ah theyve had enough of him  i bet they are only too glad to get rid of him  why they say he ran for miles without seeing a trace of the foe  the enemys general on the other hand also wrote home congratulating his government  in this way the same battle can be mafficked over by both parties  contentment is the great secret of happiness  everything happens for the best if only you look at it the right way  that is going to be the argument  the general of the future will telegraph to headquarters that he is pleased to be able to inform his majesty that the enemy having broken down all opposition has succeeded in crossing the frontier and is now well on his way to his majestys capital  i am luring him on he will add as fast as i can  at our present rate of progress i am in hopes of bringing him home by the tenth  lest foolish civilian sort of people should wonder whereabouts lies the cause for rejoicing the military man will condescend to explain the enemy is being enticed farther and farther from his base  the defeated generalwho is not really defeated who is only artful and who appears to be running away is not really running away at all on the contrary he is running homebringing as he explains the enemy with him  if i remember rightlyit is long since i played itthere is a parlour game entitled puss in the corner  you beckon another player to you with your finger  puss puss you cry  thereupon he has to leave his chairhis base as the military man would term itand try to get to you without anything happening to him  war in the future is going to be puss in the corner on a bigger scale  you lure your enemy away from his base  if all goes wellif he does not see the trap that is being laid for himwhy then almost before he knows it he finds himself in your capital  that finishes the game  you find out what it is he really wants provided it is something within reason and you happen to have it handy you give it to him  he goes home crowing and you on your side laugh when you think how cleverly you succeeded in luring him away from his base  there is a bright side to all things  the gentleman charged with the defence of a fortress will meet the other gentleman who has captured it and shake hands with him mid the ruins  so here you are at last he will explain  why didnt you come before  we have been waiting for you  and he will send off dispatches felicitating his chief on having got that fortress off their hands together with all the worry and expense it has been to them  when prisoners are taken you will console yourself with the reflection that the cost of feeding them for the future will have to be borne by the enemy  captured cannon you will watch being trailed away with a sigh of relief  confounded heavy things you will say to yourself  thank goodness ive got rid of them  let him have the fun of dragging them about these ghastly roads  see how he likes the job  war is a ridiculous method of settling disputes  anything that can tend to make its ridiculous aspect more apparent is to be welcomed the new school of military dispatchwriters may succeed in turning even the laughter of the mob against it  the present trouble in the east would never have occurred but for the white mans enthusiasm for bearing other peoples burdens  what we call the yellow danger is the fear that the yellow man may before long request us so far as he is concerned to put his particular burden down  it may occur to him that seeing it is his property he would just as soon carry it himself  a london policeman told me a story the other day that struck him as an example of cockney humour under trying circumstances  but it may also serve as a fable  from a lonely street in the neighbourhood of covent garden early one morning the constable heard cries of stop thief shouted in a childish treble  he arrived on the scene just in time to collar a young hooligan who having snatched a basket of fruit from a small lada greengrocers errand boy as it turned outwas with it making tracks  the greengrocers boy between panting and tears delivered his accusation  the hooligan regarded him with an expression of amazed indignation  what dyer mean stealing it exclaimed mr hooligan  why i was carrying it for yer  the white man has got into the way of carrying other peoples burdens and now it looks as if the yellow man were going to object to our carrying his any further  maybe he is going to get nasty and insist on carrying it himself  we call this the yellow danger  a friend of minehe is a man who in the street walks into lamp posts and apologisessees rising from the east the dawn of a new day in the worlds history  the yellow danger is to him a golden hope  he sees a race long stagnant stretching its giant limbs with the first vague movements of returning life  he is a poor sort of patriot he calls himself i suppose a white man yet he shamelessly confesses he would rather see asias millions rise from the ruins of their ancient civilization to take their part in the future of humanity than that half the population of the globe should remain bound in savagery for the pleasure and the profit of his own particular species  he even goes so far as to think that the white man may have something to learn  the world has belonged to him now for some thousands of years  has he done all with it that could have been done  are his ideals the last word  not what the yellow man has absorbed from europe but what he is going to give europe it is that interests my friend  he is watching the birth of a new forcean influence as yet unknown  he clings to the fond belief that new ideas new formulae to replace the old worn shibboleths may during these thousands of years have been developing in those keen brains that behind the impressive yellow mask have been working so long in silence and in mystery    why didnt he marry the girl    what is wrong with marriage anyhow  i find myself pondering this question so often when reading highclass literature  i put it to myself again the other evening during a performance of faust  why could not faust have married the girl  i would not have married her myself for any consideration whatsoever but that is not the argument  faust apparently could not see anything amiss with her both of them were mad about each other  yet the idea of a quiet unostentatious marriage with a weeks honeymoon say in vienna followed by a neat little cottage orne not too far from nurnberg so that their friends could have come out to them never seems to have occurred to either of them  there could have been a garden  marguerite might have kept chickens and a cow  that sort of girl brought up to hard work and by no means too well educated is all the better for having something to do  later with the gradual arrival of the family a good allround woman might have been hired in to assist  faust of course would have had his study and got to work again that would have kept him out of further mischief  the idea that a brainy man his age was going to be happy with nothing to do all day but fool round a petticoat was ridiculous from the beginning  valentinea good fellow valentine with nice ideaswould have spent his saturdays to monday with them  over a pipe and a glass of wine he and faust would have discussed the local politics  he would have danced the children on his knee have told them tales about the wartaught the eldest boy to shoot  faust with a practical man like valentine to help him would probably have invented a new gun  valentine would have got it taken up  things might have come of it  sybil in course of time would have married and settled downperhaps have taken a little house near to them  he and marguerite would have jokedwhen mrs sybil was not aroundabout his early infatuation  the old mother would have toddled over from nurnbergnot too often just for the day  the picture grows upon one the more one thinks of it  why did it never occur to them  there would have been a bit of a bother with the old man  i can imagine mephistopheles being upset about it thinking himself swindled  of course if that was the reasonif faust said to himself  i should like to marry the girl but i wont do it it would not be fair to the old man he has been to a lot of trouble working this thing up in common gratitude i cannot turn round now and behave like a decent sensible man it would not be playing the gameif this was the way faust looked at the matter there is nothing more to be said  indeed it shows him in rather a fine lightnoble if quixotic  if on the other hand he looked at the question from the point of view of himself and the girl i think the thing might have been managed  all one had to do in those days when one wanted to get rid of the devil was to show him a sword hilt  faust and marguerite could have slipped into a church one morning and have kept him out of the way with a sword hilt till the ceremony was through  they might have hired a small boy  you see the gentleman in red  well he wants us and we dont want him  that is the only difference between us  now you take this sword and when you see him coming show him the hilt  dont hurt him just show him the sword and shake your head  he will understand  the old gentlemans expression when subsequently faust presented him to marguerite would have been interesting  allow me my wife  my dear aa friend of mine  you may remember meeting him that night at your aunts  as i have said there would have been ructions but i do not myself see what could have been done  there was nothing in the bond to the effect that faust should not marry so far as we are told  the old man had a sense of humour  my own opinion is that after getting over the first annoyance he himself would have seen the joke  i can even picture him looking in now and again on mr and mrs faust  the children would be hurried off to bed  there would be for a while an atmosphere of constraint  but the old man had a way with him  he would have told one or two stories at which marguerite would have blushed at which faust would have grinned  i can see the old fellow occasionally joining the homely social board  the children awed at first would have sat silent with staring eyes  but as i have said the old man had a way with him  why should he not have reformed  the good womans unconsciously exerted influencethe sweet childish prattle  one hears of such things  might he not have come to be known as nunkie  myselfi believe i have already mentioned iti would not have married marguerite  she is not my ideal of a good girl  i never liked the way she deceived her mother  and that aunt of hers  well a nice girl would not have been friends with such a woman  she did not behave at all too well to sybil either  it is clear to me that she led the boy on  and what was she doing with that box of jewels anyhow  she was not a fool  she could not have gone every day to that fountain chatted with those girl friends of hers and learnt nothing  she must have known that people dont go leaving twenty thousand pounds worth of jewels about on doorsteps as part of a round game  her own instinct if she had been a good girl would have told her to leave the thing alone  i dont believe in these innocent people who do not know what they are doing half their time  ask any london magistrate what he thinks of the lady who explains that she picked up the diamond brooch  not meaning of course your worship to take it  i would not do such a thing  it just happened this way your worship  i was standing as you might say here and not seeing anyone about in the shop i opened the case and took it out thinking as perhaps it might belong to someone and then this gentleman here as i had not noticed before comes up quite suddenly and says you come along with me he says  what for i says when i dont even know you i says for stealing he says  well thats a hard word to use to a lady i says i dont know what you mean im sure  and if she had put them all on not thinking what would a really nice girl have done when the gentleman came up and assured her they were hers  she would have been thirty seconds taking them off and flinging them back into the box  thank you she would have said ill trouble you to leave this garden as quickly as you entered it and take them with you  im not that sort of girl  marguerite clings to the jewels and accepts the young mans arm for a moonlight promenade  and when it does enter into her innocent head that he and she have walked that shady garden long enough what does she do when she has said goodbye and shut the door  she opens the groundfloor window and begins to sing  maybe i am not poetical but i do like justice  when other girls do these sort of things they get called names  i cannot see why this particular girl should be held up as an ideal  she kills her mother according to her own account this was an accident  it is not an original line of defence and we are not allowed to hear the evidence for the prosecution  she also kills her baby  you are not to blame her for that because at the time she was feeling poorly  i dont see why this girl should have a special line of angels to take her up to heaven  there must have been decent hardworking women in nurnburg more entitled to the ticket  why is it that all these years we have been content to accept marguerite as a type of innocence and virtue  the explanation is i suppose that goethe wrote at a time when it was the convention to regard all women as good  anything in petticoats was virtuous  if she did wrong it was always somebody elses fault  cherchez la femme was a later notion  in the days of goethe it was always cherchez lhomme  it was the mans fault  it was the devils fault  it was anybodys fault you liked but not hers  the convention has not yet died out  i was reading the other day a most interesting book by a brilliant american authoress  seeing i live far away from the ladys haunts i venture to mention names  i am speaking of patience sparhawk by gertrude atherton  i take this book because it is typical of a large body of fiction  miss sparhawk lives a troubled life  it puzzles her  she asks herself what is wrong  her own idea is that it is civilisation  if it is not civilisation then it is the american man or natureor democracy  miss sparhawk marries the wrong man  later on she gets engaged to another wrong man  in the end we are left to believe she is about to be married to the right man  i should be better satisfied if i could hear miss sparhawk talking six months after that last marriage  but if a mistake has again been made i am confident that in miss sparhawks opinion the fault will not be miss sparhawks  the argument is always the same  miss sparhawk being a lady can do no wrong  if miss sparhawk cared to listen to me for five minutes i feel i could put her right on this point  it is quite true my dear girl i should say to her something is wrongvery wrong  but it is not the american man  never you mind the american man  you leave him to worry out his own salvation  you are not the girl to put him right even where he is wrong  and it is not civilisation  civilisation has a deal to answer for i admit dont you load it up with this additional trouble  the thing that is wrong in this case of yoursif you will forgive my saying sois you  you make a fool of yourself you marry a man who is a mere animal because he appeals to your animal instincts  then like the lady who cried out alack ive married a black you appeal to heaven against the injustice of being mated with a clown  you are not a nice girl either in your ideas or in your behaviour  i dont blame you for it you did not make yourself  but when you set to work to attract all that is lowest in man why be so astonished at your own success  there are plenty of shocking american men i agree  one meets the class even outside america  but nice american girls will tell you that there are also nice american men  there is an old proverb about birds of a feather  next time you find yourself in the company of a shocking american man you just ask yourself how he got there and how it is he seems to be feeling at home  you learn selfcontrol  get it out of your head that you are the centre of the universe and grasp the idea that a petticoat is not a halo and you will find civilisation not half as wrong as you thought it  i know what miss sparhawks reply would be  you say all this to meto me a lady  great heavens  what has become of chivalry  a frenchman was once put on trial for murdering his father and mother  he confessed his guilt but begged for mercy on the plea that he was an orphan  chivalry was founded on the assumption that woman was worthy to be worshipped  the modern womans notion is that when she does wrong she ought to be excused by chivalrous man because she is a lady  i like the naughty heroine we all of us do  the early victorian heroinethe angel in a white frock was a bore  we knew exactly what she was going to dothe right thing  we did not even have to ask ourselves what will she think is the right thing to do under the circumstances  it was always the conventional right thing  you could have put it to a sunday school and have got the answer every time  the heroine with passions instincts emotions is to be welcomed  but i want her to grasp the fact that after all she is only one of us  i should like her better if instead of demanding  what is wrong in civilisation  what is the world coming to and so forth she would occasionally say to herself  guess ive made a fool of myself this time  i do feel that shamed of myself  she would not lose by it  we should respect her all the more    what mrs wilkins thought about it    last year travelling on the underground railway i met a man he was one of the saddestlooking men i had seen for years  i used to know him well in the old days when we were journalists together  i asked him in a sympathetic tone how things were going with him  i expected his response would be a flood of tears and that in the end i should have to fork out a fiver  to my astonishment his answer was that things were going exceedingly well with him  i did not want to say to him bluntly  then what has happened to you to make you look like a mute at a temperance funeral i said  and how are all at home  i thought that if the trouble lay there he would take the opportunity  it brightened him somewhat the necessity of replying to the question  it appeared that his wife was in the best of health  you remember her he continued with a smile wonderful spirits always cheerful nothing seems to put her out not even  he ended the sentence abruptly with a sigh  his motherinlaw i learned from further talk with him had died since i had last met him and had left them a comfortable addition to their income  his eldest daughter was engaged to be married  it is entirely a love match he explained and he is such a dear good fellow that i should not have made any objection even had he been poor  but of course as it is i am naturally all the more content  his eldest boy having won the mottle scholarship was going up to cambridge in the autumn  his own health he told me had greatly improved and a novel he had written in his leisure time promised to be one of the successes of the season  then it was that i spoke plainly  if i am opening a wound too painful to be touched i said tell me  if on the contrary it is an ordinary sort of trouble upon which the sympathy of a fellow worker may fall as balm let me hear it  so far as i am concerned he replied i should be glad to tell you  speaking about it does me good and may leadso i am always in hopesto an idea  but for your own sake if you take my advice you will not press me  how can it affect me i asked it is nothing to do with me is it  it need have nothing to do with you he answered if you are sensible enough to keep out of it  if i tell you  from this time onward it will be your trouble also  anyhow that is what has happened in four other separate cases  if you like to be the fifth and complete the half dozen of us you are welcome  but remember i have warned you  what has it done to the other five i demanded  it has changed them from cheerful companionable persons into gloomy oneidead bores he told me  they think of but one thing they talk of but one thing they dream of but one thing  instead of getting over it as time goes on it takes possession of them more and more  there are men of course who would be unaffected by it who could shake it off  i warn you in particular against it because in spite of all that is said i am convinced you have a sense of humour and that being so it will lay hold of you  it will plague you night and day  you see what it has made of me  three months ago a lady interviewer described me as of a sunny temperament if you know your own business you will get out at the next station  i wish now i had followed his advice  as it was i allowed my curiosity to take possession of me and begged him to explain  and he did so  it was just about christmas time he said  we were discussing the drury lane pantomimesome three or four of usin the smoking room of the devonshire club and young gold said he thought it would prove a mistake the introduction of a subject like the fiscal question into the story of humpty dumpty  the two things so far as he could see had nothing to do with one another  he added that he entertained a real regard for mr dan leno whom he had once met on a steamboat but that there were other topics upon which he would prefer to seek that gentlemans guidance  nettleship on the other hand declared that he had no sympathy with the argument that artists should never intrude upon public affairs  the actor was a fellow citizen with the rest of us  he said that whether one agreed with their conclusions or not one must admit that the nation owed a debt of gratitude to mrs brown potter and to miss olga nethersole for giving to it the benefit of their convictions  he had talked to both ladies in private on the subject and was convinced they knew as much about it as did most people  burnside who was one of the party contended that if sides were to be taken a pantomime should surely advocate the freefood cause seeing it was a form of entertainment supposed to appeal primarily to the tastes of the little englander  then i came into the discussion  the fiscal question i said is on everybodys tongue  such being the case it is fit and proper it should be referred to in our annual pantomime which has come to be regarded as a review of the years doings  but it should not have been dealt with from the political standpoint  the proper attitude to have assumed towards it was that of innocent raillery free from all trace of partisanship  old johnson had strolled up and was standing behind us  the very thing i have been trying to get hold of for weeks he saida bright amusing resume of the whole problem that should give offence to neither side  you know our paper he continued we steer clear of politics but at the same time try to be uptodate it is not always easy  the treatment of the subject on the lines you suggest is just what we require  i do wish you would write me something  he is a good old sort johnson it seemed an easy thing  i said i would  since that time i have been thinking how to do it  as a matter of fact i have not thought of much else  maybe you can suggest something  i was feeling in a good working mood the next morning  pilson said i to myself shall have the benefit of this  he does not need anything boisterously funny  a few playfully witty remarks on the subject will be the ideal  i lit a pipe and sat down to think  at halfpast twelve having to write some letters before going out to lunch i dismissed the fiscal question from my mind  but not for long  it worried me all the afternoon  i thought maybe something would come to me in the evening  i wasted all that evening and i wasted all the following morning  everything has its amusing side i told myself  one turns out comic stories about funerals about weddings  hardly a misfortune that can happen to mankind but has produced its comic literature  an american friend of mine once took a contract from the editor of an insurance journal to write four humorous stories one was to deal with an earthquake the second with a cyclone the third with a flood and the fourth with a thunderstorm  and more amusing stories i have never read  what is the matter with the fiscal question  i myself have written lightly on bimemetallism  home rule we used to be merry over in the eighties  i remember one delightful evening at the codgers hall  it would have been more delightful still but for a rawboned irishman who rose towards eleven oclock and requested to be informed if any other speaker was wishful to make any more jokes on the subject of ould ireland because if so the raw boned gentleman was prepared to save time by waiting and dealing with them altogether  but if not thenso the rawboned gentleman announcedhis intention was to go for the last speaker and the last speaker but two at once and without further warning  no other humourist rising the rawboned gentleman proceeded to make good his threat with the result that the fun degenerated somewhat even on the boer war we used to whisper jokes to one another in quiet places  in this fiscal question there must be fun  where is it  for days i thought of little else  my laundressas we call them in the templenoticed my trouble  mrs wilkins i confessed i am trying to think of something innocently amusing to say on the fiscal question  ive eard about it she said but i dont ave much time to read the papers  they want to make us pay more for our food dont they  for some of it i explained  but then we shall pay less for other things so that really we shant be paying more at all  there dont seem much in it either way was mrs wilkins opinion  just so i agreed that is the advantage of the system  it will cost nobody anything and will result in everybody being better off  the pity is said mrs wilkins that pity nobody ever thought of it before  the whole trouble hitherto i explained has been the foreigner  ah said mrs wilkins i never eard much good of em though they do say the almighty as a use for almost everything  these foreigners i continued these germans and americans they dump things on us you know  whats that demanded mrs wilkins  whats dump  well its dumping you know  you take things and you dump them down  but what things  ow do they do it asked mrs wilkins  why all sorts of things  pig iron bacon doormatseverything they bring them over herein ships you understandand then if you please just dump them down upon our shores  you dont mean surely to tell me that they just throw them out and leave them there queried mrs wilkins  of course not i replied when i say they dump these things upon our shores that is a figure of speech  what i mean is they sell them to us  but why do we buy them if we dont want them asked mrs wilkins were not bound to buy them are we  it is their artfulness i explained these germans and americans and the others they are all just as bad as one anotherthey insist on selling us these things at less price than they cost to make  it seems a bit silly of them dont it thought mrs wilkins  i suppose being foreigners poor things they aint naturally got much sense  it does seem silly of them if you look at it that way i admitted but what we have got to consider is the injury it is doing us  dont see ow it can do us much arm argued mrs wilkins seems a bit of luck so far as we are concerned  theres a few more things theyd be welcome to dump round my way  i dont seem to be putting this thing quite in the right light to you mrs wilkins i confessed  it is a long argument and you might not be able to follow it but you must take it as a fact now generally admitted that the cheaper you buy things the sooner your money goes  by allowing the foreigner to sell us all these things at about half the cost price he is getting richer every day and we are getting poorer  unless we as a country insist on paying at least twenty per cent more for everything we want it is calculated that in a very few years england wont have a penny left  sounds a bit topsy turvy suggested mrs wilkins  it may sound so i answered but i fear there can be no doubt of it  the board of trade returns would seem to prove it conclusively  well god be praised weve found it out in time ejaculated mrs wilkins piously  it is a matter of congratulation i agreed the difficulty is that a good many other people say that far from being ruined we are doing very well indeed and are growing richer every year  but ow can they say that argued mrs wilkins when as you tell me those trade returns prove just the opposite  well they say the same mrs wilkins that the board of trade returns prove just the opposite  well they cant both be right said mrs wilkins  you would be surprised mrs wilkins i said how many things can be proved from board of trade returns  but i have not yet thought of that article for pilson    shall we be ruined by chinese cheap labour    what is all this talk i ear about the chinese said mrs wilkins to me the other morning  we generally indulge in a little chat while mrs wilkins is laying the breakfasttable  letters and newspapers do not arrive in my part of the temple much before nine  from half past eight to nine i am rather glad of mrs wilkins  they ave been up to some of their tricks again avent they  the foreigner mrs wilkins i replied whether he be chinee or any other he is always up to tricks  was not england specially prepared by an allwise providence to frustrate these knavish tricks which of such particular tricks may you be referring to at the moment mrs wilkins  well es comin over ereisnt he sir to take the work out of our mouths as it were  well not exactly over here to england mrs wilkins i explained he has been introduced into africa to work in the mines there  its a funny thing said mrs wilkins but to ear the way some of them talk in our block you might run away with the notionthat is if you didnt know emthat work was their only joy  i said to one of em the other eveninga man as calls isself a brass finisher though lord knows the only brass e ever finishes is what is poor wife earns and isnt quick enough to ide away from imwell whatever appens i says it will be clever of em if they take away much work from you  it made them all laugh that did added mrs wilkins with a touch of pardonable pride  ah continued the good lady its surprising ow contented they can be with a little some of em  give em a ardworking woman to look after them and a day out once a week with a procession of the unemployed they dont ask for nothing more  theres that beauty my poor sister jane was fool enough to marry  serves er right as i used to tell er at first till there didnt seem any more need to rub it into er  shed ad one good usband  it wouldnt ave been fair for er to ave ad another even if thered been a chance of it seeing the few of em there is to go round among so many  but its always the same with us widows  if we appen to ave been lucky the first time we put it down to our own judgmentthink we cant ever make a mistake and if we draw a wrong un as the saying is we argue as if it was the duty of providence to make it up to us the second time  why id a been making a fool of myself three years ago if e adnt been goodnatured enough to call one afternoon when i was out and ook it off with two pounds eight in the best teapot that i ad been soft enough to talk to im about  and never let me set eyes on im again  god bless im  es one of the borntireds e is as poor jane might ave seen for erself if she ad only looked at im instead of listening to im  but thats courtship all the world overold and young alike so far as ive been able to see it was the opinion of mrs wilkins  the mans all eyes and the woman all ears  they dont seem to ave any other senses left em  i ran against im the other night on my way ome at the corner of grays inn road  there was the usual crowd watching a pack of them italians laying down the asphalt in olborn and e was among em  e ad secured the only lamppost and was leaning agen it  ullo i says glad to see you avent lost your job  nothin like stickin to it when youve dropped into somethin that really suits you  what do you mean martha e says  es not one of what i call your smart sort  it takes a bit of sarcasm to get through is ead  well i says youre still on the old track i see looking for work  take care you dont ave an accident one of these days and run up agen it before youve got time to get out of its way  its these miserable foreigners e says  look at em e says  theres enough of you doing that i says  ive got my room to put straight and three hours needlework to do before i can get to bed  but dont let me inder you  you might forget what work was like if you didnt take an opportunity of watching it now and then  they come over ere e says and take the work away from us chaps  ah i says poor things perhaps they aint married  lazy devils e says  look at em smoking cigarettes  i could do that sort of work  theres nothing in it  it dont take eathen foreigners to dab a bit of tar about a road  yes i says you always could do anybody elses work but your own  i cant find it martha e says  no i says and you never will in the sort of places you go looking for it  they dont ang it out on lampposts and they dont leave it about at the street corners  go ome i says and turn the mangle for your poor wife  thats big enough for you to find even in the dark  looking for work snorted mrs wilkins with contempt we women never ave much difficulty in finding it ive noticed  there are times when i feel i could do with losing it for a day  but what did he reply mrs wilkins i asked your brassfinishing friend who was holding forth on the subject of chinese cheap labour  mrs wilkins as a conversationalist is not easily kept to the point  i was curious to know what the working classes were thinking on the subject  oh that replied mrs wilkins e did not say nothing  e aint the sort thats got much to say in an argument  e belongs to the crowd that angs about at the back and does the shouting  but there was another of em a young fellow as i feels sorry for with a wife and three small children who asnt ad much luck for the last six months and that through no fault of is own i should say from the look of im  i was a fool says e when i chucked a good situation and went out to the war  they told me i was going to fight for equal rights for all white men  i thought they meant that all of us were going to ave a better chance and it seemed worth making a bit of sacrifice for that did  i should be glad if they would give me a job in their mines that would enable me to feed my wife and children  thats all i ask them for  it is a difficult problem mrs wilkins i said  according to the mine owners  ah said mrs wilkins  they dont seem to be exactly what youd call popular them mine owners do they  daresay theyre not as bad as theyre painted  some people mrs wilkins i said paint them very black  there are those who hold that the south african mineowner is not a man at all but a kind of pantomime demon  you take goliath the whale that swallowed jonah a selection from the least respectable citizens of sodom and gomorrah at their worst bluebeard bloody queen mary guy fawkes and the seaserpentor rather you take the most objectionable attributes of all these various personages and mix them up together  the result is the south african mineowner a monster who would willingly promote a company for the putting on the market of a new meat extract prepared exclusively from newborn infants provided the scheme promised a fair and reasonable opportunity of fleecing the widow and orphan  ive eard theyre a bad lot said mrs wilkins  but were most of us that if we listen to what other people say about us  quite so mrs wilkins i agreed  one never arrives at the truth by listening to one side only  on the other hand for example there are those who stoutly maintain that the south african mineowner is a kind of spiritual creature all heart and sentiment who against his own will has been so to speak dumped down upon this earth as the result of overproduction up above of the higher class of archangel the stock of archangels of superior finish exceeds the heavenly demand the surplus has been dropped down into south africa and has taken to mine owning  it is not that these celestial visitors of german sounding nomenclature care themselves about the gold  their only desire is during this earthly pilgrimage of theirs to benefit the human race  nothing can be obtained in this world without money   thats true said mrs wilkins with a sigh  for gold everything can be obtained  the aim of the mineowning archangel is to provide the world with gold  why should the world trouble to grow things and make things  let us say these archangels temporarily dwelling in south africa dig up and distribute to the world plenty of gold then the world can buy whatever it wants and be happy  there may be a flaw in the argument mrs wilkins i allowed  i am not presenting it to you as the last word upon the subject  i am merely quoting the view of the south african mineowner feeling himself a much misunderstood benefactor of mankind  i expect said mrs wilkins they are just the ordinary sort of christian like the rest of us anxious to do the best they can for themselves and not too particular as to doing other people in the process  i am inclined to think mrs wilkins i said that you are not very far from the truth  a friend of mine a year ago was very bitter on this subject of chinese cheap labour  a little later there died a distant relative of his who left him twenty thousand south african mining shares  he thinks now that to object to the chinese is narrowminded illiberal and against all religious teaching  he has bought an abridged edition of confucius and tells me that there is much that is ennobling in chinese morality  indeed i gather from him that the introduction of the chinese into south africa will be the saving of that country  the noble chinese will afford an object lesson to the poor white man displaying to him the virtues of sobriety thrift and humility  i also gather that it will be of inestimable benefit to the noble chinee himself  the christian missionary will get hold of him in bulk so to speak and imbue him with the higher theology  it appears to be one of those rare cases where everybody is benefited at the expense of nobody  it is always a pity to let these rare opportunities slip by  well said mrs wilkins ive nothin to say agen the chinaman as a chinaman  as to is being a eathen well throwin stones at a church as the sayin is dont make a christian of you  theres christians ive met as couldnt do themselves much arm by changing their religion and as to cleanliness well ive never met but one and e was a washerwoman and id rather ave sat next to im in a thirdclass carriage on a bank oliday than next to some of em  seems to me continued mrs wilkins weve got into the abit of talkin a bit too much about other peoples dirt  the london atmosphere aint natrally a drycleanin process in itself but theres a goodish few as seem to think it is  one comes across freeborn britons ere and there as id be sorry to scrub clean for a shillin and find my own soap  it is a universal failing mrs wilkins i explained  if you talk to a travelled frenchman he contrasts to his own satisfaction the paris ouvrier in his blue blouse with the appearance of the london labourer  i daresay theyre all right according to their lights said mrs wilkins but it does seem a bit wrong that if our own chaps are willin and anxious to work after all theyve done too in the way of getting the mines for us they shouldnt be allowed the job  again mrs wilkins it is difficult to arrive at a just conclusion i said  the mineowner according to his enemies hates the british workman with the natural instinct that evil creatures feel towards the noble and virtuous  he will go to trouble and expense merely to spite the british workman to keep him out of south africa  according to his friends the mineowner sets his face against the idea of white labour for two reasons  first and foremost it is not nice work the mineowner hates the thought of his beloved white brother toiling in the mines  it is not right that the noble white man should demean himself by such work  secondly white labour is too expensive  if for digging gold men had to be paid anything like the same prices they are paid for digging coal the mines could not be worked  the world would lose the gold that the mineowner is anxious to bestow upon it  the mineowner following his own inclinations would take a little farm grow potatoes and live a beautiful lifeperhaps write a little poetry  a slave to sense of duty he is chained to the philanthropic work of goldmining  if we hamper him and worry him the danger is that he will get angry with uspossibly he will order his fiery chariot and return to where he came from  well e cant take the gold with him wherever e goes to argued mrs wilkins  you talk mrs wilkins i said as if the gold were of more value to the world than is the mineowner  well isnt it demanded mrs wilkins  its a new idea mrs wilkins i answered it wants thinking out    how to solve the servant problem    i am glad to see mrs wilkins i said that the womens domestic guild of america has succeeded in solving the servant girl problem none too soon one might almost say  ah said mrs wilkins as she took the cover off the bacon and gave an extra polish to the mustardpot with her apron they are clever people over there leastways so ive always eard  this their latest mrs wilkins i said i am inclined to regard as their greatest triumph  my hope is that the womens domestic guild of america when it has finished with the united states and canada will perhaps see its way to establishing a branch in england  there are ladies of my acquaintance who would welcome i feel sure any really satisfactory solution of the problem  well good luck to it is all i say responded mrs wilkins and if it makes all the gals contented with their places and all the mistresses satisfied with what theyve got and appy in their minds why god bless it say i  the mistake hitherto i said from what i read appears to have been that the right servant was not sent to the right place  what the womens domestic guild of america proposes to do is to find the right servant for the right place  you see the  difference dont you mrs wilkins  thats the secret agreed mrs wilkins  they dont anticipate any difficulty in getting the right sort of gal i take it  i gather not mrs wilkins i replied  mrs wilkins is of a pessimistic turn of mind  i am not so sure about it she said the almighty dont seem to ave made too many of that sort  unless these american ladies that you speak of are going to start a factory of their own  i am afraid there is disappointment in store for them  dont throw cold water on the idea before it is fairly started mrs wilkins i pleaded  well sir said mrs wilkins i ave been a gal myself in service and in my time ive ad a few mistresses of my own and ive eard a good deal about others  there are ladies and ladies as you may know sir and some of them if they arent exactly angels are about as near to it as can be looked for in this climate and they are not the ones that do most of the complaining  but as for the average mistresswell it aint a gal she wants its a plaster image without any natural innardsa sort of thing as aint uman and aint to be found in uman nature  and then shed grumble at it if it didnt appen to be able to be in two places at once  you fear that the standard for that right girl is likely to be set a trifle too high mrs wilkins i suggested  that right gal according to the notions of some of em retorted mrs wilkins er place aint down ere among us mere mortals er place is up in eaven with a arp and a golden crown  theres my niece emma i dont say she is a saint but a better earted arder working gal at twenty pounds a year you dont expect to find unless maybe youre a natural born fool that cant elp yourself she wanted a place  she ad been ome for nearly six months nursing er old father as ad been down all the winter with rheumatic fever and ardput to it she was for a few clothes  you ear em talk about gals as insists on an hour a day for practising the piano and the right to invite their young man to spend the evening with them in the drawingroom  perhaps it is meant to be funny i aint come across that type of gal myself outside the pictures in the comic papers and ill never believe till i see er myself that anybody else as  they sent er from the registry office to a lady at clapton  i ope you are good at getting up early in the morning says the lady i like a gal as rises cheerfully to er work  well maam says emma i cant say as ive got a passion for it but its one of those things that as to be done and i guess ive learnt the trick  im a great believer in early rising says my lady in the morning one is always fresher for ones work my usband and the younger children breakfast at arf past seven myself and my eldest daughter ave our breakfest in bed at eight  thatll be all right maam says emma  and i ope says the lady you are of an amiable disposition some gals when you ring the bell come up looking so disagreeable one almost wishes one didnt want them  well it aint a thing explains emma as makes you want to burst out laughing earing the bell go off for the twentieth time and aving suddenly to put down your work at perhaps a critical moment some ladies dont seem able to reach down their at for themselves  i ope you are not impertinent says the lady if theres one thing that i object to in a servant it is impertinence  we none of us like being answered back says emma more particularly when we are in the wrong  but i know my place maam and i shant give you no lip  it always leads to less trouble i find keeping your mouth shut rather than opening it  are you fond of children asks my lady  it depends upon the children says emma there are some i ave ad to do with as made the day seem pleasanter and ive come across others as i could ave parted from at any moment without tears  i like a gal says the lady who is naturally fond of children it shows a good character  how many of them are there says emma  four of them answers my lady but you wont ave much to do except with the two youngest  the great thing with young children is to surround them with good examples  are you a christian asks my lady  thats what im generally called says emma  every other sunday evening out is my rule says the lady but of course i shall expect you to go to church  do you mean in my time maam says emma or in yours  i mean on your evening of course says my lady  ow else could you go  well maam says emma i like to see my people now and then  there are better things says my lady than seeing what you call your people and i should not care to take a girl into my ouse as put er pleasure before er religion  you are not engaged i ope  walking out maam do you mean says emma  no maam there is nobody ive got in my mindnot just at present  i never will take a gal explains my lady who is engaged  i find it distracts er attention from er work  and i must insist if you come to me continues my lady that you get yourself another at and jacket  if there is one thing i object to in a servant it is a disposition to cheap finery  er own daughter was sitting there beside er with alf a dozen silver bangles on er wrist and a sort of thing anging around er neck as ad it been real would ave been worth perhaps a thousand pounds  but emma wanted a job so she kept er thoughts to erself  i can put these things by and get myself something else she says if you dont mind maam advancing me something out of my first three months wages  im afraid my account at the bank is a bit overdrawn  the lady whispered something to er daughter  i am afraid on thinking it over she says that you wont suit after all  you dont look serious enough  i feel sure from the way you do your air says my lady theres a frivolous side to your nature  so emma came away and was not on the whole too sorry  but do they get servants to come to them this type of mistress do you think mrs wilkins i asked  they get them all right said mrs wilkins and if its a decent gal it makes a bad gal of er that ever afterwards looks upon every mistress as er enemy and acts accordingly  and if she aint a naturally good gal it makes er worse and then you ear what awful things gals are  i dont say its an easy problem continued mrs wilkins its just like marriages  the good mistress gets old of the bad servant and the bad mistress as often as not is lucky  but how is it i argued that in hotels for instance the service is excellent and the girls generally speaking seem contented  the work is hard and the wages not much better if as good  ah said mrs wilkins you ave it the right nail on the ead there sir  they go into the otels and work like niggers knowing that if a single thing goes wrong they will be bullyragged and sworn at till they dont know whether they are standing on their ead or their eels  but they ave their hours the gal knows when er work is done and when the clock strikes she is a uman being once again she as got that moment to look forward to all day and it keeps er going  in private service theres no moment in the day to ope for if the lady is reasonable she aint overworked but no ow can she ever feel she is her own mistress free to come and go to wear er bit of finery to ave er bit of fun  she works from six in the morning till eleven or twelve at night and then she only goes to bed provided she aint wanted  she dont belong to erself at all its that that irritates them  i see your point mrs wilkins i said and of course in a house where two or three servants were kept some such plan might easily be arranged  the girl who commenced work at six oclock in the morning might consider herself free at six oclock in the evening  what she did with herself how she dressed herself in her own time would be her affair  what church the clerk or the workman belongs to what company he keeps is no concern of the firm  in such matters mistresses i am inclined to think saddle themselves with a responsibility for which there is no need  if the girl behaves herself while in the house and does her work there the contract ends  the mistress who thinks it her duty to combine the roles of employer and of maiden aunt is naturally resented  the next month the girl might change her hours from twelve to twelve and her fellowservant could enjoy the six am to six pm shift  but how do you propose to deal mrs wilkins with the smaller menage that employs only one servant  well sir said mrs wilkins it seems to me simple enough ladies talk pretty about the dignity of labour and are never tired of pointing out why gals should prefer domestic service to all other kinds of work  suppose they practise what they preach  in the ouse where theres only the master and the mistress and say a couple of small children let the lady take her turn  after all its only her duty same as the office or the shop is the mans where on the other and there are biggish boys and gals about the place well it wouldnt do them any arm to be taught to play a little less and to look after themselves a little more  its just arranging thingsthats all thats wanted  you remind me of a family i once knew mrs wilkins i said it consisted of the usual father and mother and of five sad healthy girls  they kept two servantsor rather they never kept any servants they lived always looking for servants breaking their hearts over servants packing servants off at a moments notice standing disconsolately looking after servants who had packed themselves off at a moments notice wondering generally what the world was coming too  it occurred to me at the time that without much trouble they could have lived a peaceful life without servants the eldest girl was learning paintingand seemed unable to learn anything else  it was poor sort of painting she noticed it herself but she seemed to think that if she talked a lot about it and thought of nothing else that somehow it would all come right  the second girl played the violin  she played it from early morning till late evening and friends fell away from them  there wasnt a spark of talent in the family but they all had a notion that a vague longing to be admired was just the same as genius  another daughter fancied she would like to be an actress and screamed all day in the attic  the fourth wrote poetry on a typewriter and wondered why nobody seemed to want it while the fifth one suffered from a weird belief that smearing wood with a red hot sort of poker was a thing worth doing for its own sake  all of them seemed willing enough to work provided only that it was work of no use to any living soul  with a little sense and the occasional assistance of a charwoman they could have led a merrier life  if i was giving away secrets said mrs wilkins id say to the mistresses  show yourselves able to be independent  its because the gals know that the mistresses cant do without them that they sometimes gives themselves airs    why we hate the foreigner    the advantage that the foreigner possesses over the englishman is that he is born good  he does not have to try to be good as we do he does not have to start the new year with the resolution to be good and succeed bar accidents in being so till the middle of january  he is just good all the year round  when a foreigner is told to mount or descend from a tram on the near side it does not occur to him that it would be humanly possible to secure egress from or ingress to that tram from the off side  in brussels once i witnessed a daring attempt by a lawless foreigner to enter a tram from the wrong side  the gate was open  he was standing close beside it  a line of traffic was in his way  to have got round to the right side of that tram would have meant missing it he entered when the conductor was not looking and took his seat the astonishment of the conductor on finding him there was immense how did he get there  the conductor had been watching the proper entrance and the man had not passed him  later the true explanation suggested itself to the conductor but for a while he hesitated to accuse a fellow human being of such crime  he appealed to the passenger himself  was his presence to be accounted for by miracle or by sin  the passenger confessed  it was more in sorrow than in anger that the conductor requested him at once to leave  this tram was going to be kept respectable  the passenger proved refractory a halt was called and the gendarmerie appealed to  after the manner of policemen they sprang as it were from the ground and formed up behind an imposing officer whom i took to be the sergeant  at first the sergeant could hardly believe the conductors statement  even then had the passenger asserted that he had entered by the proper entrance his word would have been taken much easier to the foreign official mind would it have been to believe that the conductor had been stricken with temporary blindness than that man born of woman would have deliberately done anything expressly forbidden by a printed notice  myself in his case i should have lied and got the trouble over but he was a proud man or had not much senseone of the two and so held fast to the truth  it was pointed out to him that he must descend immediately and wait for the next tram  other gendarmes were arriving from every quarter  resistance in the circumstances seemed hopeless  he said he would get down  he made to descend this time by the proper gate but that was not justice  he had mounted the wrong side he must alight on the wrong side  accordingly he was put out amongst the traffic after which the conductor preached a sermon from the centre of the tram on the danger of ascents and descents conducted from the wrong quarter  there is a law throughout germanyan excellent law it is  i would we had it in englandthat nobody may scatter paper about the street an english military friend told me that one day in dresden unacquainted with this rule he tore a long letter he had been reading into some fifty fragments and threw them behind him  a policeman stopped him and explained to him quite politely the law upon the subject  my military friend agreed that it was a very good law thanked the man for his information and said that for the future he would bear it in mind  that as the policeman pointed out would make things right enough for the future but meanwhile it was necessary to deal with the pastwith the fifty or so pieces of paper lying scattered about the road and pavement  my military friend with a pleasant laugh confessed he did not see what was to be done  the policeman more imaginative saw a way out it was that my military friend should set to work and pick up those fifty scraps of paper  he is an english general on the retired list and of imposing appearance  his manner on occasion is haughty  he did not see himself on his hands and knees in the chief street of dresden in the middle of the afternoon picking up paper  the german policeman himself admitted that the situation was awkward if the english general could not accept it there happened to be an alternative  it was that the english general should accompany the policeman through the streets followed by the usual crowd to the nearest prison some three miles off  it being now four oclock in the afternoon they would probably find the judge departed  but the most comfortable thing possible in prison cells should be allotted to him and the policeman had little doubt that the general having paid his fine of forty marks would find himself a free man again in time for lunch the following day  the general suggested hiring a boy to pick up the paper  the policeman referred to the wording of the law and found that this would not be permitted  i thought the matter out my friend told me imagining all the possible alternatives including that of knocking the fellow down and making a bolt and came to the conclusion that his first suggestion would on the whole result in the least discomfort  but i had no idea that picking up small scraps of thin paper off greasy stones was the business that i found it  it took me nearly ten minutes and afforded amusement i calculate to over a thousand people  but it is a good law mind you  all i wish is that i had known it beforehand  on one occasion i accompanied an american lady to a german opera house  the takingoff of hats in the german schausspielhaus is obligatory and again i would it were so in england  but the american lady is accustomed to disregard rules made by mere man  she explained to the doorkeeper that she was going to wear her hat  he on his side explained to her that she was not  they were both a bit short with one another  i took the opportunity to turn aside and buy a programme  the fewer people there are mixed up in an argument i always think the better  my companion explained quite frankly to the doorkeeper that it did not matter what he said she was not going to take any notice of him he did not look a talkative man at any time and maybe this announcement further discouraged him  in any case he made no attempt to answer  all he did was to stand in the centre of the doorway with a faraway look in his eyes  the doorway was some four feet wide  he was about three feet six across and weighed about twenty stone  as i explained i was busy buying a programme and when i returned my friend had her hat in her hand and was digging pins into it  i think she was trying to make believe it was the heart of the doorkeeper  she did not want to listen to the opera she wanted to talk all the time about that doorkeeper but the people round us would not even let her do that  she has spent three winters in germany since then  now when she feels like passing through a door that is standing wide open just in front of her and which leads to just the place she wants to get to and an official shakes his head at her and explains that she must not but must go up two flights of stairs and along a corridor and down another flight of stairs and so get to her place that way she apologises for her error and trots off looking ashamed of herself  continental governments have trained their citizens to perfection obedience is the continents first law  the story that is told of a spanish king who was nearly drowned because the particular official whose duty it was to dive in after spanish kings when they tumbled out of boats happened to be dead and his successor had not yet been appointed i can quite believe  on the continental railways if you ride second class with a firstclass ticket you render yourself liable to imprisonment  what the penalty is for riding first with a secondclass ticket i cannot sayprobably death though a friend of mine came very near on one occasion to finding out  all would have gone well with him if he had not been so darned honest  he is one of those men who pride themselves on being honest i believe he takes a positive pleasure in being honest  he had purchased a secondclass ticket for a station up a mountain but meeting by chance on the platform a lady acquaintance had gone with her into a firstclass apartment  on arriving at the journeys end he explained to the collector what he had done and with his purse in his hand demanded to know the difference  they took him into a room and locked the door  they wrote out his confession and read it over to him and made him sign it and then they sent for a policeman  the policeman crossexamined him for about a quarter of an hour they did not believe the story about the lady  where was the lady he did not know  they searched the neighbourhood for her but could not find her  he suggestedwhat turned out to be the truththat tired of loitering about the station she had gone up the mountain an anarchist outrage had occurred in the neighbouring town some months before  the policeman suggested searching for bombs fortunately a cooks agent returning with a party of tourists arrived upon the scene and took it upon himself to explain in delicate language that my friend was a bit of an ass and could not tell first class from second  it was the red cushions that had deceived my friend  he thought it was first class as a matter of fact it was second class  everybody breathed again  the confession was torn up amid universal joy  and then the fool of a ticket collector wanted to know about the ladywho must have travelled in a secondclass compartment with a firstclass ticket  it looked as if a bad time were in store for her on her return to the station  but the admirable representative of cook was again equal to the occasion  he explained that my friend was also a bit of a liar when he said he had travelled with this lady he was merely boasting he would like to have travelled with her that was all he meant only his german was shaky  joy once more entered upon the scene  my friends character appeared to be reestablished  he was not the abandoned wretch for whom they had taken himonly apparently a wandering idiot  such an one the german official could respect  at the expense of such an one the german official even consented to drink beer  not only the foreign man woman and child but the foreign dog is born good  in england if you happen to be the possessor of a dog much of your time is taken up dragging him out of fights quarrelling with the possessor of the other dog as to which began it explaining to irate elderly ladies that he did not kill the cat that the cat must have died of heart disease while running across the road assuring disbelieving gamekeepers that he is not your dog that you have not the faintest notion whose dog he is  with the foreign dog life is a peaceful proceeding  when the foreign dog sees a row tears spring to his eyes  he hastens on and tries to find a policeman  when the foreign dog sees a cat in a hurry he stands aside to allow her to pass  they dress the foreign dogsome of themin a little coat with a pocket for his handkerchief and put shoes on his feet  they have not given him a hatnot yet  when they do he will contrive by some means or another to raise it politely when he meets a cat he thinks he knows  one morning in a continental city i came across a disturbanceit might be more correct to say the disturbance came across me  it swept down upon me enveloped me before i knew that i was in it  a foxterrier it was belonging to a very young ladyit was when the disturbance was to a certain extent over that we discovered he belonged to this young lady  she arrived towards the end of the disturbance very much out of breath  she had been running for a mile poor girl and shouting most of the way  when she looked round and saw all the things that had happened and had had other things that she had missed explained to her she burst into tears  an english owner of that foxterrier would have given one look round and then have jumped upon the nearest tram going anywhere  but as i have said the foreigner is born good  i left her giving her name and address to seven different people  but it was about the dog i wished to speak more particularly  he had commenced innocently enough trying to catch a sparrow  nothing delights a sparrow more than being chased by a dog  a dozen times he thought he had the sparrow  then another dog had got in his way  i dont know what they call this breed of dog but abroad it is popular  it has no tail and looks like a pigwhen things are going well with it  this particular specimen when i saw him looked more like part of a doormat  the foxterrier had seized it by the scruff of the neck and had rolled it over into the gutter just in front of a motor cycle  its owner a large lady had darted out to save it and had collided with the motor cyclist  the large lady had been thrown some half a dozen yards against an italian boy carrying a tray load of plaster images  i have seen a good deal of trouble in my life but never one yet that did not have an italian imagevendor somehow or other mixed up in it where these boys hide in times of peace is a mystery  the chance of being upset brings them out as sunshine brings out flies  the motor cycle had dashed into a little milkcart and had spread it out neatly in the middle of the tram lines  the tram traffic looked like being stopped for a quarter of an hour but the idea of every approaching tram driver appeared to be that if he rang his bell with sufficient vigor this seeming obstruction would fade away and disappear  in an english town all this would not have attracted much attention somebody would have explained that a dog was the original cause and the whole series of events would have appeared ordinary and natural upon these foreigners the fear descended that the almighty for some reason was angry with them  a policeman ran to catch the dog  the delighted dog rushed backwards barking furiously and tried to throw up paving stones with its hind legs  that frightened a nursemaid who was wheeling a perambulator and then it was that i entered into the proceedings  seated on the edge of the pavement with a perambulator on one side of me and a howling baby on the other i told that dog what i thought of him  forgetful that i was in a foreign landthat he might not understand mei told it him in english i told it him at length i told it very loud and clear  he stood a yard in front of me listening to me with an expression of ecstatic joy i have never before or since seen equalled on any face human or canine  he drank it in as though it had been music from paradise  where have i heard that song before he seemed to be saying to himself the old familiar language they used to talk to me when i was young  he approached nearer to me there were almost tears in his eyes when i had finished  say it again he seemed to be asking of me  oh say it all over again the dear old english oaths and curses that in this god forsaken land i never hoped to hear again  i learnt from the young lady that he was an englishborn foxterrier that explained everything  the foreign dog does not do this sort of thing  the foreigner is born good  that is why we hate him
