seasons he had some men to help him in his work but for the greater part of the year he preferred doing everything himself  it was a very fine garden over which john gayther had charge it extended this way and that for long distances it was difficult to see how far it did extend there were so many oldfashioned box hedges so many paths overshadowed by venerable grapearbors and so many farstretching rows of peach plum and pear trees fruit bushes and vines there were of which the roll need not be called and flowers grew everywhere it was one of the fancies of the mistress of the houseand she inherited it from her motherto have flowers in great abundance so that wherever she might walk through the garden she would always find them  often when she found them massed too thickly she would go in among them and thin them out with apparent recklessness pulling them up by the roots and throwing them on the path where john gayther would come and find them and take them away this heroic action on the part of the mistress of the house pleased john very much he respected the fearless spirit which did not hesitate to make sacrifices for the greater good no matter how many beautiful blossoms she scattered on the garden path john gayther might have thinned out all this superfluous growth himself but he knew the mistress liked to do it and he left for her gloved hands many tangled jungles of luxuriant bloom  the garden was old and rich and aristocratic it acted generously in the way of fruit flowers and vegetables as if that were something it was expected to do an action to which it was obliged by its nobility it would be impossible for it to forget that it belonged to a fine old house and a fine old family  john gayther could not boast of lines of long descent as could the garden and the family he was comparatively a newcomer and had not lived in that garden more than seven or eight years but in that time he had so identified himself with the place and all who dwelt upon it that there were times when a stranger might have supposed him to be the common ancestor to the whole estate  john understood well the mysterious problems of the tillable earth and he knew as well as anybody could know what answers to expect when he consulted the oracles of nature he was an elderly man and the gentle exercises of the garden were suited to the disposition of his mind and body in days gone by he had been a sailor a soldier a miner a ranchman and a good many other things besides in those earlier days according to his own account john had had many surprising adventures and experiences but in these later times his memory was by far the most active and vigorous of all his moving forces this memory was like a hazel wand in the hands of a man who is searching for hidden springs of water whenever he wished it to turn and point in any particular place or direction it so turned and pointed                           this story is told by                             john gayther                            and is called                       what i found in the sea     i  what i found in the sea   it was on a morning in june that john gayther was hoeing peas drawing the fine earth up about their tender little stems as a mother would tuck the clothes about her little sleeping baby when happening to glance across several beds and rows of box he saw approaching the daughter of the house probably she was looking for him but he did not think she had yet seen him he put down his hoe feeling as he did that this june morning was getting very warm and he gathered up an armful of peasticks which were lying near by with these he made his way toward a little house almost in the middle of the garden which was his fortress his palace his studio or his workshop as the case might be  it was a low building with a faroutreaching roof and under the shade of this roof outside of the little building john liked to do his rainyday and veryhotweather work from the cool interior came a smell of dried plants and herbs and bulbs and potted earth  when john reached this gardenhouse the young lady was already there she was not tall her face was very white but not pale and her light hair fluffed itself all about her head under her wide hat she wore gold spectacles which greatly enhanced the effect of her large blue eyes john thought she was the prettiest flower which had ever showed itself in that garden  good morning john she said i came here to ask you about plants suitable for goldfishes in a vase my fishes do not seem to be satisfied with the knowledge that the plants through which they swim were put there to purify the water they are all the time trying to eat them now it strikes me that there ought to be some plants which would be purifiers and yet good for the poor things to eat  john put down his bundle of peasticks by the side of a small stool wont you sit down miss pointing to a gardenbench near by and i will see what i can do for you then he seated himself upon the stool took out his knife and picked up a peastick  the best thing for me to do he said is to look over a book i have which will tell me just the kind of water plants which your goldfish ought to have i will do that this evening and then i will see to it that you shall have those plants whatever they may be i do not pretend to be much of a water gardener myself but its easy for me to find out what other people know john now began to trim some of the lower twigs from a peastick  talking about water gardens miss he said i wish you could have seen some of the beautiful ones that i have come acrossmore beautiful and lovely than anything on the top of the earth you may be sure of that i was reminded of them the moment you spoke to me about your goldfish and their plants  where were those gardens asked the young lady and what were they like  they were all on the bottom of the sea in the tropics said john gayther where the water is so clear that with a little help you can see everything just as if it were out in the open airbushes and vines and hedges all sorts of tender waving plants all made of seaweed and coral growing in the white sand and instead of birds flying about among their branches there were little fishes of every color canarycolored fishes fishes like robinredbreasts and others which you might have thought were blue jays if they had been up in the air instead of down in the water  where did you say all this is to be seen asked the daughter of the house who loved all lovely things  oh in a good many places in warm climates said john but now i come to think of it there was one place where i saw more beautiful sights more grand and wonderful sights under the water than i believe anybody ever saw before would you like me to tell you about it  indeediwould said she taking off her hat  john now began to sharpen the end of his peastick it was a good many years ago said he more than twentyand i was then a seafaring man i was on board a brig cruising in the west indies and we were off porto rico about twenty miles northward i should say when we ran into something in the nightwe never could find out what it wasand we stove a big hole in that brig which soon began to let in a good deal more water than we could pump out the captain he was a man that knew all about that part of the world and he told us all that we must work as hard as we could at the pumps and if we could keep her afloat until he could run her ashore on a little sandy island he knew of not far from stÂ thomas we might be saved there was a fresh breeze from the west and he thought he could make the island before we sank  i was mighty glad to hear him say this for i had always been nervous when i was cruising off porto rico do you know miss that those waters are the very deepest in the whole world  no said she i never heard that  well they are said john if you should take the very tallest mountain there is in any part of the earth and put it down north of porto rico so that the bottom of it shall rest on the bottom of the sea the top of that mountain would be sunk clean out of sight so that ships could sail over it just as safely as they sail in any part of the ocean  of course a man would drown just as easily in a couple of fathoms of water as in this deep place but it is perfectly horrible to think of sinking down down down into the very deepest waterhole on the face of the whole earth  didnt you have any boats asked the young lady  we hadnt any said john we had sold all of them about two months before to a british merchantman who had lost her boats in a cyclone one of the things our captain wanted to get to stÂ thomas for was to buy some more boats he heard he could get some cheap ones there  well we pumped and sailed as well as we could but we hadnt got anywhere near that sandy island the captain was making for when one morning after breakfast our brig which was pretty low in the water by this time gave a little hitch and a grind and stuck fast on something and if we hadnt been lively in taking in all sail there would have been trouble but the weather was fine and the sea was smooth and when we had time to think about what had happened we were resting on the surface of the sea just as quiet and tranquil as if we had been a toy ship in a shopwindow  what we had stuck on was a puzzle indeed as i said before our captain knew all about that part of the sea and although he knew we were in shallow soundings he was certain that there wasnt any shoal or rock thereabout that we could get stuck on  we sounded all around the brig and found lots of water at the stern but not so much forward we were stuck fast on something but nobody could imagine what it was however we were not sinking any deeper and that was a comfort and the captain he believed that if we had had boats we could row to stÂ thomas but we didnt have any boats so we had to make the best of it he put up a flag of distress and waited till some craft should come along and take us off  the captain and the crew didnt seem to be much troubled about what had happened for so long as the sea did not get up they could make themselves very comfortable as they were but there were two men on board who didnt take things easy they wanted to know what had happened and they wanted to know what was likely to happen next i was one of these men and a stockbroker from new york was the other he was an awful nervous fidgety meddling sort of a man who was on this cruise for the benefit of his health which must have been pretty well worn out with howling and yelling and trying to catch profits like a lively boy catches flies he was always poking his nose into all sorts of things that didnt concern him and spent about half of his time trying to talk the captain into selling his brig and putting the money into pacific lardor it might have been mexican balloon stock as well as i remember this man was tingling all over with anxiety to find out what we had stuck on but as he could not stick his nose into the water and find out and as there was nobody to tell him he had to keep on tingling  i was just as wild to know what it was the brig was resting on as the stockbroker was but i had the advantage of him for i believed that i could find out and at any rate i determined to try did you ever hear of a waterglass miss  no i never did said the daughter of the house who was listening with great interest  well i will try to describe one to you said john gayther you make a light box about twenty inches high and a foot square and with both ends open then you get a pane of glass and fasten it securely in one end of this box then youve got your waterglassa tall box with a glass bottom  the way that you use it is this you get in a boat and put the box in the water glass bottom down then you lean over and put your head into the open end and if you will lay something over the back of your head as a man does when he is taking photographs so as to keep out the light from above it will be all the better then miss youd be perfectly amazed at what you could see through that glass at the bottom of the box even in northern regions where the water is heavy and murky you can see a good way down but all about the tropics where the water is often so thin and clear that you can see the bottom in some places with nothing but your naked eyes it is perfectly amazing what you can see with a waterglass it doesnt seem a bit as if you were looking down into the sea it is just like gazing about in the upper air if it isnt too deep things on the bottomfishes swimming about everythingis just as plain and distinct as if there wasnt any water under you and you were just looking down from the top of a house  well i made up my mind that the only way for me to find out what it was that was under the brig was to make a waterglass and look down into the sea and so i made one taking care not to let the stockbroker know anything about it for i didnt want any of his meddling in my business i had to tell the captain but he said he would keep his mouth shut for he didnt like the stockbroker any more than i did  well miss i made that waterglass and when the stockbroker was taking a nap for he was clean tired out poking about and asking questions and trying to find out what he might get out of the business if he helped to save the brig the captain and i with a few men quietly let down into the water the aft hatch one of those big doors they cover the hatchways with and when that was resting on the water it made a very good raft for one man and i got down on it with my waterglass and an oar  the first thing i did of course was to paddle around the brig to the place where she had been stove in she wasnt leaking any more because the water inside of her was just as high as the water outside so if we could do anything this was the time to do it i looked down into the water on our starboard bow and i soon found the place where the brig had been stove in probably by some waterlogged piece of wreckage i located the hole exactly and i reported to the captain who was leaning over the side then i paddled around the brig to see if i could find out what we were resting on  when i had sunk my waterglass well into the water and had got my head into the top of it i looked down on a scene which seemed like fairyland the corals and water plants of different colors and the white glistening sand and the fishes big and little red yellow pink and blue swimming about among the branches just as if they had wings instead of fins that i told you of just now were all there and the light down under the water seemed so clear and bright that i could see everything under me that was as big as a pea  that must have been an entrancing vision said the daughter of the house  indeed it was replied john gayther but would you believe me miss i didnt look at it for more than half a minute for when i turned my waterglass so that i could look under the brig i could not give a thought to anything else in the world except the astonishing objects our brig was resting on  at first i could not believe my eyes i paddled around and around and i put down my waterglass and i stared and i stared until i felt as if my eyes were coming out of my head at last i had to believe what i saw there was no use trying to think that my eyes had made a mistake it was all just as plain to me as you are now  down in the water resting on the bottom of this shallow part of the sea were two great shipsships of the olden time with enormously high poops which were the stern part of oldfashioned vessels built way up high like a fourstory house these two antiquated vessels were lying side by side and close together with their tall poops reaching far up toward the surface of the sea and right on top of them resting partly on one ship and partly on the other was our brig just as firmly fixed as if she had been on the stocks in a shipyard  the whole thing was so wonderful that it nearly took away my breath i got around to the stern of the brig and then i stared down at the two vessels under her until i forgot there was anything else in this whole world than those two great oldfashioned ships and myself the more i looked the more certain i became that no such vessels had floated on the top of the sea for at least two hundred years from what i had read about oldtime ships and from the pictures i had seen of them i made up my mind that one of those vessels was an old spanish galleon and the other one looked to me very much as if it were an englishbuilt ship  and how did they ever happen to be wrecked there side by side almost gasped the young lady  oh they had been fighting said john there could be no mistake about that they had been fighting each other to the death and they had gone down together side by side and there was our brig two hundred years afterwards resting quietly on top of both of them  i was still wrapped up body and soul in this wonderful discovery when i heard a hail from the stern of the brig and there was that stockbroker shouting to me to know what i was looking at of course that put an end to my observations and i paddled to the side and got on board  lend me that box said the stockbroker and let me get down on your raft what is it youve been looking at and what did you see in that box  but he had got hold of the wrong man no sir said i find a box for yourself if you want one and i held mine so that he could not see that the bottom of it was glass then the captain came along and told him not to try to get down on that hatch for if he did he would topple into the water and get himself drowned which would have been certain to happen for he could not swim then the hatch was hauled on deck and i went below with the captain to his cabin to tell him what i had seen the stockbroker tried awfully hard to come with us but we wouldnt let him  when the captain had heard all i had to tell him he wasnt struck sentimentally the least bit as i had been it did not make any more difference to him whether those two ships had been down there two hundred years or two years but there was another part to the affair that was very interesting to him  gayther said he its ten to one that them ships has got treasure aboard and what weve got to do is to form a company and go to work and get it  and how would you do that said i  the captain was from provincetown cape cod and it didnt take him two seconds to work out his whole plan  its this way said he the first thing to do is to form a company i am president and you can be the other officers when that is all fixed we can go to work and well mend that hole in our bow now if you know just where it is well work day and night in that hold water or no water and well stop it up then well pump the brig out and i believe shell float then well mark this place with a buoy and well sail away as fast as we can with our company all formed and everything fixed and settled then well come back with the vessels and machines and well get out that treasure well divide it into three parts one part will be mine one part will be yours and the other part will go to the crew  and how about the stockbroker said i going to let him in the company  no sir said the captain bringing his fist down on the table whatever else happens he is to be kept out  this was a very fine plan but it didnt altogether suit me i didnt want to sail away from that spot and perhaps never see those two ships again there was no knowing what more i might find out with my waterglass if that stockbroker could be kept from bothering me  i told the captain this and he looked hard at me and he said it will take a couple of days to mend that leak and to pump out the brig if this fine weather keeps on i think we can do it in that time and if while we are working at it you choose to try to find out more about them two ships you can do it  and how can i do it said i  if you can go down in a divers suit you can do it said he i dont know whether you know anything about that business but if you want to try i have got a whole kit on board airpump armor and everything it belongs to a diver that was out with me about a year ago in the gulf of mexico he had to go north to attend to some business and he told me he would let me know when he would come back and get his divingkit but he hasnt come back yet and the whole business is stowed away here on board do you know anything about going down in a divingsuit  now i had never done anything in the way of diving but i had heard a good deal about it and i had seen divers at work and my whole soul was so jumping and shouting inside of me at the very idea of going down and searching into the secrets of those two old ships that i told the captain i was ready to undertake the diving business just the minute he could get things in shape  well miss early the next morningand i can tell you i didnt sleep much that nighteverything was ready for me to go down and two of the crew who had done that sort of thing before were detailed to attend to the airpumps and all the other business the stockbroker he was like a bee on a windowpane he was buzzing and kicking and bumping his head trying to find out what we expected to do but the captain wouldnt tell him anything you may be sure i wouldnt and nobody else knew  as soon as we could get things straightened out i was lowered over the side of the brig and sunk out of sight into the water the captain and all the crew except the men who were attending to me then went to work to mend the hole in the side of the brig and the last thing i heard as i went under the water was the stockbroker howling and yelling and rampaging around the deck  as i told you before miss i had never been down in a divingsuit but i paid the greatest attention to everything i knew and i got down to the bottom all right having a hard time to keep from being scratched to pieces by the barnacles on the sterns of the big ships  i clumped about for a while on the sandy bottom so as to get familiar with the airtubes signalcords and all that and then i signalled to be hauled up a bit and after a good deal of trouble i got on board the vessel which i was sure was a spanish galleon as i stood on her upper deck looking around i felt as if i was in a world of wonders there was water everywhere of coursein and around and about everything but i could see so plainly that i forgot that i was not moving about in the open air  i cant tell you miss everything i saw on that great ship for it would take too long but as soon as i could i set to work to see if i could find the treasure that i hoped was on board of her here and there about the decks i saw swords and pistols and old cannon but not a sign of any of the brave fellows that had fought the ship for the fish had eaten them up long ago bones and all  while hunting about and being careful to keep my airtube from fouling i looked into a cabin with the door open and you will believe me miss when i tell you that a cold chill ran down my back when i saw something moving inside just as if it was a man getting up to see what i wanted it turned out to be a big fish about half my size and he did not ask any questions but just swam through the open door almost brushing me and went his way  i wonder you werent frightened to death said the daughter of the house  it would be hard to kill me with fright said john gayther and ill prove that to you miss as i moved on still looking for the treasure i came to the door of another cabin and this was shut and bolted on the outside i had a hatchet with me and with this i knocked back the bolts and forced open the door and there i saw something to make anybody jump sitting on a locker right in front of the door was the skeleton of a man the room had been shut up so tight that no fish big enough to eat bones could get in but the little things that live in the water and can get through any crack had eaten all of that man except his bones his gold buttons that were lying about on the floor the golden embroidery of his uniform that was still hanging about on his skeleton and the iron fetters on his hands and feet he was most likely a prisoner of rank who was being taken back to spain and he had been shut up there through all the fight  the first thought that came into my mind when i looked at him was that he might be columbus and that the spaniards had made up the story about their really getting him back to spain at the time when he was to be brought home in irons but thinking more about it i knew that this could not be true and so i shut the door so as to keep the poor fellow from any intrusions so long as he might happen to stay there  then i went to work in real earnest to find the treasure and i tell you miss i did find it  what exclaimed the daughter of the house you really found the treasure on that spanish galleon  indeed i did replied john gayther it was in boxes stowed away in a big room in the stern i smashed the door and there were the boxes i went to work at one of them with my hatchet and i had just forced up one corner of the lid and had seen that it was filled with big gold pieces when i felt a pull on my signalrope and knew that they wanted me to come up so i put my fingers into the crack and got out a few of the coins i could not take a whole box it would have been too heavy and then i went out of that room and signalled that i was ready to go up it was time i can tell you miss for i was getting mighty nervous and excited and i needed rest and something to eat  when i was safe on the deck of the brig i found everybody gathered there waiting to hear what i had to tell they had stopped work for dinner and that is the reason i had been signalled  but i didnt say anything to anybody as soon as my helmet was unscrewed and i was out of my divingsuit i went below with the captain and although the stockbroker followed us close and nearly pushed himself into the cabin we shut the door on him and kept him out then i told the captain everything and i showed him the three gold coins which i had kept all the time tightly clinched in my right hand i can tell you the eyes of both of us were wide open when we looked at those coins two of them were dated sixteen hundred and something and one of them fifteen hundred they were big fellows worth about ten dollars apiece the captain took them and locked them up  now said he do you think you will be able to go down again today if you want to see whats in the other ship youve got to be lively about it for i think we can get the brig pumped out in twentyfour hours and if a stiff breeze should spring up tomorrow afternoonand i am inclined to think it willwe dont want to be caught here if the other ships a treasureship he went on to say you know it would be a good deal better for our company and so it might be well to find out  i didnt need any spurring to make me go down again for i was all on fire to know what was on board the other ship which i was sure was english having had a good opportunity of looking at it while i was down there  so as soon as i had taken a rest and had had my dinner i went on deck to get ready for another diving expedition there was the stockbroker watching me like a snake watching a bird he didnt stamp around and ask any more questions he just kept his venomous eye on me as if he would like to kill me because i knew more than he did but i didnt concern myself about him and down i went and this time i got myself aboard the english vessel just as soon as i could  it wasnt as interesting as the old spanish vessel but still i saw enough to fill up a book if i had time to tell it there were more signs of fighting than there had been on the other ship muskets and swords were scattered about everywhere and although she was plainly a merchantvessel she had a lot of the small cannon used in those days  i looked about a great deal and it struck me that she had been a merchantman trading with the west indies but glad enough to fight a spanish treasureship if she happened to come across one it was more than likely that her crew had been a regular set of halfbuccaneers willing to trade if there was trade and fight if there was any fighting on hand anyway the two vessels had had a tough time of it and each of them had met her match i could see the grapplingirons which had fastened them together they had blown so many holes in each others sides that they had gone to the bottom as peaceably as a pair of twins holding each other by the hands  i worked hard on that english ship and i went everywhere where i dared to go but i couldnt find any signs that she had carried treasure i hadnt the least doubt that she was on an outward voyage and that the spaniard was homeward bound  at last i got down into the hold and there i found a great number of big hogsheads that were packed in so well under the deck that they had never moved in all these years of course i wanted to know what was in them for although it would not be gold or silver it might be something almost as precious if it happened to be spirits of the olden time  after banging and working for some time i got out the bung of one of these hogsheads and immediately air began to bubble up and i could hear the water running in it was plain the hogshead was empty and i clapped the bung in again as quick as i could i wasnt accustomed to sounding barrels or hogsheads under water but as i knew this was an empty one i sounded it with my hatchet and then i went around and got the same kind of a sound from each of the others that i hammered on they were all empty every blessed one of them  now i was certain that this vessel had been outward bound she had been taking out empty hogsheads and had expected to carry them back full of west indian rum which was a mighty profitable article of commerce in those days but she had fallen into temptation and had gone to the bottom and here were her hogsheads just as tight and just as empty as on the day she set sail from england  as i stood looking at the great wall of empty hogsheads in front of me wondering if it would not be better to give up searching any more on this vessel which evidently had not been laden with anything valuable and go again on board the spanish ship and make some sort of a plan for fastening lines to those treasureboxes so that they might be hauled up on board the brig i began to feel a sort of trouble with my breath as if i might suffocate if i did not get out soon i knew of course that something was the matter with my airsupply and i signalled for them to pump lively but it was of no use my supply of fresh air seemed to be cut off i began to gasp i was terribly frightened you may be sure for with air gone and no answer to my signals i must perish i jerked savagely at my signalcord to let them know that i wanted to be pulled upit was possible that i might reach the surface before being suffocatedbut the cord offered no resistance i pulled it toward me as i jerked it had been cut or broken  then i took hold of my airtube and pulled it it too was unattached at the other end it had no connection with the airpump  breathing with great difficulty and with my legs trembling under me a thought flashed through my mind as rapidly as possible i drew in the indiarubber airtube presently i had the loose end of it in my hand then i caught hold of the bung of the hogshead which i had opened and which was just in front of me and the instant i pulled it out i thrust in the end of the airtube to my great delight it fitted tightly in the bunghole and now in an instant i felt as if i was sitting upon the pinnacles of paradise air fresh air came to me through the tube not in abundance not freely for there was some water in the tube and there was a good deal of gurgling but it was air fresh air and every time an exhaled breath escaped through the valve in my helmet a little air from the hogshead came in to take its place  i stood for a while weak with happiness i did not know what had happened i did not care i could breathe that was everything in the world to me  by gradually raising the tube a few feet at a time i managed to empty the water it contained into the hogshead and then i breathed more easily as i did not wish to wait until the air in the hogshead had been exhausted i went to work on the bung in the next one and soon transferred the end of my tube to that which would probably last me a good while for it was almost entirely free from water  now i began to cogitate and wonder i pulled in the end of the signalcord and i found it had not been rubbed and torn by barnacles the end of it had been clean cut with a knife i remembered that this was the case with the airtube as i placed it into the bunghole of the first hogshead i had noticed how smoothly it had been severed  now i felt a tug at the rope by which i was raised and lowered i didnt like this if i should be pulled up i might be jerked away from my airsupply and suffocate before i got to the surface so i took a turn of the rope around a stick of timber near by and they might pull as much as they chose without disturbing me there i stood and thought and wondered but above everything i could not help feeling all the time how good that air was it seemed to go through every part of me it was better than wine it was better than anything i had ever breathed or tasted a little while ago i was on the point of perishing now before me there were tiers of hogsheads full of air if it had not been that i would be obliged to eat i might have stayed down there as long as i pleased  i had stayed a long time and i was at work on the air in a third hogsheadnot having half used up the contents of the other twobefore i really made up my mind as to what had happened i was sure that there had been foul play and i felt quite as sure that the stockbroker was at the bottom of it except that man there was no one on board the brig who would wish to do me a harm the stockbroker he hated me i had seen that in his face as plainly as if it had been painted on a signboard i knew something which he did not know i was trying to get something which was to be kept a secret from him if i could be put out of the way he probably thought he might have some sort of a chance i could not fathom the mans mind but thats the way it looked to me  i had been down there a long time and it must have been getting toward the end of the afternoon so i prepared to leave my watery retirement i had made a plan and it worked very well i placed the end of my airtube far into the bunghole of the hogshead so that i might not accidentally pull it out i loosened myself from the bit of timber and then i made my way to the bow of the vessel on which i was looking upward i found that our brig which was resting on the tall poops of the two sunken vessels was so suspended above me that her fore chains which ran under her bowsprit were almost over my head  now i stood and took some long deep breaths then having made everything ready i jerked myself out of that divingsuit in a very few seconds and standing free i gave a great leap upward and went straight to the surface i am a good swimmer and with a few strokes i caught the chains stealthily i clambered up making not the least noise and peeped over the rail there was nobody forward the whole ships company seemed to be crowded aft where there was a great stir and confusion i slipped quietly over the rail and without being seen by anybody made my way into the forecastle i hurried to my seachest i took off my wet things and dressed myself in an almost new suit of shore clothes which i had never worn on the brig i did not lose any more time than i could help but i took unusual care in dressing myself i put on a new pair of yellow shoes and turned up the bottom of my trousers so as to show my red socks i had a big felt hat which i had bought in mexico with a little feather in it and this i put on pulling it rakishly over on one side i put around my neck a long blue silk cravat with white spots which i tied in the biggest bow i could make then feeling that i ought to have something in my hands i picked up a capstanbar and laying it across my arm after the manner of a cutlass i went boldly on deck  making as much noise as possible and advancing with what you might call a majestic tread i strode to the stern of that brig at first my approach was not noticed for there was still a great hubbub and everybody seemed to be shouting or swearing or shaking his fist the stockbroker stood on one side and his tongue was going as fast as anybodys but i noticed that his hands were tied behind him and there was a rope around his neck  the captain was the first to see me he gave me just one look he turned pale and then with a sort of a scared grunt down he went on his knees  when the rest of the men laid eyes on me you never saw such a scared lot in your life their mouths and their eyes went open and their swarthy faces were as white as you could wash a dirty sail some of them shook so that their caps fell off and one or two began to pray  as to the stockbroker he at first seemed greatly startled but he recovered himself in a moment there was nothing superstitious about him and he knew well enough that i was no spirit risen from the deep but a living man  ha ha he shouted here you are after trying to rob and cheat us and making believe to be dead you water thiefhiding safe and sound on deck while such a row is being raised here about your death and all sorts of threats being made against me on account of it look at him my brave men said he turning to the crew look at the fellow who has been trying to rob us and he is the man you ought to hang to the yardarm  then he turned again to me you are a fool of a thief anyway after you had gone down under this vessel i found your box with the glass in the bottom of it i got down close to the water and i watched you i saw you going about in that big sunken ship looking after treasure and no doubt finding it filling your pockets with gold and telling nobody i didnt want to kill you when i cut your airtube as i have told these good sailors but i wanted to make you stop stealing and come up and i did it the treasure under this vessel belongs to us all and you have no right to make a secret business out of it and keep it for yourself and the captain now my good men he shouted to the crew there is the fellow you ought to hang look at him dressed up in fine clothes while you thought he was soaked and dead at the bottom of the sea hang him up i say then well get the treasure and well divide it among us fair and even  this was a dangerous moment for me the men had recovered from their fright they saw i was no spirit and they believed that i had been trying to deceive and defraud them a good many of them drew their knives and came toward me the stockbroker urging them on the captain tried to restrain the men who were near him but they pushed him aside  i now stepped forward i pulled my great hat still further over my face i glared at the men before me and i brought my capstanbar with a tremendous thump upon the deck  sirrah varlets i roared what mean ye stop where ye are and if one man of ye comes nearer ill cleave him to the chine caitiffs varlets hounds dare ye threaten me odsbodikins i like it well by our lady ye are a merry set of mariners who draw your blades upon a man who is come upon this deck to tell ye how to fill your pockets with old gold back there every man of ye and put up your knives ere i split your heads and toss ye into the sea  as i spoke these words my voice and tones were so loud and terrible that i almost frightened myself the crew fell back as i advanced a step or two and every man of them sheathed his knife even the stockbroker seemed to be overawed by my tremendous voice and my fierce appearance  john gayther said the daughter of the house who had been listening very eagerly what made you talk like that and strut about and pound the deck thats not like you i would not have supposed that you ever could have acted so  you will understand it all miss said the gardener when you remember that for nearly two hours i had been breathing the atmosphere of the sixteenth century that atmosphere was the air which for two hundred years had been fastened up in those empty hogsheads i had drawn it into my lungs it had gone into my blood my nerves my brain i was as a man who swashbucklesa reckless mariner of the olden time i longed to take my cutlass in my teeth and board a spaniard as i looked upon the villainous stockbroker before me i felt as if i could take him by the throat plunge down with him to the deck of the spanish galleon and shut him up fast and tight in the room with that manacled spaniard who could not have been columbus i thrilled with a fierce longing for combat it was the air of the sixteenth century which had permeated my every pore  now i fixed upon the stockbroker a terrible glare and stepped toward him money miscreant i yelled you it was who tried first to murder me and then to turn the hearts of all these good men against me i raised my capstanbar in the air aroint thee fiend i yelled get thee below and if anon i see thee i will break thy dastardly skull  at this the stockbroker frightened nearly out of his wits and with his hands still tied and the rope around his neck made a dive for the companionway and disappeared below i stood up very bold i threw out my chest and gazed around in triumph the air of the sixteenth century had saved me those men would have no more dared to attack me as i stood roaring out my defiance and my threat than they would have ventured to give battle to the boldest and the blackest of all bloody buccaneers  i now called the men around me and i told them all my story you may imagine that they opened their eyes and mouths so wide that i thought some of them would never get them shut again but the captainhe was from provincetown cape cod and he went straight to business  weve mended the leak said he and well pump all night and it may be tomorrow we shall float free then well form a company for the recovery of the treasure on that spanish galleon i will take one third of it mrÂ gayther shall have one third and one third shall be divided among the crew then well anchor a buoy near this spot and sail away to come back again as soon as may be  everybody agreed to this and we all went to supper early the next morning a breeze blew very fresh from the southwest then it increased to a gale and before ten oclock the waves began to run so high that one of them lifted the brig clean off the sunken ships on which she had been resting and we were afloat in ten seconds more we were lying broadside to the wind then indeed we had to skip around lively get up some sails and put her properly on the wind before we had time to draw an easy breath we were scudding along far from the spot which we had intended to mark with an anchored buoy there was a good deal of water in the hold but the brig went merrily on as if glad to get away from those two old sea spectres of the past with which she had been keeping such close company  of course it was impossible to beat up against such a wind and so we kept on toward stÂ thomas the captain had carefully taken the longitude and latitude of the spot where we had been stranded on the ancient ships and he was sure he could find the place again by sounding in fair weather  before we reached port he came on deck with the three gold pieces which i had brought up from the spanish galleon one of these he put into his own pocket one he gave to me and the other he gave to the crew to be changed into small coin and divided the stockbroker got nothing and i saw him no more on that voyage i had sworn to break his head if my eyes ever fell upon him and he was wise enough to keep out of my sight  and that is all the money you ever got from the galleon asked the daughter of the house  yes said john gayther that was all i have the ancient gold piece in my room now and some day i will show it to you  as soon as we could do it we all went with the captain to new york and there we organized our company and sold a lot of stock and chartered a good steamer with derricks and everything necessary for raising sunken treasure but although the weather was fair and we sounded and sounded day after day at the very point of longitude and latitude where we had left the two great ships of the olden time we never could find them  one day just before we had concluded to give up the search we saw another vessel not far away also sounding this we afterwards heard belonged to the stockbroker he had chartered a steamer and he had on board of her a president a secretary a treasurer a board of trustees and four derricks we steamed away and soon left him and i am very sure that if his company had ever declared any dividends i should have heard of it  and that is the end of your story john gayther said the daughter of the house as she rose from her seat  yes miss that is the end of it replied the gardener  the young lady said no more but walked away in quiet reflection while john gayther picked up the only peastick on which he had been at work that morning                           this story is told by                      the daughter of the house                            and is called                        the bushwhacker nurse     ii  the bushwhacker nurse   the daughter of the house her fair cheeks a little flushed walked rapidly down the broad centre path of the garden looking for john gayther the gardener she soon saw him at work in a bed of tomatoplants  john said she i have just finished composing a story and i came out to tell it to you before i write it i want to do this because you compose stories yourself which in some ways are a good deal like this of mine but i cant tell it to you out here in the sun isnt there something you can do in your little house havent you some peasticks to sharpen  oh yes miss said john gayther with great alacrity and if you will go and make yourself comfortable under the shed i will be there in a few minutes  it was rather difficult for john gayther to find any peasticks which had not already been stuck into the ground or which wanted sharpening but he succeeded in getting a small armful of them and with these he came to where the young lady was seated he drew up a stool and took out a big knife  now said she gazing through her goldrimmed spectacles far out into the sunlit garden this is the story of a girl  john gayther nodded approvingly the story of a girl was exactly what he would like to hear provided it was told by the young lady who sat in front of him  she was of an independent turn of mind said the daughter of the house and there were a great many things in this world which bored her not because they were uninteresting in themselves but because she could not enjoy them in the way which suited her she had thought of hundreds of things she would like to do if she only could do them in her own way and without control by other people she was very anxious to perform deeds noble deeds if possible but she could not endure the everlasting control which seems to be thought necessary in this worldat least for girls the consequence of this was that she spent a great deal of her time in doing things which made no imprint whatever upon the progress of the world or upon the elevation of her own character  now it happened that at the time of my story there was a war in the land and a great many people with whom my heroine was acquainted went forth to do battle for their country and their principles or to act patriotically in some other way than fighting i forgot to say that my heroine is named almia  de ponsett i suppose interrupted john gayther almia de ponsett is the name of a beautiful new white tearose  not at all said the young lady drawing her eyebrows slightly together there is no de ponsett about it and her name has nothing to do with tearoses it is simply almia she grew more and more dissatisfied every day the war went on everybody who was worth anything was doing something and here she was doing nothing what was there she could do this became the great question of her life if i were about to write out this story i would say something here about the workings of her mind but that is not necessary now but her mind worked a great deal and the end of it was that she determined to be a nurse nursing indeed is the only thing a young woman can do in a war  but when she began to make inquiries about army nurseswhat they ought to do how they ought to do it and all thatshe ran up against that terrible bugbear of control everywhere was control control control and she really began to despair there were examinations and training and applications to the surgeongeneral and to the assistant surgeon and to special heads of departments and districts and states and counties for all i know there was positively no end to the things she would have to do to get a regular appointment to go forth and do her duty to her country so she threw up the whole business of regular army nursing and made up her mind to go out into the field of duty to which she had appointed herself and do the things she ought to do in the way she thought they ought to be done she likened herself to the knights of old who used to go forth to fight for their ladies and for the upholding of chivalry she wanted to be a sort of a freelance but she did not want to hire herself to anybody she did not fancy being anything like a guerilla and then it suddenly struck her that if she did just as she wanted to do she would resemble a bushwhacker more than anything else a bushwhacker is an honest man when there is no war he whacks bushes that is he cuts them down and when there is a war  he whacks the enemy suggested john gayther  the daughter of the house smiled a little yes she said he tries to do that but he is entirely independent he is under nobody and that suited almia a bushwhacker nurse was exactly what she wanted to be and as soon as this was settled she made all her preparations to go to the war  of course said john gayther the young ladys parentsor perhaps she did not have any parents  the daughter of the house frowned now john said she i dont want anything said about parents there were no parents in this case at least none to be considered i dont say whether they were dead or not but the story has nothing to do with them parents would be very embarrassing and i dont want to stop to bother with them  john gayther nodded his head as if he thought she was quite right and she went on  the first thing almia did was to fit herself out after the fashion she thought best adapted to a bushwhacker nurse she wore heavy boots and a bicycleskirt which just came to the top of the boots and in this skirt she put ever so many pockets she wore a little cap with a strap to go under the chin and from her belt on the left side she hung a very little cask which she happened to have something like those carried by the stÂ bernard dogs in switzerland when they go to look for lost travellers and this she filled with brandy in her pockets she put every kind of thing that wounded men might want adhesive plaster raw cotton bandages some pieces of heavy pasteboard to make splints needles and fine silk for sewing up cuts and a good many other things suitable for wounded people and in the righthand pocket of her skirt she carried a pistol with five barrels  my conscience exclaimed john gayther that was dangerous and then you know nurses hardly ever carry pistols  but this was necessary said she as you will see as the story goes on then when she put on a long waterproof cloak which covered everything she was ready to go to the war  john gayther looked at the daughter of the house steadfastly and wondered if the almia of the story had cut off her beautiful hair he was sure she had had an abundance of light silverygolden hair which fluffed itself all about her head under her wide hat and it would be a sort of shock to think of its being cut off but he asked no questions he did not want to interrupt too much  almia knew by the papers continued the daughter of the house that a great battle was expected to take place not far from a town at some distance from her home and she went to this town by rail carrying only a small handbag in addition to the things she wore under her waterproof she took lodgings at a hotel and after an early breakfast the next morning she hired a cab to take her out to the battlefield the cabman drove her several miles into the country but when he heard the booming of the preliminary cannon with which the battle was then opening he refused to go any farther and she was obliged to get out at the corner of a lane and the highroad she paid the man his fare and gave him five dollars extra and then she engaged him to call at that place for her at eight oclock that evening she was sure the battle would be over by that time as it would be beginning to get dark the cabman was sorry to leave her there to walk the rest of the way but his horse was afraid of cannon and he did not dare to go any farther  almia took off her waterproof and left it in the cab and the cabman was a good deal astonished when he saw her without it he said he supposed she was a reporter and that the little cask was full of ink he had driven lady reporters about before this but almia told him she was a nurse and that he must not fail to call for her at the time appointed then he drove away and she walked rapidly along the lane which seemed to lead toward the battlefield the lane soon began to curve and she left it and walked across several fields soon she came to some outposts where the sentries wanted to know where she was going of course the sentries behind an army are not as strict as those in front of it and so when she informed them she was a nurse they told her how to get to the fieldhospital which was a mile or more away  but almia did not intend to go to any hospital she knew if she did she would immediately be put under orders and now her blood was up and she could stand no orders she thought she perceived a faint smell of powder in the air this made her feel wonderfully independent and she strode onward with a light and fearless step but when she came to a bosky copse which concealed her from the sentries she turned away from the direction of the hospital and pressed onward toward the point from which came the heaviest sound of cannon  now you must understand john gayther remarked the daughter of the house taking off her broad hat that the breeze might more freely blow through the masses of her silverygolden hair that when people who are really in earnest especially people in fiction go forth to find things they want they generally find them and if it is highly desirable that these things should be out of the common they are out of the common a great deal of what happens in real life and almost everything in literature depends on this principle you of course comprehend this because you compose stories yourself  oh yes said the gardener i comprehend it perfectly  i say all this on account of what is about to happen in this story and also because i dont want you to make any objection in your mind on account of its not being exactly according to present usages almia was pushing steadily through the clump of bushes when she heard not far away the clash of arms greatly excited she silently moved on and peeping out from behind some foliage she saw in a small open space in the woods two men engaged in single combat how her heart did beat she was frightened nearly to death but she did not think of flight her eyes were glued upon the fascinating spectacle before her often had she heard of two brave swordsmen fighting each other to the bitter end and often had she dreamed of these noble contests but her eyes were all unfamiliar with such inspiring sights this truly was war  the combatants were both moderately young men athletic and active one with brown hair and the other with black they had thrown aside their coats and vests and each wore a broad leathern belt fiercely and swiftly their long swords clashed sparks flew and the ring of the steel sounded far into the woods but there was none to hear save almia only and her soul tingled with admiration and terror as the bright blades flashed against the background of semigloom which pervaded the woods she scarcely breathed her whole soul was in her eyes  i have seen it there before thought john gayther but he said nothing  now there was a tremendous onset from each swordsman and the ground echoed beneath their rapid footfalls as they stamped around then there was a lunge and a sharp nervetingling scrape as one blade ran along the other and then without a groan down fell one of these brave warriors flat upon his back upon the grass the wild flowers and bits of bark instantly the impulses of a woman flashed through every vein and nerve of that onlooking girl scarcely had the tall form of the soldier touched the sod when she became a nurse springing out from her leafy concealment she knelt beside the vanquished form of the fallen man the other soldier who was about to rest himself by leaning on his sword sprang back it seemed as though there had suddenly appeared before him a being from another world  where they wear bicycleskirts thought john gayther  every trace of enthusiastic excitement had passed away from almia who now had something in this world to do and who set about doing it without loss of a second the man was only wounded for he opened his eyes and said so and drawing up his shirtsleeve he showed almia that the cut was in the lower part of his left arm instantly despatching the other soldier to a neighboring spring for water she cleansed the wound and finding it was not very deep she drew the edges of the cut together and held them in place with strips of adhesive plaster when this had been done she wrapped the arm in several folds of bandage and the man having risen to a sitting posture she gave him a small draught of brandy from her cask  almia now explained how she happened to appear upon the scene and addressing the wounded man she said she hoped she could soon find some way of conveying him to a hospital hospital he cried springing to his feet under the revivifying influence of the brandy no hospital for me i can walk as well as anybody and now sir he said speaking to his former opponent am i to consider myself vanquished and am i to go with you as your prisoner the other regarded him without answering and for the moment almia too was lost in reflection  at this point john gayther who had been in wars began to wonder even if soldiers in these days should engage in single combat with long swords how one of them could be wounded in the left arm but he did not interrupt the story  the first thing that shaped itself clearly in almias mind was the fear of being left alone in these woods now that she was so near the edge of the battle there was no knowing what she might meet with next the soldier who had conquered now spoke yes sir said he you are my prisoner and it is my duty to take you to my regiment and deliver you to my officers i am sorry to do so but such are the laws of war the other soldier bowed his head simply remarking proceed i will follow you  if i should take a prisoner thought john gayther i should make him walk in front of me  then almia stepped forward she had made up her mind and she was very resolute gentlemen said she this cannot be we are nearing the contending forces there may be stragglers and i do not wish to be left alone you are both my prisoners the two soldiers looked at her in utter amazement yes said almia firmly i mean what i say i am it is true a nurse but i am a bushwhacker nurse perfectly independent and free to act according to the dictates of my judgment you are my prisoners and if one of you attempts to escape it will be the duty of the other to assist in arresting his enemy do not smile i am armed and with this she took from her pocket the pistol with the five barrels the two soldiers stopped smiling yes continued almia i would not wish to do anything of the kind but if either of you attempts to escape i will call upon him to halt and if he does not do it i will fire upon his legs while the other soldier attacks him with his sword you are enemies and each one of you is bound by his soldiery oaths to prevent the escape of the other i am absolutely impartial if either of you should be wounded i would dress his wounds and nurse him carefully without asking to which side he belongs but if either of you attempts to escape i will as i said fire at his legs without asking to which side he belongs  the soldier with the brown hair looked at the one with the black hair if i should attempt to escape said he would you assist this lady in restraining me i would answered the other then i would do the same by you said the first speaker miss i am your prisoner and i also said the blackhaired soldier  well well said john gayther who had not cut a peastick for the last fifteen minutes i suppose you could not tell by their uniforms which one of them belonged to your sidei mean the young lady could not tell  almia had no side replied the daughter of the house and the soldiers wore no coats for they had thrown them aside in the heat of the combat and she purposely took no note whatever of their trousers she was determined to be absolutely impartial now then said almia to her prisoners i am going to get just as close to the battle as i can i am delighted to have you with me not only because you can remove wounded prisoners to shady places where i can nurse them but because you will be a protection to me should an unruly soldier appear from either army he will always be met by an enemy and by me  the three now pressed on for there was no time to lose the roar of the battle was increasing reports of musketry as well as cannon rent the air and the sharp whistling of rifleballs could frequently be heard reaching a wood road they followed this for some distance almia in advance when suddenly they came upon a man sitting on the trunk of a fallen tree he had a little blankbook in his hand and apparently he was making calculations in it with a leadpencil at the sound of approaching footsteps he rose to his feet still holding the open book in his hand he was a moderately tall man a little roundshouldered and about fifty years old he wore a soldiers hat and coat but his clothes were so covered with dust it was impossible to perceive to which army he belonged he had a bushy beard and that was also very dusty he wore spectacles and had a very pleasant smile and looked from one to the other of the newcomers with much interest i hope said he speaking to the soldiers that this young woman is not your prisoner no sir said almia before the others had time to reply they are my prisoners the dusty man looked at her in amazement yes said the man with the black hair she speaks the truth we are her prisoners  rapidly almia explained the situation and when she had finished the stranger nodded his head three or four times and put his blankbook in his pocket well well well said he this is what might be expected from the tendency of the times there are sixteen thousand two hundred and forty more women than men in this state and many of them are single and have to do something but a bushwhacker nurse truly i never thought of anything like that  and you asked almia i think it is right that you should give some account of yourself i do not ask your name nor do i wish to know which cause you have espoused but as you appear to be a soldier i am curious to know how you happen to be sitting by the roadside making calculations i am a soldier answered the dusty man but under the circumstancesregarding very closely the trousers of almias two companionsi am very glad you do not want to know to which side i belong the facts of the case are these i am an exceptional pedestrian i am also a very earnest student of social aspects considered in their relation to topography yesterday when my army halted at noon i set out to make some investigations in connection with my favorite research and when i returned much later than i expected my army had gone on and i have not yet been able to come up to it although i have walked a great many miles  i should say remarked the soldier with the black hair that you are a deserter no replied the exceptional pedestrian i did not desert my army it deserted me and now i wish to say that i have become very much interested in you all and if there is no objection i should like to join your company for the present i have no objection myself said almia but what do you say she asked addressing the two soldiers i am afraid miss replied the man with the brown hair who had recognized some peculiarities in the fashion of the strangers dusty clothes that if he attempted to leave us i would be obliged to shoot him as a deserter and i said the other would be obliged to do the same thing because he is my enemy under these circumstances said the exceptional pedestrian i beg to insist that i be allowed to attach myself to your party  almia felt she had reason to be proud here were three military men who were in her power and who could not get away from her they were like three mice tied together by the tails each pulling in a different direction and all remaining in the place where they had been dropped  the party now pushed forward toward the battles edge if glory is your object said the exceptional pedestrian to almia it would have been better if you had joined a regular corps of nurses then any meritorious action on your part would have been noted and reported to the authorities and your good conduct would have been recognized but now you can expect nothing of the kind i did not come for the sake of glory said almia flushing slightly i came to succor the suffering and to do it without trammels  trammels are often very desirable said he they enable us to proceed to a greater distance along the path of duty than we would be apt to go if we could wander as we please from side to side  almia was about to reply somewhat sharply to this remark when suddenly they heard a sound which made their nerves tingle it was the clang of sabres and the thunder of countless hoofs they were in a mass of tangled underbrush and they peeped out into a wide roadway and beheld the approach of a regiment of cavalry on came this tidal wave of noble horsemen it reached the spot where almias burning eyes glowed through the crevices of the foliage wildly galloping cavalryman after cavalryman passed her by the eyes of the horses flashed fire and their nostrils were widely distended as if they smelt the battle from afar their powerful necks were curved their hoofs spurned the echoing earth and their riders with flashing blades waved high above their heads shouted aloud their battlecry while their tall plumes floated madly in the surging air and above the thunder of the hoofs and the clinking and the clanking of the bits and chains and the creaking of their leathern saddles rose high the clarion voice of their leader urging them on to victory or to death  almia had never been so excited in her life she could scarcely breathe this was the grandeur of glorious war oh how willingly would she have mounted a fleet steed and have followed those valiant horsemen as they thundered away into the distance  john gayther had seen many a body of cavalry on the march but he had never beheld anything like this  after her excitement almia felt somewhat weak she needed food and when they had crossed the roadway they stopped to rest under the shade of a spreading oak unfortunately the soldiers had brought no rations with them and almia had only some albert biscuit which she did not wish to eat because she had brought them to relieve the faintness of some wounded soldier if you will permit us said the soldier with the black hair we two will go out and forage each of us will see to it that the other returns  while they were gone the exceptional pedestrian conversed with almia during my investigations of the social aspects of this region he said i put many miles between myself and the army to which i belong but by closely adhering to certain geological and topographical principles i knew i should eventually find it in fact when you met with me i was making some final calculations which would not fail to show me where i should find my comrades there is no better way to discover the position of an army than by observing the inclination of the geological strata in this section for instance the general trend of the beds of limestone and quartz indicates the direction of the running streams and these naturally flow into the valleys and plains and the land being well watered is more fertile consequently it was soonest cleared by the settlers while the higher ground surrounding it is still encumbered by timber growth an army naturally desires open ground for its operations for large bodies of cavalry and artillery cannot deploy to advantage through wooded districts therefore if we follow this roadway which as you see slightly descends to the northeast we shall soon come within sight of the opposing forces  but said almia the roar of the battle comes over from that way which must be the northwest  that may be said the exceptional pedestrian but the principle remains  the two soldiers now returned bearing two large applepies resting upon two palmleaf fans these were all we could procure said the brownhaired soldier and the woman would not sell her plates the pies were rapidly divided into quarters and the hungry party began to eat it is true said the exceptional pedestrian that the character of the apple indicates the elevation above sealevel of the soil in which it grew the people who grew these apples would have done much better if they had devoted themselves to the cultivation of the huckleberry these they could have sold and then have bought much better apples grown in the plains i also notice that the flour of which this pastry is made was ground from the wheat of this region which is always largely mixed with cockle if the people would give up growing wheat for three or four years cockle would probably disappear and they would then have flour of a much higher grade almia and the two soldiers could not help smiling when they perceived that while the exceptional pedestrian was making these criticisms he ate three quarters of a pie which was more than his share  when the pies had been consumed the little party pressed forward but not to the northeast for the two soldiers insisted that the battle raged in the northwest and they would not go in any other direction although the exceptional pedestrian endeavored to overwhelm them with arguments to prove that he was right the din of the battle however soon proved that he was wrong penetrating an extensive thicket they reached its outer edge and there gazed upon a farstretching battlefield  now this would be the place said the daughter of the house for a fine description not only of the battlefield but of the battle which was raging upon it and if i ever write this story i shall tell how one army was posted on one side of a wide valley while the other army was posted on the other and how regiments and battalions and detachments from each side came down into the beautiful plain and fought and fired and struggled until the grass was stained with blood and how the cannon roared from the hills and mowed down whole battalions of infantry below how brave soldiers fell on every side wounded and dead while men with stretchers hurried to carry them away from beneath the hoofs of the charging cavalry i would tell how the carnage increased every moment how the yells of fury grew louder and how the roar of the cannon became more and more terrible  but all i can say now is that it was a spectacle to freeze the blood poor almia could scarcely retain consciousness as she gazed upon the awful scenes of woe and suffering which spread out beneath her and she could do nothing her labors would be useful only in cases of isolated woundings if she were to mingle in the fray she would perish in the general slaughter and if she were to go and offer assistance in the hospitals she would find herself but as a drop in the bucket her efforts unrecognized even if she were not driven away as an interloper besides she did not know where the hospitals were  as she gazed upon this scene of horror she perceived an officer mounted upon a noble charger and followed by several horsemen take a position upon a hillock not far from the spot where she and her companions were concealed from this point of vantage the officer who was evidently a general could perceive the whole battlefield  and get himself picked off by a sharpshooter thought john gayther but he did not interrupt  the brownhaired soldier trembled with emotion and whispered to almia that is my commanderinchief even without this information almia would have known that the stalwart figure upon the pawing steed was an officer in high command for after speaking a few words to one of his companions the latter galloped away into the valley toward the right and very soon the battle raged more fiercely in that direction and the booming of the cannon and the cracking of the rifles was more continuous then another officer was sent galloping to the left and in this direction too the battle grew fiercer and the carnage increased courier after courier was sent away here and there until at last the commander remained with but one faithful adherent since his arrival upon the hillock the horrors of the bloody contest had doubled and almia could scarcely endure to look into the valley  is there no way she said in a gasping whisper of stopping this these two armies are like hordes of demons humanity should not permit it  humanity has nothing to do with it said the exceptional pedestrian a declaration of war eliminates humanity as a social factor such is the usage of nations  i dont care for the usage of nations said almia it is vile  now something very important happened in the battlefield the commanderinchief rose in his stirrups and peered afar then suddenly turning he sent his only remaining follower with clattering hoofs to carry a message he is making it worse declared almia now more brave men will fall more blood will flow  of course said the exceptional pedestrian he gives no thought to the falling of brave men or the flowing of blood upon his commands depends the fate of the battle  and without his commands asked almia trembling in every fibre  the exceptional pedestrian shrugged his shoulders and slightly smiled without them he said there would soon be an end to the battle he is the soul the directing spirit of his army unless he directs the contest cannot be carried on  almia sprang to her feet not caring whether she was seen or not she looked over the battlefield and her heart was sick within her not only did she see the carnage which desecrated the beautiful plain but she saw far far away the mothers and sisters of those who were dead dying and wounded she saw the whiteness of their faces when their feverish eyes should scan the list of dead and wounded she saw them groan and fall senseless when they read the names of loved ones she could bear no more  suddenly she turned gentlemen she said follow me and without another word she stepped out into the open field and walked rapidly toward the commanderinchief whose eyes were fixed so steadfastly on the battle that he did not notice her approach the three soldiers gazed at her in amazement and then they followed her they could not understand her mad action but they could not desert her  almia stopped at the horses head with her left hand she seized his bridle and in a clear loud voice she exclaimed commanderinchief you are my prisoner there was no trembling no nervousness now body and soul she was as hard as steel the general looked down upon her in petrified bewilderment he gazed at the three soldiers and again looked down at her girl he thundered what do you mean let go my horse as he said these words he gave his bridle a jerk but the noble steed paid no attention to his master he was not afraid of girls in former days he had learned to like them to him a girl meant sugar and savory clovertops he bent his head toward almia and instantly her hand was in her pocket and she drew forth an albert biscuit the horse which had not tasted food since morning eagerly took it from her hand and crunched it in delight  the commanderinchief now became furious and his hand sought the hilt of his sword if almia had been a man he would have cut her down girl he cried what do you mean are you insane you men remove her instantly  then almia spoke up bravely never loosening her hold upon the bridle of the horse i am not insane she said i am a nurse but not a common one i am a bushwhacker nurse and that means i am entirely independent these men are under my control they are from the opposing armies and compel each other to obey my commands i have determined to stop this blood and slaughter if you do not quietly surrender to me i will fire at one of your legs and call upon the soldier who is your enemy to attack you with his sword his duty to his country will compel him to do so  the general who was now so infuriated he could not speak jerked savagely at the reins but almia had just given the noble animal another biscuit and his nose was seeking the pocket from which it came the horse was conquered  at this moment a rifleball shrieked wildly overhead the enemy had perceived the little party upon the hillock the three soldiers who stood a little below shouted to almia to come down or she would be killed she instantly obeyed this warning but she did not release her hold upon the generals bridle she started down the hillock away from the battle and the horse who willingly subjected himself to her guidance trotted beside her the general did not attempt to restrain him for he had been startled by the rifleshots  a little below the edge of the hill almia stopped and turning toward the commanderinchief she said you might as well surrender i do not wish to injure you but if you compel me to do so i must and with this she drew the pistol from her pocket  is that thing loaded exclaimed the general  it is answered almia and with five balls  please put it back in your pocket said the officer who for the first time during the terrible battle showed signs of fear a girl with a pistol said he makes me shudder why do you stand there he shouted to the three men come here and take her away  but they did not obey and the blackhaired soldier stepped forward you are my enemy sir he said and i am bound to assist in your capture if i can there are two of your own men here but only one of them is armed  as he spoke these words a great shell struck the top of the hillock and blew the earth and little stones in every direction without a word the whole party retired rapidly to an open space behind a large overhanging rock the general was very much disturbed the enemy must be getting nearer he almost forgot almia  look here he cried to the brownhaired soldier creep back to the top of the hillock and tell me how the battle goes with furrowed brows he waited while almia fed his horse the brownhaired soldier came quickly back tell me cried the general without waiting for the other to speak has my cavalry made its grand charge and cut off the approach of the left wing of the enemy  no sir replied the soldier touching his cap it did not charge in time and it is now all mixed up with the artillery which is rapidly retiring  what cried the general retiring  yes sir said the soldier i am sorry to say that our whole army is retreating pellmell as fast as it can go the enemy is in active pursuit and its left wing is now advancing up this side of the valley in less than twenty minutes the retreat of our cavalry and artillery will be cut off by the hills and the infantry is already scattering itself far and wide  i must go shouted the general drawing his sword from its scabbard i must rally my forces i must  no general said the brownhaired soldier that is impossible if you were now to attempt to approach our army you would throw yourself into the ranks of the enemy  the commanderinchief dropped the bridle from his listless hands and bowed his head lost he murmured lost and this was the decisive battle of the war if i had been able to order my cavalry to charge the enemys left wing would have been cut from their main body but for you he continued fixing his eyes upon almia with a look of unutterable sadness i should have done it you have caused me to lose this battle  almia drew herself up her heart swelling with emotion this was the proudest moment of her lifeprouder by far than she had ever expected any moment of her existence to be yes she said that is what i did and if this was the decisive battle of the war then will follow peace blood will cease to flow widows and orphans will cease to suffer and men who have been fighting one another like tigers without really understanding why they sought one anothers lives will again meet as friends  there is a great deal of sense in what you say exclaimed the exceptional pedestrian i admit i am a soldier but i do not approve of war the statistics of social aspects prove  he was interrupted by the brownhaired soldier who remarked it would be well for us to retire for doubtless the enemy will soon occupy the ridge  the general took no notice apparently he was lost in thought  excuse me sir said the brownhaired man but you must seek a place of safety  the general raised his head is there a road to the west he asked i must take a roundabout way and join my army and share its fortunes whatever they may be  yes sir said the exceptional pedestrian if you skirt these woods and follow the upward trend of the limestone and quartzbeds and then keep along the crest of the mountain for about eight miles you will come to the village of kirksville where our retreating army will no doubt halt for the night  the general said no more he turned his horse whose bridle almia had now released and casting another look of sadness upon the erect form of the bushwhacker nurse he sped away  i will not say anything more of the general except that after following for half an hour the directions given to him by the exceptional pedestrian he rode at full speed into the ranks of the enemy and was obliged to surrender no evil happened to him however for the war was soon ended and he was released  now said the exceptional pedestrian who was in no way a traitor but only a person accustomed to making mistakes the day is drawing to a close and we must hurry away  no one objected and the three soldiers accompanied almia back over the way she had taken when she walked to the battlefield a little after eight oclock they arrived at the main road and there almia found her cab waiting for her  i will probably not see you again said the exceptional pedestrian shaking her very cordially by the hand for as the war is now practically over and my regiment probably scattered i shall go west there are many features of our social aspects out there which i wish to study but before i leave you miss i wish to thank you for having made yourself so highly instrumental in bringing this terrible and inhuman war to a close  goodby said almia but i think it may be said that it was an albert biscuit which gave us peace if that horse had not been used to being fed by girls my efforts might have come to nothing  when the two younger soldiers bade goodby to almia they did not say much but it seemed to her they felt a good deal at any rate she knew she felt a good deal she had known them but a little while but they had come into her life in such a strange way for a time she had ruled their destinies and they had been so good to her they had stood by her regardless of everything but her wishes and then they were both so handsome such gallant soldiers she took their hands she gazed into their honest faces a few words of farewell were spoken and then they helped her into the cab the door was shut and she drove away  as she turned and looked out of the little window in the back of the cab she saw one of them gazing after her but the dusk of the evening had come on so rapidly she could not be certain which one of them it was at a turn in the road she sank into her seat she was tired she was faint and instinctively thrusting her hand into her pocket she found there one albert biscuit which had been left she drew it out but when she looked at it it seemed to her as though it would be a sacrilege to eat it its companions had done so much for humanity but she did eat it and felt stronger  for the rest of the drive she sat and wondered and wondered which it was who had looked back the brownhaired soldier or the blackhaired one then she tried to think which she would like it to be but she could not make up her mind  before parting with the soldiers almia had exchanged cards with them and they had assured her they would let her know how fortune should treat them day after day she watched and waited for the lettercarrier but a fortnight passed and he brought her nothingat least nothing she cared for  at last a letter came it was from one of the soldiers she knew that by the address and its general appearance but of course she did not know the handwriting she held it in her hand and gazed upon it and her heart beat fast as she asked herself the question which one has written first  presently she opened it it was from the brownhaired soldier her face flushed and her heart said to her this is right this is what you hoped for then she read the letter which was long it told of many things and among others it informed almia how grateful were the writers wife and two little girls for the kindness she had shown the husband and father she had dressed his wounds she had saved him from being made a prisoner for the rest of their lives they would never forget her  the letter dropped from almias hand she had received a shock and for a time she could not recover from it she sat still looking out into the nothingness of the distant sky then her face flushed again and her heart told her it had made a mistake she was well pleased that this was the one who had written that he was married  hour after hour and day after day almia became more and more convinced that she was right it was the blackhaired soldier on whom her thoughts were constantly fixed and no wonder in the first place he was the better soldier of the two she hated war but if men must fight it is glorious to conquer and she had seen his quick and practised blade lay low his enemy the thought of his power made her heart swell moreover he had stood by her in the moment of greatest peril he it was who had said to the commanderinchief armed and mounted though he was that he would attack him if her commands were not obeyed then too he was a little taller than the other and handsomer his chest was broad he stood erect  day after day she watched and waited but no letter came at last however there was a ring at the bell and the blackhaired soldier was announced by a supreme effort almia controlled herself she bade her heart be still and she went down to meet him she was dressed in white there were flowers in her hair and in her belt she could not help wondering what he would think of the difference between her and the girl he had known as a bushwhacker nurse  when her eyes fell upon him and their hands met she was the one who had the right to be the more amazed she had thought him handsome before he was glorious now arrayed in fashionable wellfitting clothes wearing only a mustache and with his hair properly cut he was a vision of manly beauty instantly without any volition on her part her heart went out to him she knew that it belonged to him  for twenty minutes perhaps a little longer almia sat with the man she loved and as she listened to him saying but little herself colder and colder grew the heart she had given him soon she discovered that he looked upon her as a young lady in whom he took an interest on account of the adventures they had had together but still as a chance acquaintance he had come to see her because he had happened to be in the town in which she lived when he went away she did not ask him to come again and it was plain that he did not expect such an invitation the few remarks he made about his future plans precluded the supposition that they might meet again he was pleasant he was polite he was even kind but when he departed he left her with a heart of stone there was now nothing in the world for which she cared to live she despised herself for such a feeling but existence was a blank she had loved perhaps unwittingly she had shown her love and now by day and by night she moaned and mourned that the bushwhacker nurse had ever met the two brave soldiers with their glittering swordsthat she had not passed them by and gone out into the battlefield to be laid low by some chance bullet  for some little time the daughter of the house had been speaking in a voice which grew lower and lower and now she stopped there were tears in her eyes brought there by the story she herself was telling john gayther dropped his peastick and leaned forward  now miss said he i really think your story is not quite right you must have forgotten somethinga good many things think it over and i am sure you will agree with me that that is not the true ending  she looked at him in surprise what do you mean she asked  i mean this replied the gardener if you will put your mind to it and seriously consider the whole situation i believe you will see just as well as i do that it really turned out very differently from the way you have just told it that blackhaired soldier did not go away in twenty minutes it must have been somebody else at some other time who went away so soon it would have been simply impossible for him to have done it the longer he sat and looked at miss almia the more he gazed into her beautiful eyes the more fervently he must have thought that if it depended upon him he would never leave her never never again and she as she gazed into his handsome features thrilling with the emotion he could not hide must have known what was passing in his heart it did not even need the words he soon spoke to make her understand she was the one thing in the world he loved and that in spite of sickness and obstacles of all sorts he had come that day to tell her so and when they had sat together for hours and at last he was obliged to go and they stood together his impassioned eyes looking down into her orbs of heavenly blue you know what must have happened miss now dont you really and isnt this the true true end of the story  the eyes of the daughter of the house were sparkling a little flush had come upon her cheeks and a smile upon her lips  i do really believe that is the true ending john said she but how did you ever come to know so much about such things  i cant tell you that miss said the gardener but sometimes i notice things i cannot see as when i look upon a flower bud not yet open and know exactly what is inside of it  with the smile still on her lips and the flush still on her cheeks the daughter of the house walked away through the garden she had determined to make her story end sadly but john gayther had known her heart better than she knew it herself                           this story is told by                             john gayther                            and is called                          the lady in the box     iii  the lady in the box   john gayther was busy putting the finishing touches to a bed in which he intended to sow his latest planting of bushbeans or stringbeans or snaps as they are called in different parts of the country these were very choice seeds which had been sent to him by a friend abroad and consequently john wanted to get them into the ground as soon as possible but when he saw entering the garden not only the daughter of the house but also her mother the mistress of the house a sudden conviction shot through him that there would be no beans planted that morning  the elder of these two ladies was not very elderly and she was handsomer than her daughter she was pleasant to look upon and pleasant to talk to but she had a mind of her own john gayther had found that out long before she was very fond of flowers and there were many beds of them which were planted and treated according to her directions and fancies these beds did not in fact form part of the gardeners garden they belonged to her and nobody else had anything to say about them many things grew there which were not often found in gardens weeds for instance from foreign countries and some from nearby regions which the mistress of the house thought might be made to grow into comely blossoms if they were given the chance here she picked and planted and put in and pulled out according to her own will and her pulling out was often done after a fashion which would have discouraged any other gardener but john gayther who had long since learned that the mistress of the house knew what she wanted and that it would be entirely useless for him to trouble himself about her methods  the gardener was not altogether happy when he saw these two ladies coming toward him he felt sure that they were coming for a story for when the elder lady came to the garden it was not her habit to bring her daughter with her and neither of them was likely on ordinary occasions to walk along in a straightforward way loitering neither here nor there their manner and their pace denoted a purpose  john gayther had never dug into a gardenbed as earnestly and anxiously as he now dug into his mind these ladies were coming for a story the younger one had doubtless told her mother that there had been stories told in the garden and now another one was wanted and it was more than likely that he was expected to tell it but he did not feel at all easy about telling a story to the mistress of the house he knew her so well and the habits of her mind that he was fully assured if his fancies should blossom too luxuriantly she would ruthlessly pull them up and throw them on the path still he believed she would like fancies and highly colored ones but he must be very careful about them they must be harmonious they must not interfere with each other they might be rare and wonderful but he must not give them long latin names which meant nothing  one thing which troubled him was the difficulty of using the first person when telling a story to the mistress of the house he could tell his stories best in that fashion but he did not believe that this hearer would be satisfied with them she would not be likely to give them enough belief to make them interesting he had a story all ready to tell to the daughter of the house for he had been sure she would want one some day soon and this one told in a manner which would please him he thought would please her but it was very different with her mother he must be careful  when the two ladies came to the bed where the beans were to be planted the gardener found that he had not mistaken their errand  john said the mistress of the house i hear you tell a very good story and i want you to tell me one let us find a shady place  there was a pretty summerhouse on the upper terrace a shady place where the air was cool and the view was fine and there they went but there was no need of john gaythers making any pretence of trimming up peasticks this time  i have a story said he his stool at a respectful distance from the two ladies who were seated on a bench outside the little house  is it about yourself asked the daughter of the house  no miss not this time he answered  i am sorry for that she said for i like to think of people doing the things they tell about but i suppose we cant have that every time  oh no said her mother and if john has an interesting story about anybody else let him tell it  the gardener began promptly the name of this story is the lady in the box said he and with the exception of the lady the principal personage in it was a young man who lived in florence toward the end of the last century  and how did you come to know the story asked the daughter of the house has it ever been told before  now there was need to assert himself if john gayther did not wish to lose grace with his hearers and he was equal to the occasion it has never been printed said he quietly but boldly it came to me in the most straightforward way step by step  very good said the mistress of the house i like a story to come in that way  the young man whose name was jaqui continued john gayther was of good parts but not in very good circumstances he was a student of medicine and was the assistant of a doctor which means that he did all the hard work such as attending to the shop mixing the drugs and even going out to see very poor patients in bad weather jaquis employermaster in factwas drÂ torquino an elderly man of much reputation in his town the doctor expected jaqui to be his successor and as the years went on the younger man began to visit patients in good circumstances who fell sick in fine weather at last drÂ torquino made a bargain with jaqui by which the latter was to pay certain sums of money to the old mans heirs and then the stock and goodwill of the establishment were formally made over to him and shortly afterwards the old doctor died but before his death he told jaqui everything that it was necessary for him to know in regard to the property and the business to which he had succeeded  illustration the gardener began promptly  torquinos house was a very good one consisting of three floors on the ground floor were the shop the private office and the livingrooms the old doctor and jaqui lodged on the third floor the second floor was very handsomely furnished but was not then occupiedat least not in the ordinary way it belonged to drÂ paltravi the old doctors former partner a somewhat younger man and married he had been greatly attached to his wife and had furnished these rooms to suit her fancy he was a scientific man and much more devoted to making curious experiments than he was to the ordinary practice of medicine and surgery in a small room on this floor at the very back of the house was donna paltravi in a box  was she dead exclaimed the daughter of the house  it was believed by drÂ torquino that she was not but he could not be sure of it  and her husband asked the elder lady was he dead  no replied the gardener at least there was no reason to suppose so about forty years before the time of this story he had left florence and this was the way of it donna paltravi was a young and handsome woman but her health was not as satisfactory as it might have been for she had a tendency to fall into swoons and to remain in them sometimes for many hours coming out of a trance as lively as before she went into it now this disposition had a powerful effect upon her husband and he studied her very closely with an interest which almost devoured the other powers of his mind he experimented upon her and became so expert that he not only could bring her out of her trances whenever he chose but he could keep her in them and this he did sometimes as long as a week in order to prove to himself that he could do it  shame upon him exclaimed the daughter of the house  never mind said her mother let john go on  well continued the gardener the old doctor told jaqui a great many things about paltravi and his wife and how she came to be at that time in the box paltravi had conceived a great scheme one which he had believed might have immense influence on the happiness of the world he determined that when his wife next went into a trance he would try to keep her so for fifty years and then revive her in the midst of her youth and beauty to enjoy the world as she should find it  there was nothing new about that said the mistress of the house that is a very old story and the thing has been written about again and again and again  that is very true madam answered john gayther and drÂ paltravi had heard many such stories but most of them were founded upon traditions and myths and the vaguest kind of hearsay and some were no more than the fancies of storytellers but the doctor wanted to work on solid and substantial ground and he believed that his wifes exceptional opportunities should not be sacrificed  sacrificed exclaimed the daughter of the house i like that  of course i will not attempt to explain the doctors motives or try to excuse him said the gardener i can only tell what he did he protracted one of his wifes trances and when it had continued for a month he determined to keep it up for half a century if it could be done and he went earnestly to work for the purpose the old doctor had not altogether approved of his partners action but i dont believe he disapproved very much for he also possessed a good deal of the spirit of scientific investigation when everything had been arranged and the lady had been placed in a large and handsome box which had been designed with great care by her husband and constructed under his careful supervision she was carried into the little room which had been her boudoir and there her husband watched and guarded her for nearly a year in all that time there was not the slightest change in her so far as mortal eye could see but there came a change over her husband he grew uneasy and restless and could not sleep at night and at last he told drÂ torquino he would have to go away he could not stay any longer and see his beautiful wife lying motionless before him the desire to revive her had become so great he found it impossible to withstand it and therefore in the interest of science and for the advantage of the world he must put it out of his power to interfere with the success of his own great experiment  he wrote down on parchment everything that was necessary for the person to know who had charge of this great treasure and he made drÂ torquino swear to guard and to protect donna paltravi for fortynine years if he should live so long and if he did not that he would deliver his charge into the hands of some worthy and reliable person if at the end of the ladys halfcentury of inanimation paltravi should not make his appearance on account of having died for nothing else would keep him away then the person in charge of the lady was to animate her in the manner which was fully and minutely described on the parchment paltravi then departed and since that time nothing had been heard of him  when jaqui came into possession of drÂ torquinos house he felt he owned the contents of only two floors and that the second floor especially the little room in the rear was a great responsibility which he did not desire at all and of which he would have rid himself if drÂ torquino had not made him swear that he would guard it sacredly for the ten years which still remained of the intended period of inanimation  he had seen the lady in the box for the old doctor had taken him into her room and they had removed the top of the box and had looked at her through the great plate of glass which covered her she was very beautiful and richly dressed and seemed as if she were merely asleep but in spite of her beauty and the interest which attached to her he wished very much somebody else had her to take care of such thoughts however were of no use she went with the business and the property and he had nothing to say about it  jaqui did not have a very good time after the old doctors death continued john gayther it was not even as good as he had expected it to be for nearly fifteen years he had been living in that house with drÂ torquino and in all that time the lady in the box had never troubled him but now she did trouble him various legal persons came to attend to the transfer of the property and although they found everything all straight and right so far as the old doctors possessions were concerned they were not so well satisfied in regard to the contents of the second floor some of them thinking the government should have something to say in regard to the property of a man who had been away for forty years but as paltravi had made torquino his heir when he left florence and jaqui had the papers to show this matter was settled but for all that jaqui was troubled and it was about the box of the lady it was such a peculiarlooking box that several questions were asked as to its contents and when jaqui boldly asserted that it contained anatomical preparations he was asked why it happened to be in that handsome little room but by the help of money and his generally good reputation jaqui got rid of the legal people  but after this he had to face the neighbors these heard of the box and it revived memories in the minds of some of the elders of strange stories about drÂ paltravi his wife had died several times according to some of them and she had at last been carried to her native town in lombardy for burial but nobody knew the name of that town and there were one or two persons who said she never had been buried but that her husband had preserved her skeleton and had had it gilded he was so very fond of her jaqui had a good deal of trouble with these people who had never dared to trouble old drÂ torquino with their idle curiosity for he was a man with a high temper and would stand no meddling  but when the neighbors had ceased to talk at least to him there came a third class of troublers worse than either of the others these were some scientific people who long ago had heard of the experiment drÂ paltravi had been making with his wife several of these wrote to jaqui and two of them came to see him these insisted on looking at the lady in the box and jaqui was obliged to show her the two scientists were very much interestedextremely so but they did not in the least believe the lady was alive they considered the beautiful figure the most admirable specimen of the preservation of the human body after death that they had ever seen and that paltravi was entitled to the greatest credit for the success of his experiment they were anxious to be informed of the methods by which this wonderful result had been obtained but this jaqui firmly informed them was now his secret and his property and he would not divulge it the scientists acknowledged the justice of this position and did not urge their point but each of them when he went away resolved that in the course of a few years he would come back and if the body of the lady was still in good preservation he would buy it if he could jaqui might be poor by that time or dead  jaqui now thought his troubles were over but he was mistaken a new persecutor appeared who belonged to a fourth class fortunately not a very large one this person was a young man who was not only a fool but a poet  unfortunate creature exclaimed the mistress of the house  i dont know madam said john gayther he was very happy it was the people with whom he associated in this world who were unfortunate this young man whose name was florino lived in milan and it would have been much better for jaqui if he had lived in patagonia by great bad luck he had overheard one of the scientists who had visited jaqui talking about what he had seen at his house and the poet instantly became greatly interested in the story he plied the learned man with all manner of questions and very soon made up his mind that he would go to florence to see the lady in the box he believed she would make a most admirable subject for a poem from his pen  when florino presented himself to jaqui he came as the general of an army who settles down before a town to invest it and capture it if he shall live long enough at first jaqui tried to turn him away in the usual manner but the poet was not to be turned away he had no feelings which could be hurt and jaqui was afraid to hurt his body on account of the police the young man begged he argued he insisted he persisted all he wanted was to see just once the face of the beautiful lady who had been so wonderfully preserved he visited the unfortunate jaqui by day and by night and at last when florino solemnly promised that if he should be given one opportunity of seeing the lady he would go away and never trouble drÂ jaqui any more the latter concluded that to agree to this proposition would be the best way to get rid of the youth and so consented to allow him to gaze upon the face which forty years before had been animated by the soul of donna paltravi  when the upper part of the lid of the box had been removed and the face of the lady appeared under the plate of glass the soul of the young poet who tremblingly bent over it was filled with rapturous delight never in his life had he seen anything so beautiful and more than this he declared he had never dreamed of features so lovely for a time it interested jaqui to listen to the rhapsodies and observe the exaltation of the foolpoet but he soon had enough of this amorous insanity and prepared to close the box then florino burst into wild entreatiesonly ten minutes more five minutes three minutes anything so it went on until the poet had been feasting his eyes on the lady for nearly half an hour then jaqui forcibly put him out of the room closed the box and locked the door  florino had no more idea of keeping his word than he had of becoming a blacksmith he persecuted jaqui more than he had before and when his solicitations to see the lady again were refused he went so far as to attempt to climb up to her window of course jaqui could have called in the aid of the police but it would have made it very unpleasant for him to bring the whole affair into court and florino knew this as well as he did after a short time the poet tried a new line of tactics and endeavored to persuade jaqui that it was his duty to revive the lady when this idea once got well into the head of the young man he became a worse lunatic than before jaqui attempted to reason with him but florino would listen to nothing he had to say and went on being a fool and a poet and a lover at the same time and jaqui began to be afraid that some day he would get into the room by foul means break open the box seize upon the sealed parchment which lay under the lid and try to revive the lady himself  it is quite possible this might have happened had not something very unexpected occurred drÂ paltravi came back to his old home jaqui recognized him immediately from the description which torquino had given of him he was now nearly seventy years old but he was in good health and vigor his tall form was still upright and the dark eyes which the old doctor had particularly described were as bright and as piercing as ever they had been  he told jaqui he had hoped to postpone the revival of his wife until the expiration of the fifty years but that of late his resolution had been weakening it had become very hard for him to think he must wait ten years more before he came back to his home and his wife science was a great thing but the love of a man for a woman such as he loved was still greater and when he heard of the death of drÂ torquino he had instantly made up his mind he would not leave his wife in the custody of any one but his old friend and partner so here he was fully resolved to lose no time in reviving his wife and in spending his life here with her in their old home so long as they might survive  jaqui was now a happy man here was the owner of the lady ready to take her off his hands and relieve him of all the perplexing responsibility and misery which her possession had caused him as he looked at the stalwart figure of the returned husband it made him laugh to think of the foolpoet  drÂ paltravi and jaqui were both practical men and that evening they laid out the whole plan for the revivification of the lady in the box jaqui was so glad to be rid of her that he willingly undertook to do anything to assist paltravi in starting out on his new career of domestic happiness  it was agreed that it was most important that when she woke again to life donna paltravi should not be too much surprised and her husband did everything he could to prevent anything of the kind he had her old bedroom swept and garnished and made to look as much as possible as it had been when she last saw it then he went out into the town and was fortunate enough to engage as maid a young girl who was the daughter of the woman who had been his wifes maid forty years before then it was decided that this girl having been well instructed as to what was expected of her should be the first to see the lady when she should revive and that after that when it should be deemed a suitable moment jaqui should have an interview with her in the capacity of physician and explain the state of affairs so that she should not be too greatly excited and shocked by the change in the appearance of her husband then when everything had been made plain paltravi was to go to her  those two were a couple of brave men remarked the mistress of the house  they were very fortunate men i think said her daughter what would i not give to be the first to talk to a woman who had slept for forty years  perhaps she is going to sleep indefinitely answered the mistress of the house but we will let john go on with his story  all these plans were carried out continued john gayther the next day the lady was taken out of the box removed to her own chamber and placed upon a couch the garments she wore were just as fresh and well preserved as she was and as drÂ paltravi stood and looked at her his heart swelling with emotion he could see no reason why she should not imagine she had fallen asleep forty minutes before instead of forty years the two doctors went to work speaking seldom and in whispers their faces pale and their hearts scarcely beating so intense was their anxiety regarding the result of this great experiment jaqui was almost as much affected as drÂ paltravi and in fact his fears were greater for he was not supported by the faith of the other he could not help thinking of what would follow if everything did not turn out all right  but there was no need of anxiety in a little while respiration was established the heart began to beat gently the blood slowly circulated there was a little quiver about the lipsdonna paltravi was alive her husband on his knees beside her lifted his eyes to heaven and then his head falling forward he sank upon the floor  oh ejaculated the daughter of the house i hope he did not die that would have been good tragedy but how dreadful  no answered the gardener he did not die and jaqui his excitement giving him the strength of a giant took the insensible man in his arms and carried him out of the room  the mistress of the house gave a little sigh of relief i am so glad he did said she i was actually beginning to be afraid i really do not want to be present when she first sees him  john gayther perfectly understood this remark and took it to heart it implied a little lack of faith in his dramatic powers but it made things a great deal easier for him  without reÃ«ntering the room continued he jaqui partly closed the door and gazed at the lady through a little crack  i do not know about that said the mistress of the house he should have gone in boldly  excuse me said john gayther but i think not this was a very important moment nobody knew what would happen she must not be shocked by seeing a stranger at the same time the eye of a professional man was absolutely necessary donna paltravi slightly moved and sighed then she opened her eyes and gazed for a few minutes at the ceiling after which she turned her head upon the cushion of the couch and in a clear soft voice called out rita this was the name of the girl now in waiting as it had been the name of her mother and she instantly appeared from the adjoining room she had seen all that had happened and was trembling so much she could scarcely stand but she was a girl of nerve and approached and stood by her mistress rita said the lady without looking at her i am hungry bring me some wine and a few of those cakes you bought yesterday  drÂ paltravi had remembered everything that had pleased his wife he had thought of the little cakes and had scoured the town early in the morning to get some which resembled them he knew her favorite wine and had given rita her instructions without delay the maid brought the refreshments and in a few minutes the lady was sitting on the couch a glass of wine in her hand rita said she after eating and drinking a little you are dressed very awkwardly this morning have you been trying to make your own clothes  the doctor had searched diligently in his wifes closets for some garments belonging to her former maid and he had thought he had succeeded in getting rita to dress as her mother had dressed but he did not remember these things as accurately as his wife remembered them you know i do not like carelessness in dress continued donna paltravi and now that i look at you more closely  she is truly alive said jaqui and in full possession of her senses and with this he closed the door  when the doctor recovered both he and jaqui were very glad to take some wine for they had been under a dreadful strain  had been exclaimed the mistress of the house who understood the heart of woman and knew very well that the great strain had not yet come but what happened next john  the next thing happened too soon replied the gardener in less than fifteen minutes the maid came to the two doctors and told them her lady demanded to see her husband and if he were not in the house he must be sent for immediately this greatly disturbed jaqui and he turned pale again if he could have had his own way at that moment he would have put the lady back in her box and locked the door of the little room he did not feel ready to tell the story he had to tell but there was no help for it he must do it and that immediately go in jaqui said drÂ paltravi prepare her mind as well as you can and then i will see her  hurry please sir said the maid she is very impatient and i cannot explain to her  thus reassured jaqui followed the maid  the quick temper of donna paltravi reminds me of edmond abouts story of the man with the broken ear said the mistress of the house the hero of that story was a soldier who had been preserved in a dried condition for many years and who proved to be a very bad subject when he had been dampened and revived  i have read that novel said john gayther considerably to the surprise of both his hearers and it belongs to the same class as mineof course you know all stories are arranged in classesbut the one i am telling you is much more natural and true to life than the one written by the frenchman  i am quite ready to believe that said the mistress of the house now please go on  the daughter of the house did not say anything but she looked very earnestly at the gardener the conviction was forcing itself upon her that john gayther himself had a story and she hoped that some day she might hear it  jaqui was very much surprised when he saw donna paltravi he had seen her face so often that he was perfectly familiar with it but now he found it had changed in color it was not as lifelike as it had been in the box she was pale and somewhat excited my maid tells me you are a doctor sir said she but why do you come to me if i need a doctor and my husband is away why is not drÂ torquino here  madam said jaqui his voice faltering a little you will excuse the intrusion of a stranger when i tell you that drÂ torquino is dead  rather abrupt said the mistress of the house  he could not help it madam said john gayther it popped out of his head but it did not matter donna paltravi had a quick perception oh she exclaimed and i not know it then she stopped and looked steadfastly at jaqui i see she said slowly i have been in one of my trances then she grew still paler but my husband he is not dead tell me he is not dead she cried  oh no exclaimed jaqui he is alive and well and will be with you very soon donna paltravis face lighted with an expression of great happiness her color returned and she looked almost as handsome as when she had been lying in the box blessed be the holy mary said she if he is well it does not matter what has happened how long have i been in a trance  i cannot say exactly replied jaqui very much afraid to speak the truth in fact i was not here when you went into it but  oh never mind never mind she exclaimed my husband will tell me everything i would much rather he should do so but what uglyfashioned clothes you are wearing sir does everybody dress in that way now or is it only doctors i am sure i must have been asleep for a good while and that i shall see some wonderful things it is quite delightful to think of it i can scarcely wait until my husband comes i want him to tell me everything  when the greatly relieved jaqui returned with this news he threw drÂ paltravi into a state of rapture his wife knew what had happened she had not been shocked she understood and above everything else she longed to see him after all these forty years he was nowthis minuteto be with her again she was longing to see him with all the vigor of youth he bounded up the stairs  now said john gayther we will pass over an interval of time  i think that will be very well indeed the mistress of the house said approvingly  not a long one i hope said her daughter for this is a breathless point in the story i have worked it out in my own mind in three different ways already  the gardener smiled with pleasure he had a high regard for the mind of the daughter of the house  well said he the interval is very short it is really not more than twenty minutes at the end of that brief space of time jaqui was surprised to see drÂ paltravi reÃ«nter the room he had so recently left in all the wild excitement of an expectant lover but what a changed man he was pale haggard wildeyed aged he sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands  i was afraid of that i was afraid of that exclaimed the mistress of the house  and i too said her daughter with tears in her eyes that was one of the ways in which i worked it out but it is too dreadful john gayther dont you think you have made a mistake if you were to consider it all carefully dont you really believe it could not be that at least not quite that  i am sorry said the gardener but i am sure this story could not have happened in any other way and i think if you will wait until it is finished you will agree with me  for a few minutes the distressed husband could not speak and then in faltering tones he told jaqui what had happened his wife had been so shocked and horrified at his appearance that she had come near fainting what made it worse was that it was evident she did not regard him as some strange old man she had recognized him instantly his form his features his carriage were perfectly familiar to her she had known them all in her young darkhaired husband of forty years before and here was that same husband grayheaded graybearded and repulsively old she had turned away her head she would not look at him as soon as she could speak she had demanded to know how long she had been in her trance and when the matter was explained her anger was unbounded  drÂ paltravi never told jaqui all that she said but she must have used very severe language she declared he had used her shamefully and wickedly in keeping her asleep for so long and then wakening her to be the wife of a miserable old man just ready to totter into the grave but she would not be his wife she vowed she would have nothing to do with him he had deserted her he had treated her cruelly and the holy father the pope would look upon it in that light and would separate her from him with bitter reproaches she had told him to go away and never to let her see him again  she ought to have been ashamed of herself said the daughter of the house i have no sympathy with her instead of upbraiding him she ought to have been grateful to him for the wonderful opportunities he had given her  but john said the mistress of the house i do not believe the pope could have separated them the roman catholic church does not sanction divorce  not as a rule madam replied the gardener but i will touch on this point again there was a good deal to be said on her side it is true but i am not going to take sides with any of the persons in my story she had driven away the poor doctor and declared she would have nothing to do with him and so the unhappy man told jaqui he was going back to milan where he had been living and would trouble his wife no more then up jumped jaqui in a terrible state of mind was he never to get rid of this lady he declared to paltravi he could not accept the responsibility when she had been in the box it had been bad enough but now it was impossible he would go away to some place unknown he would depart utterly and leave everything behind him  but on his knees drÂ paltravi implored jaqui to stay where he was and to protect his wife for a time at least he would send money he would do everything he could and perhaps after a time some arrangement could be made but now he must go he had been ordered to leave and he must do so it had not been two days since paltravi and jaqui had met but already it seemed to them that they were old friends strange circumstances had bound them together and jaqui now found he could not refuse the charge which was thrust upon him and drÂ paltravi departed  donna paltravi did not allow her anger to deprive her of her opportunities there were so many new things she wanted to see that she set about seeing them with great earnestness and industry and she enjoyed her new world very much indeed the news of her revivification spread abroad rapidly for such a thing could not be concealed and many people came to see her she was beautiful and popular and adopted new fashions as soon as she learned them jaqui had nothing to say to all this he had no right now to keep people from seeing her  very soon there came to her the foolpoet now jaqui began to hope he had been assured by his priest that under the circumstances the church would dissolve this young ladys marriage with paltravi and if florino would marry her jaqui might look forward to a peaceful life now whether the priest had a right to say this i will not take it on myself to say but he did say it and so jaqui did not feel called upon to interfere with the courtship of the foolpoet he decided that as soon as possible he would go away from that house he had a dislike for houses with three floors and his next habitation should be carefully selected if so much as a preserved bug or a butterfly in a box should be found on the premises that symbol of evil should be burned and its ashes scattered afar  jaqui had every reason to hope florino literally threw himself at the feet of the fair donna paltravi and she was delighted with him he was somewhat younger than she was but that had been the case with her first lover and she had not objected the two young people got on famously together although there was now a duenna as well as a maid on the second floor jaqui was greatly comforted he spent a good deal of his spare time going about florence looking for a desirable house with two floors the courtship went on merrily and there was talk of the wedding and while jaqui could not help pitying the poor old man in milan he could not altogether blame the gay young woman in florence who was now generally looked upon as a lady who had lost her husband  it was nearly three weeks after the lady had come out of her box when a strange thing happened four days elapsed without florino coming to the house jaqui was greatly disturbed and nervous suppose the young man had found some other lady to love or suppose his parents had shut him up such suspicions were very disquieting and jaqui went to see florino he found the foolpoet in a fit of the doleful dumps at first the young man refused to talk but when jaqui pressed him he admitted that he had not quarrelled with the lady that she did not know why he was staying away that he had received several notes from her and that he had not answered them then jaqui grew very angry and half drew his sword this was a matter in which he was concerned the ladys husband had placed her in his charge and he would not stand tamely by and see her deserted by her lover who had given everybody reason to believe that he intended to make her his own  but jaqui put back his sword for the foolpoet showed no signs of fight and then he used argument just as earnestly as he had formerly tried to keep these two apart did he now endeavor to bring them together but florino would listen to no reason and at last when driven to bay he declared he would not marry an old womanthat donna paltravi had dozens of gray hairs on each temple and there were several wrinkles at the corners of her eyes he was a young man and wanted a young woman for his wife  jaqui was utterly astounded by what he heard his mind was suddenly permeated by a conviction which rendered him speechless he rose and without another word he hurried home as soon as he could he made a visit to donna paltravi he had not seen her for a week or more and the moment his eyes fell upon her he saw that florino was right she was growing old he spent some time with her but as she did not allude to any change in herself of course he did not but just as he was leaving he made a casual remark about florino oh he has not been here for some time said the lady i missed him at first but now i am glad he does not come he is very frivolous and i have a small opinion of his poetry i think most of it is copied and he shows poor judgment in his selections  that evening sitting in his private room jaqui thought he saw through everything upstairs on the second floor was a lady who was actually seventyone years old her natural development had been arrested by artificial influences but as these influences had ceased to operate there could be no reason to doubt that nature was resuming her authority over the lady and that she was doing her best to make up for lost time donna paltravi appeared now to be about fortyfive years old  this is getting to be very curious john said the mistress of the house i have often heard of bodies which on being exhumed after they have been buried a long time presented a perfectly natural appearance but which crumbled into dust when exposed to the air and the light would not this ladys apparent youth have crumbled into dust all at once when it was exposed to light and air  i cannot say madam said the gardener respectfully what might have happened in other cases but in this instance the life of youth remained for a good while and when it did begin to depart the change was gradual  you forget mamma said the younger lady that this is real life and that it is a story with one thing coming after another like steps  i did forget said the other and i beg your pardon john  the gardener bowed his head a little and went on jaqui was greatly interested in this new development he made frequent visits to donna paltravi and found to his surprise that she was not the vain and frivolous woman he had supposed her to be but was in reality very sensible and intelligent she talked very well about many things and even took an interest in science jaqui lost all desire to put her back in her box and spent the greater part of his leisure time in her company  at this the mistress of the house smiled but her daughter frowned  of course continued the gardener he soon fell in love with her  which was natural enough said the mistress of the house  whether it was natural enough or not cried her daughter it was not right  john gayther looked upon her with pride he knew that in her fair young mind that which ought to be rose high above thoughts of what was likely to be which came into the more experienced mind of her mother  but you see miss said john gayther jaqui was human here was a lady very near his own age still beautiful very intelligent living in the same house with him glad to see him whenever he chose to visit her it was all as clear as daylight and it was not long before he was in such a state of mind that he would have fallen upon florino with a drawn sword if the foolpoet had dared to renew his addresses to donna paltravi  i must say remarked the mistress of the house that although his action was natural enough he was in great danger of becoming a prosefool  you are right madam said the gardener and jaqui had some ideas of that kind himself but it was of no use she was an uncommonly attractive lady now that her mind came to the aid of her body he knew that nature was still working hard to make this blooming middleaged lady look like the old woman she really was but love is a powerful antidote to reason and this was the first time jaqui had ever been in love when he thought of it at all he persuaded himself that it did not matter how old this lady might come to be he would love her all the same in fact he was sure that if she were to turn young again and become frivolous and beautiful his love would not change it was getting stronger and stronger every time he saw her  what i am thinking about exclaimed the daughter of the house is that poor old gentleman in milan no matter what the others were doing or what they were thinking they were treating him shamefully and jaqui was not his friend at all  you may be right said her mother but dont you see this is real life you must not forget that my dear  john gayther smiled and went on and the young lady listened although she did not approve jaqui was a handsome man and could make himself very agreeable and it is not surprising that donna paltravi became very much attached to him he could not fail to see this and as he was a man of method he declared to himself one day that upon the next day at the first moment he could find the lady alone he would propose marriage to her he had ceased to think about increase in age and all that he was perfectly satisfied with her as she was and he troubled his mind about nothing else  but early the next day before he had a chance to carry out his plans he received a letter from drÂ paltravi urging him to come immediately to milan the poor gentleman was sick in his bed and greatly longed to see his friend jaqui the letter concluded with the earnest request that jaqui should not tell donna paltravi where he was going or that he had heard from the unfortunate writer jaqui set off at once for fear he should not find his friend alive and on the way his emotions were extremely conflicting  and very wicked i have no doubt said the daughter of the house he hoped that old man would die  there is some truth in what you say miss answered john gayther with a proud glance at the mistress of the house who was not ashamed to return it for jaqui could not help thinking that if old drÂ paltravi who could not expect any further happiness in this life and who must die before very long anyhow owing to his age and misfortunes should choose to leave the world at this time it would not only be a good thing for him but it would make matters a great deal easier for some people he would leave behind him in real life you cannot help such thoughts as this miss unless you are very very good far above the average  jaqui found the old doctor very sick indeed and he immediately set about doing everything he could to make him feel better but drÂ paltravi did not care anything about medical treatment it was not for that he had sent for jaqui what he desired was to make arrangements for the future of donna paltravi and he wanted jaqui to carry out his wishes in the first place he asked him to take charge of the ladys fortune and administer it to her advantage and secondly he desired that he would marry her if i die knowing that the dear woman who was once my wife is to marry you said the sick man and thus be protected and cared for i shall leave this world grateful and happy i can never do anything for her myself but if you will take my place my friendand i am sure donna paltravi will easily learn to like youthat will be the next best thing now will you promise me jaqui knelt by the side of the bed took his friends hand and promised there were tears in his eyes but whether they were tears of joy or of sorrow it is not for me to say  it is for me though said the daughter of the house very severely i know that man thoroughly  the gardener went on with his story jaqui remained several days with drÂ paltravi but he could not do his poor friend any good the sick man was nervous and anxious he was afraid that some one else might get ahead of jaqui and marry donna paltravi and he urged his friend not to stay with him where he could be of no service but to go back to florence and prepare to marry donna paltravi when she should become a widow as jaqui was also getting nervous being possessed of the same fears he at last consented to carry out the old doctors wishesand his own at the same timeand he returned to florence  in the meantime donna paltravi had been somewhat anxious about jaqui she had conceived a high regard for him and she could think of no satisfactory reason why he should go away without saying anything to her and stay away without writing she hoped nothing had occurred which would interfere with the very agreeable sentiments which appeared to be springing up between them this disturbed state of mind was very bad for a lady in the physical condition of donna paltravi if i may use the simile of a clock in connection with her apparent age i should say that worrying conjecture had caused some cogs to slip and that the clock of her age had struck a good many years since jaquis absence  when he met her she greeted him warmly plainly delighted to see him but for a moment he was startled this lady was really very much older than when he had left her her hair was nearly gray  served him right said the daughter of the house  but when he began to talk to her continued john gayther his former feelings for her returned she was charming and he forgot about her hair her conversation greatly interested him and now that his conscience came to the assistance of his affection for he was doing exactly what drÂ paltravi desired him to do he was quite happy and spent a pleasant evening but in the morning as he looked at himself in the mirror he remembered her gray hair  at the word conscience an indication of a sneer had appeared on the face of the young lady but she did not interrupt  it was about a week after this that donna paltravi sat alone in the little room on the second floor and drÂ jaqui sat alone in the little room on the first floor she was waiting for him to come to her and he was not intending to go he believed with reason that she was expecting him to propose marriage to her and he did not intend to offer himself he was very willing to marry a middleaged lady but he did not wish to espouse an old oneat least an old one who looked her age and that donna paltravi was going to look her full age in a very short time jaqui had now no doubt whatever her face was beginning to show a great many wrinkles and her hair was not only gray but white in some places but these changes did not in the least interfere with her good looks for in some ways she was growing more handsome and stately than she had been before but our good friend jaqui  not my good friend jaqui please interrupted the daughter of the house  said to himself continued john gayther that he did not want a mother but a wife a few weeks before he would have supposed such a thing impossible but now a certain sympathy for florino rose in his heart so he did not go upstairs that evening and the lady was very much disturbed and did not sleep well  in a few days jaqui got ready to go away again and this time he went to bid the lady goodby she had heard he was about to take a journey and as he greeted her he saw she had been weeping but was quite composed now farewell my friend said she i know what is happening to me and i know what is happening to you it will be well for you to stay away for a time and when you return you will see that we are to be very good friends greatly interested in the progress of science and civilization then she smiled and shook hands with him  jaqui went to rome and to naples wandering about in an objectless sort of way he dreaded to go to milan because he had not heard that drÂ paltravi was dead and it would have been very hard for him to have to explain to the sick man why he had decided not to carry out his wishes apart from the disappointment he would feel when he heard that donna paltravi was not to have the kind guardianship he had planned for her the old doctor would be grieved to the soul when he heard his wife had lost the youth he had taken from her but which he had expected to return in full measure what made it worse for jaqui was that he could administer no comfort with the news he could not sacrifice himself to please the old man promise or no promise this was impossible he had not consented to marry an old lady again from the very bottom of his heart did jaqui wish there never had been a lady in a box  at last when he could put it off no longer he went to milan and there he found drÂ paltravi still alive but very low and very much troubled because he had not heard from jaqui the latter soon perceived it would be utterly useless to try to deceive or in any way to mislead the old man who although in sad bodily condition still preserved his acuteness of mind jaqui had to tell him everything and he began with florino and ended with himself not omitting to tell how the lady had recognized the situation and what she had said then fearing the consequences of this revelation he put his hand into his leathern bag to take out a bottle of cordial but drÂ paltravi waved away medicine and sat up in bed  did you say he cried she is growing old and that you believe she will continue to do so until she appears to be the lady of threescore and ten she really is  yes said jaqui that is what i said and that is what i believe  then by all the holy angels cried drÂ paltravi jumping out of bed she shall be my wife and nobody else need concern himself about her  hurrah cried the daughter of the house involuntarily springing to her feet i was so afraid you would not come to that  i was bound to come to that miss said john gayther  and did they really marry again asked the mistress of the house  no was the reply they did not there was no need of it the priests assured them most emphatically that there was not the slightest need of it and so they came together again after this long interval which had been forty years to him but which she had lived in forty days if they had been together all the time they could not have loved each other more than they did now to her eyes so suddenly matured there appeared a handsome stately old gentleman seventy years of age to his eyes from which the visions of youth had been so suddenly removed there appeared a beautiful stately old lady seventyone years of age it was just as natural as if one of them had slept all day while the other had remained awake it was all the same to them both in the evening  she soon ceased to think how cruelly she had sent him away from her for she had been so young when she did it and he now gave no thought to what she had done remembering how young she was when she did it they were as happy as though she had had all the past that rightfully belonged to her for he had had enough for both of them  and jaqui asked the mistress of the house  oh jaqui was the happiest of the three of them happy himself and happy in their happiness never again did he wish the lady in her box he looked no further for a smaller house which should contain but two floors he was as glad to stay where he was as they were to have him they were three very happy people all of them greatly interested in the progress of scientific investigation  and not one of them deserved to be happy said the daughter of the house  but you must remember miss this is a story about realities said the gardener  she sighed a little sigh she knew that where realities are concerned this sort of thing generally happens  that is a very good story john said the mistress of the house rising from her seat but it seems to me that while you were talking you sometimes thought of yourself as jaqui  there is something in that madam answered the gardener it may have been that during the story i sometimes did think that i myself might have been jaqui  mamma said the daughter of the house as the two walked out of the garden dont you think that john gayther is very intelligent  i have always thought him remarkably intelligent her mother replied i have noticed that gardeners generally are a thoughtful intelligent race of men  i dont think it is so much the garden as because he has travelled so much said the young lady and i have a strange feeling that he has a story of his own in the past i wonder if he will ever tell it to me  if he has such a story said the elder lady he will never tell it to you                           this story is told by                      the mistress of the house                            and is called                         the cot and the rill     iv  the cot and the rill   a week or so later the daughter of the house came skipping down one of the broad paths john gayther stood still and looked at her glad to see her coming as he always was no matter on what errand she came  john she cried before she reached him you are to stop work then as she came up to him she continued yes there is to be storytelling this morning we have told papa about it and he is coming to what he calls the storytelling place with us and mamma feels inspired to tell the story so you may take that troubled look out of your face please put the big easy gardenchair in the shade of the summerhouse papa does so like to be comfortable and the view from there is so fine you knowa beautiful land view papa must be tired of sea views and shore views and here he will enjoy the mountains  having delivered all this very volubly the daughter of the house skipped away and as john gayther busied himself in making the storytelling place attractive he felt glad that there were others besides himself who liked to tell stories there was such a thing as overworking a mine he was that rare thing a storyteller who is also a good listener moreover john felt very diffident about telling one of his stories before the master of the house who was a man prone to speak his mind not that john disliked the master of the house far from it he with the family was pleased when the master of the house returned from a long cruise and proceeded immediately to make himself very much at home for the master of the house was a captain in the navy and as hearty bluff and goodnatured as a captain should be  the captain had been at home some days and had been in the garden several times and now john gayther was filled with admiration as he saw this fine sturdy figure clad all in white approach the summerhouse with an air of supreme content this figure partly stretched itself in the big gardenchair while the two ladies seated themselves on the bench john gayther stood respectfully until the master of the house motioned to him to sit on his stool  good morning john he cried heartily weve piped all hands to yarns i have heard what you can do in this line and we shall call upon you before long this time you are privileged to listen you can let somebody else cut your asparagus and dig your potatoes this morning  papa said his daughter it is too late for asparagus and too early for potatoes i am afraid you forget about these things when you are at sea  not at all said her father on shipboard we cut our asparagus at any time of the year the steward does it with a big knife which he jabs through the covers of the tin cans as for potatoes they are always with us  the mistress of the house was now prepared to tell her story  i am going to tell my story in the first person she began  there is no better person interrupted the master of the house  i do not intend to describe my hero who is to tell the story continued his wife i will only say that he is moderately young and moderately handsome various other things about him you will find out as the story goes on now then he begins thus i was driving my wife in a buggy in a mountainous region and when we reached the top of a little rise in the road anita put her hand on my arm stop she said look down there that is what i like it is a cot and a rill you see that cotnot much of a house to be sure but it would do and there just near enough for the water to tumble over rocks and gurgle over stones to soothe one to sleep on summer nights is the rillnot much of a rill perhaps but i think it could be arranged with a shovel and then all the rest is enchanting i had been looking at it for some time before i spoke there is a smooth meadow stretching away to a forest and behind that there are hills and in the distance you can just see the mountains now this is the place where i should like to live isnt there any way of making those horses stand still for a minute  i tried my persuasive powers on the animals and succeeded moderately to live i asked and for how long  until about the 3d of august she replied that will be about three weeks  you mean i said in surprise something like this  i do not answered anita i mean this very spot to find something like it would require months what i want as i have told you over and over again is a real cot with a real rill to which we can go now and live for a little while that unsophisticated life for which my soul is longing  anita and i were taking a summer outing together and were trying to get into free nature away from people we knew and had been several days at a mountain hotel and were driving about the country my black cobs now declined to stand any longer  drive them down into the valley there must be a road to that house said anita  i drove on for a short distance and soon came to a wagontrack which descended to the little house anita said i i cannot go down that road it is too rough and rocky and we should break something but why do you want to go down there anyhow you are not in earnest about living in such a place as that  but i am in earnest she answered sweetly but decisively i want to stay in this region and explore it we both of us hate hotels and i could be very happy in a cot like that a little arranged perhaps until the 3d of august when we have to go north but i wont ask you to go down that road of course suppose we come again tomorrow with some quieter horses  i am sorry said i but i cannot do that mrÂ baxter comes tomorrow you know it was planned that he should always come tuesdays  she sighed i suppose everything must give way to business she said and i shall have to wait until wednesday but one thing must certainly be agreed upon when we get to that cot there must be no more mrÂ baxter you can certainly plan for that cant you  i made no immediate reply because i was busy turning the horses in rather an awkward place but when we were on the smooth highway and were trotting gayly back to the hotel i discussed the matter more fully with anita and i found that what she had been talking about was not a mere fancy before coming to this picturesque mountain region she had set her heart upon some sort of camping out in the midst of real nature and this cotandrill business seemed to suit her exactly  i want to go there and live she said but i do not mean any marie antoinette business with milkpails decked with ribbons and dainty little straw hats i want to live in a cot like a cotterthat is for us to live like two cotters as for myself i need it my moral and physical natures demand it i must have a change an absolute change and this is just what i want i would shut out entirely the world i live in and it is only in a real and true cot that this can be done as i want to do it  she talked a great deal more on the same subject and then i told her that if it suited her it suited me and that on the day after tomorrow we would drive out again and examine the cot for the rest of the day and the greater part of the evening anita talked of nothing but her projected life in the valley and before i went to sleep i was quite as much in love with it as she was the next day it rained but mrÂ baxter came all the same weather never interfered with him  who in the name of common sense is mrÂ baxter asked the master of the house i like to know who people are when i am being told what they do  i had hoped said the mistress of the house that i should be able to tell my story so you would find out for yourselves all about the characters just as in real life if you see a man working in a garden you know he is a gardener  but he may not be said her husband he may be a coachman pulling carrots for his horses  but as you wish it continued the mistress of the house i do not mind telling you that mrÂ baxter was my heros righthand man and business manager and now he will go on  after baxter and i had finished our business i told him about the cot for if we carried out anitas plan it would be necessary for him to know where we were then putting on waterproof coats we rode over to the place which had excited my wifes desire to become a cotter we found the house small but in good order with four rooms and an adjunct at one end there were vines growing over it and at the side of it a gardena garden with an irregular hedge around two sides it was a poor sort of a garden mostly weeds i thought as i glanced at it the stream of water was a pretty little brook and baxter who rode to the head of it said he thought it could be made much better  the house was the home of a widow with a grownup daughter and a son about fifteen we talked to them asking a great many questions about the surrounding country and then retired to consult we did not consider long in less than ten minutes i had ordered baxter to buy the house and everything in it if the people were willing to sell and then to purchase as much land around it as would be necessary to carry out my plans which i then and there imparted to him in a general way leaving him to attend to the details  your nameless hero said the master of the house must have been in very comfortable circumstances  i am glad to see that my story is explaining itself remarked his wife and she continued  baxter looked serious for a moment and said it was a big piece of work but he did not decline it baxter never declined anything  how much time can you give me he asked  my wife will want to look at the place tomorrow i replied that is if it does not rain for she says she does not want to see it first in bad weather  thats a help said baxter the weather bureau promises east winds and rains for tomorrow and perhaps the next day and anyway i know now what you want i will go back to town by the oneoclock train and start things going  there is one thing i object to said i when we were on the country road from which anita had first seen the cot and the rill the house is in full view from this road before we know it we will be making ourselves spectacles to parties from the hotel who happen to discover us and drive out to see how we are getting on  baxter reflected oh i can arrange that said he i know this road it turns again into the highway not far below here it is really a private road for the benefit of this house and two others nearly a mile farther on i will include those places in the purchase and close up the road then i will make it a private entrance to this place with a locked gate will that do  very well said i laughing but i suppose people could cut across the country and come in at the other end of the road if they really wanted to look into the valley  not after i have finished the job said baxter and i asked no further questions  may i inquire said the captain if that mrÂ baxter is in want of a position  i am afraid papa said the daughter of the house that you would have to own a navy before you could employ him  the gardener smiled a story built upon these lines interested him the mistress of the house went on without regard to the interruptions  i found anita in earnest consultation with her maid maria and the mistress of the hotel and it was at least an hour before she could see me when i told her i had secured the cot or at least arranged to do so she was pleased and grateful especially as i had had to go out into the rain to do it i knew of course she said that baxter would settle that all right and so i have been making my arrangements but there is one favor i want you to grant me i dont want you to ask me anything about how i am going to manage matters i dont want to deceive you in any possible way and so if you do not ask me any questions it will make it easier for me  very good i replied and i shall ask a similar favor of you  all right said anita and now that matter is settled  the prophecies of the weather were correct the next day wednesday it rained and it also rained on thursday and friday but on saturday it looked as if it might clear in the afternoon  i am not going today said anita i have been working very hard lately and tomorrow i will take a good rest and we will start in on monday  baxter was very glad of the four days of delay occasioned by the stormy weather and said that without working on sunday he could finish everything to his satisfaction i went down to the cot the next day to see how he was getting on but anita asked me no questions and i asked none of her i had never known her to be so continuously occupied as i stood with baxter in front of the cottage where there was a fine view of the surrounding country i asked him how much land he had thought it desirable to purchase  over there he said i bought just beyond that range of trees about half a mile i should say but to the west a little more just skirting the highroad to the north i bought to the river which is three quarters of a mile but over there to the south i included that stretch of forestland which extends to the foothills of the mountains the line must be about a mile from here  that is a very large tract said i how did you manage to buy it so quickly  i had nine realestate agents here on thursday morning he replied and the sales were all consummated this morning they all went to work at once each on a separate owner we bought for cash and no one knew his neighbor was selling  i laughed and asked him how he was going to keep this big estate private for our use we want to wander free you know anywhere and everywhere  that is what i thought said he and that is why i took in such a variety of scenery nobody will interfere with you there will be no inhabited house on the place except your own and i am putting up a fence of chickenyard wire around the whole estate there is nothing like chickenyard wire it is six feet high and very difficult to climb over and it is also troublesome to cut  i exclaimed in amazement that will take a long time  i have contracted to have it done by saturday morning replied baxter the train with the wire fence and posts is scheduled to arrive here at eleven oclock tonight and work will begin immediately paulo montani the italian boss who has worked for me before has taken this contract and will put twelve hundred men on  the train will arrive here said i what do you mean  the mÂ bÂ Â t line runs within a mile and a half of this place and my trains will all be switched off at a convenient place near here  i would not have supposed there was a sidetrack there i remarked  oh no he replied there was none but i am now having two built all the different gangs of men will sleep on the freightcars which have been fitted up with bunks the woodcutters and the landscapemen hedgers sodders and all that arrived about an hour ago and i am expecting the mechanics train late this afternoon the gardeners will not arrive until tomorrow but if it keeps on raining that will give them time enough they want wet weather for their work  excuse me said the master of the house who had now finished his cigar and was sitting upright in his chair but didnt you omit to state that your hero was the king of siam  i have nothing of the kind to state answered his wife he is merely an american gentleman  when i heard of the great works that were going on i exclaimed look here baxter you must be careful about what you are doing if you make this place look like a vast cemetery all laid out in smooth grass and gravelled driveways my wife wont like it she wants to live in a cot and she wants everything to be cottish and naturally rural  that is just what i am going to make it said he the highest grade of true naturalism is what i am aiming at in house and grounds tomorrow afternoon you can look at the house everything will be done then and the furniture will all be in place and if you want any change there will be time enough  the next day i went to the cot but before i reached it i stopped baxter i said you have done very well with this rill it is quite a roaring little torrent  yes said he and down below they are working on some waterfalls but they are not quite finished  when i reached the house i did not exactly comprehend what i saw it was the same house and yet it was entirely different it seemed to have grown fifty years older than it was when i first saw it its color was that of wood beautifully stained by age there was a low piazza i had not noticed which was covered with vines brightcolored oldfashioned flowers were growing in beds close to the house and there was a pathway bordered by box bushes which led from the front door to a gateway in a stone wall which partly surrounded the green little yard i had not noticed before the gateway or the stone wall on which grew bittersweet vines and virginia creeper  now you see said baxter this grass here is not smooth green turf fresh from the lawnmower it is natural grass with wild flowers in it here and there nearly all of it was brought from a meadow about a mile away from here but now step inside a minute everything there is of the period of 1849 horsehair you see lots of black walnut color all toned down and all the ornaments covered with netting to keep the flies off  i was interested and amused but i told baxter i did not want to see everything now i wished to enjoy the place with my wife when we should come to it he was doing admirably and i would leave everything to him as i stood on the little portico and looked over the valley i saw what seemed to be a regiment of men coming out of the woods and crossing a field  that is the first division of the wirefence men said baxter going to supper they are divided into three sections and one gang relieves another so that the work is kept going all night by torchlight  as i went away baxter called my attention to the gate at the entrance of our road it was of light iron and it could be opened into a clump of bushes where it was not likely to be noticed if this gate is locked said i it might make trouble it may be necessary for some one to go in or out  oh said baxter i have provided for all that you know baldwin who used to superintend your lake george gardens i have put him in charge of this gate and have lodged him in a tent over there in the woods he will know who to let in  on monday morning anita rose very early and was dressed and ready for breakfast before i woke the day was a fine one and her spirits were high you have not the slightest idea she said how i am going to surprise you when we get to the cot i told her i had no doubt her surprise would be very pleasant and there i let the matter drop soon after breakfast we drove over to the cot this time with a coachman on the box when we arrived at the gate which was open and out of sight i proposed to anita that she should send the carriage back and walk to the cot  good said she i do not want to see a carriage for two weeks  i have not time to speak of anitas delight at everything she saw she was amazed that plain people such as i had told her owned the house should have lived in such a simple natural way everything exactly suits everything else she said and it is all so cheap and plain there is absolutely nothing that does not suit a cot she was wild with excitement and ran about like a girl and when i followed her into the garden which i had not seen i found her in one of the boxbordered paths clapping her hands the place was indeed very pretty filled with oldfashioned flowers and herbs and hoppoles and all sorts of country plants and blossoms  at last we returned to the house now anita said i we are here in our little cot  where we are going to be as happy as two kittens she interrupted  and as i want everything to suit you i continued i am going to leave the whole matter of the domestic arrangements in your hands you have seen the house and you will know what will be necessary to do mention what servants you want and i will send for them  first tell me said anita what you did with the people who were here you said there were three of them  i could not very well answer this question for i did not know exactly what baxter had done with them i was inclined to think however that he had sent them to the hotel until arrangements could be made for them to go somewhere else but i was able to assure anita that they had gone away  good said she i have been thinking about them and i was afraid they might find some reason or other to stay about the place and that would interfere with my plans and now i will tell you what servants i want i dont want any i am going to do the work of this house myself now dont open your mouth so wide there is nothing to frighten you in what i have said i am thirtytwo years old and although i am not very large i am perfectly strong and healthy and i cannot imagine anything in this world that would give me more pleasure than to live in this cot with you for two weeks and to cook our meals and do everything that is necessary to be done there are thousands and hundreds of thousands of women who do all that and are just as happy as they can be that is the kind of happiness i have never had and i want it now  i sat upright in my slippery horsehair chair and spoke no word surely anita had astonished me more than i could possibly astonish her before me sat my beautiful wife the mistress of my great house in town with its butlers and footmen its maids and its men its horses its carriages its grand company and its stately hospitality the lady of my famous country estate with more butlers and footmen and gardeners and stewards and maids and men and stables and carriages and herds and flocks its houseparties of distinguished guestshere was this wife of mine so well known in so many fashionable centres a social star at home and abroad a delicately reared being always surrounded by servitors of every grade who had never found it necessary to stoop to pick up so much as a handkerchief or a rosebud and here was this superfine lady of high degree who had just announced to me that she intended to cook our meals to pare our potatoes to wash our dishes and probably to sweep our floors no wonder i opened my mouth  i hope now said anita putting her feet out in front of her to keep herself from slipping off the horsehair sofa that you thoroughly understand i do not want any assistance while we are in this cot i have sent away maria who has gone to visit her parents and no woman in service is to come on this place while i am here i have been studying hard with mrsÂ parker at the hotel who seems to be an excellent housekeeper and accustomed to homely fare and i have learned how to make and to cook a great many things which are simple and nutritious i have had appropriate dresses made and maria has gone to town and bought me a great variety of household linen all good and plain for our damask tablecloths would look perfectly ridiculous here i have also laid in a great many other things which you will see from time to time  what a wonderful moment this would have been for a great slump in stocks remarked the master of the house everything swept away but the cot and the rill and the dear little wife with her coarse linen and her determination to keep no servant the husband of your anita would have been the luckiest fellow on wall street if i were working on this story i would have the blackest of black fridays just here  now harold said anita i do not in the least intend to impose upon you because i choose to work is no reason why you should be compelled to do so  i am glad to hear that said i  i knew you would be continued anita but of course neither of us will want very much done for us if we live a cotters life with these simple surroundings and so i think one man will be quite enough to do for you all you will want done but of course if you think it necessary to have two i shall not object  one will be enough said i and i will see about sending for him this afternoon  i am so glad said anita that you have not got him now for we can have our first meal in the cot all by ourselves ill run upstairs and dress and then i will come down and do my first cooking  in a very short time anita appeared in a neat dress of coarse blue stuff a little short in the skirts with a white apron over it  come now said she gayly let us go into the kitchen and see what we shall have for dinner shall it be dinner or lunch cotters dine about noon  oh make it lunch said i i am hungry and i do not want to wait to get up a dinner anita agreed to this and we went to work to take the lid off a hamper which she told me had been packed by mrsÂ parker and contained everything we should want for several days  besides she said that widow woman has left no end of things all in boxes and cans labelled she must have been a very thrifty person and it was an excellent piece of business to buy the house just as it stood with everything in it  anita found it difficult to make a choice of what she should cook for luncheon suppose we have some tea  very good said i for i knew that was easy to make  then said she on her knees beside the hamper with her forefinger against her lips supposesuppose we have some croquettes i know how to make some very plain and simple croquettes out of  oh dont let us do that said i they will take too long and i am hungry  very well then said anita let us have some boiled eggs they are quick  i agreed to this  the next thing said anita is bread and butter would you like some hot sodabiscuit  no said i you would have to make some dough and find the soda andisnt there anything ready baked  oh yes she answered we have albert biscuit and  albert biscuit will do i interrupted  now said she we will soon have our first meal in the cot  this is a very unassuming lunch she said when we were at last seated at the table but i am going to give you a nice dinner if you want more than three eggs i will cook you some in a few minutes i put another stick of wood in the fire so as to keep the water hot  i was in considerable doubt as to what sort of man it would be best for us to have i would have been very glad to have my special valet because he was an extremely handy man in many ways but i thought it better to consider a little before sending for him he might be incongruous i had plenty of time to consider for anita occupied nearly the whole afternoon in getting up our dinner she was very enthusiastic about it and did not want me to help her at all except to make a fire in the stove after that she said everything would be easy the wood was all in small pieces and piled up conveniently near as i glanced around the kitchen i saw that baxter had had this little room fitted up with every possible culinary requirement  we had dinner a little before eight anita sat down hot red but radiant with happiness  now then said she you will find i have prepared for you a highgrade cotters dinner by which i mean that it is a meal which all farmers or country people might have every day if they only knew enough or were willing to learn i have looked over several books on the subject and mrsÂ parker told me a great deal maria told me a great many things also they were both poor in early life and knew what they were talking about first we will have soupa plain vegetable soup i went into the garden and picked the vegetables myself  i wish you had asked me to do that said i  oh no she answered i do not intend to be inferior to any countrywoman then there is roast chicken after that a lettuce salad with mayonnaise dressing i do not believe cotters have mayonnaise dressing nor shall we every day but this is an exceptional meal for the next course i have made a pie and then we shall have black coffee if you want wine you can get a bottle from the winehamper but i shall not take any i intend to live consistently through the whole of this experience  there was something a little odd about the soup it tasted as if a variety of vegetables had been washed in it and then the vegetables thrown away i removed the soupplates while anita went out to get the next course when she put the dish on the table she said something had given way while the fowl was cooking and it had immediately stuck its legs high in the air it looks funny she remarked but in carving you can cut the legs off first  i found one side of the fowl much better cooked than the otherin fact i should have called it kilndriedand the other side had certainly been warmed the mayonnaise was very peculiar and made me think of the probable necessity of filling the lamps and i hoped baxter had had this attended to the pie was made of gooseberry jam the easiest pie in the world to make anita told me you take the jam just as it is and put it between two layers of dough and then bake it the coffee was very like black writingink and having been made for a long time was barely tepid  strange as it may appear however i ate a hearty dinner i was very hungry  now said anita as she folded her napkin i do not believe you have enjoyed this dinner half as much as i enjoyed the cooking of it and i am not going to wash up anything for i will not deprive myself of the pleasure of sitting with you while you smoke your afterdinner cigar on the front porch these dishes will not be wanted until tomorrow and if you will take hold of one end of the table we will set it against the wall there is a smaller table which will do for our breakfast  i drank several glasses of wine as i smoked but i did not feel any better if i had known what was going to happen i should have preferred to go hungry i did not tell anita i was not feeling well for that would have made her suffer in mind more than i was suffering in body but when i had finished my smoke and she had gone into the house to light the parlor lamp i hurried over to the barn where baxter had had a telephone put up and i called him up in town and told him to send me a chef who could hoe and dig a little in the garden  i thought you would want a man of that kind baxter telephoned will isadore do he is at your town house now and can leave by the tenoclock train  i knew isadore he was the second chef in my town house a man of much experience and goodnatured i told baxter to make him understand what sort of place he was coming to and to send him on without delay  do you want him to live in the house asked baxter and i replied that i did not  very good said he i will have a tent put up for him near baldwins  when i went to the house i told anita i had engaged a man  i am glad said she but i have just thought of something i cannot possibly cook for a man  oh you wont have to do that i answered he will live near here just the other side of the road  that will do very well said she i do not mind being your servant harold but i cannot be a servants servant  do you know said the master of the house as this story goes on i feel poorer and poorer every minutei suppose by comparison in fact i do not know that i can afford to light another cigar but one thought comforts me he continued if i had been living in that cot with my wife i would not have had the stomachache so that balances things somewhat  the lady smiled  the next morning a little after eight oclock i came down to open the house and there standing by the porch hat in hand i saw isadore he was a middleaged man large and solid with very flat feet and a smoothly shaven face twinkling eyes and a benevolent smile i was very glad to see him especially before breakfast i took him away from the house so that anita might not overhear our conversation and then i laid the whole case before him he was an alsatian but his english was perfectly easy to understand  i know precisely what it is that is wanted said he and mrÂ baxter has made the arrangements with me it is that madame shall not suppose anything but that what she wishes to be done shall be done  that is the idea said i dont interfere with her but have everything done all right  and i am to be man of all work i like that you shall see that i am charmed now i will go and change my clothes and this welldressed man turned away toward baldwins tent  when anita came down the servant i had engaged was at the kitchen door waiting for orders he was a plainly dressed man his whole appearance neat but humble he looks like a foreigner said anita  you are right i replied he is an alsatian  and his name  i was about to tell her isadore but i stopped myself it was barely possible that she might have heard the name of the man who for two years had composed the peculiar and delicious ices of which she was so fond she might even have seen him and the name might call up some recollection did you say your name was isaac i called out to the man  yes sir he answered it is that i am isaac  i am going to get breakfast said anita do you suppose he can build a fire  oh yes i replied that is what he is engaged forto be the man of all work  prompted by curiosity i shortly afterwards looked in at the kitchen door while you prepare the table madame the man of all work was saying shall i arrange the coffee for the hot water  do you know how to do it she asked  oh yes madame the good isaac replied in a little hut in alsace where i was born i was obliged to learn to do all things my father and my mother had no daughter and i had to be their daughter as well as their son i learn to cook the simple food i milk the cow i rub the horse i dig in the garden i pick the berries in the woods as he talked isaac was not idle he was busy with the coffee  that is very interesting said anita to me where there are no daughters among the poor the sons must learn a great deal  i remained at the kitchen door to see what would happen next there was a piece of dough upon a floury board and when anita went to lay the table the alsatian fairly flew upon the dough it was astonishing to see with what rapidity he manipulated it when anita came back she took the dough and divided it into four portions there will be two rolls apiece for us she said and now isaac will you put them into the stove the back part is where we bake things we are going to have some lamb chops and an omelet she said to me as she approached the hamper  ah madame cried the alsatian allow me to lift the chops the raw meat will make your fingers smell  that is true said anita you may take them out and then she went back to the diningroom  isaac knelt by the hamper then he lifted his eyes to the skies and involuntarily exclaimed oh tonnerre they were not put by the ice and he gave a melancholy sniff but they will be all right he said turning to me have trust the man of all work handled the chops and offered to beat the omelet but anita would not let him do this she made it herself a book open beside her as she did so then she told isaac to put it on the stove and asked if i were ready for breakfast as she turned to leave the room i saw her assistant whip her omelet off the stove and slip on it another one when or where he had made it i had no idea it must have been while she was looking for the sugar  a most excellent breakfast said i when the meal was over and i spoke the exact truth  yes said anita but i think i shall do better after i have had more practice i wonder if that man really can wash dishes on being questioned isaac declared that in the humble cot in which he was born he had been obliged to wash dishes there were no daughters and his mother was infirm  that is good and if any of the plates need a little rubbing up afterwards i can do them said anita now we will take a walk over the place which we have not done yet  when we returned isaac was working in the garden anita went into the house and then the man of all work approached me he had in his hand a little piece of red earthenware which he held up before me in one hand and touched his cap with the other sir said he is it all pots grass bushes everything  oh no said i what is the matter  excuse me said he but everywhere i work in the garden i strike pots and i broke this one but i will be more careful i will not rub so deep  for two or three days anita and i enjoyed ourselves greatly we walked we sat in the shade we lay in hammocks we read novels that man said anita is of the greatest possible assistance to me the fact is that having been taught to do all sorts of things in his infancy he does the hard work of the kitchen and all that is necessary for me to do is to give the finishing touches  that afternoon when i saw the wellknown chef isadorefor some years head cook to the duke of oxminster and willing to accept a second place in the culinary department of my town house only on account of extraordinary privileges and emolumentswhen i saw this man of genius coming down the hill carrying a heavy basket which probably contained meats packed in ice i began to wonder about two things in the first place i wondered what exceptional remuneration in addition to his regular salary baxter had offered monsieur isadore in return for his exceptional services in our cot and in the second place i wondered if it were exactly fair to practise such a variety of deceptions upon anita but i quieted my conscience by assuring it that i was doing everything for her benefit and happiness particularly in regard to this man of all work who was probably saving us from chronic dyspepsia besides it was perfectly fair play for if she had told me she was going to do all my cooking i never would have come to this cot  it was that evening when we were both in a good humor after a good dinner that my wife somewhat disturbed my peace of mind everything is going on so smoothly and in such a pastoral and delightful way said she that i want some of our friends to visit us i want them to see for themselves how enjoyable such a life as this is i do not believe any of them know anything about it  friends i exclaimed we do not want people here we cannot entertain them such a thing was never contemplated by either of us i am sure  that is true said anita but things are different from what i expected they are ever and ever so much better and we can entertain people we have a guestroom which is fitted up and furnished as well as ours is if we are satisfied i am sure anybody ought to be i tell you who will be a good person to invite for the first onemrÂ rounders  rounders i exclaimed he is the last man in the world for a guest in this cot  no he is not answered anita he would like it very much indeed he would be perfectly willing and glad to do anything you do and to live in any way you live besides he told me not very long ago that he often thought of the joys of an humble life without care without anxiety enough no more and a peaceful mind  very well said i this is your picnic and we will have rounders and his wife  no indeed said anita very emphatically she cannot come anyway because she is in europe but i would not have her if she were here if he comes he is to come alone shall i write him a note or will you there is no time to waste  she wrote the note and when it was finished isaac carried it to baldwin and told him to have it mailed  the more i thought about this invitation the more interested i became in it no one could be more unsuited to a cotters life than godfrey rounders he was a rich man of middle age but he was different from any other rich man with whom i was acquainted it was impossible to talk to him or even to be with him for five minutes without perceiving that he was completely controlled by the money habit he knew this but he could not help it in business resorts in society and in the clubs he met great capitalists millionaires and men of wealth of all degrees who were gentlemen scholars kind and deferential in manner and unobtrusive in dress and not to be distinguished so far as conversation or appearance could serve as guides from those high types of gentlemen which are recognized all over the world rounders longed to be like one of these but he found it to be impossible he was too old to reform and the money habit had such a hold over him that i believe even when he slept he was conscious of his wealth he was not a coarse vulgar dives he had the instincts of a gentleman but these were powerless the consciousness of money showed itself on him like a perspiration wipe his brows as he might it always reappeared  he had not been poor in his early life his father was a man of moderate means and rounders had never known privations and hardships but in his intense desire to make people think that his character had not been affected by his money he sometimes alluded to straits and difficulties he had known in early days of which he was not now in the least ashamed but he was so careful to keep these incidents free from any suspicion of real hardships or poverty that he always failed to make the impression he desired i have seen him quite downcast after an interview with strangers and i was well aware what was the matter with him he knew that in spite of his attempts to conceal the domination of his enslaving habit these people had discovered it considering all this i came to believe it would please rounders very much to come to stay a few days with us life in a cot without any people to wait upon him would be a great thing for him to talk about it might help to make some people believe that he was getting the better of his money habit  in the middle of the night i happened to wake then i happened to think of rounders then i happened to think of a story baxter had told me and then i burst out into a loud laugh fortunately anita did not awake she merely talked in her sleep and turned over the story baxter had told me was this in the past winter i had given a grand dinner and rounders was one of the guests isadores specialty was ices pastry salads and all sorts of delicate preparations and he had excelled himself on this occasion especially in the matter of sweets at an unhappy moment rounders had said to his neighbor that if she could taste the sort of thing she was eating as his cook made it she would know what it really ought to be an obliging butler carried this remark to monsieur isadore as he was sipping his wine in his dressinggown and slippers the interesting part of this anecdote was baxters description of isadores rage the furious cook took a cab and drove directly to baxters hotel the wording of monsieur isadores volcanic remarks i cannot state but he butchered cut up roasted carved peppered and salted rounderss moral and social character in such a masterly way that baxter laughed himself hoarse the fiery cook would have left my service then and there if baxter had not assured him that if the gilded reptile ever dined with him again isadore should be informed beforehand that he might have nothing to do with anything that went on the table in consequence of this promise monsieur isadore having withdrawn a deposit of several thousand dollars from one of the trust companies with which rounders was connected consented to remain in my household  now then i asked myself how are we going to get along with rounders and my man of all work isaac but the invitation had gone and there was no help for it i concluded and i think wisely that it would be unkind to trouble anita by telling her anything about this complication but i would prepare the mind of the good isaac  i went into the garden the next morning where our man of all work was gathering vegetables and when i told him that mrÂ godfrey rounders was coming to spend a few days with us the face of isadorefor it was impossible at that moment to think of him as isaacwas a wonderful sight to see his brows contracted his countenance darkened and his eyes flashed as though they were about to shoot out lightning then all color even his natural ruddiness departed from his face he bowed gravely  i have heard it said you have taken some sort of dislike to mrÂ rounders said i and while i have nothing to do with it and do not want to know anything about it i do not wish to force you into an unpleasant position and if you would rather go away while mrÂ rounders is here i will have some one sent to take your place until he leaves then we shall want you back again in this unusual position you have acquitted yourself most admirably  while i was speaking isadore had been thinking hard and fast it was easy to see this by the varied expressions which swept over his face when i had finished he spoke quite blandly  it is that it would be beneath me sir to allow any of the dislike of mine to interfere with the comfort or the pleasure of yourself and madame i beg that you will not believe that i will permit myself even to think of such a thing i remain so long as it is that you wish me is it that you intend that your visitor shall know my position in your town house  oh no said i as i have not told my wife of course i shall not tell him i am much obliged to you for your willingness to stay it would be very awkward if you should go  i understand that sir said isaac and i would do not one thing to discompose madame or yourself  rounders arrived according to schedule and i met him at the gate and explained that my wife insisted it would be incongruous for a carriage to drive up to the cot i like that exclaimed rounders i like to walk a little i took up one of his valises the good isaac carried the two larger ones while rounders with an apologetic look from right to left as if there might be some person present to whom this action should be explained took up some canes and umbrellas wrapped in a rug and we all went down to the cot where anita was waiting to receive us  oh i like this said rounders quite cheerfully i do not know when i have gone anywhere without some of my people but i assure you i like it at the bottom of our hearts we all like this sort of thing  anita showed him everything and probably bored him dreadfully but our guest was determined to be pleased and never ceased to say how much he liked everything there was no foolish pride about him he said he believed in coming close to nature and although a great many of the peaceful joys of humanity were denied the man of affairs still when the opportunity came how gladly our inward natures rose up to welcome it your wife tells me said he that she is cook housekeeper everything this is charming it must be a joy to you to know she is capable of it but my dear friend he said putting his hand on my shoulder you must not let her overwork herself she will be very apt to do it the temptation is great i am sure if i were she the temptation to overwork in these new spheres would be very great  rounders certainly did overwork himself and this was in the line of trying to make us believe that he thoroughly liked this plan of ours of living in a cot by a rill and that he was quite capable of forgetting his ordinary life of affluence and luxury in the simple joys of our rural household he would have produced an impression on both anita and me if he had not said so much about it but i knew what he was trying to do and made all the necessary allowances for him  but say what he might i knew he was not satisfied i could see that he missed his people by whom he was accustomed to be surrounded and served and i soon found out that his meals did not suit him anita visited the kitchen much more frequently than she had done just before rounders arrived and she talked a great deal about the dishes which were served to us but so far as i could judge she had no more to do with their preparation than she had previously had i was thoroughly well satisfied with everything and although rounders was not it was impossible for him to say so when he sat opposite the lady who told him two or three times at every meal that she presided in the kitchen of course i would have done everything in my power to give rounders things to eat that he liked but i did not know what to do our table was just as good though not as varied as it was when we were in town and that rounders was accustomed to living better than we did i could not for one moment believe i came to the conclusion that in spite of his efforts to subdue his dominating habit he could not resist the temptation to let us know that he was not used to humble life or even the appearance of it  so i enjoyed our three good meals a dayanita would not allow us any morewhich were prepared by one of the best cooks on the continent from the choicest materials furnished regularly under baxters orders and if rounders chose to think that what was good enough for me was not good enough for him he must go his own way and suffer accordingly in fortune and in station i was so immeasurably superior to him that it nettled me a little to see him put on airs at the table to which i had invited him but rounders was rounders and i did not allow my irritation to continue  in two or three days our visitors overwork began to show on him his naturally plump cheeks hung down his eyes drooped and although he drank a great deal of wine he was seldom in good spirits on the fourth day of his visit after the morning mail had been brought to us by isaac rounders came to me and told me he had just received a letter which would make it necessary for him to go home that afternoon i expressed my regret but did not urge him to stay for it was obvious that he wanted to go i have had a most delightful time he said as he took leave of anita but business is business and i cannot put it aside  i believed both these statements to be incorrect i knew that at that season he was not likely to be called away on business and he had given me no reason to suppose he was enjoying himself and as i walked with him to the gate i am afraid i was only stiffly polite our spirits rose after his departure anita said she had found him an incongruity and i was tired of the spectacle of a purseproud man trying to appear like other people but if i were harsh in my judgment of him i was speedily punished on the third day after he left i received a message from baxter who wanted to see me at baldwins tent he was not allowed to come into the grounds for anita said that would look too much like business  i found that baxters errand was indeed urgent and that he was fully warranted in disturbing our privacy the members of an english syndicate were coming down from canada to make final arrangements with me for the purchase of a great tract of mining land and as my presence and signature were absolutely necessary in the concluding stages of the transaction i would be obliged to be in new york on the next day but one  i was greatly annoyed by this intelligence the weather was particularly fine anita was reading me a most interesting novel and i was settling myself down to a thorough enjoyment of our cottage life which i did not wish interfered with by anybody or anything and i growlingly asked why the syndicate had chosen such an unsuitable time of the year to come down from canada but baxter did not know i continued to growl but there was no way out of it i must go to new york for the sake of perhaps half a million dollars which would not alter our ordinary manner of living which would not give us any pleasures privileges or advantages of any kind which we did not now possess we must break up our delightful life at the cot and rill and go back to the humdrum of ordinary society  baxter tried to console me he said we could easily return when this business had been settled but i knew that going away would break the charm i thoroughly understood anitas nature and i was sure if she left the cot for a time she would not want to go back to it but when i told her baxters business and that she would have to have some one come and pack up for her she flatly declared that no one should do anything of the kind she would stay where she was  you cant stay here by yourself i cried  of course not she said who could imagine such an absurdity but i shall not be alone i was thinking this very morning of fanny ransmore and her mother i want some women guests this time and they would be delightful after mrÂ rounders fanny is as lively as a cricket and mrsÂ ransmore could take care of anybody you can tell baxter to have some one to patrol the grounds at night and we shall get along beautifully i am sure you will not be away long  but can you get the ransmores i asked  certainly said she they are at newport now but i will telegraph immediately and they can start tonight and get here tomorrow afternoon you need not be afraid they cannot come they would give up any engagement on earth to be our only guests  the matter was settled according to anitas plan and i was more willing to go to new york when i reflected that after the ransmores came anita would not be able to read aloud to me  at this point said the master of the house your hero makes me angry why should he think he could not go away and leave his wife for three days when i leave my wife and daughter too for three years his anita is not worth one twentieth as much as either my wife or daughter then again if i were in his place i would not allow a disadvantageous halfmillion to take me away from you two it is only the absolutely necessary thousands that make me leave you as i do  your sentiments are just as nice as they can be papa said the daughter of the house but dont you see if the gentleman did what you would do it would spoil the story  john gayther smiled with pleasure here was a young lady who never forgot the principle of the thing whatever the thing might be  that is true exclaimed the captain stretching himself at full length in his chair i did not think of that madam please proceed let the king of siam recommence his performances  i will merely remark said the mistress of the house that if the king of siam undertook to emulate my hero in all his performances it would be a pretty hard thing for his already overtaxed subjects  the ransmores arrived on time and were as delighted with the invitation as anita had said they would be according to her orders neither of them brought a maid which must have been pretty hard on the old lady but they declared that the fun of waiting on themselves would be greater than anything newport could possibly offer them  i went to new york attended to my business which occupied me for three days and then i thought this would be a good opportunity to take a trip to philadelphia to look at a large steamyacht which was in course of construction at the shipyards there i did not feel in such a hurry to go back to the cot now that the ransmores were there and i was sure also that anita would like to hear about the new yacht in which we hoped to make a mediterranean voyage during the winter but early in the forenoon of my second day in philadelphia while i was engaged in a consultation concerning some of the interior fittings of the yacht i received a telegram from baxter informing me that my wife had returned from the cot on the previous evening and was now at our town house at this surprising intelligence i dropped the business in hand and went to new york by the first train  of course said anita when we were alone i will tell you why i left that precious cot we had a very good time after you left and i showed the ransmores everything the next day fanny and i determined to go fishing leaving mrsÂ ransmore to read novels in a hammock an occupation she adores isaac was just as good as he could be all the time he got rods for us and made us some beautiful bait out of raw beef for of course we did not want to handle worms and we started for the river we had just reached a place where we could see the water when fanny called out that somebody had a chickenyard there and that we would have to go around it we walked ever and ever so far over all sorts of stones and bushes until we made up our minds we were inside a chickenyard and not outside and so we could not get around it i was very much put out and did not like it a bit because we could not reach the river but fanny saw through it all and said she was sure the fence had been put there to keep all sorts of things from disturbing us and then she proposed fishing in the rill  we tried this a long time but not a bite could we get and then fanny went wandering up the stream to see if she could find a spring because she said she had heard that trout were often found in cold streams after a while she came running back and said she had found the spring and what on earth did i think it was she had soon come to what seemed to be the upper end of the rill and went down on her hands and knees and looked under the edge of a great flat rock and there she saw the end of an iron pipe through which the water was running when i heard this i threw down my fishingrod and would have nothing to do with an artificial rill i remembered then that i had thought two or three times it had improved very much since i had first seen it and when i asked mrÂ baxter about it last night he said the original rill had not water enough in it for the little cataracts and ponds and all that and so he had brought down water from some other stream about half a mile away  when we went back to the cot fanny seemed to have her suspicions excited and she pried into everything and soon told me that the furniture and all the things in the cot were only imitation of the things plain country people use and were in reality of the best materials and wonderfully well made and that it must have cost a lot of money to buy all these imitations of oldfashioned poorfolksy things then she went into the garden and peered about and told isaac who was working there that she had never seen so many different kinds of vegetables all ripe at the same time he touched his cap and said that was a compliment to his gardening but pretty soon she saw the edge of a flowerpot sticking above the ground and showed it to me i made him dig up whole beds of things and there was nothing but pots and pots in which everything was growing  i went back to the house and looked about a good deal more with fanny at my elbow to tell me how poor people would never have this or that or the other thing then i was very angry with myself for not being able to see things without having them pointed out to me by that fanny ransmore who was not invited to pry about and make herself disagreeable in that way  and were you angry with me i asked  yes she answered for a little while but when i remembered the plans i had made i thought we were about square and that i had concealed as much from you as you had from me i was not angry but i was determined i would not stay in that mockcot any longer i could not bear the sight of anything i looked at i thought the quickest way of settling the matter was to get rid of the whole business at once and i told isaac to put a crowbar under the kitchen stove which was full of burning wood and turn it over but he was horrified and said he might be arrested and put in prison for doing that and besides it would be such a shame to waste so many beautiful things fanny and her mother thought so too and i asked isaac where the family lived who used to own the cot and he said they were still at the hotel not being able to find any suitable quarters so i sent for the widow and her daughter and son and i told them to take the cot just as it was and to keep it forever and i would have mrÂ maxwell make out the law papers they went about shouting with delight at everything they saw very different from that fanny so it was really a very nice thing to do and i feel a great deal better and here i am and you will find fanny and her mother somewhere in the house whenever you want to see them after this i think it will be better for us both not to try any affectionate frauds on each other  i was very glad the investigating fanny had not discovered all my affectionate frauds and that i was able myself to reveal to anita the identity of the useful isaac this did amaze her and for a moment i thought she was going to cry but she was not in the habit of doing much of that sort of thing and presently she laughed monsieur isadore she exclaimed working in the garden and washing pots and pans why dont you know some people think he is almost as good as our head chef leonard  as good i cried he is infinitely better leonard could never have done for us what our good isaac did and now i must tell you a story about isadore that baxter related to me this morning as we drove up from the station i then told her the story of isadore alias isaacof his dislike for mrÂ rounders and of the noble manner in which he had determined to stand by us when he heard that gentleman was about to visit us after rounderss arrival i remarked things went on apparently as well as before  illustration i made him dig up whole beds of things  apparently anita interrupted they went on better than before i let isaac as we called him do a great deal more of the cooking than he did before mrÂ rounders came i thought our meals were remarkably good and if mrÂ rounders did not like them as i sometimes thought he did not i believed it was because he could not help putting on airs even to us  i laughed well said i the state of the case was this during the whole time rounders stayed with us isadore did not cook one particle of food for him  that was impossible cried anita i noticed nothing of the kind and besides mrÂ rounders would have found it out immediately  of course neither of us noticed it said i for isadore did not serve us with any of the things he gave to rounders and as for the latter discovering that he was eating his food raw he had no idea that such was the case he supposed he was eating what we ate and therefore did not like to say anything about it  but i do not understand cried anita how could any one eat things and not know they were uncooked  you do not understand said i because you do not comprehend the deep and wonderful art of isadore baxter tried to explain some of it to me as he heard it from the lips of the chef himself but i do not know enough of kitchen magic to understand it as isadore waited on us he was able to bring us wellprepared food and to give mrÂ rounders something very different but which looked just like that we had even his coffee was served in a cup heated hot in the oven while the coffee itself had merely been warmed i cannot explain all these uncooked meals and if you want to know more you must ask isadore himself but baxter told me that spices and condiments must have been used with wonderful effect and that the poor man must have lived mostly on biscuits isadore said that all his life he would laugh when he thought of mrÂ rounders trying to eat a chicken croquette the inside of which was perfectly raw while the outside smoked and looking at the same time with astonishment at you and me as we quietly ate what seemed to be exactly like the thing he had on his plate  but harold said anita that was a shameful way to treat our guest  that is what baxter said to isadore but the cook excused himself by stating that all this happened in a cot in a dear little cot where everything was different from everything else in the world and where he had tried to make you and me happy and where he himself had been so happy especially when he saw mrÂ rounders trying to eat chicken croquettes he was also so pleased with the life at the cot that he is going to have one of his own when he goes back to alsace which will be shortly as he has made enough to satisfy his wants and he intends to retire there and be happy in a cot  anita reflected for a few moments and then she said i think life in a cot might be very happy indeedfor isaac  with this the mistress of the house rose from her chair  is that at all exclaimed her daughter there are several things i want to know  that is all replied the storyteller like the good king of siam i consider my already overtaxed subjects and with this she went into the house  do either of you suppose remarked the master of the house that that anita woman gave the whole of that great estate to the widow and her two children how much land do you think john gayther was enclosed inside that chicken wire  i have been calculating it in my head replied the gardener and it must have been over a thousand acres and for my part sir i dont believe it was all given to the widow when mrÂ baxter came to attend to the papers i think he made over the cot and about seven acres of land which was quite enough to be attended to by a halfgrown boy  that is my opinion too said the daughter of the house and i think that the opulent owner of that great estate made a deerpark of the rest of it with reindeer fallow deer red deer stags and all sorts of deer and not one of them able to jump over the wire  ah me said the captain rising and folding his arms as he leaned his broad back against a pillar of the summerhouse these great volcanoes of wealth always in eruption always squirting out town houses country houses butlers chefs underchefs diamonds ladysmaids horses carriages seaside gardens thousandacre poultryyards private sidewalks and clouds of money which obscure the sun daze my eyes and amaze my soul john gayther i wish you would send me one of your turniphoers i want him to take my secondbest shoes to be mended                            this story is told by                        the master of the house                             and is called                       the gilded idol and the                          king conchshell     v  the gilded idol and the king conchshell   the rosevines were running riot over the old garden wall and as it was now midsummer and the season of their full bloom had passed john gayther set to work one morning to prune and train them the idea of doing this was forcibly impressed upon his mind that day by the fact that the mistress of the house had returned the evening before and he knew that she would notice the untidy appearance of the rosevines as soon as it should please her to come into the garden the family had been at the seashore for nearly two weeks and the gardener had missed them sorely especially the daughter of the house they had now all returned and the butler had told him that they had brought with them a visitor a frenchman john gayther whose mind was always full of the daughter of the house immediately inquired if he was young but the butlers answer was unsatisfactory as he said the gentleman was neither young nor old and talked queer english as the butler himselfwho was englishtalked what seemed to the gardener queer english john did not lay much stress upon that statement  he was soon to make his own observations however for a sweet voice he knew well called out to him we are all back john in the dear old garden  john turned and found four persons had come up quietly and were watching his work he returned the cordial greetings of the family and then the master of the house informally introduced their companion we have a foreign gentleman with us john he belongs to the same nation as your great hero lafayette and therefore i know you will be pleased to have him join our storytelling party for it has been decided by the ruling power in this house that a story is to be told this morning so leave your vines and come with us  john was obliged to follow as the party took the path to the summerhouse but he went unwillingly lafayette was a great and good man but it did not follow that all his countrymen were of that sort and in fact john knew but little about frenchmen he immediately conceived a dislike to this one as he saw him walking by the side of the daughter of the house and evidently pleased with her company he greatly disliked the idea of telling a story to this stranger and determined it should not be made interesting  there was nothing in the frenchmans appearance to excite this dislike there was nothing striking about him he was a goodlooking man verging on middle age perhaps with a rather short little figure and an airy walk  now said the master of the house when the party were all disposed to the best advantage and the frenchman had gone into an ecstasy over the view from the summerhouse john gayther you are to listen carefully to this story for i am going to tell it myself being moved thereto by the story my wife told here  john greatly relieved by this announcement signified his cordial approbation and the captain began his relation  captain abner budlong was a retired sailorman he was rather small of stature with mild blue eyes and a little gold ring in each of his ears he was in the prime of life and had been so often wet with salted water and dried by salted winds that he looked as though he might last forever  he had ceased to sail in ships because his last vessel of which he had been partowner had positively declined to sail any longer under him when this misguided craft decided to go to the bottom of the sea captain abner in a little boat accompanied by his crew betook himself to the surface of the land and there he determined to stay for the rest of his life his home was on the seashore in the summertime he fished and took people out to sail in his boat and in the cold weather he generally devoted himself to putting things into his house or arranging or rearranging the things already there he himself was his family and therefore there was no difference of opinion as to the ordering of that household  the house was divided through the middle by a narrow hallway that part to the right as one entered the front door was called by captain abner the bachelor side while the portion to the left he designated as the married side the right half might have suggested a forecastle and was neat and clean with sanded floors and everything coiled up and stowed away in true shipshape fashion but the other half was viewed by captain abner as something in the quarterdeck style exactly half the hall was carpeted and the little parlor opening from it was also carpeted painted and papered and filled with a great variety of furniture and ornaments which the captain had picked up by sea and land everything was very pretty and tasteful according to the captains ideas of taste and art and everything was sacred no collector could have bought anything out of that little parlor no matter how much money he might offer  this parlor and the room above had been furnished decorated and ornamented for the future mistress of captain abners household and he was ready to dedicate them to her services whenever he should be so lucky as to find her so far as he sometimes expressed himself he had not had a chance to sing out there she blows  one afternoon when captain abner was engaged in dusting the ornaments in the parlor his good friend samuel twitty stood in the doorway and accosted him sam twitty had been mate to captain abner and as he had always been accustomed to stand by his captain he stood by him when he left the sea for the land although they did not live in the same house they were great cronies and were always ready to stand by each other no matter what happened sams face and figure were distinguished by a pleasant plumpness he was two or three years the junior of captain abner and his slippered feet were very flat upon the ground he held his pipe behind his back in such a position that it hung over the uncarpeted part of the hallway a pipe in the married part of the house was never allowed  sam said captain abner youve hove in sight jes at the right minute for im kind o puzzled heres this conchshell which is the biggest i ever seed and a king conchshell at that and i cant make up my mind whether shed like it here in the middle of the mantelpiece or whether shed like to have the gilded idol here where it would be the fust thing shed see when she came into the room sometimes im inclined in the way of the heathen idol and sometimes in the way of the king conchshell and how am i to know which she likes what do you think about it  well now capn abner said sam his head cocked a little to one side thats a pretty hard question to answer considerin i dont know who she is and what kind o taste shes got but ill tell you what id do if i was you id put that king conchshell on the mantelpiece or i would put the gilded idol there it wouldnt matter much which and then id put the other one handy so that when she fust come in and you could see she didnt like whatever it was that was in the middle of the mantelpiece you could whip it off and put the other thing there almost afore she knowed it  sam said captain abner thats a real good rule to go by and it looks to me as if it might fit other things besides gilded idols and conchshells and now that youre here id like you to stay and take supper with me ive got something to tell you  after the evening meal which was prepared by captain abner and his guest who were both expert maritime cooks and housekeepers these two old friends sat down to smoke their pipes the parlor door having been carefully shut  sam said the captain ive got everything ready for her that i can think of there isnt anything more shed be likely to want so now im goin after her and im goin to start on monday mornin  sam twitty was astonished he had had an idea that captain abner would go on preparing for her to the end of his days and it was a shock to him to hear that the work of preparation in which he had been interested for so many years and in which he had so frequently assisted should now be brought suddenly to a close  ready he ejaculated i wouldnt have believed it if ye hadnt told me yourself and yet come to think of it i cant see for the life of me what else you can do for her  there aint nothin else said abner and on monday mornin im settin out to look for her  do you go by land or by water asked sam  land was the answer there aint no chance of runnin across her by sea  and how are you goin walkin  no sir said abner im goin to hire a horse and a buggy thats how im goin  and where are you goin to steer fust asked sam  im goin fust to thompsontown and after ive took my observations there ill fetch a compass and sail every which way if need be theres lots of people of all sorts in thompsontown and i dont see why she shouldnt be one of them  no more do i said sam twitty i think its moren likely shell be one of them  very early the next morning almost before the first streaks of dawn captain abner was awakened by a voice under his window  shipmate ahoy said the voice which was sam twittys in a moment abners head was out of the window  capn abner said sam im goin with you  abner did not immediately answer but presently he replied look here sam twitty you come around after breakfast and tell me that agin  promptly after breakfast sam appeared  look a here said captain abner when they had lighted their morning pipes that aint a bad notion of yours somethin might turn up when id want advice and you might give me some like you gave me about the king conchshell and the gilded idol it aint a bad idea and as you say so id like you to come along  sam did not reply with the alacrity that might have been expected of him he puffed silently at his pipe and gazed upon the ground you said you was agoin in a buggy he remarked  yes thats what im expectin to do  then how am i to get back inquired sam  thats so said abner i never thought of that  look a here capn said abner what do you say to a springwagon with seats for four two in front and two behind  this suited captain abner and sam went on to say therell be another good thing about that if you get her and bring her back  which is what im goin for and intend to do  then continued sam you two could sit on the back seat and i could sit in front and drive  did you ever drive sam asked captain abner  not yet but i wouldnt mind larnin  but you wont larn with me and her said captain abner  how are you goin to manage it then asked sam you wont want me and her to sit on the back seat and it wouldnt look jes right for you an her to be in front and me behind all by myself as if i was company  dont know said captain abner well get her fust and then let her sit where she wants to  theres one thing i wouldnt like to see said sam twitty and thats you and me sittin behind and her adrivin  there wont be none of that said captain abner that aint my way  is that a good beginning asked the master of the house suddenly addressing his wife  yes she replied very good and i see this is to be a real mans story  and so it should be mamma said the daughter of the house men know more about men than they do about women  dont be too sure of that said her father but no matter the two friends started out on monday morning after breakfast for thompsontown considerable delay was occasioned at the liverystable by certain pieces of advice which sam twitty offered to captain abner in the first place he objected to a good black horse which had been attached to the wagon giving it as his opinion that that looked too much like a funeral and that a cheerfulcolored horse would be much better adapted to a matrimonial expedition a gray horse slower than the black one was substituted and sam was quite satisfied then a great many things in the way of provisions and conveniences came into his mind which he thought would be well to take on the voyage and he even insisted upon rigging up an extension at the back of the wagon on which her trunk could be carried on the home journey  at last they got away and as they drove slowly out of the little village not one of the inhabitants thereof knew anything about their intended journey except that they were going to thompsontown for captain abner and sam twitty would have as soon thought of boring a hole in the bottom of a boat in which they were to sail as of telling their neighbors they were going to look for her and to bring her back in that springwagon  the old gray horse jogged very comfortably over the smooth road until a tollgate was perceived near by  now then capn said sam as they drew up in front of the little house by the roadside whatever you pay here you ought to charge to the expense of gettin her  thats so said his companion but if shes all right i aint goin to mind no tolls  a pleasantfaced woman now came to the door of the little house and stood expectant while captain abner thrust his hand into his pocket  how much is it said he  its ten cents said she  then sam twitty who did not wish to sit silent remarked that it was a fine day and the tollgate woman said that indeed it was captain abner was now looking at some small change in the palm of his hand  i aint got ten cents said he heres only six and i cant scrape up another copper sam can you lend me four cents  sam searched his pockets havent got it said he them little things we bought jes afore we started cleaned me out of change  the same things happened to me too said abner and madam ill have to ask you to change a fivedollar note which is the smallest ive got  the tollgate woman said she was very sorry but indeed she had not five dollars in change either at the tollgate or in the house where she lived just behind in a little garden the day before she had had a good deal of change but she had paid it all into the company  then what are we goin to do asked sam i suppose you wont let us go through without payin  the woman smiled and shook her head i couldnt do that its against the rules sometimes when people come along and find they have nothin to pay toll with they go back and get the money somewhere its our rules and if i broke them i might lose my place  which we wouldnt think of makin you do remarked sam  but thats one thing i cant do said captain abner i cant turn round and go back if the folks knew i was turned back because i couldnt pay toll id never hear the end of it  thats so agreed sam it would never do to go back  the toll woman stood and looked at them and smiled she was a pleasant personage not inclined to worry over the misfortunes of her fellowbeings  isnt there a place somewhere near here where i could get a note changed asked abner  i cant say answered the toll woman i dont believe any of the houses along the road has got five dollars in change inside of them and even if you went across the country to any of the farmhouses you wouldnt be likely to find that much but if you are not in a hurry and wouldnt mind waitin its as like as not that somebody will be along thats got five dollars in change you dont seem to know this part of the country she added  no said abner when me and my mate travels we generally take the public conveyances this is the fust time weve druv on this road  then up spoke sam twitty does you and your husband live here and keep the tollgate maam  the woman looked as though she thought the plump person a little inquisitive but she smiled and answered my husband used to keep the tollgate but since he died ive kept it  captain abner looked troubled i dont mind so much waitin myself said he but its the horse im thinkin about i promised id have him fed at twelve oclock sharp every day i have him hes used to it and i dont want him givin out afore im through with him  when horses is used to bein fed at regular times said the tollgate woman they do show it if they dont get fed but if you dont mind ive got a little stable back there and some corn and if you choose to drive your horse into the yard and give him a feed ill charge you jes what anybody else would and while hes afeedin most likely somebodyll come along thats got five dollars in change  for some minutes sam twitty had not said a word but now he most earnestly advised his friend to accept this offer and jumping to the ground he hurried to open the gate so that captain abner might drive in abner had not yet made up his mind upon the subject but as sam stood there by the open gate he drove in  look a here said sam as they stood by the stable door this is a jolly good go did you take notice of that tollgate woman shes tiptop to look at did you see how clean she is and what a nice way of smilin an a good deal of red in her cheeks too and jes about old enough i should say if i was called upon and more than that i should say judgin from what ive seen of her shes as likely to be as accommodatin as any person i ever did see that i had seed for so short a time i jes put her into my mind agoin into your parlor and sayin that conchshells was jes what she liked on mantelpieces and i could put her in jes as well with the gilded idol  you seem to do a lot of thinkin in a mighty short time said abner but whats all that got to do with anything  do exclaimed sam its got lots to do why wouldnt she be a good one for her i dont believe youd find a better one in thompsontown  sam twitty exclaimed abner rather testily what are you talkin about do you suppose id paint and paper and clean up and furnish one side of my house for her and then start out on a weeks cruise to look for her and then take and put in her place and give everything ive been gettin for her for so many years to the fust woman i meet and she a tollgate woman at that  the frenchman who had been listening with great apparent interest now looked so inquiringly at the master of the house that he paused in his story  excuse my interrupt he said apologetically but what is tollgate woman  my conscience exclaimed the captain you havent understood a word of my story he then proceeded to explain a tollgate and its office and emoluments but it was at once evident that the frenchman knew all about the thinghe did not know the english words which expressed it and he had a clear comprehension of the narrative  those two men pull two ways he said gleefully ought to make a good story  it is a good story if my papa tells it spoke up the daughter of the house and john gayther was pleased to note a sharpness in her voice  yes miss that is just what i saya very much good story i long for the end to come  not exactly the compliment intended remarked the mistress of the house with a smile  how do you think it will end asked the daughter of the house impulsively addressing the frenchman  it is not polite to imagine he replied  but i want to know she persisted it is not impolite to guess  well then miss he marry nobody too many women in that villa thompson but we sadly interrupt beg pardon captain  the captain i am telling about in my story said the master of the house resuming his narrative could not silence sam twitty  now i tell you capn he said as he assisted in taking the horse out of the wagon dont you go and miss a chance heres a fustrate woman with red cheeks and mighty pretty hair and a widow too even if you dont take her now its my advice that you look at her sharp with the idea that if things dont turn out in thompsontown as youd like them to it would be mighty comfortin to you to pick her up on your way back  when captain abner and sam returned from the stable they looked up and down the farstretching road and then at the invitation of the tollgate woman they seated themselves on a bench at the back of the tollhouse  tisnt a very good time for people to be passin said she not many folks is on the road between twelve and one theyre generally feedin themselves and their horses but if you can make yourselves comfortable here in the shade i dont think youll have to wait very long ill jes step in and see if my dinner aint cooked there aint nobody in sight  sam twitty rubbed his hands together in my opinion said he that woman is a fustclass housekeeper  in a very few minutes she returned if you gentlemen dont mind said she i can give you your dinner here at the same price youd have to pay anywhere else i always cook a lot on mondays sos i can have something cold for the rest of the week its on the table now and you can go in and wait on yourselves  sam gave a quick glance at abner you go in with her said he and eat your dinner im not hungry and ill wait out here and keep the tollgate afterwards ill get a bite  the tollgate woman smiled perhaps it would be better for me to go in and wait on one of you at a time but i dont think its likely therell be anybody passin  abner did not objecthe was hungry and he followed the tollgate woman into her house sam twitty made a motion as if he would dance a little in his slippered feet  thats jes like runnin across a dead whale whats jes expired of too much fat all youve got to do is to cut it up and try it down the fust thing capn abner does is to run into a widow woman thatll suit him i believe better than anybody hell meet if he cruises around thompsontown for a week  sam sat down on the bench and pictured things in his mind he took the tollgate woman all over captain abners house even into the unmarried part and everywhere he saw her the same brightcheeked pleasantly smiling woman she was here in her own house the picture pleased him so much that he withdrew his senses from the consideration of everything else and therefore it was he did not hear wheels on the road and was awakened from his pleasant dreams by a voice outside the door he bounced to his slippered feet and entered the tollhouse  on the roadway was a buggy and a horse and in the buggy sat a smiling young woman why she smiled sam could not imagine but then he could not see the comical expression on his own face on being thus suddenly aroused to a sense of his duty  how much is the toll said the young woman still smiling  sam looked at her she was a goodlooking young person and he liked her smile for it betokened a sense of humor and that pleased him how much he repeated a vehicle a man and a horse  but this is a girl and a mare she interrupted how much is that  sam looked up and smiled this young person certainly had a sense of humor i wonder how much that would be he said i guess ill have to get a pencil and paper and work it out  the girl laughed you are not the tollgate keeper she asked  no replied sam im keepin it for her shes eatin her dinner dont you know the toll yourself youve paid it before havent you  no i havent she replied i am visiting in the neighborhood but i wont haggle about being a girl ill pay the price for a man if you will let me know what it is  an idea came suddenly into sam twittys head this was a very bright girl a very attractive girl who was visiting in the neighborhood and he determined to keep her at the tollgate a few minutes if he could  i dont want to make any mistake he said quickly ill jes pop into the house and see what the toll reallyll be for you  oh you neednt do that said the young woman of course it is the same  but sam was gone and she laughed and said to herself that the deputy tollgate keeper was a very funny person sam ran to the house panting he beckoned to captain abner to step outside  look a here he said you hurry out to the gate and take a good long look at the girl thats there shes avisitin in the neighborhood now mind you take a good look at her and ill be there in a minute  without exactly understanding the reason for this earnest injunction abner went to the gate he was accustomed to taking sams advice if he saw no good reason against it  the tollgate woman was on her feet but sam detained her and said something about the relation between sex and toll  well well said the woman she must be a queer one ill go out to her  oh no cried sam sit here and finish your dinner hes comin right back and ill collect the toll halfway to the tollhouse sam met abner what do you think of her he asked hurriedly did you take a good look at her  yes i did replied his friend and i dont think nothin of her what is there to think about her  go back to your dinner cried sam ive got to collect her toll  i want you to tell me said the girl not smiling now do you keep a detective here do you think i want to cheat the road out of its toll i am ready to pay the charge whatever it is  detective exclaimed sam  yes said she that little brown man who came out here and looked at me as if he were determined to know me the next time he saw me  oh him said sam thats a friend of mine capn abner budlong hes no detective nor nothin like one he jes came out to see who was passin while i was findin out about the toll hes always fond of seein people  i should think he was said the young woman in fact i think you are a funny lot tollgate woman and all now here is a quarter please take the toll and give me the change that is if you know how to calculate  sam took the money but he did not immediately make the change i dont want you to think hard of any of us said he on account of your bein kept here a little longer than common but specially i dont want you to think hard of my friend capn abner budlong the gentleman who stepped out here to see who was passin bless your soul hes no detective hes one of the finest fellows i know and you jes ought to see his house at shamrick its filled with more things thats nice to look at and things thats comfortable to use than any other house in that region everythings jes as clean and shipshape  he must have a good wife the young woman interrupted  he hasnt got no wife at all said sam delighted to get in this piece of information never had one  the girl looked at him and then she laughed merrily i really must go on she said you truly are a funny lot all of you and as she drove on she looked back still laughing  sam twitty rubbed his hands together quite cheerfully and went into the house to get his dinner  did that woman change your fivedollar note asked the keeper of the tollgate  bless my soul exclaimed sam i never thought to ask her  what did you ask her cried the woman she was out there for the longest time and i thought of course you was gettin your note changed  sam smiled she was very interesting said he  what a treasure sam twitty would be in a matrimonial bureau exclaimed the mistress of the house  provided he exercised a little more caution in the selection of his specimens suggested john gayther respectfully some might be too green and some the other way you know he didnt seem overparticular  three travellers passed through continued the master of the house but not one of them could change a fivedollar note and abner chafed at the delay  i dont like wastin time like this said he to sam as the two smoked their afterdinner pipes  wastin exclaimed sam i dont call this wastin time we didnt start till late this mornin and here weve got sight of two of her aready heres this one as redcheeked and sociable as anybody could expect and then theres that gal in the buggy  gal in the buggy exclaimed abner what on earth are you talkin about her for  why shouldnt i asked sam i tell you capn abner shes the prettiest and the liveliest young woman youd be likely to meet if you cruised for a year and shes visitin right in the neighborhood and cant be far from shamrick  codwollops said abner contemptuously  in the course of an hour old joshua asbury drove up in his farmwagon and changed the fivedollar note and was glad to do it for he did not like to carry so much inconvenient silver and copper in his pocket the two friends now made ready to depart  lets hurry up said sam weve done fustrate so far and maybe well sight one or two more afore bedtime  when you come back said the woman id be glad to have you stop and rest and give your horse a feed if you want to  sam twitty assured her most earnestly that they certainly would stop whether they wanted rest and a feed or not and he thanked her warmly as he paid for the kind entertainment she had given them  sam said abner when they were on the road the trouble with you is youre too quick if you was at the tiller youd run into the fust port you come to and there wouldnt be no vyage at all  theres no knowin when a fellow may want to run into port replied sam and its a good thing to find out all about them as youre coastin along  a few miles from the tollgate they came to the bottom of a long hill and halfway up it they saw going in the same direction as themselves a man walking vigorously  by the general cut of his clothes said sam id say he is a minister  i expect youre right said abner most likely fillin some fishin ministers pulpit sunday and walkin home monday  the pedestrian clergyman walked more slowly as he neared the top of the hill and the gray horse gradually overhauled him  look a here said sam nudging his companion lets give him a lift he must be dreadfully hot and then by george capn abner jes think what a jolly thing itll begoin after her and takin a minister along sittin comfortable on the back seat thats like holdin a landinnet ready to scoop her up the minute you get her to the top of the water  they stopped and asked the clergyman if he were going to thompsontown and when he said he was they invited him to get in and take the unoccupied seat he proved to be an agreeable companion he was young and very grateful sam soon fell into a very friendly conversation with him and two or three times when abner thought that his friend was on the point of saying something that bore too directly on the object of their journey he pressed his port boot gently upon sams starboard slipper  toward the middle of the afternoon they reached thompsontown where the young clergyman said he was going to stop for the night and go on by train the next day sam twitty was glad to hear this and advised him to stop at the spinnaker boom where he and captain abner intended to stay until they finished the business which brought them to thompsontown  thompsontown was a seaside resort and rather a lively place in the season there was a large hotel for summer visitors who could afford to pay good prices and several smaller houses of entertainment such as the spinnaker boom where people of moderate means were made very comfortable  it was much too early for supper and captain abner and sam took a long walk on the beach and at their invitation the young clergyman joined them this gentleman who did not seem to know any one in thompsontown proved to be a thorough landsman but as he was chatty and glad to acquire knowledge it gave captain abner and sam a great deal of pleasure to talk to him on nautical points and thereby improve his mind on their return sam stopped with a start and almost dropped his pipe  whats the matter cried captain abner did you see her spout  sam made no answer but stood with his mouth open he had remarkably good vision the clergyman stopped and looked at him inquiringly  they are coming both of them said sam  both of who asked abner  the gal in the buggy and the tollgate woman  if i were telling this story here interrupted the daughter of the house excitedly i really do not know which one i would marry to captain abner  thank you for the compliment my dear said her father  well there they both were side by side they were walking along the smooth beach and approaching our three men sams eyes sparkled the tollgate woman appeared much more comely and attractive than when engaged in her professional duties earlier in the day she was now attired in freshlooking summer clothes and wore a pretty straw hat as for the girl of the buggy she was quite another person it would have been impossible for any one who had merely seen her within the limited confines of a small vehicle to form any idea of the buoyant air and the lively step of this handsome young woman  upon my word exclaimed sam twitty advancing toward them who would have expected to meet you two here  at this meeting all our characters were variously affected the tollgate woman beamed with pleasure the young woman of the buggy looked as if she were about to laugh the young minister looked very much interested although he could have given no good reason why he should be the countenance of captain abner budlong betrayed no interest whatever and sam twitty was in a glow of delight  i suppose you are surprised to meet me here said the tollgate woman but this is the way of it a neighbor and his wife came along soon after you left and offered to bring me to thompsontown and of course i jumped at the chance and left the tollgate in charge of my brother who lives hard by and in the town at the house of a friend i met this young lady and glancing at her companion she added i really did not catch the name  miss denby stated the young person referred to  the three men here bowed to miss denby then stepping nearer to sam the tollgate woman asked in a low voice who is the minister  i dont know his name said sam but ill find out in a minute and then he approached the girl of the buggy i am so glad to see you he said  she laughed outright it is awfully funny answered she that you care whether you see me or not  i dont think its funny at all said sam but jes let me ask you one thing whats the name of the tollgate woman  well i declare she exclaimed from the way she talked about you i thought you were old friends her name is mrsÂ sickles  sam skipped over to the young clergyman and put his question mrrr  rippledean said the young man  in an instant the quickslippered sam had joined the party in the bonds of conventional acquaintanceship having added to the rest of his information the fact that he was samuel twitty of shamrick  you are the funniest people i ever met exclaimed the lively denby girl none of you seems to know the rest  it is very pleasant to know each other i am sure remarked the tollgate woman and if i had anything to say about what would be agreeable on such a breezy afternoon as this now that theres a party of us i would say it would be to get a boat and take a sail on this sparkling water  a sail cried sam why that will be the best thing in the world and if youll wait ten minutes ill get a boat capn silas peck is a friend of mine and has got two boats that aint likely to be out ill run down and get one and have it here in no time  in less than a quarter of an hour the party was seated in captain pecks sailboat captain abner at the tiller and sam twitty in charge of the sheet they decided to sail out to an island about three miles from shore a stiff breeze was blowing and captain abner was in his glory the wind was much too high for ordinary pleasureboats and there were no other sails upon the bay but summer visitors and seafaring men stood along the beach and watched the admirable manner in which that little craft was handled word was passed from one to another that it was captain abner budlong of shamrick who was at the tiller many of the watchers had heard of captain abner and what he had done in days gone by and they were proud to see what their neighbor of shamrick was doing now  mrsÂ sickles sat beaming both hands grasping the rail and her feet firmly braced but with an expression of perfect trust as she gazed from captain abner to sam twitty which would have been edifying to any one of weak habits of faith the younger womans hat was off and her hair was flying like a streamer from a masthead she drank in the salt breeze with delight and her eyes sparkled as the boat dipped at the turn of captain abners tiller until the rail cut under the surface of the water as if it were skimming a pan of milk she looked upon the brighteyed sailor at the helm as though he were some sort of a saltwater deity whom it was suitable to worship it was better than sparkling wine to her to dash over the sparkling water  the island shore drew near the little boat bore bravely down upon it and then with a beautiful sweep fell into the wind her great wing dropped and hung listless and her keel gently grazed the sand  very beautiful oh so fine a turn to words exclaimed the frenchman who was very intent upon the story  my papa is a sailor said the daughter of the house proudly you should see him bring around a great vessel with a grand sweep so quietly and so gracefully  you never saw me do anything of the kind said her father in surprise  i have never seen you she admitted reluctantly but i know just how you would do it  her father smiled and laid a hand on her head  well my dear he said what sam twitty told the inmates of the boat was this if there was an eggshell twixt her bow and the beach capn abner wouldnt have smashed it  the captain stemmed the praises which now poured upon him with a jerk of the head thats all very well said he but im goin to give sam twitty a chance hell sail you back  when the party was on shore and the boat safely moored sam twitty began to jump about like a collie dog in charge of a flock of sheep he had said little in the boat but his mind had been busily at work with the contemplation of great possibilities there was much to be done and but little time to do it in but sams soul warmed up to its work casting a rapid glance around he singled out captain abner and dashing into the little party cut him off from his companions and drove him out of earshot  now capn abner said he your times come and the quicker you get to work the better  work cried abner what work have i got to do  do exclaimed sam youve got lots to do look at that sun its settin jes as steady as if it was bein towed into port and youll never get another chance like this heres two women to pop your question to here is a minister on hand heres me and the young woman what dont get chosen for witnesses heres all them white caps skippin over the water and heres this clean stretch of sand there couldnt be a better place for a sailor to be married in than jes here  but i tell you sam said abner a little querulously i didnt come here to marry one of them women i didnt start on this trip to make fast to the fust female person i might fall in with i set out on a weeks cruise and i want to see a lot of them afore i make a chice  i tell you capn said sam very earnestly it wont do you might hang round thompsontown for a year and you wouldnt find any two such women as them two here they are two kinds to pick from one of them as ripe as a peach and the other like a cross between a cricket and a blossom and youve got no time to fool away when the sun goes down youve got to sail back to thompsontown and then one will go one way and the other another and where the minister will go to nobody knows theyll all be scattered and out of sight and this glorious chance youve got might as well be at the bottom of the sea now capn i tell you this thing thats right afore you is what you come for jes you listen to what i say to you you go to that mrsÂ sickles and let her see how youre standin and what your course is shes no fool and she can see the sense of gettin over a sandbar at high tide jes as well as you can  captain abner hesitated a moment shes a mighty fine woman sam said he but if i go and set the case afore her and she agrees to ship with me then i cant ask the other one and there might as well be no other one and shes as pert a little clipper as ever i seed sam and she likes sailin that she does  now dont you worry about that said sam you jes say all youve got to say to her and hear all shes got to say but dont sign no papers and take her aboard until you talk to that other girl now hurry up and walk along the beach a little further off  without waiting for an answer sam twitty galloped away or that was what he would have done had he been a sheepdog he darted in between mrsÂ sickles and her companions he turned her down the beach he talked to her in rapid snaps about the sea the sky the sand and before she knew it he had driven her alongside of captain abner then with what might have been compared to a bark of satisfaction he bounced away to join the others who were looking for shells  in about ten minutes sam twittys port eye told him that captain abner and the tollgate woman were approaching but in abner there were signs of a disposition to fall back in an instant he had bounded between them and was showing shells to the widow then letting her go on by herself he turned sharply upon abner  well said he their heads close together what did she say is she all right  captain abner threw a glance over the water as if his soul were yearning for the fancied possibilities of thompsontown oh its all right enough so far as she counts said he i went straight at it and put the whole thing afore her i told her about the house and the two parts to it and what they was for and she said that was charmin and i told her about the king conchshell and the gilded idol and she said she thought either one of them would be jes lovely and nothin she thought could be better on mantelpieces than gilded idols and king conchshells and everything else was jes as slick and smooth as if she was slidin off the stocks shes goodlookin enough sam but she aint got no mind and i didnt fix up that house and bother myself year in and year out agettin it all right to take it and give it to a woman whats got no mind shed be jes as well satisfied to see me asettin up on the mantelpiece as if the gilded idol or the king conchshell was there  and she dont suit you asked sam eagerly  no sir replied the other she dont suit  all right exclaimed the everready sam jes you wait where you are one minute in less than that time the agile sam had rounded up miss denby and had her walking along the beach by the side of captain abner and whether she thought that skilful skipper was going to show her some rare seaweed or the state of his mind sam considered not for one minute he had brought the two together and that was all he cared about  the good mrsÂ sickles was standing alone reflectively gazing upon the little waves so sam had no trouble in carrying off the minister to a little distance for confidential remarks  i want you to tell me sir said he if there is any law agin your marryin a party on the seashore especially when one of them is a sailor  mrÂ rippledean laughed as i am a regularly ordained minister i can perform a marriage anywhere said he provided the parties are of legal age and there are no objections but what are you talking about who wants to be married  i cant say jes now answered sam matters isnt settled yet but everything is goin ahead lively with a stiff breeze and i guess well get into soundins pretty soon i only spoke to you to know if youd be all right when the couples ready  there is nothing the matter with me said the young man but i would like to know  jes you lay to for a while said sam and ill tell you all about it and then noticing that mrsÂ sickles was glancing toward the captain and his companion as if she thought to join them he dashed out upon her to cut her off  meanwhile miss denby with glowing eyes was saying yes i do love to sail and to sail in a small boat close to the water almost as if i were in it skimming like a bird with my wings dipping oh it is grand and you have a sailboat  and the captain answered indeed i have and theres none better either for sailing on the wind or before the wind or with next to no wind at all  how wonderfully you must sail it i could not keep my eyes off you as you brought us over here it was grand you made her do anything you pleased  the captain smiled and nodded but i think of my house as much as i do of my boat miss said he ive got a mighty nice parlor thats as good as any ships cabin and now let me put this pint to you if you had a big king conchshell the prettiest you ever seed and it was on the middle of the mantelpiece and you had a gilded idol in another place would you put the idol where the conchshell was and the conchshell where the idol was or would you leave em both jes where they was afore  the young woman laughed merrily what kind of an idol would it be she asked a beautiful piece of carving  taint that said captain abner its jes a piece of wood whittled out by a heathen but it used to be in a temple and its gilded all over  oh dear said she i dont think much of that sort of an idol i might like to be a gilded idol myself if i had the right person to worship me but as for a wooden idol i wouldnt put that on the mantelpiece and i am of the same opinion as to the conchshell  but its a king conchshell said the captain  i dont care said she king or queen it would be all the same to me but if i were you i think id be most of the time in the boat what is a house no matter what it has in it compared to a boat dancing over the waves and speeding before the wind  captain abner looked at her i expect youd like to learn to steer wouldnt you  indeed i would she answered there is nothing i would like better  captain abner put his hands into his pockets and gently whistled and leaving him miss denby ran to join the tollgate woman down swooped sam twitty  is it all right he whispered to abner  all up the other answered and im glad of it she dont want no gilded idol and she dont want no king conchshell she wants her hand on the tiller thats what she wants shes got too much mind for me after ive been workin year in and year out agettin my affairs the way i wants them i dont fancy anybody comin down on me and takin the tiller out of my hands  sam made two or three steps forward and then he stood gazing in the direction of the setting sun resting on one slippered foot and extending the other before him he folded his arms and remained a few moments wrapped in thought suddenly he turned  capn abner he cried it wont do to sink this chance itll never pop up agin you must have spoke pretty plain to that tollgate woman considerin the way shes been turnin it over in her mind  yes i did said captain abner and thats the way i found out what she was but i didnt ask her to ship with me  and you dont want her to said sam  no i dont  and you dont want the other one nuther  no i dont replied captain abner doggedly i dont want nuther of em and i say sam the suns gettin down and its about time for us to be settin sail  theres a good stretch of sky under that sun yet said sam and jes you wait a bit capn  sam twitty walked slowly along the sandy beach he looked as a sheepdog might look who was wondering within himself whether or not he had brought back from the fields as many sheep as he had taken out he stopped and looked about at the party captain abner was walking toward the boat the minister and the denby girl were standing together comparing shells the tollgate woman was strolling by herself a little higher up the beach still in a reflective mood sam gazed from his companions to the sky the water the beautiful glistening sands  its a shame to lose all this he said to himself its a burnin shame to sink it all then suddenly as if his master had whistled he sped to the side of mrsÂ sickles backward and forward these two walked sam talking earnestly and the tollgate woman listening with great interest captain abner now and then gave them an impatient glance but the other couple did not regard them at all  but mrÂ twitty said mrsÂ sickles this is so unexpected i had an idea of the kind about capn abner for i could not help it but youreally ive heard of you often mrÂ twitty but i never saw you until today  now mrsÂ sickles said sam you couldnt have had a better day to see me in if youd waited a year and aspeakin quick and sharp as ive got to do for the suns keepin on goin down there couldnt be a better day to marry me in  oh mrÂ twitty cried mrsÂ sickles with flushed face  there couldnt be a better time or a better place said sam and a minister right here and two witnesses  but mrÂ twitty said she i really thought that capn budlongand from what he told me about his house and his things  capn abner is one of the finest men in this world interrupted sam and hes got a fustclass house and i aint got none and hes got all sorts of things from all parts of the world that hes put in it but i can get a house and things to put in it and i can do without gilded idols and king conchshells and whats still more to the pint mrsÂ sickles i wants you and he dont  theres something in that said the tollgate woman and then she added but as to marryin you here and now mrÂ twitty its not to be thought of  sam walked slowly away one might have thought his head drooped under a rebuke he approached the young minister and the girl of the buggy  look a here said he to the former you dont mean to say sir that youd back out of marryin a couple right here and now that was growed up and of full age and nothin to hinder  marry cried miss denby a wedding right here on this beautiful island oh that would be glorious who wants to be married  i do said sam  they both laughed but the other person asked mrÂ rippledean there must be a bride if you want a wedding  oh the bridell be mrsÂ sickles said sam but the trouble is she aint altogether willin  i told you said the merry miss denbyyou know i told you that you are the funniest people i ever met and you truly are people generally come to an agreement between themselves before they speak to the clergyman  mrÂ twitty said the clergyman i strongly advise you to give up your present notions of immediate matrimony and wait at least until all parties agree upon time and place and upon the other circumstances of this union for which you seem so impatient  hello sam shouted captain abner from the waters edge aint you comin along  sam made no answer to any one he walked silently down toward the boat everything seemed to be breaking loose from him and slipping away his old friend who had so long wanted her and who had prepared his house for her and had set out to look for her had declined to take her when he saw her and he sam who had so thoroughly understood the opportunities which had been spread before the little party that afternoon and who knew what would happen if these opportunities were allowed to slip out of sight had been set aside by one woman laughed at by another had been advised by a clergyman and had been scolded by captain abner his soul resented all this and he saw that the edge of the sun was nearly touching the rim of the distant sea with a great slap upon his thigh he sprang to the side of the boat and turned and faced the others all of whom were now approaching him  i am to sail this boat back to thompsontown he cried its been agreed im to do it and im goin to do it but one thing ill tell youthe sun can go down the night can come on and you can all stay here till mornin if you like but this boat dont leave this island with me at the helm till im a married man with this he skipped on board sat down in the stern and clapped his broad hands on the tiller  there was a burst of astonishment from the rest of the party as sam thus seated himself at bay even the girl of the buggy did not laugh  but i must go home she cried before it is any later my friends will be waiting supper for me  dont matter said sam supper can wait  look a here said captain abner  i dont want to look a here said sam im alookin a different way and its mrsÂ sickles im lookin at and you neednt none of you look cross at me im to steer this boat home thats settled and i dont steer her an inch till im a married man  the others gathered together on the beach and gazed with varied emotions upon the determined figure of sam as he sat in the stern his arm resting upon the tiller and one leg crossed leisurely over the other his protruding slipper lighted up by the rays of the setting sun  what is the matter with him asked mrÂ rippledean is he crazy does he really think of forcing us to remain here until he shall be married i never heard anything  so delightfully absurd interrupted miss denby  theres nothin crazy about sam twitty said captain abner hes as sound as a nut body and soul but when sam makes up his mind he sticks to it now sometimes when i make up my mind i dont stick to it hes a good man all around and hes got enough to live on though he never was a capn but you couldnt find a better fust mate than him or a better sailor except perhaps somebody whats had a leetle more experience sam made up his mind that we was all comin out here for a weddin everything fallin together exactly to suit wind and tide and everything else but sam aint goin to force nobody to do nothin he aint that kind all hes goin to do is to stay here till hes married  the girl of the buggy clapped her hands oh that is fine she cried it is like lifting you up on a horse and dashing away with you oh dear mrsÂ sickles take pity on him and on all of us if you do not i shall have to talk to him myself and see if i  mrsÂ sickles was not inclined to give attention to any such idle words as these and she stepped up to captain abner  you seem to think very well of mrÂ twitty sir she said  indeed i do he answered there aint nobody i think more of on watch or below in storm or fine weather take him as you find him than i do of him  sam twitty had not heard any of the remarks which had been made on shore he had been communing with himself but now his active mind would no longer permit him to sit still springing to his feet he stepped forward and stood up in the bow of the boat and cast his eye over the little party in front of him then he spoke  mrsÂ sickles i want to put a pint to you thats been put to you afore but i want to put it a little different if there was a gilded idol and a king conchshell that you knowed of and you was asked which of them you would like to have for your own and you only could have one  oh dear exclaimed miss denby here is that delightful gilded idol and conchshell again i wonder what they will do now  the tollgate woman was paling and flushing and these changes of countenance combined with her becoming summer dress and her straw hat made her very attractive to the eye without waiting for sam to finish his remarks she spoke  i am very sure mrÂ twitty that both the things you mention from what i have heard of them would be very nice and pleasant but you see mrÂ twitty i dont  sam suddenly stepped upon the rail steadying himself by the mast mrsÂ sickles he cried ill put it plainer to you supposing you couldnt get the gilded idol  mrsÂ sickles now saw very clearly that there was no more time for hesitation she stepped a little forward  in that case she said id take the conchshell  with a bound sam twitty sprang from the shore and the next moment he had seized the blushing mrsÂ sickles by the hand for a moment he gazed proudly around the sunset light casting a ruddy glow upon his countenance which made it almost as rosy as that of his companion then he tucked her under his arm and turned toward the minister  please step this way mrÂ rippledean he said that little bluff there with grass on it is the place ive picked out for the ceremony and capn abner ill ask you and that young woman to follow along after us and stand up for witnesses  just as the upper edge of the sun disappeared beneath the glowing sea the name of sickles departed from observation and recognition on that line of longitude but in the glow upon the faces of mr and mrsÂ twitty there was nothing to remind one of a sunset sky it might have been supposed rather that they were gazing eastward and that the morn was glorious  having gravely saluted his bride sam lifted up his voice he was used to that sort of thing for he had been a boatswain capn abner budlong he exclaimed step aft and kiss the bride  when this command had been obeyed with urbane alacrity sam called out again very much as if he were piping all hands to osculation revÂ mrÂ rippledean step aft and kiss the bride  when the minister had retired from the performance of his duty sam cast a speaking glance in the direction of miss denby he looked as if he would say that on this occasion it was a great pity that any one should be left out the girl of the buggy understood his glance and lifted up her voice in laughter  oh no mrÂ twitty said she it is not the custom to kiss witnesses  oh no answered mrsÂ twitty in tones of approbation and these were the first words she spoke after she had ceased to be sickles  as that boat of blissfulness sped across the bay speeding along under a strong breeze from the west under a sky full of orangecolored clouds sam twittys strong hand grasped the tiller with an energy which would have been sufficient for the guidance of a ship of the line as the thin sheets of water curled over the lee scuppers of the boat the right hand which held sams left never trembled nor tightened its hold and when the clergyman sitting by miss denby asked her if she felt at all afraid she cheerily replied  not with the gilded idol and the king conchshell both on boardno not i                                                the honeymoon of mr and mrsÂ twitty was spent in thompsontown and lasted three days for at the end of that time the brides brother demanded to be released from the care of the tollgate having other duties which were incumbent upon him but when sam and his wife spoke of leaving the spinnaker boom captain abner was perfectly willing to go with them his face bore an expression of contented resignation  i will drive you two back sam said he taint no more use for me to stay here i dont believe ill find her and i give it up  on the way home the happy mrÂ twitty burst out laughing it do seem awful comical capn abner said he that after all we said about comin home that me and her should be asettin on the back seat and you adrivin in front alone and when this remark was explained to mrsÂ twitty she laughed very heartily indeed  sam did not go directly back to shamrick his wife had a good house and could not without due notice give up her public office and so he determined to remain for the present in the very pleasant quarters thus afforded him but he vowed with considerable vehemence that mrsÂ twitty should keep the tollgate no more this duty so long as it had to be performed he would take upon himself and he found it a most congenial and interesting occupation  like it he exclaimed to his wife after his first days experience its as interestin as readin the weekly paper everybody that comes along seems ready for some different kind of chat and when that young woman with the buggy happens to be drivin this way she dont pay no toll ill pay for her myself every time on account of her services as witness  no you dont sam twitty remarked his consort that young woman pays her own toll every time while im here i dont want no changes in the customs of this tollgate                                                it was about a fortnight after sam twittys wedding that that wellsatisfied individual being called to the gate by the sound of wheels beheld a buggy and miss denby sitting therein in answer to sams cheerful greeting she did not laugh nor even smile  i saw your friend captain abner about a week ago she said as i drove through shamrick and he looked dreadfully solemn i think his disappointment is wearing on him it is a great pity that a man who can sail a boat as he can should have a moments sorrow on this earth it almost made me feel sorry he found out i wanted to learn to steer i think that was the only barrier between us and he would have taken me out sailing every fine day  oh no no said sam that would never have done you could never have kept your hands off the tiller if he had known what was good for him he would have married her these words he spoke in a confidential tone and pointed with his thumb behind him but he had the chance and he didnt take it and now i dont wonder hes doleful  you ought to go and try to cheer him up said miss denby gathering up the reins do you expect to go on keeping this tollgate mrÂ twitty  id like to said sam if youre goin to keep on travellin this way  oh said miss denby with a reproving smile  yes indeed said sam for it reminds me of such a happy day  oh said miss denby as she drove away with her nose in the air  a few days after this sam did go to shamrick and walking on the street he met captain abner but to his surprise that individual did not look at all doleful there was a halfsmile on his lips and his step was buoyant the two old friends clasped hands with much heartiness  you are as gay as a pot of red paint said sam you must be feelin well  i should say so said abner and then after a portentous pause he added ive got her  got her exclaimed sam in amazement where did you get her  got her here  and who is it youve got  susan shellbark  susan shellbark cried sam you dont mean to say that  its susan shellbark and i do mean to say that  why youve known her all your life said sam  all my life was the answer  then why didnt you take her afore asked his friend  because i hadnt been to thompsontown to see what i could get there of course i didnt want to take anybody here until i found out what there was in thompsontown now i know there aint nothin for me there  and so you take susan shellbark interrupted sam  and so i take susan shellbark  sam looked at his friend for a moment and then burst out laughing give me your hand he cried im mighty glad youve got susan shellbark and im mighty glad you went to thompsontown  so am i said captain abner if i hadnt gone to thompsontown id never have got susan shellbark  thats so cried sam and if you hadnt made up your mind to go to thompsontown you and med never got stuck at the tollgate with nothin but a fivedollar note im mighty glad we was stuck capn abner im mighty glad we was stuck  thereupon the two friends shook hands again  but there is one thing i want to ask said sam what about the gilded idol and the king conchshell  oh thats all right said captain abner theyre both to go on to the mantelpiece one on one end and tother on the other thats to be the way with everything weve got youve knowed susan shellbark as long as i have sam and you know shell stick to that bargain  thats so said sam shell stick to that bargain both of youll be on the mantelpiece one on one end and the other on tother  and what became of the girl in the buggy asked the mistress of the house  her later history is unknown to me said the master of the house  i have not made up my mind about that story papa said the daughter of the house it is not altogether satisfactory  but very much what usually happens said john gayther in an undertone                            this story is told by                             the frenchman                             and is called                            my balloon hunt     vi  my balloon hunt   the next morning after breakfast the mistress of the house and john gayther were walking through the garden together for her quick eye had detected much that needed attention some things she had already decided upon but there were others in which she thought it best to ask johns advice they did not always agree in fact they were seldom in exact accord but both were sensible and he reasoned that as mistress she ought to do as she pleased and she reasoned that as he had learned the business and she had not it was just to him and to herself that he should on many points be allowed his own way  the orchard was really a continuation of the lower terrace of the garden but the mistress had not been there for some time a great many pears john she commented as they strolled under the trees a fair show of apples but there are no plums at all  plums have their seasons said john sententiously they are not always falling in ones way and these are choice plums and dont come promiscuoussorter scattered like  i wonder if john means that for philosophy thought the mistress then aloud my daughter brought me a luscious one yesterday and really it looks as if she had gathered the only one  bless her heart said john fervently i hope shes goin to pick them up all along the way she goes  that is too much to hope for any one john said the mistress as they turned to go up into the garden but in her heart she had the very same hope  they walked through two terraces filled with luxuriant vegetables and bordered by small fruits now out of season then on to the third terrace bordered by currantbushes beautiful now to look upon hung as they were with a profusion of red tassels and here there came to them an almost overpowering fragrance for on the terrace above were great beds of lilies now in their glorylilies from many climes lilies of many hues great white spikes small pink clusters spotted striped variegated white with borders of all colors even black or purple so dark it looked black all standing proudly in the sunshine and sending to heaven their incense of gratitude  it was a gorgeous sight and the two looked at it with delight and a good deal of pride for it was the design and the handiwork of both  then they saw behind all this glory a group of people disposed in various comfortable positions about the little summerhouse on the upper terrace where the view was finest  there was the master of the house in the big gardenchair there was the frenchman seated on a low grassy knoll there was the daughter of the house on the bench she liked and beside her was the next neighbor who was an intimate friend of the daughter of the house and therefore a frequent visitor the nearest house was not in sight but it could be reached in a moderate walk its mistress was a young married woman very pretty to look at and of a lively turn of mind she waved her hand to the mistress while the master called out come up here you two we are waiting for you when the two complied with the command the master continued now make yourselves comfortable and listen to a story our guest has promised us  the mistress of the house willingly took the rustic chair the frenchman brought forward but john gayther had no wish to hear the frenchmans story he had no fancy for the man and he did not believe he would fancy his story excuse me he said to the master of the house but i see that boy jacob coming through the gate and i must go with him to weed the melonbed  you will do nothing of the kind said the master of the house let the boy weed it alone  never cried john in horror he will trample on all the vines  then tell him to do something else and without waiting for john to give the order he called out ahoy there boy clear out of this garden  the boy vanished with celerity and john gayther sank upon his stool with an air of resignation but no sooner had the frenchman uttered a few sentences than he brightened up and not only listened attentively but put aside the disagreeable feeling he had had for him the beginning of the narrative lifted a load from his mind  the frenchman having again betaken himself to the grassy mound began in an easy airy way  i am a sportsman as well as a frenchman it seems hardly necessary to mention both of these things at once for in my mind they naturally go together i am expert in many kinds of sports and it pleases me much when engaged in such recreations to employ my mind as well as my body and in so doing i frequently devise methods of pursuing my favorite sports which are never made use of by ordinary and unimaginative persons  my ireneshe is my wifeis also addicted to sport it was partly for this reason that i married her it is not always by sharing my dangers and my glories that my dear irene shows her passion for the outdoor sports which are so fascinating to me it is often that she does this merely by sympathy she can remain at home and think of me in the field or on the stream and be happy when i return she welcomes she appreciates if i overstay my time i do not give myself worryi know that she will understand that there are contingencies when she greets me there are no reproaches she is the wife for a sportsman  but it is not always that i rely simply upon the sympathy of my irene it was not so when i went in a balloon to hunt tigers she was then at my side for there was no other place where she would have been satisfied or where i would have had her there are vicissitudes which should be faced together by those who love  i had long wished to hunt tigers and it had come into my head that it would be a grand and novel idea and also extremely practicable to shoot at these savage creatures from a balloon this would be an exhilarating sensation and it would be safe in no other way would i take my irene with me when tigerhunting and in no other way i freely admit would i be very desirous of going myself  i have heard that one of my countrymen had himself shut up in a stout cage and conveyed to a region infested by tigers there with his rifle he sat comfortably in a chair with a lantern on a table near by when at night the tigers crowded round his cage he shot them but this would not have suited me suppose a bar of the cage should have been broken  but in a balloon it would be different poised in the air a moderate distance above the ground i could shoot at tigers beneath me and laugh at their efforts to reach my height therefore it was that i determined to hunt my tigers in a balloon irene screamed when i mentioned this plan but she did not refuse to go with me she had been in balloons but she had never seen an unrestricted tiger now she could enjoy these two pleasures at once and be with me  this happened in french tonkin we were in a little outlying town where there was a garrison and some engineers who made military observations in a balloon this was a captive balloon not employed for independent ascensions and from some of the officers who were my friends i procured it for my projected tiger hunt they were all much interested in my expedition for if it succeeded there would be a new variety of sport in this monotonous region  the balloon was supplied with gas sufficient to carry myself and my irene with rifles provisions and various necessities and its lifting power was so proportioned to the weight it carried as to keep it at the height of an ordinary church steeple above the earth  about ten miles from the town there was a long stretch of desert and barren land extending for about a quarter of a mile from a jungle and forest to a river and here i was told tigers were often to be found sometimes crossing the open country to slake their thirst at the stream but more frequently to prevent antelopes and other tender animals from slaking their thirst there could be no better spot than this for my experiment  our journey to the huntingground was most delightful seating ourselves in the commodious car which hung beneath the balloon we rose to the height of the rope which restrained its ascent the lower end of this rope was then seized by natives active and strong who ran along pulling the balloon above them it was the most comfortable method of progression that i had ever known there were no jars scarcely any sense of motion the great overhanging balloon sheltered us from the sun we leaned over the side of the car surveyed the landscape and breathed the fresh morning air then we breakfasted and smoked our cigarettes i was happy my irene was happy we could have journeyed thus for days  but when we came to the appointed place we prepared for business we had with us a machine for anchoring the balloon and the natives immediately went to work to drive this deeply into the soil about halfway between the water and the jungle so that we might be moored at a proper distance above the ground there was no wind the balloon hung almost motionless it had been arranged that when it should be properly attached the natives should leave us and return in the evening to pull us back to the town and to carry away the skins of the tigers we had killed  it was truly luxurious hunting the rifle of my irene was light and suitable for a lady mine was of the most improved pattern we had another one in case of emergencies we sat and looked down upon the men urging them to hasten their work and be gone we were longing for our sport  suddenly there was a cry from one of the natives gazing toward the jungle he yelled a tiger a tiger instantly our hearts stopped beating and our eyes were turned toward the jungle there against the matted leaves and stalks was a mass of yellow and blackhalf a tiger in the bright sunlight we could see it plainly it had been roused by the noise of the pounding and was gazing out to see what was the matter with one united scream the natives shot away they scattered they disappeared utterly and at once where they went i know not we never saw them again we did not even think of them our eyes were set fast upon the black and yellow stripes and the great head without volition i grasped my rifle irene put her hand upon her weapon but i whispered to her not to move  the tiger came slowly out of the jungle so that we could see him clearly then he walked toward us i clutched my rifle still more tightly  suddenly irene whispered to me we are not fastened those men did not attach the rope and we may drift away from him perhaps across the river and so lose him is it too far for a shot  entirely entirely i answered we must wait and if we do drift across the river we may find some other game there be quiet  so we both were quiet but the balloon did not drift there was no wind  the tiger moved gently toward us it was dreadful to remain thus motionless and see him come on he had paid no attention to the escaping natives he was giving his mind entirely to our balloon he looked up at us and he looked down at the end of the rope a yard or two of which was moving about like a snake as the balloon veered a little this way and that  this seemed to interest the tiger he stopped for a few moments and looked at it he was now near enough for us to observe him closely we did so with breathless interest he was a long tiger and very thin his flabby flanks seemed to indicate that he was hungry suddenly he gave a quick bound he ceased to regard the balloon his eyes were fixed upon the end of the rope with great leaps he reached it he arched his back and looked at it as it moved then he put one paw upon it we leaned over the edge of the car and watched him  the rope was so attached that by putting out her arm irene could reach it she seized it and made the lower end of it move more quickly on the ground the tiger gave a jump with his eyes on the rope then he leaped forward and over and over again he put his foot upon it and quickly jerked it away  what are you doing i whispered are you mad you may enrage him do not touch the rope do not touch it again oh the recklessness the unthinking playfulness of woman how can we guard against it how can we be safe from it  the rope was now still for a moment it ceased to interest the tiger and he looked upward suddenly an idea came into his head he seized the rope in his great jaws and gave a powerful jump backward oh what a jerk what a shock it was worse than an earthquake it was like a great throb from the heart of the tiger to the heart of the man i must have turned pale did he intend to haul us down this fearsome thought vented itself in smothered ejaculations and irene turned to me and spoke in her usual voice  he cannot do that for it is impossible for him to haul us down hand over hand or paw over paw he is only playing the rope amuses him and we need not speak in whispers even if he hears us he cannot understand us is it not time to shoot  she is so precipitate my irene i love her but she lacks that prudent hesitancy which so often gives a man his power over circumstances  still i considered the case if i were going to shoot at all this was surely a good time everything had come so suddenly that i had not had time to collect myself to prepare for action  i looked steadfastly down at the beast and so did my irene i was becoming calmer he looked up at us with an air of concentration he paid no more attention to the rope  i lifted my rifle i scrutinized its every portion it was in order then i leaned over the edge of the car and pointed it downward i aimed it between his great earnest eyes into the very middle of his thoughtful and observant countenance i pulled the trigger the explosion shook the car  up from the ground there came a sudden startling roar at first i could not see the tiger but when the smoke moved away i found myself gazing down into his savage blazing eyes roar after roar came up he sprang from side to side his tail stiffened and curled and when he opened his vast mouth showing the cavern of his throat his red tongue and his long white teeth a shiver ran through me instinctively i grasped my irene by the arm  i do not believe you hit him said she see how he bounds he cannot be hurt it must be difficult to aim directly downward but let me try  i did not forbid her even by chance she might strike that awful beast in some vital part she took a long deliberate aim and as she fired the tiger gave a veritable scream  ah ha i cried you hit him truly my irene you hit him  but it was only in the toe she said see how he has stopped to lick it with his tongue i think it is his littlest toe it is not much  large toe or small one that tiger was now an angry beast hopping backward a little way he now crouched to the ground and then gave a wild spring upward it was heartsickening as his great form with its yellow skin and black stripes his blazing eyes his flashing teeth and his outspread claws rose toward us through the air of course he could not hurt us we were too high up irenes face flushed that was a great leap she said  i took up my rifle again it comforted me to see what a small jump the beast had made compared to our distance from the ground again i fired and this time also i did not hit him i had never practised shooting at things almost beneath me the slightest motion of irene disturbed my aim the report seemed to infuriate the tiger until he was on the verge of madness he jumped from side to side he roared he gnashed his teeth and it seemed to me that i could smell his horrid breath coming up toward us  suddenly he ceased all motion he crouched upon the ground he made no sound he shut his mouth he partly shut his eyes but they were fixed upon me immovably and they were green as emerald  now said irene is a good time to take another shot shall i try  i raised my hand that she might not move there was a change coming over the sun at first i thought my sight was affected and i did not see well but it was not that instinctively i gazed upward a wandering cloud was slowly moving under the sun then i looked down the tigers yellow was not so bright his black stripes were not so clear and sharpcut and more than that he was coming nearer the balloon was slowly descending the truth flashed upon me deprived of the direct rays of the sun the gas was condensing we were going down down slowly but surely down  a chill ran through me an awful premonitory chill i knew what to do but there was little i could do we carried no ballast for this was a captive balloon what could i throw out the extra rifle out it went and fell not far from the tiger but he did not move with his green eyes fixed upon the car he watched it slowly descend the rifle had relieved it of a little of its weight but the middle of the cloud was thicker than its edge the gas was still condensing the balloon was slowly descending i became almost frantic if my irene had been any one else i believe i would have thrown her out but i could not throw out my irene besides she was so vigorous  it was awful this steady this merciless descent it was like entering a tomb with a red tongue and flashing teeth waiting within the green eyes gleamed with the malice of a waiting devil biding his time and knowing that it was drawing near  down down we went and the smell of his horrid breath came up like the forerunner of a cruel death now a tremor ran through the whole body of the crouching beast even his tail trembled like a feather in the wind he seemed to press himself nearer and nearer to the earth his eyes were fixed steadily upon the car  i knew what this meant he was about to spring the moment that we should descend sufficiently low he would hurl himself into the car he would not wait for it to touch the ground  my thoughts raced through my brain if anything could be done it must be done in the next halfminute i spoke quickly to irene  do not lose a second i said get out on the outside of the car rest lightly upon its edge hold by the ropes i will do the same at the moment i give the word you must jump both together do not hesitate it will not be much of a fall we cannot stay here and have him  at this instant the tiger gave a tremendous bound upward his fore paws bristling with claws stretched over the edge of the car in that instant i jumped  it was a great leap and as my feet struck the ground and my eyes glanced rapidly about me a feeling of great joy filled my breast i was on the earth again master of myself and the tiger was not there i looked upward the great beast was drawing up his hind legs and was climbing into the car and there was irene my irene outside of the car sitting on the edge and holding on to the ropes i had forgotten to give her the word how my heart sank it was terrible  i now perceived something that almost paralyzed my every faculty that balloon was rising i was a large man and i was heavier than the tiger with its reduced weight the balloon was slowly going upward i clasped my hands i gasped for breath if i should call to irene to jump now she would be dashed to pieces the car was already so high and then the great truth flashed upon me what matters it if she leaps she will be killed if she does not leap i could not think of it  to be sure i might seize the rope and pull her down low enough so that she might safely drop but if i did that the tiger might also jump oh what a position to be in for one who loves  it was now absolutely impossible for either of them safely to leap from the car unless i pulled it down and my mind was not capable of even considering such an alternative to meet him here upon the ground in this awful solitude to die together but not in each others arms to perish from this bright earth to reach out to my irene to call to her as she reached out and called to me when the terrible monster it was too much  but even in my despair i remembered to be humane i seized the end of the rope i would not let my irene float away altogether i could not the soul of the husband asserted itself the cloud had now passed from the face of the sun the balloon was rising with considerable force but i could hold it i was very heavy i would not desert my irene  as i stood thus looking upward and holding fast to all that was dear to me in life i saw irene still sitting on the edge of the car raise one hand and put it to her head i could see that she was feeling faint the strain of her position was beginning to tell upon her at any moment she might fall then my quick glance sought the tiger he was in the car his great head and two front paws hanging over the edge his green eyes were steadily fixed on me just then irene evidently unable to hold any longer to the ropes gave herself a dexterous twist and in an instant she was inside the car her head sinking down out of sight oh noble most beloved irene sooner than let herself drop and fall at my feet a mangled corpse she would do anything she well understood my too sensitive soul this dear irene  in spite of my emotion i still held firmly to the rope and the tiger still glared down upon me it was too far for him to jump he knew that if he did he would be dashed to pieces this gave me strength and courage  irene now raised herself and looked over the edge of the car the tiger by her side did not regard her i have often read of wild animals of different kinds and degrees of fierceness who having fallen into a pit together did not attack each other but remained as gentle as sheep being cowed by their fear plainly this tiger was cowed he had never been so far above the earth he knew that he would die if he leaped but he kept his sinister green eyes steadily fixed on me  illustration the great beast was drawing up his hind legs and was climbing into the car  now irene called down to me i could not hear what she said i was in such terrible agitation and besides i think she was afraid to speak too loudly for fear she might startle the blackandyellow beast how i longed to hear her dear words perhaps her last mayhap she was bidding me a fond farewell perhaps she was trying to encourage me and uphold my heart in this terrible trial it would be like her she knows my love for her my dear irene  and then ah yes it might be that she was asking my permission to throw herself from the car that she was beseeching me to turn away my head that she might leap to the ground and thus end her anxieties and her miseriesi might say our miseries for if the tiger should follow her he too would be killed i should be left to weep over my dearest the joy of my life and my heart the tiger would be dead in her last breath irene would know that i was safe that would be like irene my dear irene but i would not suffer it i could not speak but i shook my head  she did not try to say anything more but she looked down upon me and so did the tiger the two heads were not far from each other they were both regarding me i grew almost crazy never was man placed in more terrible straits than this  suddenly a thought struck me i seized more tightly the end of the rope and i ran i ran to the river i plunged i bounded i made such great haste that sometimes i stumbled over obstacles and sometimes the balloon seemed to lift me from the ground but on on i went on to the river  when i reached the edge of the water i took courage to stop and look up they were both still gazing over the edge of the car both with their eyes strained upon me  then boldly and fearlessly i walked into the river i walked until the water was up to my knees until it reached my waist i walked until the surface of the water lapped my shoulders i was not afraid i am a good swimmer irene now called down to me it was plain she was becoming reckless she would know what i was going to do no matter what effect her words would have upon the tiger if she thought i was about to commit suicide not daring to bear up under her coming fate she would dissuade me it would be like her that dear irene  what are you going to do she cried and as i looked upward her eyes and those of the tiger were steadily fixed on me  you must get on the outside of the car again i cried do it quickly without disturbing him then i will pull you down down a little at a time when you are far enough downand i will be the judge of thati will give you the word then you must jump it will not hurt you the water will break your fall and i will save you think of nothing else but your trust in me and jump the moment you leave the car i let go the rope then it will instantly be too far for him to jump quick be ready when i give the word and as i spoke i hauled steadily upon the rope  irene looked at me for an instant and then she stood up in the car i saw her put one foot upon the seat which surrounds it then quickly appeared the other foot upon the edge of the car she raised both arms and joined her hands above her head she pushed herself between the ropes and leaped it was all the work of a second  she came down beautifully head foremost it was a splendid dive relieved of her weight the balloon gave a great jerk and i let go the rope  irene went down into the water as cleanly and smoothly as if she had been a diving duck she scarcely made a splash she was a magnificent swimmer  as my dear irene disappeared beneath the surface of the water i made use of the rapid moments in which i could not expect to see her in glancing upward the tiger was rising rapidly his head was stretched out over the edge of the car i could see his wild and frightened eyes he was afraid to jump  then i turned to the water the head of irene had risen above it she was striking out bravely for the shore she did not need my help she is a grand woman in a few moments we stood beside each other on the shore i would have thrown myself into her arms i would have embraced this dear one now my own again but she was so wet i was so wet we seized each other by the hands it is impossible to say whether she wept or not her face was so wet  then by a sudden instinct we looked upward the balloon was high above us rising steadily we could see the head of the tiger projecting from the carnow such a little head but i knew that he was gazing at me then we heard a sound which came down from above it was the tigers roar but it was such a little roar i clasped more tightly the hand of my irene we did not speak but gazed steadily upward at the balloon which had reached a current of air which was carrying it across the country the sun was now very hot the gas was expanding the balloon was rising higher and higher and higher  we stood holding each others hands and gazing at last there was but a little black spot in the sky then it faded and shivered and was gone side by side we moved away we were very wet but the sun was hot  suddenly i spoke i could not restrain my burning desire to look deep into the soul of irene i owed it to my love of her to know the extent of her love for me those words which she called down from the car which might have been her last words on earth what were they i asked her  i said she answered that if you would pick up that rifle you threw out and stand ready i would jerk open the safetyvalve i would then take up my rifle and when the car came down we would both shoot him but you shook your head and i said no more  i did not answer but in my heart i said o woman what art thou and of what strange feelings art thou made thou hast the beauty of the flower and the intellect of the leaf to let that awful blackandyellow fiend descend to the earth to call up to a cruel death and ask it to come downstairs and meet you on the lowest step skies how can the mind of man conceive of it  and leaving the shores of the river we toiled homeward over the dreary wastes  the company were all much interested in this narrativealmost painfully interested they said as much to the frenchman and he was pleased at the impression he had felt sure he would make and which he always did make when he told that story they talked of hunts and wild beasts but there were no comments upon the story itself each one had his or her own thought however the master of the house thought what a clever woman the mistress of the house thought just like a frenchman the next neighbor wished she had been in the balloon to pitch the tiger on him the daughter of the house was fascinated at the idea of the vicinity of the beautiful ferocious tiger and john gayther thought as he looked wistfully at the daughter of the house i am glad he has a wife                            this story is told by                           pomona and jonas                             and is called                      the foreign prince and the                          hermits daughter     vii  the foreign prince and the hermits daughter   the frenchman went away and after him there was a succession of visitors to the house who were not interested in gardens and were therefore not introduced within the sacred precincts of the summerhouse on the upper terrace the young people took a fancy to a pretty rustic arbor in a secluded spot but whether it was because they especially admired that part of the garden did not transpire  but the guests left one after another and finally there came to visit the family euphemia and her husband they were old and intimate friends of the family and the very morning after their arrival they all repaired to the summerhouse which overlooked the garden there was some conversation about the gardenits beautiful things and its useful products and its antiquityfor euphemia loved the old garden and its traditions  the two gentlemen provided with comfortable chairs smoked their cigars in peacefulness and content and the daughter of the house seemed absorbed in some fancy work but after some time the master of the house turning suddenly to euphemias husband asked what has become of jonas and pomona  here they are to answer for themselves cried the daughter of the house springing up as john gayther ushered into the garden the next neighbor followed by pomona and jonas the next neighbor was also on intimate terms with euphemia and her husband and a devoted and rapturous admirer of pomona the couple had descended upon her the night before in a most unexpected fashion but she gave them a hearty welcome and rejoiced in them even after she discovered that she owed the visit to a desire on the part of her guests to see euphemias husband they knew where he was visiting but had thought it wiser to go to the next neighbor to pay their little visit and so the explanation of this apparently strange meeting of so many old friends was simple enough  chairs and benches were found and john gayther brought his stool unasked and joined the party he had no idea of missing that conversation  it was soon evident that while jonas was as tranquil as usual pomona had something on her mindthat she had come with a purpose and as soon as the inquiries and explanations were over she addressed the husband of euphemia with great earnestness  jone and me came to see you sir about something particular and as we are all friends here i may as well say it right out  the more you say the better we shall be pleased the master of the house exclaimed  pomona nodded to him but turned again to the husband of euphemia  weve been told sir that some editors have been asking you to get us to enter fiction again and what we want to say is that we dont want to enter it no more what we did when we was in it was all very well but thats past and gone although ive said to jone a good many more times than once that if i had to do this or that thing now thats set down in the book id do it different but then he always answers that if id done that id have spoiled the story and so there was no more to say on that subject what weve done we gladly did and were more than glad we did it for you sir but as for doing it again we cant do it for it aint in us even if we tried to do the best we could for you all youd get would be something like skimmilkgood enough for cottage cheese and bonnyclabber but nothing like good fresh milk with the cream on it  i think you are perfectly right said euphemia if you dont want to go into fiction again you ought not to be made to do it  i would not do such a wicked thing as to put anybody in fiction who did not want to go there gravely replied the husband of euphemia  at these words the load that was on pomonas mind dropped from it entirely  now sir said she weve got another thing to say and it will seem queer to you after what weve said already we do want to go into fiction but not the way we was in it before the fact is that between us weve written a story and weve brought it with us hoping you wouldnt mind letting jone read it to you of course we was expecting to read it to only two but as weve got to go back today if the rest of the folks dont mind jone can read it anyway  i should like it above all things exclaimed the next neighbor  we will not let you go away until it is read said the mistress of the house  oh i do want to hear it cried the daughter of the house  of course jonas must read it was euphemias quiet comment  heave ahead called out the master of the house  pomona smiled gratefully it isnt a very long story but weve been a long time working at it and we wouldnt think of such a thing as calling it finished until our friends has heard it  the quiet and goodnatured jonas now drew a manuscript from his pocket and began  the name of my story said he is the foreign prince and the hermits daughter  we thought of a good many other names for it said pomona and i wanted to call it the groundless prince but jone he said that groundless applies to things there is no reason for and as so many princes are of that kind somebodys feelings might be hurt and so i gave in  now this is the way the story begins said jonas in that period of time which is not modern and yet is not too far back and in which a great many outoftheway things have happened a certain young prince went travelling in foreign parts of the world with the general purpose of broadening his mind he wanted to study the manners and customs of other nations in order that he might better know how to govern his own people  but when after several years absence he came back to the place of his nativity he found that neighboring nations had made war upon his countrythat they had conquered his army and subjugated his people and had partitioned his principality among themselves consequently he found himself in a strange position he had gone forth to visit foreign lands and now he returned to find himself a foreigner on the very spot where he was born in fact his nationality had been swept away his country had disappeared  but he was still a prince nothing could deprive him of his noble birth but to all the world save to one person he was an alien prince and must always so continue the exception was a single adherent who had followed him when he began his travels and whose loyal spirit would not suffer him to leave his master now  slowly with crossed arms and head bent low the prince strode away from the place that had once been his home his single adherent following his footsteps  after a long days journey they came to a little valley chiefly remarkable for streams and rocks here at the entrance of a commodious cave he beheld an elderly hermit seated upon a stone calmly surveying the sunset sky the hermit looked up with a pleasant smile for it had been long since a traveller had passed that way and perceiving that the stranger was not only wellbred but tired invited him to take a seat upon a stone near by his own at the same time motioning the adherent to a smaller stone at a little distance  in reply to the numerous questions of the hermit the prince soon told his story  well well exclaimed the hermit then you are the prince ferrando i might have known it for you so closely resemble your father  you knew him then inquired the prince  i have often seen him the hermit replied the likeness is wonderful and so you have come back to find that your principality does not exist it is a strange condition of things but believe mei mingled a great deal with the world before i came to this cave and i know what i am talking aboutwhen i tell you that there are many potentates who would be glad to come back from a journey and to find that their dominions had ceased to exist and that with them had disappeared all the trials responsibilities and dangers of sovereignty  but i am not that sort of person said ferrando i do not allow care to oppress me i do not shrink from responsibility i am not afraid of danger i travelled far to broaden my mind i came back prepared to reign wisely over my subjects but i have no subjects and therefore i cannot exercise that enlightened rule for which i have with so much toil and study prepared myself wherever i go i must always be an absolute alien and as such i must try to learn to consider myself  cheer up my friend said the hermit you are too young to give up things in that way and now allow me sir to introduce you to my daughter  ferrando sprang up quickly and beheld standing near him a very handsome young woman carrying a large basket filled with watercress the prince bowed low it is very unusual i think said he for a hermit to have a daughter  the hermit smiled yes said he it is rather out of the common but when i came here to seek rest and peace within these rocky walls my daughter could not be dissuaded from accompanying me  it is plain that she possesses a noble soul said the prince again bowing low  i wonder if he ever thinks that of me the single adherent asked himself as he stood respectfully by his low stone  when the hermits daughter had been made aware of ferrandos former station and his misfortunes she went away to prepare supper the meal was soon ready and consisted of cress fresh from the spring fried cress and toasted cress with cress tea and also freshly drawn water from a spring  poor young man exclaimed the next neighbor so tired and hungry was that all they had to give him  of course explained pomona hermits never eat anything but watercress  after supper continued jonas the hermit filled a pipe with dried watercress and offered another to his guest and the three sat at the entrance of the cave and discussed the princes affairs in which the hermit and his daughter seemed to take a lively interest at a little distance on the small stone sat the single adherent also smoking a pipe of watercress and his inability to enjoy this novel sensation was plainly evident in the radiant beams of the full moon in the course of an hour the prince and his adherent retired to a guestcave near by but the hermit and his daughter sat up far into the night discussing the prince and the peculiar circumstances in which he found himself  the next morning after breakfast the principal dish of which was a salmi of watercress the hermit his daughter and their guest held council together while the adherent stood at a respectful distance and listened with earnest attention to all that was said  my daughter and i said the hermit agree that it is a lamentable thing that a prince such as yourself so eminently qualified to rule should have no opportunity to exercise his abilities for sovereignty therefore we think the best thing you can do is to rent a principality for a term of years in some ways this would be better than inheriting one for if you do not like it you can give it up at the end of the term  but where could i find a principality to let exclaimed the prince i never heard of anything like that  very likely said the hermit but if you were to look around i think you might find something to suit you which the reigning potentate might be willing to lease  i am of my fathers opinion said the hermits daughter and if you will take my advice you will investigate the country north of this valley there are several principalities in that direction and it would not at all surprise me if before the end of a days journey you were to find something that could be rented  the prince was very much pleased with the interest taken in his affairs by the hermit and his daughter and he decided to follow their advice as he and his single adherent were about to depart the hermit said to him i shall be very glad to hear from you and if you should succeed in renting a principality i will willingly give you any advice and assistance in my power when i mingled with the general world i saw a great deal of governing and all that sort of thing and it may be i can give you some points which will be of advantage to you  the prince accepted with thankfulness the kind offer of his host and when he approached the daughter to take leave of her she graciously stuck a sprig of watercress in his buttonhole  after walking a few miles the prince and his adherent stopped at a roadside inn where they ate an abnormal breakfast and then with invigorated bodies they continued their journey  late in the afternoon the prince became a little tired and suggested that they stop at a farmhouse which stood near the road and sojourn there for the night the adherent however was of the opinion that they should go on until they reached the crest of a hill before them they would then be able to survey the country he placed a high opinion on the statement of the hermits daughter that they would be likely to find what they wanted before nightfall  when they reached the crest of the hill they were delighted to see before them at no great distance a small city when they had approached it nearer they perceived by the side of the great gate a signboard which bore the inscription                    principality to letfurnished                   apply to dowager at the palace  the single adherent nodded his head as he said to himself this is just about what i expected  that hermits daughter said the prince is a remarkable young woman and her suppositions should not be disregarded  after passing the night at an inn near the gate the prince and his single adherent repaired to the palace to make inquiries regarding the principality  the dowager was a middleaged woman dressed in rusty black with a quick eye and an eager expression having demanded references of ferrando she declared herself perfectly satisfied with his statements for she had met his father and the likeness was unmistakable she told him she would be very much pleased to have him for a tenant and that she was quite sure the principality would suit him exactly she then showed him all over the palace the adherent following and taking notice of everything  the furniture and appointments of the princely mansion were somewhat timeworn and shabby and the dowager noticing the scrutinizing glances of the adherent thought it wise to state that during the life of her late husband everything in the palace had been kept in the most admirable order but of course it could not be supposed that she by herself could go to the expense of new carpets and furniturecoverings she assured the prince however that a very little expenditure of money would make the palace look as bright and clean as if it had been recently furnished  of course you have an army remarked the prince  oh yes said the dowager an excellent armythat is considering the size of my principality the infantry is very good indeed in fact i heard my late husband say on an occasion when the infantry corps had just been furnished with new uniforms that he never saw a finerlooking set of men the cavalry is also in excellent condition of course in time of peace it is not necessary to keep these men supplied with horses but in an agricultural country it is not difficult to obtain horses whenever they are really needed  and the artillery inquired the prince  i am sorry to say replied the dowager that the artillery is not yet supplied with cannon it was the intention of my late husband to furnish them with the necessary cannon ammunition horses and all that but he never did so and of course being a woman i could not be expected to attend to such things but i have no doubt whatever that you can easily and inexpensively put this branch of the army on a proper footing that is if you care for artillery  the prince asked no further questions about the army but inquired if the principality was furnished with a navy  oh no said the dowager we have no waterfront and my late husband used often to say that this impossibility of having a navy saved him a great deal of expense to say nothing of the trouble warships might get him into when they are out of sight in distant parts of the world  at this point the dowager was called out by a servant who in a whisper asked her if the visitors were going to stay to dinner the adherent seized this opportunity to say in a low voice  if your royal highness will excuse me i will suggest that you ask if there is a legislative body and a judiciary  the dowager having shaken her head at the servant returned to the prince  have you a legislature asked the prince  certainly she said i cannot say that i think it is a very good one for i have more trouble with it than with anything else in the principality but it has now less than a year to run and my advice would be that you should not convene it again my experience has taught me that one can get along a great deal better without a legislative body than with one for my part i do not approve of them at all  and a judiciary remarked the prince i suppose you have that  the dowager hesitated a moment as if she did not exactly understand but she recovered herself and answered quickly oh yes we have one but i have so little to do with it that for the moment i forgot it it has been a very good one indeed but it has been little used of late and it may be out of order i have found that plain straightforward decrees from the throne are a great deal cheaper and a great deal quicker in their operation than a judicial decision but if you desire a regularly organized judiciary it will not cost you much to establish one if you do not employ your judges by the month or year i find piecework a great deal more satisfactory and you can get so much law for nothing in this country that it is not worth while giving much for it when you have to pay  the countenance of the single adherent had been growing darker and darker and he now stepped up to the prince  your royal highness said he it might be well to speak of the rent  when the prince asked the dowager how much she wanted per year for her principality she did not immediately answer but reflected with her chin in her hand and then turning to the prince she stated the amount  you must understand she added that i would not rent this principality to every one for such a sum as that but as i know you to be a regular prince who will appreciate the advantages and responsibilities of a place like this and as you are unmarried without encumbrances of any sort i presume i would much prefer to let it to you even at a lower price than to rent it to a perfect stranger  when the adherent heard the sum mentioned by the dowager his countenance grew almost black and prince ferrando stood in silent amazement  it would be impossible for me to pay such a sum as that he said at last i have studied political economy and am familiar with the principles of internal revenue and the income to be derived from ordinary taxes and imposts in a principality of this size would not enable me to pay that sum  oh you are very much mistaken cried the dowager of course as a woman i have not been able to make the principality pay me what it ought to but my late husband received a very good revenue from it and i am sure you could do the same if not a great deal better for my late husband was not a good business man he thought too much of other people and not enough of his family  the prince looked at his adherent and the latter shook his head violently  it is impossible said prince ferrando i cannot pay such a sum as that and he rose to go  of course said the dowager hastily if you think that is too much and that you would not be able to pay it i might take off something in your case i would not do this for everybody but as it is you i will take off one per cent of the amount i have named  for a moment ferrando stood undecided he greatly wanted the principality he would be homeless and forlorn without one and yet this dowager was asking him a most outrageous price  i will consider this matter said he and if you will give me the refusal of the principality for twentyfour hours i will see you again tomorrow  the dowager considered this request as favorable to her interests and fearing that she had asked him too little she added of course in case of a reduction like this it must be stipulated in the lease that i reserve some rooms in the palace where i shall board at your expense you cannot expect me to accept a reduced rent and to be turned out of my house besides  the prince bowed and without reply he and his adherent left the palace followed by the eager wistful glances of the dowager when they reached the inn the prince said to his single adherent  i am greatly troubled and i wish i had the advice of that good hermit i will write a letter to him and you shall take it but you must not walk that long distance tomorrow you will hire a vehicle and go to the hermit  the prince wrote his letter and the adherent took it to the hermit the good man and his daughter read it with the greatest interest and retired to the back of the cave to consider it presently the hermit approached the single adherent is there room in your vehicle for three persons said he receiving an affirmative answer he continued then my daughter and i will go back with you we think the prince is in danger of making a very bad bargain and as we know a great deal about these things we believe that our presence and advice will be of great advantage to him  so after the horse had all the watercress it could eat the little party started back to the city  they must have been the first realestate agents remarked the master of the house  pomona was about to reply but jonas gave no time  when the prince heard the sound of the wheels and came down to the door of the inn he was amazed and delighted to see the hermit and his daughter and welcomed them with unusual ardor  of all the people in the world he exclaimed i am most happy to see you i am in great trouble and difficulty and i want your advice and counsel  which is what we came to give you said the good hermit as he warmly pressed the hand of the prince  after supper the prince and his guests retired to an inner room for consultation while the adherent stood in the background after some discussion it was decided that early in the morning the prince should go to the palace and should agree to lease the principality for five years provided the dowager would accept one half the sum she had originally asked and that he should also absolutely refuse to board the dowager or to allow her to reserve any part of the palace for her own use he would promise to pay one quarters rent in advance if these terms were agreed upon on the spot  it was nearly high noon on the following day that the dowager left the palace taking with her all her belongings as she departed she turned and cast a black look at the adherent  it is to his advice she said to herself that i owe this very bad bargain that i have made if that young fellow had been left to himself he would have agreed to everything i demanded  for an hour or two before she left the prince had been wandering around the premises impatiently waiting for her departure as soon as she was gone he called to his adherent and sent him to the inn to summon the hermit and his daughter to his presence he wished to be grateful to these good friends but as he had a respect to appearances he did not desire the dowager to know that these humble persons were to be his first guests in the palace  when the hermit and his daughter arrived at the palace they received a princely welcome and ferrando informed them that he wished them to make him a visit of at least a week  you have been so good to me that i wish to do the best for you and so i have arranged that you shall occupy the state suite in the right wing  we are thankful for this great honor said the hermit but if it would please your royal highness we should prefer the corresponding rooms in the left wing we think they will suit us better  the prince raised his eyebrows in surprise but he gave orders that his guests wishes should be gratified the adherent who was standing in the background raised his eyebrows also but he was not surprised  in about half an hour the hermit and his daughter rejoined the prince in the grand hall to his utter amazement ferrando beheld his guests dressed in rich and handsome garments  did they bring any trunks with them he whispered to his adherent as they approached  no your royal highness was the answer they brought nothing but a basket of watercress which the lady said had been freshly picked and ought not to be wasted  with great dignity the hermit advanced to the prince and by his side walked his daughter who was so beautiful in her silks and laces that the prince found it impossible to remove his eyes from her  in order to explain this change in our appearance said the hermit i will state that the dowager from whom you rented this principality is my brothers widow before he died he arranged that the dowager should reign over the principality as long as she lived and that my daughter should then succeed her at the same time knowing that his wife did not understand the governing of principalities he appointed me assistant prince with a salary this seemed like a very good plan but it did not work the dowager soon showed such a disposition to meddle with everything that was going on that my position gradually became so intolerable that i determined to retire to a hermits cell to which my daughter accompanied me  with his mind scarcely able to grasp the situation the prince gazed from the one to the other of his guests can it be possible he said presently that in renting this principality i have interfered with your prospects  oh not at all not at all replied the hermit in the first place you have given us the great honor of visiting you and of occupying our old suite of apartments i cannot describe to your royal highness the pleasure i felt when i saw my dressinggown hanging on its accustomed hook with my favorite slippers beneath it  i take back my invitation for a week cried the prince now that i know who you are you must stay with me for a long time i wish you could stay always he added his eyes still fixed upon the beautiful young woman then as if to explain this outburst of interest he said you know i rely so much on your advice and counsel and there is no knowing what that dowager may do next  you are right said the exhermit there is no possible way of knowing but a plan has suggested itself to me which i think may relieve you of any possible annoyance or molestation my idea is that you shall marry my daughter then in virtue of your lease you will reign over the principality and she will be your consort after a time when the dowager departs this life my daughter by virtue of inheritance will reign over the principality and you will be her consort thus you see the dowager will have no show at all  the countenance of the prince shone like the sun a heavenborn plan he cried from the moment i saw your daughter with the basket of watercress i loved her by your permission i will embrace her  the permission was given and he embraced her she might have said that from the moment she had understood the peculiar circumstances in which the prince had found himself her heart had gone out to him like a dove seeking the nest of its partner but she did not think it needful to occupy the time with unnecessary statements  your royal highness said the adherent approaching with a bow i think it is only right to inform you that the dowager when she left said to me that she would return early in the afternoon to superintend the removal of her parrots  what cried the prince havent those beastly birds gone yet send them after her without the loss of a minute i dont want to see her back here again  the exhermit who had drawn his daughter aside for a few words of consultation now advanced with uplifted hands nay said he if you will excuse me i think i can suggest a better plan than that the old lady is bound to come back and the sooner she comes and goes the better but we should be prepared for her i suggest that a priest be summoned and that you and my daughter be married immediately our position in the palace will then be assured and the dowager will have nothing to say either about our presence here or about anything else how does my plan suit your royal highness  ferrando did not answer but turning to the adherent he ordered him to summon a priest without delay and to order the assemblage in the great hall of all the courtiers and servants who could be found the adherent sped away on his errand and as he did so he smiled and said to himself she is a better manager than the old woman and her views are broader  when the marriage ceremony had been concluded the prince ordered a sumptuous weddingfeast to be spread but he was soon informed that there was nothing to eat in the house for the dowager had not thought it at all incumbent upon her to provide eatables for her tenant  it matters not cried the exhermit his face glowing with pleasure there will be time enough to provide a good supper and in the meantime what could be more appropriate for a weddingrepast than the basket of cress which my daughter brought with her  a table was spread with a great dish of watercress in the centre and it may be remarked that the prince was so wild with delight that if this had been suddenly changed to one containing fried chicken with cream gravy he would not have perceived the difference  early in the afternoon the dowager returned to the palace to superintend the removal of her parrots as she entered the great hall she perceived the weddingparty waiting to receive her and her amazement was such that her toes turned upward and she sat down with great suddenness in a chair which the adherent thoughtfully placed behind her  how do you do my dear sisterinlaw said the exhermit i do not wonder you are surprised to see us here and in order to relieve your mind i will instantly explain the state of affairs whereupon he explained them  the dowager then found her voice and her strength springing to her feet she cried this is a plot i have been deceived and the lease is void not one of you has any right in this palace and i hereby order you out  the exhermit smiled and drew a paper from his pocket before we obey your orders my dear sisterinlaw he remarked i wish to call your attention to a little business matter you will remember that when i was here with you acting as your assistant you found great difficulty in paying me my salary the first year you told me to take it out of the customs duties the sum i received was not equal to the amount due me but i made no complaint the second year i was obliged to rely on the taxes on internal production but as you required most of the income from this source i found myself very short of money at the end of the year the third year i was obliged to rely upon the taxes on pewrents and that as you are aware yielded me almost nothing after that you paid me no salary at all here is my bill for the money due me but if you cannot conveniently pay me i will agree in the presence of these good friends to postpone the settlement until the next time i lay my eyes upon you if you do not then pay me i shall then levy upon your personal possessions  the dowager glared at the princess ferrando and having shaken her long forefinger at that beautiful young lady she departed and was never seen in the palace again  here jonas folded the paper  is that the end asked the daughter of the house  that is all there is of it said jonas sententiously  i thought said the daughter of the house that the story would tell how he governed his rented principality and if he ever got his own i worked it out in my mind like a flash that he would govern so well that his own people would go to him and beg him to govern them  i think said the next neighbor that if that principality was governed at all it was by that scheming wife  theres two ways of ending a story said pomona one is to wind it up and the other is to let it run down now when a story is running down as if it was a clock its often a good deal longer than you think before it stops so we thought we would wind this one up right there  euphemia laughed but if you wind it up she said you help it to keep on going  for a moment pomona looked embarrassed but she quickly recovered herself i dont mean to wind it up like a clock she said but to wind it up like an oldfashioned clothesline which isnt wanted again until you have some more things to hang on it  the husband of euphemia stated it as his opinion that that was an excellent way to stop a story but euphemia did not agree with him i think she said that a story of that kind ought to end with a moral they nearly always do  pomona now looked at jonas and jonas looked at pomona  several times when we was writing the story said pomona i had a notion that jone was trying to squeeze a moral into it here and there but he didnt say nothing about it and i didnt ask him and if theres anything more to say about it its for him to do it  jonas smiled my opinion about morals to stories is that the people who read them ought to work them out for themselves said he some people work out one kind of moral and others work out another kind it was a pretty big job to write that story which i had to do the most of and i dont think i ought to be called on to put in any moral which is a good deal like being asked to make bread for the man who buys my wheat  pomona looked down at the ground then up to the sky and then she remarked  if you wouldnt mind hearing a little bit of a story id like to tell you one no one had any wish to object and she began once there was a young married man who went to his business in a canoe every morning he paddled himself down to his business and every afternoon he paddled himself back about halfway down the beautiful stream on which he lived there was a little point of rocks projecting out into the water and the young man was obliged to paddle his canoe very near the opposite shore in order to get out of the way this was troublesome and after a while he got tired of it it would be very much pleasanter he thought if he could paddle along the middle of the stream without thinking about the rocks so when one morning he was in a great hurry he said to himself that he would steer his canoe right straight against that point of rocks and break it off after that he would have a clear passage up and down the stream so as soon as he got near enough he carried out his plan that young man did not go to his office that morning and the fragments of his canoe was picked up by a poor family and used for kindlingwood now she added looking deliberately at jonas if you can find a good moral to that story wed be glad to hear it  it was very evident to the listeners that pomona had given a shrewd guess as to the moral of the story jonas had read if indeed he had had in his mind any moral at alland that her own was an offset to it or so intended so the next neighbor came to the rescue  i have a great dislike she announced to morals of all sorts i prefer never to think of morals they are very perplexing and often worse than useless but if there are any morals to those two stories i should say that the first story has something to do with women who manage too much and the second in some occult manner deals with men who try to reform their wives  here every one laughed and then there followed a lively criticism of the story jonas had read but they all agreed that it was worthy of pomona and jonas and should be published when they had reached this conclusion they were summoned to luncheon                            this story is told by                       the daughter of the house                             and is called                         the conscious amanda     viii  the conscious amanda   one morning as john gayther was working in the melonbed the daughter of the house came to him and greeted him with such a glow on her face that john knew she had something pleasant to tell him  yes miss john replied to her greeting it is a beautiful morning and i know of something more beautiful than the morning  i do not see any very great beauty in muskmelons said the daughter of the house demurely  muskmelons are not in my mind at this minute john replied letting the hoe fall upon the ground as he looked at her pretty face all aglow  i have something in my mind johna very original story papa said yesterday i must tell a story and i have one all ready i do not believe you ever heard one like it come to the summerhouse mamma and papa are already there  she tripped away and john followed her stopping on the way to pick up a basket of seedpods he had just established himself on his stool facing the family group and had taken some pods to shell as he listened when his hand was arrested and all the party silenced by a burst of song from the tall lilacbushes near the hedge they could not see the bird but it was evident that he was enjoying his own melody such pure sweet notesnow rippling softly now with a gay little quiver of joy now a tender prolonged note now a succession of trills high and low that set the air throbbing and every now and then a great burst of seraphic music as if his little heart was so full of happiness he was compelled to pour it forth to all who chose to listen our party would gladly have listened for a long time and have omitted the story altogether but after some minutes of delicious song the strains suddenly ceased and a little whirring noise in the lilacs indicated that the bird had flown away  the daughter of the house gave a deep sigh i was afraid to breathe she said lest he might fly away  i have heard nothing like that this summer said the mistress of the house  it is the red thrush said john gayther who had listened rapturously a pair of them were here in the early spring i wonder why this one has come back  perhaps said the daughter of the house it is one of the young ones come back to visit his birthplace i am afraid after that ravishing performance that my story will sound tame enough  it will be a different sort of melody said the mistress of the house looking fondly at her daughter  my heroine began the young lady cannot appear in the first person as if she were telling the story nor in the second person as if she were listening to one nor in the third person as if she were somewhere else for in fact she was not anywhere and as there is no such thing as a fourth person in grammar she cannot be put into any class at all  the captain turned and looked at his daughter there seems to be something very foggy about this statement said he i hope the weather will soon clear up so we can get our bearings  we shall see about that said the young lady this heroine of mine miss amanda never went to sleep to be sure she sank into slumber about as often as most people but when she spoke of having done so she always said she had lost consciousness she was very methodical about going to sleep and waking up and at night just as she was about to lose consciousness she always said to herself seven oclock seven oclock seven oclock over and over again until she was really asleep and in the morning she woke up at seven precisely she was not married and so she was able to live her own life much more independently than if the case had been different she liked to be independent and she liked to know as much as she could about everything in these two things she was generally very successful but you must not think she was prying or too inquisitive she was really a very good woman and very fond of her family which was composed entirely of brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces  she was a very active person but she was not very strong and when she was nearly forty years old something happened to her lungs and her health gave way more and more until at last there was no hope for her and she knew she must die  oh this is an awful way to begin a story said the captain i dont like it you ought not to kill your heroine just as you begin  if you want to make any remarks about this story papa said the daughter of the house which shall be worth anything you ought to wait until you hear more of it and begin to understand it when miss amanda found she had a very little while to live she composed herself comfortably and began to repeat to herself the words fifty years fifty years fifty years over and over again this she did until at last she died and then there was her funeral and she was buried and there was a stone put up over her head with her name on it  john gayther smiled with approbation he felt sure he was going to hear a story to his liking the captain smoked steadily as he had been advised he would wait until he felt firm ground beneath him before he made any further remarks as for the mistress of the house she looked at her daughter and wondered the story continued  all this happened a few years before the middle of a century and a few years before the end of a century miss amanda regained consciousness that is to say she woke up at the end of fifty years exactly as she had been in the habit of waking up at seven oclock in the morning but although she was conscious she did not understand how it was possible she should be so she did not see she did not hear she did not feel she had no body no hands or feet no eyes or ears she had nothing and she knew she had nothing she simply was conscious and that was all there was about it she was not surprised she seemed to take her state and condition as a matter of course and to a certain degree she comprehended it she remembered perfectly well that she had lost consciousness as she was saying fifty years fifty years fifty years over and over again and now she knew that as she had regained consciousness the fifty years must have passed so instead of wondering how things had come to be as they were she or rather her consciousness set itself to work to observe everything around it and about it this had always been miss amandas habit of mind  now i want to explain said the young lady that in one way it will be troublesome for me to express myself exactly as i tell this story of course miss amanda did not exist it was only her consciousness which observed things but i think it will be a great deal less awkward for me if i speak of that consciousness as miss amanda none of us really understands consciousnesses with their outsides all hulled off as john is doing with those seeds which he drops into the basin each one of those little seeds has within it a power which we do not understand and that is the way with miss amandas consciousness  there said the captain i agree with you nobody can object to that  the first thing of which miss amanda became conscious was the smell of sweet peas she had always been very fond of these flowers the air was soft and warm and that too was pleasant to her she observed a good many other things such as trees and grass but she did not know where she was and she did not see anything she could recognize you must not forget that when i say she saw anything i mean she became conscious of it presently however she did perceive something that was familiar and if such a thing had been possible her face would have flushed with pleasure this familiar object was a sundial in the middle of a wide grassmound the sundial was of brass it was very old and some of the figures on the round plate were nearly obliterated by time and weather but miss amanda recognized it it was the same sundial she had always known in the home where she had been born but it was not mounted on a round brick pillar as when she had known it now it rested on a handsome stone pedestal but it was the same sundial she could see the place where the upright part had been mended after her nephew john then only fourteen had thrown a stone at it being jealous of it because it would never do any work in bad weather whereas he had to go to school rain or shine  now thought miss amanda if this is the old sundial and if this is the mound in front of our house although it is so much smaller than i remember it the dear old house must be just behind it but when she became conscious in that direction the dear old house was not there there was a house but it looked new and handsome it had marble steps with railings and a portico but it was another house altogether and everything seemed to be something else except the sundial and even that did not rest on the old brick pillar with projections at the bottom on which she used to stand when she was a little girl in order to see what time it was  now miss amanda felt lonely and a little frightened she had never been accustomed to finding herself in places entirely strange to her she felt too that she was there in that place and could not be anywhere else even if she wanted to and this produced in her a condition which half a century before would have been nervousness but suddenly she perceived something which although strange was very pleasant it was a young girl upon a bicycle coming swiftly toward her over a wide smooth driveway miss amanda had never been conscious of a bicycle and as the girl swept rapidly on it seemed as if she were skimming over the earth without support at the foot of the marble steps the girl stopped and seemed to fall to the ground but she had not fallen she had only stepped lightly from the machine which she leaned against a post and then walked rapidly toward the place where the sweet peas grew  miss amanda greatly admired this girl she was dressed in an extremely pretty fashion with a straw hat and short skirts something like the peasants in southern europe she began to pick the sweetpea blossoms and soon had a large bunch of them now steps were heard coming round the house and the girl turning her head called out oh grandpa wait a minute i am picking these flowers for you from around one end of the house which was a large one miss amanda saw approaching an elderly gentleman who was small with short gray hair and a round ruddy face he walked briskly and with a light switch which he carried in his hand he made strokes at the heads of a few fluffy dandelions which appeared here and there but he never hit any of them  instantly miss amanda knew him it was her nephew johnthe same boy who had broken the sundial no matter what his age might happen to be he had the same bright eyes and the same habit of striking at things without hitting them yes it was john there could be no possible mistake about it it was that harumscarum young scapegrace john if miss amanda had had a heart it would have gone out to that dear old boy if she had had eyes they would have been filled with tears of affection as she gazed on him of all her family he had been most dear to her although as he had often told her there was no one in the world who found so much fault with him  the old gentleman sat down on a rustic seat beneath a walnuttree and his granddaughter came running to him filling the air with the odor of sweet peas she seated herself at the other end of the bench and let the flowers drop into her lap grandpa said she these are for you but i am only going to give you one of them now for your buttonhole the rest i will put in a vase in your study but i wanted you to stop here anyway for i have something to tell you  tell on said he when the girl had put a spray bearing three blossoms into his buttonhole is it anything you want me to do this afternoon  it isnt anything i want you to do ever she said it is about something i must do and it is just this grandpa there are two gentlemen who are about to propose to me and i think they will do it very soon  how in the world do you know that he exclaimed have they sent you printed notices  how is it that anybody knows such a thing she answered we feel it and we cant be expected to explain it you must have felt such things when you were young for i have been told you were often in love  never in my life said her grandfather have i felt that a young woman was about to propose to me  oh nonsense said the girl laughing but you could feel that she would like you to propose to her thats the way it would be in your case  miss amanda listened with the most eager and overpowering attention often in love that young scapegrace john but she had no doubt of it when she had last known him he was not yet eighteen and he had had several lovescrapes of course he must have married for here was his granddaughter and who in the world could he have taken to wife could it have been that rebecca hendricksthat bold blackeyed girl who as everybody knew had tried so hard to get him with all the strength of her consciousness miss amanda hoped it had not been rebecca there was another girl mildred winchester a sweet young thing and in every way desirable whom miss amanda had picked out for him when he should be old enough to think about such things which at that time he wasnt rebecca hendricks ought to have been ashamed of herself now she did hope most earnestly that she would hear something which would let her know he had married mildred winchester  well said the old gentleman if they do propose as you seem to have some occult reason for suspecting have you made up your mind which of them you are going to take  that is the trouble said the girl a very serious look coming over her face i have not made up my mind what i ought to do i know i ought to be prepared to give the proper answer to the one who speaks first whichever one he may be but i cannot come to a decision which satisfies me and that is the reason grandpa i wanted to talk to you about it of course you know who they aregeorge and mrÂ berkeley  my dear mildred said the old gentleman turning quickly around so that he could face her just listen to me  mildred mildred thought miss amanda and her consciousness was pervaded by a joyful thankfulness which knew no limits she must have been named after her grandmother he surely married mildred and miss amanda gazed on the scapegrace john with more affection than she had ever known before but in the midst of her joy she could not help wondering who it was that that rebecca hendricks had finally succeeded in getting that she got somebody miss amanda had not the slightest doubt  mildred said the old gentleman just listen to me this is a most important thing you have told me and i have only this to say about it if you cant make up your mind which one of those young men you will take when they propose make up your mind now this minute not to have either of them if you love either one of them as you ought to love the man who shall be your husband you will have no difficulty in deciding therefore if you have a difficulty you do not really love either of them  for a few minutes the girl sat quietly looking down at the flowers in her lap and then she said but grandpa suppose i do not understand myself properly perhaps after a while i might come to a  illustration miss amanda listened with the most eager and overpowering attention  after a while interrupted her grandfather that will not do you want to understand yourself before a lover proposes to you not afterwards  the captain sat up straight in his chair now look here he said but he addressed the mistress of the house not the storyteller how does this daughter of ours come to know all these things about lovers and the weathersigns which indicate proposals of marriage and all that has she been going about in society making investigations into the rudiments of matrimony during my last cruise and would you mind telling me if any young men have been giving her lessons in loveaffairs john gayther have you seen any stray lovers prowling about your garden of late  the gardener smiled and said he had seen no such persons but he said nothing about a very true friend of the daughter of the house who lived in a small house in the garden and who would have been very well pleased to break the head of any stray lover who should wander into his precincts  you dont know girls my dear said the mistress of the house and you dont know what comes to them naturally and how much they have to learn so please let the story go on  of course said the old gentleman i know who they are considering how often they have been here of late i could not well make a mistake about that and although i am not in favor of anything of the sort and feel very much inclined to put up a sign no lovering on these premises still i am a reasonable person you must have changed very much if you are you dear boy thought miss amanda and know what is due to young people and i am obliged to admit that these young men are good enough as young men go but the making a choice that is what i object to i would advise you my dear not to think anything more about it until the time shall come when you feel there is no need of making a choice because the thing has settled itself  but grandpa she said what am i to say if they ask me i am bound to say something  the old gentleman did not reply but began switching at some invisible dandelions what you tell me he said presently reminds me of my aunt amanda she was a fine woman and she had two lovers you little roundfaced scamp thought miss amanda are you going to tell that child all my loveaffairs and what do you know about them anyway i never confided in you you were nothing but a boy although you were a very inquisitive one always wanting to know things and what you have found out is beyond me to imagine  your aunt amanda said mildred thats the one in the oval frame in the parlor she must have been very pretty  indeed she was said the old gentleman that portrait was painted when she was quite a young girl but she was pretty until the day of her death i used to be very fond of her and thought her the most beautiful being on earth she always dressed well and wore curls even when she was scolding me i used to sit and look at her and think that if such a lady a little bit younger perhaps but not much were shut up in a castle with a window to it i would be delighted to be a knight in armor and to fight with retainers at the door of that castle until i got her out and rode away with her sitting on the crupper of my saddle the horse being always as i well remember a gray one dappled with dark spots with powerful haunches and a black tail you dear boy murmured miss amanda if i had known that i could not have scolded well as i said before she had two lovers one was a handsome young fellow named garrett bridges  it seems to me i have heard that name said mildred  very likely very likely said her grandfather it has been mentioned a great many times in our family garrett had been intended for the army but he did not get through west point and at the time he was making love to my aunt amanda his only business was that of expecting an inheritance but he was so brave and gay and selfconfident and was so handsome and dashing that everybody said he would be sure to get along no matter what line of life he undertook i wonder thought miss amanda what he did do after all i hope i shall hear that her other lover said the old gentleman was randolph castine a very different sort of young man you unmitigated little storyteller ejaculated miss amanda he never made love to me for one minute in his whole life i wish i could speak to johnoh i wish i could speak to john so then continued the old gentleman here were the two young men both loving my aunt amanda and here was i intensely jealous of them both  oh grandfather laughed mildred how could you be that  easily enough said he i was very impressionable and of a very affectionate turn of mind you had very queer ways of showing it you young scamp said miss amanda and i remember when i was about ten years old i once asked my mother if it were wicked to marry aunts and when she told me it would not do i said i was very sorry for i would like to marry aunt amanda i liked her better than anybody else except my mother and i was sure there was no other person who would take more from me and slap back less than aunt amanda i remember that very well thought the happy consciousness and when your mother told me about it how we both laughed  well the better i liked my aunt amanda the less i liked anybody who made love to her and one night as i was sitting on the edge of my bedit must have been nearly eleven oclocki vowed a vow which i vowed i would never break that no presumptuous interloper especially garrett bridges should ever marry my aunt amanda as to randolph castine or any other suitor i did not think them really worthy of consideration garrett bridges was the dangerous man he was at our house nearly every day and apart from his special obnoxiousness as a suitor to my aunt amanda i hated him on my own account for he treated me as if i were nothing but a boy and why shouldnt he murmured miss amanda you were nearly grown up at that time but you really behaved more like a boy than a man and that was one reason i was so fond of you  i had a good many plans for freeing my aunt amanda from the clutches of mrÂ bridges but the best of them and the one i finally determined upon pleased me very much because it was romantic and adventurous it seemed to me the best way to prevent mrÂ bridges from marrying my aunt amanda was to make him marry some one else and i thought i could do this there was a girl named rebecca hendricks who lived about a mile from our house with whom i was very well acquainted she was a firstclass girl in many ways i would like to know what they were exclaimed miss amanda i think she was about sixthclass no matter how you looked at her for one thing she was very plucky and ready for any kind of fun i knew she liked mrÂ bridges because i had heard her say so and her praise of him had frequently annoyed me very much for i did not want a friend of mine as she professed to be to think favorably in any way of such a man as garrett bridges but things were now getting serious and i did not hesitate to sacrifice my feelings for the sake of my aunt amanda i was always ready to do that not always my boy thought miss amanda not always i am afraid so i resolved to get up a match between rebecca and garrett bridges as i thought over the matter it seemed to me that they were exactly suited to each other thats queer thought miss amanda i always supposed you thought she was exactly suited to you of course i could not say anything to bridges about the matter but i went over to rebecca and told her the whole plan she laughed at me and said it was all pure nonsense and that if she were going to marry at all she would a great deal rather marry me than mrÂ bridges but i told her seriously it was of no use to think of me in the first place i was four years younger than she was and then i had made up my mind never to marry no never as long as my aunt amanda lived i was going to take care of her when she grew elderly and i wanted nobody to interfere with that purpose you dear boy said miss amanda with a sort of choke in her affectionate consciousness that is so like youso like you and yet i thought you were in love with that rebecca of course i did not give up my plan because she talked in that way continued the old gentleman i knew her i had studied her carefully like most boys of my age i was a deepminded student of human nature and could see through and through people  of course laughed mildred i have known boys just like that  but i was about right in regard to rebecca said her grandfather i kept on talking to her and it was not long before she agreed to let me bring mrÂ bridges to see herthey were not acquainted i had no trouble with him for he was always glad to know pretty girls and he had seen rebecca there never was a piece of matchmaking which succeeded better than that and it delighted me to act as prompter of the play while those two were the actors and i was also the author of the piece  grandpa said mildred dont you think all that was rather wrong  i did not think so then he answered and i am not sure i think so now for really they were very well suited to each other and there did seem to be danger that the man might marry my aunt amanda and that as it seemed to me then and seems to me now would have been a deplorable thing if you had known a little more you scheming youngster said miss amanda you would have understood that there was not the least danger of anything of the kindthat is to say i am not sure there was any danger it was not long after these two people became acquainted before i had additional cause for congratulating myself that i had done a wise and prudent thing bridges came to see my aunt amanda every afternoon just the same as he had been in the habit of doing and yet he spent nearly every evening with rebecca and that proved to me he was not a fit lover for my aunt amanda no matter how you looked at it  but the young girl said mildred didnt you think he was also too fickle for her  oh no said the old gentleman i was quite positive that rebecca could manage him when she got him she would make him walk straight i knew her she was a great girl every morning i went to see her to inquire how things were coming on and she told me one day that mrÂ bridges had proposed to her and that she had accepted him and that it was of no use to say anything about it to her father because he would be sure to be dead set against it her mother was not living and she kept house for her father who was a doctor and he had often said he would not let her marry anybody who would not come there and live with him and judging from what she had heard him say of garrett bridges on one or two occasions she did not feel encouraged to propose this arrangement for him  so the plan they agreed uponwhich in fact i suggested although rebecca would never have admitted itwas to go off quietly and get married then she could write to her father and tell him all about it and when his anger had cooled down they could make him a visit and it would depend on him what they should do next i worked out the whole plan of operation which rebecca afterwards laid before mrÂ bridges as the result of her own ingenuity for which he commended her very much they both agreedand you may be sure i did not disagree with themthat the sooner they were married the better the equinoctial storms were expected before very long and then a weddingtrip would be unpleasant and sloppy so they fixed on a certain wednesday which suited me very well because my father and mother would then be away from home on a visit and that would make it easier for me to do my part you little schemer said miss amanda of course you suggested that wednesday  this place was quite in the country then and eight miles from a station and there was only one train to town at seven oclock in the morning if they could get to the village where the station was at quarterpast six they would have time to get married before the train came old mrÂ lawrence the methodist minister was always up at six oclock and he could easily marry them in twenty minutes and that would give them lots of time to catch the train i would furnish the conveyance to take them to the village and would also attend to rebeccas baggage mrÂ bridges could have his trunk taken to the station without exciting suspicion at five oclock in the morning i told rebecca i would have a horse and buggy tied to a tree by the roadside at a little distance from the doctors house where the lovers were to meet  the night before rebecca was to put all the clothes she wanted to take with her in a pillowcase which she was to carry to a woodshed near the house soon after they started in the buggy i would arrive with a springwagon and an empty trunk i would then get the pillowcase put it into the trunk and drive to the station by another road  mrÂ bridges approved of this plan and thought she was very clever to devise it so everything was settled and i went to the stable the day before and told peter i wanted him to get up very early the next morning and put old ripstaver in the buggy and drive him over to drÂ hendrickss i told him he must be there before five oclock and that he was to tie the horse to a mapletree this side of the front yard i said one of the doctors family had to get to the village very early because there were some things to be done before the train came and it had been agreed we should lend our buggy peter was not quite pleased with the arrangement and asked why we did not send the old marewe only kept two horses but i said she was too slow and it had been specially arranged that the buggy with ripstaver should be sent peter was a great friend of mine so he agreed to do what i asked and said he did not mind walking back i never would have believed said miss amanda that the boy had such a mind if i had only known what he was planning to do if i had only known but even if i had it is so hard to tell what is right  my aunt amanda was not in the habit of meddling with anything about the barn or stable but that afternoonand i never knew whyshe went to the barn and found peter dusting off the buggy he told me she asked if anybody was going to use the buggy that evening and he replied he was getting it ready to take over to the hendrickses in the morning as some one there wanted to go to the village before the train started for the city then she asked what horse he was going to put to it and he told her old ripstaver then she said she did not think that was a good plan because ripstaver was hard to drive and it would be a great deal better to send the old mare peter agreed to this and so it happened that when i went to the barn the next morning as soon as i had seen peter drive away in the buggy i found the only horse in the stable was old ripstaver i was mad enough i can tell you for if rebecca made any noise and woke her father he could overtake that old mare long before she could get to the village i never did understand how my aunt amanda happened to meddle that afternoon  of course you couldnt said miss amanda you were a fine little manager but when i looked out of my window that afternoon and saw a boy carrying a trunk to the barn i was very likely to suspect something and when i went down to the barn myself and found peter getting the buggy ready to go away early the next morning i suspected a great deal more i did not know what to do for i did not want to make a scandal by letting peter know anything was out of the way and all i could think of was to have a slow horse put in the buggy instead of a fast one i thought that might help anyway  well continued the old gentleman there was nothing for me to do but to take ripstaver and the springwagon and go after rebeccas baggage when i reached the doctors house and found the buggy had gone i got the pillowcase put it into the trunk and started off on a back road which joined the turnpike a couple of miles farther on near the junction of the two roads was a high hill from which i hoped i might be able to see the buggy and if so i would follow it at a safe distance as soon as i got to the top of this hill i did see the buggy but i saw more than thati saw another buggy not far behind it there was a roan horse in this one which i knew to belong to the doctor bridges was whipping our old mare like everything and she was doing her best and galloping but the doctors roan was a good one and he was gaining on them very fast it was a beautiful race and i felt like clapping and cheering the doctor for although he was spoiling my game it was a splendid thing to see him driving his roan so fast and so steadily never letting him break out of a regular trot and i hated bridges so much i was glad to see anybody getting the better of him  it was not long before the doctors buggy caught up with the other one and then they both stopped everybody got out and there must have been a grand talk but of course i could not hear any of it the doctor shook his fist and i could see they were having a lively time after a bit they stopped talking the doctor took rebecca into his buggy and drove back and garrett bridges got into our buggy and went slowly toward the stationto see about his trunk i suppose i did not lose any time after that but drove to the doctors as fast as old ripstaver could travel and i had rebeccas pillowcase in the woodshed before the doctor arrived now i never was able to imagine how the doctor found out that rebecca had gone she did not know herself she said she got out of the house without making any more noise than a cat and as for her father waking up at the sound of wheels in the public road that was ridiculous if he had heard them he would not have paid any attention to them that was one of the queer things neither of us ever found out  miss amanda was amused of course you didnt it was not intended that you should how could you know that being greatly troubled i woke up very early that morning and when i found you were not in your room i put on my overshoes and walked across the fields to drÂ hendrickss i did not get there as soon as i hoped i would but when i rang the doorbell and the doctor himself came to the door and i told him i did not want to see him but rebecca and he went to look for her and found her gone and i confided to him as a great secret what i was sure had happened it did not take him long to get his horse and buggy and go after her and how glad i was she had our old mare and not ripstaver but i thought all the time it was you she had run away with and i never knew until now that it wasnt the doctor told me afterwards that he and his daughter had agreed not to say anything about it and he advised me to do the same but the sly old fellow never told me it was mrÂ bridges and not you but if i had only known who really was running away with her i would not have walked across those wet pasturefields that chilly morningthat is i do not think i would have done it  but one thing i did know said the old gentleman which i often regretted and that was that if my aunt amanda had not meddled with the horses and so spoiled my plan rebecca hendricks would have married mrÂ bridges and several evil consequences would have been avoided i wonder what they were thought miss amanda well things went on pretty much as they had been going on and that garrett bridges came every day just as bold as brass to see my aunt amanda who of course knew nothing of his trying to run away with rebecca sometimes i thought of telling her but that would have made a dreadful mess and i was bound in honor not to say a word about rebecca  mrÂ randolph castine sometimes came to our house but not often and i began to wish he would court my aunt amanda and marry her if she had to marry he would be a thousand times better than garrett bridges and i thought i could go to his housewhich was a beautiful one with hunting and fishingto see her and perhaps make long stays in the summertime which would have been utterly impossible in the case of garrett bridges you would have been welcome enough in any home of mine said miss amanda but you are utterly mistaken about mrÂ castine alas he was no lover at all but although mrÂ castine was a splendid man in every way he was not a bold lover like garrett bridges and after a while he seemed to get tired and went off to travel not very long after that bridges went off too i think perhaps he had received part of the inheritance he was expecting but i am not sure about that anyway he went and then my aunt amanda had no lover but me  very soon her health began to fail and this went on for some time and nothing did her any good at last she took to her bed it seemed to me the weaker and thinner she got the more beautiful she became and i did everything i could for her which of course was not any good i remember very well that at this time she never lectured me about anything but she sometimes mentioned rebecca hendricks always to the effect that she was a very strange girl and that she could not help thinking her husband if she ever got one would be a man who ought to be pitied i think she was afraid i might marry her but she need not have worried herself about thati never had the slightest idea of any such nonsense but i had every reason to suppose you had such an idea said miss amanda considering i thought you had tried to run away with her  well said the old gentleman there is not much more of the story my aunt amanda died and our family was in great grief for a long time but none of them grieved as much as i did if miss amanda could have embraced her dear nephew john she would have done so that minute then greatly to our surprise randolph castine suddenly came home he had heard of my aunt amandas dangerous condition and he had hurried back to see her and to tell her something before she died he told my mother to whom he confided everything that he had been passionately in love with my aunt amanda for a long time but that he had been so sure she was going to marry mrÂ bridges that he had never given her any reason to suppose he cared for her which i said then and i say now was a very poor way of managing love business if he had spoken everything would have been all right and my aunt amanda might have been living now there are plenty of people who live to be ninety i am positively sure now that she was just as much in love with him as he was with her  miss amanda now suffered a great and sudden pain she seemed to exist only in her memory of her great love for randolph castine and in this present knowledge that he had loved her oh why had she been told that in life she had been dreaming and that only now she had come to know what had been real nothing that was said nothing that was visible impressed her consciousness just then but presently some words of her nephew john forced themselves upon her attention  so she never knew and he never knew and two lives were ruined and she died the old gentleman continued my mother thought as much from disappointed love as from anything else  and what became of mrÂ castine asked mildred who had been listening with tears in her eyes  he went away again said her grandfather and stayed away a long time and at last he married a very pleasant lady because he thought it was his duty having such a fine estate which ought to be lived on and enjoyed  did he have any children asked mildred  yes one daughter who married a mrÂ berkeley of queen mary county it was considered a good match  berkeley exclaimed the young girl moving so suddenly toward her grandfather that all the sweet peas in her lap fell suddenly to the ground berkeley why arthur berkeley comes from queen mary county do you mean he is the grandson of mrÂ castine  exactly that is who he is said the old gentleman  mildred sat for a few minutes without saying a word looking at the ground grandpa she said presently do you know i believe all the time my mind was made up and i did not know it and after what you have told me of arthur berkeley grandpa and your aunt amanda i really think i know myself a great deal better than i did before and if arthur should ask methat is if he ever does  and he surely will said her grandfather for he came to me this morning like the honorable fellow he is and obtained permission to do so  grandpa exclaimed mildred and as she looked up at him there was no beauty in any sweetpea blossom or in any other flower on earth which could equal the brightness and the beauty of her face  the pain faded out of the consciousness of miss amanda and this is the way it ends she murmured this is the way it ends johns granddaughter and his grandson and now it was not pain but a quiet happiness which pervaded her consciousness  the grandfather and granddaughter rose from the rustic bench and walked slowly toward the house miss amanda looked after them and blessed them then she gazed upon the sweet peas on the ground then she looked once more upon the old dial still bravely marking each sunny hour and then slowly and gradually miss amanda lost consciousness without saying to herself seven oclock or fifty years or any other period of time  that is the end said the young lady  and quite time exclaimed the master of the house madam he said turning to his wife did you know of all this knowledge of which your daughter seems possessedof boys nature and womans love and the human heart and all the rest of it i cant fathom her with my longest line  you may as well give up all idea of that sort of sounding said the mistress of the house there is no line long enough to fathom the human heart  i am thinking said john gayther as he rattled the seeds in the pan whether it was worth while for amanda to become conscious for so short a time and just to hear a tale like that  was it worth while to learn that the man she had wanted to love her had really loved her asked the daughter of the house eagerly  it doesnt seem the sort of love to wait fifty years to hear about said john i dont like the way they have in novels of making folks keep back things that men and women couldnt help telling  then you dont like my story john said the daughter of the house in a disappointed tone  indeed but i do miss he replied quickly as a story it is just perfect but as real doings it doesnt pan out square but then it is meant for a story and it couldnt be better or more unlike other stories told here nobody could have thought that out that hadnt a deep mind  the young lady looked critically at john but she saw he really meant what he said and she was satisfied                           this story is told by                          the old professor                            and is called                           my translatophone     ix  my translatophone   the professor was very old but he was well preservedalways spoken of as hale and hearty he still held his position in his college and still took a good part in teaching mathematics but he had an assistant who did the heavy work he had been principal of the school where the mistress of the house received her education and she was much attached to him and he always spent some part of his summer vacation at her house the master of the house of course was not there every summer and so this season the old professor had a special treat for there were many things he liked to talk about in which he knew the two ladies could take no interest  it rained for two days after his arrival at the house but the third morning was bright and clear and the master of the house conducted his visitor to the favorite resort of the familya spot the old professor knew well and loved they conversed for a while on some deep subjects and then they were joined by the two ladies and the next neighbor and the serious discourse changed into light talk and john gayther coming up to pay his respects to the old professor the next neighbor was seized with an inspiration  john she said you must tell us a story sit right down and begin once upon a time know i havent heard a story for a long time  madam said john respectfully i always do what the ladies tell me to do and i am more sorry than i can say but i have to know beforehand when i am to tell a story and indeed i havent one ready  oh you are clever and can make up as you go along as the children say  john never tells an impromptu story said the mistress of the house but my dear professor and she turned to the old gentleman we are all friends here and i should so like you to tell us how you got your wife you once told it to me and i should like to know what this company will think of the way you won her  the old professor smiled i know what you think about it and i know what i think about it and as you say we are all old friends and i am rather curious to know what this company will think about it i will tell my little story when they were all ready he began in a clear voice  if my mary were living this story would never have been told but she has been a blessed spirit now these many years and has doubtless long known it and has judged my conduct righteously such is my belief here he made a reverent pause and then began again  in my early youth i left for some two or three years the beaten trackso to speakof mathematics or more properly mechanics for i interested myself in inventing with more or less success certain scientific machines  one of the most successful of these various contrivances and the one indeed in which i was most deeply interested was a small machine very much resembling in appearance the tube with a mouthpiece at one end and an earpiece at the other frequently used by deaf persons but very different in its construction and action in the ordinary instrument the words spoken into the mouthpiece are carried through the tube to the ear and are then heard exactly as they are spoken when i used my instrument the person spoke into the mouthpiece exactly as if it were an ordinary tube but the result was very different for the great feature of my invention was that no matter what language was spoken by the person at the mouthpiece be it greek choctaw or chinese the words came to the ear in perfect english  this translation was accomplished by means of certain delicate machinery contained in the end of the mouthpiece which was longer and larger than that of the ordinary eartube but the outward appearance of which did not indicate that it held anything extraordinary it would take too long to explain this mechanism to you and you would not be interested nor is it necessary to my story  when after countless experiments and disappointments and days and nights of hard study and hard work i finished my little machine which i called a translatophone i was naturally anxious to see how it would work with some other person than myself at the mouthpiece in the course of its construction i had frequently tried the machine by putting the earpiece into my ear and speaking into the mouthpiece such scraps of foreign languages as i was able to command these experiments were generally satisfactory but i could not be satisfied that the machine was a success until some one else should speak into it in some foreign tongue of which i knew positively nothing so that it would be impossible for me to translate it unconsciously  this was not an easy thing and i had determined i would not explain my invention to the public until i had assured myself that it worked perfectly and until i had had my property in the invention secured to me by patent right to go to a foreigner and ask him to speak into my instrument using a language he could readily assure himself i did not speak or understand would be the same thing as an avowal of what the translatophone was intended to do i thought of several plans but none suited me i did not want to pretend to be deaf and even if i did so i could not explain why i wished to be spoken to in a language i did not use myself  in the midst of my cogitations and uncertainties i received a note from mary armat which for a time drove from my mind all thought of translatophone and everything concerning it  miss mary armat and i had been friends since the days in which we went to school together i had always liked her above the other girls of my acquaintance and about three years previous to the time of this story i had almost made up my mind that i was in love with her and that i would tell her so this however i had not done at that time i had become intensely interested in some of my inventions and although my feelings toward mary armat had not in the least changed i did not visit her as often as had been my custom and when i did see her i am afraid i told her more about mechanical combinations than she cared to hear but so engrossed was i that i stupidly failed to notice this and i did not perceive that i had been neglecting the most favorable opportunities of declaring the state of my affections until she informed me not in a private interview but in the midst of her family circle that she had made up her mind to become a missionary and go to india to work among the heathen i was greatly shocked but i could say nothing then and afterwards had no opportunity to say anything  i did not write to mary because she was a most independent and highspirited girl and i knew it must be spoken words and not written ones which would satisfy her that i had had good reasons for postponing a declaration of love to her until she had left the country  so she went to burma i frequently heard of her but we did not correspond she had gone into her new work with great zeal she had learned the burmese tongue and had even translated a little english book into that language for some time she had seemed well satisfied but i heard through her family that she was getting tired of her eastern life the rainy seasons were disagreeable to her the dry seasons did not agree with her her school duties were becoming very monotonous and she had found out that in her heart she did not care for the heathen especially for heathen children therefore she had resigned her position and was on her way home the note i received from her informed me that she had arrived in new york the day before and that she would be very glad if i would come to see her  she did a sensible thing anyway commented the master of the house  the daughter of the house opened her mouth to say i do not like her she had no enthusiasm or real goodness to give up her work so soon and for such reasons but she suddenly reflected that mary had been the speakers wife and she shut her mouth with a little vicious snap  i went to the armat house that evening and i found there a very lively girl awaiting me her parents and her two sisters had gone out and we had the parlor to ourselves life in burma may not have suited mary armat but it certainly had improved her for she was much more charming than when i had last seen her moreover she was so very friendly and without doubt so glad to see me she was so bright and full of high spirits that it might have been supposed she had arranged matters so that we could have the evening to ourselves and was eminently pleased with her success  i admired her more and more every time i looked at her and i determined that as soon as the proper time should come i would make earnest love to her and tell her what perhaps i should have told her long ago but just now i had other matters on my mind  above all things i wanted mary to talk into my translatophone and to speak in burmese i knew nothing whatever of that language and if she should speak it and the words should come to my ears in pure english then no further experiment would be necessary no doubts could possibly exist but until i had made this test i did not want her to know what the instrument was intended to do it was barely possible she might play a trick on me and speak in english but if the thing succeeded i would tell her everything we two should be the sole owners of the secret of my great inventionan invention which would not only benefit the englishspeaking world but which might be adapted to the language of any nation and which would make us rich beyond all ordinary probabilities  as soon as i had the opportunity i began to speak of the work i had been engaged upon during marys absence and when i approached the subject i thought i saw on her face an expression which seemed to say oh dear are you going to begin on that tiresome business again but i was not to be turned from my purpose such an opportunity as this was too valuable too important to be slighted or set aside for anything else in a few minutes i might discover whether this invention of mine was a success or a failure i took my translatophone from my pocket and laid it on the table beside us  whats that she exclaimed you dont mean to tell me you have become hard of hearing  oh no said i my hearing is just as good as it ever was  but that is a thing deaf people use she said  well yes i answered it could be used by deaf people i suppose although i have never tried it in that way it is my latest and i think my most important invention it would take too long to explain its mechanism just now  indeed it would she interrupted quickly  but what i want to do i continued is to make a little trial of it with you  if you mean you want me to speak into that thing she said i do not want to do it i should hate to think you are deaf and needed anything of the sort please put it away i do not even like the looks of it  but i persisted i told her that i greatly desired that she should speak a few sentences in burmese into my instrument i had a certain reason for this which i would explain afterwards  but you do not understand burmese she said in surprise  not a word of it i answered i do not know how it sounds when it is spoken nor how it looks when it is written but there are certain tones and chords and all that sort of thing in the foreign languages which are very interesting no matter whether you understand the language or not  oh it is a sort of musical thing then she said  i will not say it is exactly that i replied but if you will simply speak to me in burmese for a minute or two that is all i ask of you and afterwards we can talk about its construction and object  oh i do not want to talk any more about it said she but if it will satisfy you i will say a few words to you in burmese do you speak into this hole she said as she took up the instrument  i arranged the earpiece very carefully and covered my other ear with my hand immediately she began to speak to me and every word came to me in clear and beautiful english but i knew as well as i knew that i lived that the words she spoke were burmese or belonged to some other language which she knew i did not understand the proof of this was in the words themselves  i think you are perfectly horrid she said and i am glad to have an opportunity to tell you so even though you do not understand me i cannot imagine how anybody can be so stupid as to want to talk about horrible eartrumpets the first time he meets a girl whom he has not seen for years and who used to like him so much and who likes him still in spite of his cruel stupidity i wonder why you thought i wanted to see you the minute i got home i am awfully disappointed in you for i did think you would talk to me in a very different way the first time you saw me and now i am going to tell you somethingand i would rather cut my tongue out than say it in english but it gives me a wicked delight to say it in burmese i love you john howard i have loved you for a long time and that is the reason i went to burma and now that i have come back i am obliged to say that i love you still if you could invent some sort of a tube that would make you see better with your eyes and understand better with your mind it would be a great deal more suitable than this horrid snakelike thing for your ear i do not suppose you will ever hear me speak this way in english but i tell you again john howard that i love you and it makes me sick to think what a goose you are  now then she said putting down the tube was there anything peculiar in the tones and chords of that bit of foreign language  fortunately the only light in the room was behind me and therefore i had reason to hope that she did not observe the expression of my countenance moreover as soon as she had finished speaking she had turned her face away from me and was now leaning back in her chair her mouth tightly shut and her wideopen eyes directed on the opposite wall she looked like a woman who had taken a peculiar revenge and who in the taking of it had aroused her soul in its utmost recesses  for some moments i did not answer her question in fact i could not speak at all my thoughts were in a mad whirl not only had i discovered that my invention the hope of my life was an absolute success but i was most powerfully impressed by the conviction that now i could never tell mary what my invention was intended to do for then she would know what it had done  yes i answered speaking slowly there was a sort of accord a kind of  i was interrupted in what would have been a very labored sentence by the ringing of the doorbell mary instantly rose it was plain she was laboring under suppressed excitement for there was no other reason why she should have jumped up in that way she looked as if she were anxious to see some one no matter who it was i too felt relieved by the interruption in my state of wildly conflicting emotions any third person would be a relief  the door opened and miss sarah castle walked in oh mary she exclaimed i am so glad to find you at home as it isnt late and the moon is so bright i thought i would run over to see you for a few minutes oh mrÂ howard  sarah castle was a young woman for whom i had no fancy active in mind and body and apparently constructed of thoroughly wellseasoned material she was quick to notice eager to know and ready at all times to display an interest in the affairs of her friends with which in most cases said friends would willingly have dispensed as she took a seat she exclaimed  you dont mean to say mary that you went deaf in burma  unfortunately i had forgotten to put my translatophone into my pocket and it was lying in full view on the table mary gave a scornful glance toward the innocent tube  oh that she said that is not mine it belongs to mrÂ howard  the words mrÂ howard grated upon my nerves up to this moment except through the translatophone she had not addressed me by my name in any form and every tentative lover knows that when his lady addresses him as though he had no name it means that she does not wish to use his formal title and that the time has not arrived for her to call him by his christian name  you deaf cried sarah turning to me i have never heard anything of that when did it come on it must have been very recent  oh he isnt deaf said mary impatiently it is only one of his inventions but tell me something of your brothers i have not heard a word about them yet  but the knowledgeloving sarah was not to be bluffed off in this way  oh they are all right said she they are both in college now but mrÂ howard deaf i am truly amazed do you have to talk to him through this mary  mary armat was not an illnatured girl but as i said before she was a highspirited one and was at the time in a state of justifiable irritation  oh bother that thing she answered i told you it is only one of his inventions and i wish he would put it in his pocket  not just yet said sarah i am really anxious to know about it why do you use it mrÂ howard if you are not deaf  my face must have displayed my extreme embarrassment at this unanswerable question for mary came to my relief  oh it is a kind of musical instrument she said but dont let us talk any more about it this is the second time i have seen you but we have not really had a good chance to say anything to each other  i took advantage of this very strong hint and rose  musical exclaimed the irrepressible sarah oh mrÂ howard please play on it just the least little bit  mary allowed herself an expression of extreme disgust please not while i am present she said i could not abide it  i now advanced to take my leave  do not go just now said sarah i merely ran over for a minute to ask mary about the wilmer reception but as you are going mrÂ howard you might as well see me home it is later now  i retired to a booktable at the other end of the parlor and it was a good deal later when the two young ladies had finished talking about the wilmer reception  i do not understand it at all said miss castle when we were on the sidewalk you are not deaf mrÂ howard and yet you use an eartrumpet what does it mean  of course i did not know what to say but i had to say something and moreover that something must not be wholly inconsistent with my explanation to mary  oh it is a thing i answered that is intended to be used in connection with foreign languages then i made a bold stroke it shows the difference in their resonant rhythms  well i am sure i do not understand that said miss castle but what is the good of it does it make them any pleasanter to listen to  i admitted that it did  whether you understand them or not she asked  if this young woman had at this moment fallen down a coalhole i cannot truthfully say that i should have regretted it  i cannot explain that miss castle i said for it would take a long time and here we are at your door  come in and let me try it said sarah  thank you very much i replied but i really cannot i have an engagement at my club in fact i was just going to take leave of miss armat when you came in  she looked at me scrutinizingly you used to call her mary armat when you spoke of her said she but i suppose her having been a missionary makes a difference in that way i do not believe much in club engagements but of course we have to recognize them and if you cannot come in now i wish you would call on me soon if your invention has anything to do with foreign languages i truly want to try it i am studying german now and if it will put any resonant rhythm into that language it will be very interesting  i made a hasty and indefinite promise and gladly saw the front door shut behind miss sarah castle  that night i did not sleep in fact i did not go to bed the words mary armat had spoken to me in burmese should have completely engrossed my every thought but they did not for one moment my mind was filled with rapture by the knowledge that i was loved by this lovely girl and in the next i was overwhelmed by anxiety as to what should be done to make it impossible for her to know that i knew she had spoken those words but whether my thoughts made me happy or distressed me there seemed to be but one way out of my troubles i must be content with marys love that is if i should be so fortunate as to secure it there might be doubts about this women are fickle creatures and mary had been very much provoked with me when i parted from her  i see what is coming here interrupted the next neighbor and i dont approve of it at all  it would be hard continued the old professor after pausing for further remarks to turn my back upon the golden future which my invention would give to mary and me but i must win her golden future or not i sat before my study fire and planned out my future actions as soon as i could see mary alone i would tell her my love and i would explain to her why i had not spoken when i first saw her but in order to do this i should have to be very careful i would say nothing but the truth but i would be very guarded in telling that truth she must not imagine that anything she had said had made me speak she must not imagine that i thought she expected me to speak  i would begin by asking her pardon for worrying her with my invention when i knew she disliked problematic mechanics then i would tell her in as few words as possible that i had expected this little instrument to give me fame and fortune and therefore i wanted her to know all about it and then before she could ask me why i wanted her to know this i would tell her it was because i wished to lay that fame and fortune at her feet after that in the best way my ardent feelings should dictate i would offer myself to her without fortune without fame just the plain john howard who loved her with all his heart if she accepted me i would tell her that the invention had not worked as i had intended it should and therefore i should put it behind me forever  oh dear cried the next neighbor i knew it was coming  maybe it didnt said the master of the house  having come to a decision the old professor went on with more animation upon this most important matter my mind grew easier and i became happier what was anything a black tube could do for mewhat indeed was anything in the worldcompared to the love of that dear girl and so i sat and gazed into the fire and dreamed waking dreams of blessedness  after a time however it came to me that i must make up my mind what i was going to do about the translatophone i might as well take it apart and throw it into the fire at once and then there would be an end to that danger to the future of which i had been dreaming yes there would be an end to that but there would also be an end to the great boon i was about to bestow upon the world a boon the value of which i had not half understood it truly was a wonderful thinga most wonderful thing an american or an englishman or any one speaking english could take with him a translatophone and travel around the world understanding the language of every nation of every peoplethe polished tongues of civilization the speech of the scholars of the orient and even the jabber of the wild savages of africa to be sure he could not expect to answer those who spoke to him but what of that he would not wish to speak he would merely desire to hear all he would have to do would be to pretend that he was deaf and dumb and my simple translatophone might put him into communication with the minds of every grade and variety of humanity  then a new thought flashed into my mind why only humanity if i should attach a wide mouthpiece to my instrument why should i not gather in the songs and cries of the birds why should i not hear in plain english what they say to each other why should not all creation speak to me so that i could understand why should i not know what the dog says when he barkswhat words the hen addresses to her chicks when she clucks to them to follow why should i not know the secrets of what is now to us a tonguetied world of nature  illustration and dreamed waking dreams of blessedness  then i had another idea that made me jump from my chair and walk the floor i might know what the monkeys say when they chatter to each other what discovery in all natural history could be so great as this the thought that these little creatures so nearly allied to man might disclose to me their dispositions their hopes their ambitions their hates their reflections upon mankind had such a sudden and powerful influence on me that i felt like seizing my translatophone and rushing off to the zoÃ¶logical gardens it was now daybreak i might obtain admission  but i speedily dismissed this idea if i should ever hear in english what the monkeys might say to me i must give up mary i should be the slave of my discovery it would be impossible then to destroy the translatophone i sat down again before the fire shall i put an end to it now i said to myself nothing would be easier than to take its delicate movements and smash them on the hearth now a prudent thought came to me suppose mary should not accept me then with this great invention lostfor i never should have the heart to make anotheri should have nothing left in the world no i would be cautious lest in every way my future life should be overcast with disappointment the sun had risen and i felt i must go out i must have air before i opened the front door however i said to myself remember it is all settled it is mary you must havethat is if you can get her  of all things in this world the mind of man is the most independent the most headstrong it will work at your bidding as long as it pleases and then it will strike out at its own pace and go where it chooses during a walk of a couple of miles i thought nearly all the time of what the monkeys might say to me if i should attach a wide mouthpiece to my translatophone and place it against the bars of their cage over and over again i stopped these thoughts and said to myself but all this is nothing to me i must consider mary and nothing else then in a very few minutes i was wondering if the monkeys would ask me questionsif they have as strong a desire to know about us as we have to know about them from such questions how much i might learn in regard to the mental distance between us and them but again i put all this away from me and began to plan anew what i should say to mary and then again it was not very long before i found myself thinking how intensely interesting it would be to know what the treetoads say and what the frogs talk about when they sit calling to each other all night it might be a little difficult to get near enough to treetoads and frogs but i believed i could manage it  however when i returned home i was thinking of mary  it was early in the afternoon and i was trying to decide what would be the best time to visit the armat house the monkeys had not ceased to worry me dreadfully and i had begun to think that when bees buzz around their hives they must certainly say something interesting to each other then a note was brought to me from mary i tore it open and read    i want you to come to see me this afternoon if you possibly can   come about four oclock and bring that speakingtube with you miss   castle has been here nearly all the morning and some things she has   said to me have worried me very much please come and do not forget   the eartrumpet  this she signed merely with her initials  marys note drove to the winds monkeys bees and the rest of the world what had that wretched mischiefmaker that castle girl been saying to her i did not believe that the mind of mary armat was capable of originating an unfounded suspicion of me but the mind of sarah castle was capable of originating anything she had doubtless suspected that there must be some extraordinary reason for my desire to have people talk to me through a tube in a language i did not understand she had been too impatient to wait until she could try her german upon me and she had gone to mary and had filled her mind with horrible conjectures one thing was certain no matter what else happened i must not take that translatophone to mary after what sarah had said to her there could be no doubt that she would make me speak to her in a foreign language through the tube it would be easy enough she could give me a french book and tell me to read a few pages no matter how badly i should pronounce the words they would reach her ears in pure english  and then  i took my translatophone from the cabinet in which i kept it the easiest way to destroy it was to throw it at once into the fire but that would fill the house with the smell of burning rubber no it was only necessary to destroy the internal movements i unscrewed the long mouthpiece and gently withdrew from it the little membranecovered cylinder not six inches in length which formed the soul of my invention i took it in my hand and gazed upon it through its thin flexible and almost transparent outer envelope i could see as i held it to the light its framework fine as the threadlike bones of a fish its elastic chords its quivering diaphragms and all the delicate organs of its inner life it seemed as if i could feel the palpitations of its heart as i breathed upon it for how many days and months had i been working on this subtle inventionworking and thinking and dreaming here it lay perfect finished ready to tell me more than any man ever has knowna thing almost of life and ready to be brought to life by the voice of man or beast or bird or perhaps of any living thing could i have the heart to destroy it could i have the heart to turn my back upon the gate of the world of wonders which was just opening to me  yes said i to myself i have the heart to do anything that will prevent my losing the love of mary armat  then an evil thought came to me and tempted me if you choose you can hear the monkeys talk and have mary too everything you want is in your own hands dont put that little machine back into the tube lock it up safely out of sight and then go to mary with your instrument and you can talk into it and she can listen and she may talk and you may listen yes you may have your maryand she need never know that you understand what the monkeys may say to you or what she has said to you  i am proud that i entertained this evil thought for but a very short time i turned upon it and stormed at it no i exclaimed i shall never win mary by cheating her whether i get her or not i will be worthy of her  then there came another thought apparently innocent and certainly persuasive do not destroy the translatophone then if things do not turn out well between you and mary you will still have the monkeys  no i said to myself i must have mary i will have nothing to fall back upon i will allow nothing to exist that might draw me back  there was another thing i might do i might take my translatophone to her and explain everything but would there be any possibility even if she did not fly from me in shame and never see me again that i could make her believe in a love which had been so spurred on even aroused as she might well imagine mine had been no that would never do apart from anything else it would be impossible for me to be so cruel as to let mary know i had understood the burmese words she had spoken to me  i looked at the clock it was halfpast three whatever was to be done must be done now i cast one more look of longing affection upon the quivering throbbing little creature which to me was as much alive as if it had been a tired bird panting in my hand and then i gently laid it on the hearth i lifted my left foot and let it hang for an instant over the hopes the fears the anxieties the happy daydreams those early years of my life had given me and then with relentless cruelty not only to that quivering object but to myself i brought down my foot with all my strength  there was a slight struggle for an instant during which there came to me quick muffled sounds which to my agitated brain sounded like the moans of despair from that vast world of animal intelligence which does not speak to man from my own heart there came a groan all was over from the mysterious inner courts of the animal kingdom no revelations would ever come to me the thick curtain between the intelligence of man and the intelligence of beast and bird which i had raised for a brief moment had now been dropped forever i should never make another translatophone  i cast no glance upon the hearth but put on my hat and coat and went to mary as i walked there rose behind me a cloud of misty disappointment while before me there was nothing but dark uncertainty what would mary have to say to me and how should i explain what would seem to her to be a cowardly evasion of her plainly expressed request  when i entered the armat parlor i found mary alone this encouraged me a little i had feared that the yearningly inquisitive sarah might also be there in that case how might i hope to preserve one atom of my secret  mary came forward with a smile and held out her hand i was so astonished i could not speak  now dont be cross said she as i told you in my note sarah castle was here this morning and she greatly troubled my mind about you she told me i was actually snappish with you when she was here last night she had never heard me speak to any one in such an illnatured way she knew very well that i do not care for inventions and machines but she did not consider this any reason for my treating you in such a manner she said i ought to have known that your whole soul is wrapped up in the queer things you invent and that i should have made some allowance for you even if i did not care about such things myself now when she told me this i knew that every word was true and i was utterly ashamed of myself and as soon as she left i sent you that note because i wanted you to let me beg your pardonwhich you may consider has been done and now please let me see your speakingtube i want you to explain it to me i want to know how it is made and what is its object for i know very well that even if your inventions are not successful they always have very good objects please forgive me and let us sit on the sofa and have a nice talk together such as we should have had last night  my soul shouted with joy within me and i said to myself we shall have the nice talk we should have had last night but it shall be the talk you wanted then and not the one you ask for now  now then said she when we had seated ourselves let us go to work to make experiments with your tube i am so glad you do not feel about it as i thought you would  i did not bring it i said  oh what a pity interrupted mary  no said i it is not a pity it did not work as i expected it would and there is no use in talking any more about it i placed great hopes in it and i had a particular reason for wanting to tell you all about it then i began and bravely told her all about it that is all that justice and kindness would permit me to tell in the conversation which ensued which was a very happy exchange of sentiment it was wonderful how that translatophone was put into the background  a great deal of what mary said in answer to my passionate avowals she had already said to me in burmese but the fact that those straightforward honest words fresh from a true womans heart and spoken only for the satisfaction of her own frank and impetuous nature had come to me before in plain english she did not imagine nor did i ever allow her to imagine this secret of her soul i always regarded as something that came to me in involuntary confidence and i always respected that confidence  were you never sorry asked the daughter of the house when the old professor ceased  no he said thoughtfully i have never been sorry for what i did i had a very happy life with my marya life far happier than any wonderexciting invention could have given me  was it fair to the world to destroy an instrument that might have been of great advantage to science ventured john gayther hesitatingly  it is not easy said the old professor to decide between what we owe to the world and science and what we owe to ourselves you see i decided in favor of myself possibly another man would have decided in favor of the invention  not if he were desperately in love said the master of the house  all those finespun feelings were unnecessary said the next neighbor if you had not confused your mind with them you would have seen clearly enough that the first idea which came into your head was the proper one to act upon it would have been no terrible deception if you had taken the instrument to mary without the little machine and talked english with her later you could have told her you had the invention and you could use it by that time she would have forgotten that she ever had made that burmese speech and would have been glad of the fame and fortune the machine would surely have brought  the old professor looked pained i do not deny that some such afterthoughts troubled my mind occasionally for some years but who can say anything of the might have been the instrument might have failed after all or the information gained have proved not worth the hearing or  here there was an unlookedfor interruption the red thrush suddenly burst into song from the midst of the lilacbushes and the whole company listened spellbound with delight while the little creature filled the air with melody and sweetness  when the song ceased the professor remarked my translatophone would have been worse than useless here if i could have heard those words i should have lost that delicious melody doubtless the words were commonplace enough but the melody was divine and it was easy to interpret the spirit of it it was a song of joy for all that is pleasant and bright and happy in this world                           this story is told by                          the next neighbor                            and is called                           the viceconsort     x  the viceconsort   the red thrush seemed now to be part of the pleasantness of the garden whether he was drawn to the lilacbushes by the sweet memory of his former home or whether he was keeping a tryst with his mate of the nesting season and was calling her to come to him or whether his coming was pure caprice of course john gayther could not know but every day he came and when the sky was clear he sang his merry song and even when the clouds were overshadowing he could not help uttering little trills of melody after a time he would fly away but he left a note of gladness in johns heart that stayed there all day  the bird did not seem in the least disturbed by the talk on the terrace if the sound of the voices reached him at all it must have been as a low murmur and perhaps he liked it the family now timed their visits to the summerhouse when they were able to go there by the red thrush and he seldom disappointed them it so happened however one morning when they were all there that the lilacs gave forth no sound they waited for the accustomed music and a hush fell upon them they were silent for some time and then the old professor spoke  i see john gayther below the terrace cant we have a story if we cannot have a song  john was called up at once and the next neighbor accosted him gayly if you had known that i am going to tell a story you would have walked faster  john answered her with a pleasant smile he liked the next neighbor he liked the kind of mind she had for it was thoroughly imbued with an anxious desire to do her duty in this world in the manner in which that duty showed itself to her he liked her because she was fond of the daughter of the house he liked her because she considered her husband to be the handsomest best and cleverest man in the world perhaps john would have liked this trait best of all if he had not clearly seen that she held in reserve an opinion that this husband would move on a still higher plane if he would place more value on her opinions and statements  this is the first time you have favored us he said courteously  well she said i knew the time would come when i would be called upon and i could tell many a story about things that have happened to me i am not exactly the heroine of this tale but i am intimately concerned in its happenings and shall tell it in my own way  before i was married i used to feel that all we have to do in this world is to grow up like grass or cloverblossoms and to perform our parts by being just as green or as sweetsmelling as our natures allow but i do not think that way now along comes a cow and our careers are ended of course we cannot get out of the way of our fate any more than grass can get out of the way of a cow but it often happens that we can accommodate ourselves to our misfortunes we can be content to being nibbled close we can spring up again from the roots or we can patiently wait until we blossom again the next summer  it was about a year after i was married that i began to think about such things we were spending a fortnight at the country house of one of my old friends mrsÂ cheston and although bernard my husband was away most of the time fishing with mrÂ cheston we were enjoying ourselves very much there was a village not far away where there were some very nice people so that we had a good deal of pleasant social life and it was not long before i became quite well acquainted with some of the village families  one day mrsÂ cheston gave me a luncheon to which she invited a good many of the village ladies and after they were all gone we two sat on the piazza and talked about them two or three of our guests i had not met before and in the course of our talk emily mentioned the name of margaret temple  temple said i which one was that i do not recall her  you were talking to her some time she replied i think she was telling you about the mountains  oh yes said i she was pointing out those passes through which people go into the next county she sat at the other end of the table didnt she she was dressed in black  oh no said emily she was not dressed in black she never wears black i think she wore a brown dress with some sort of light trimming  oh well said i i did not notice her dress and when i do not notice peoples clothes i nearly always think they dress in black is she nice  she is very nice indeed said emily everybody thinks that  i wish i had seen more of her said i  emily did not answer this remark but a smile came on her face which presently grew into a little laugh i looked at her in surprise  what is there funny about miss temple i asked  really there is nothing funny about her she replied but i often laugh to myself when i think of her  i suddenly became very much interested in miss temple tell me why you do that i said i always like to know why people laugh at other people  emily now became very sober you must not think she said that there is anything ridiculous about margaret temple there is not a finer woman to be found anywhere and i do not believe there is anybody who laughs at her except myself you know i am very apt to see the funny side of things  and so am i i exclaimed do tell me about miss temple it is so seldom there is anything amusing about a really nice person  emily was silent for a moment and then she said well i do not know that there is any real harm in telling you what makes me laugh a good many people know all about it but i would not for the world have margaret temple find out that i told you  i assured her with great earnestness that if she would tell me i would never breathe it to any living soul  very well said emily i will trust you as i said it really isnt funny but it is just this it is a positive fact that five married ladies i am certain of this number and it may be more have gone to margaret temple during the past few years and each one has asked her to become her husbands second wife in case she should die  i did not laugh i exclaimed in amazement why did they all ask her i did not notice anything particularly attractive about her  i think that is the point said emily i do not think a woman is likely to want her husband to take an attractive woman for his second wife if she had the chance to choose her successor she would like her husband to have a really nice person good in every way but not one with whom he would be likely to fall violently in love dont you see the point of that  i replied that it was easy enough to see the point but that there was another one you must remember said i that husbands are generally very particular if one has had a young and handsome wife he would not be likely to be satisfied with anything less  emily shook her head i am older than you rosa and have had more opportunities of noticing widowers there are a great many things for them to think about when they marry a second time their children their positions and all that i believe that if a man and his wife discussed it which they would not be likely to do they would be very apt to be of the same mind in regard to the sort of person who ought to come in as number two for my part i do not wonder at all that so many women have cast their eyes on margaret temple as a person they would like to have take their places when they are gone for one thing you know they would not be jealous of her this is very important then they would be as certain as anything can be certain in this world that their children if they had any as well as their husbands would be in most excellent hands often when i have been thinking about her i have called margaret temple the viceconsort but i have never told any one this please remember  so far i had not seen a thing to laugh at but i was deeply interested how came all this to be known i asked has miss temple gone about telling people  oh no indeed she is not that sort of person a good many of the village ladies know it and i think they always have heard it from those prudent ladies who were providing for their husbands futures people talk about it of course but they are very careful that nothing they say shall reach margaret temples ears  tell me about some of the people i said who want to secure miss temple as a successor do they all feel as though they are likely to die  not all of them answered emily there is mrsÂ hendrickson who was obliged to go to arizona on account of her fathers property he was very rich and died not long ago her husband has to stay at home to attend to his business and she could not take her little baby and although she is just as healthy as anybody she knew all the dangers of railroad travelling and all sorts of things in that faraway place and before she packed her trunk she went to margaret temple and asked her to promise that if she died out there she margaret would marry mrÂ hendrickson this i know for certain for mrsÂ hendrickson told me herself  did miss temple promise  that i did not hear replied emily mrsÂ hendrickson was in a great hurry and perhaps she did not intend to tell me anyway but i do not believe margaret absolutely refused at least it would not have been prudent for her to do so the hendricksons are rich and he is a fine man there would be nothing in the way of such a match  except the return of the wife i remarked  emily smiled and then there was poor mrsÂ windham she continued everybody knew she asked margaret she left a son about eight years old who is very delicate the poor woman has not been dead long enough for anything to come of that but i do not believe anything ever will there are people who say that mrÂ windham drinks but i have seen no signs of it then there is another oneand no matter what you may hear people say about these things you must never mention that i told you this mrsÂ barnes the rectors wife has spoken to margaret on the subject she looks very well so far as i can judge but there is consumption in her family she is almost bigoted in regard to the duties of a rectors wife she tries just as hard as she can to fill the position properly herself and she knows mrÂ barnes would never be satisfied with any one who did not agree with him as she does about the responsibilities of a rectors wife  does margaret temple agree with him i asked  i do not know for i never talked with her on the subject replied emily but she is very apt to think what is right besides it is believed that mrsÂ barnes has not only spoken to margaret but to the rector himself and if he had not thought the plan a good one mrsÂ barnes would have dropped it and from things i have heard her say i know she has not dropped it  emily looked as though she were about to rise and i quickly exclaimed but that is only three who are the others  one of them said she is mrsÂ clinton there is nothing the matter with her physically but she is very rich and is prudent and careful about everything that belongs to her while her husband is not a business man at all and never has anything to do with money matters of importance there are three children and she has reason to feel anxious about them should they and their property be left in the charge of mrÂ clinton or to the tender mercies of some woman who would marry him for the sake of his wealth you can see for yourself that it is no wonder she casts her eyes upon margaret i believe mrsÂ clinton could die happy if she could see her husband and margaret temple promise themselves to each other at her bedside  that seems to me to be horrid said i but of course it would be extremely sensible and the other one  oh that matter does not amount to much said emily old mrsÂ gloucester lives at the other end of the village and she does not visit much so you have not seen her her husband is old enough dear knows but not quite so old as she is she is very much afraid that she will die and leave him with nobody to take care of him for they have no children they are very well off and i dare say she thinks it would be a good thing for margaret as well as for the old gentleman  that is shameful said i it would be the same thing as engaging a trained nurse  emily laughed i never heard how margaret received this remarkable proposition she said but i hope she was angry  but at any rate it could never come to anything said i  of course not answered mrsÂ cheston  it is not surprising that after this conversation i took a great interest in margaret temple and when she called the next morning i had a long and undisturbed talk with her mrsÂ cheston being out i am very fond of analyzing human character and i often do it while i am riding in the streetcars and it was not long before i had made up my mind as to what sort of woman margaret temple was i set her down as what may be called a balanced person in fact i thought at the time she was a little too well balanced if some of her characteristics had been a little more pronounced i think she would have been more interesting but i liked her very much and i remember i was almost as well pleased when she was talking to me as when she was listening and i am sure there are very few persons men or women of whom i can say this  here a smile came upon the faces of the company but they were too polite to make any comment on what had called forth the smile the master of the house asked permission to light a cigar and the old professor who never smoked remarked there is deep philosophy in all this  i dont know about the philosophy said the next neighbor but it is absolute truth well after a time i began to wish that miss temple lived near our home because she would be such an admirable person for a friend and neighbor then suddenly without any warning there flashed through me the strangest feeling i ever had in my life i must have turned pale for miss temple asked me if i did not feel ill i soon recovered from the effects of this strange feeling and went on talking but i was very glad when mrsÂ cheston came home and took the conversation out of my hands  for two or three days after this my mind was very much troubled and bernard thought that the air of that part of the country did not agree with me and that we ought to go to the seashore but this i positively refused to consider there could be no seashore for me until a good many things had been settled it was at this time that i first began to think that we cannot grow up fresh and green and blossom undisturbed and that we must consider untimely cows coming along  to make the state of my mind clearly understood i must say that there is an hereditary disease in my family i had never thought anything about it for there had been no reason why i should but now i did think about it and there did seem to be reason my grandfather had had this disease and had died of it to be sure he was very old but that did not matter he died of it all the same it never troubled my father but this made no difference so far as i was concerned for i have always heard that hereditary diseases are apt to skip a generation and if this one had skipped there was nobody for it to skip to but me for i have no brothers or sisters  the more i thought on this subject the more troubled my mind became and at last i believed it to be my duty to speak to bernard although i did not tell him all my thoughts for i had had a good many that were not necessarily connected with hereditary diseases i was positively amazed at the way my husband received what i told him i had expected that perhaps he might poohpooh the whole thing but he did nothing of the kind he became very serious and talked to me in the most earnest way  now rosa said he i am glad you told me about this and i want to impress it upon your mind that you must be very careful in the first place you must totally give up hot spirits and water you must not drink more than two glasses of wine or three at the utmost at any of your meals when you get up in the morning you must totally abstain from drinking those mixtures that are taken by some people to give appetite for breakfast at night you must try to do without any sort of punch or toddy to make you sleep if you will take this advice and restrict yourself to water and milk and not overrich food i think you may reasonably expect to live longer than your grandfather did although i cannot imagine why any one should want to live that long  of course i was angry at all this for i saw then that he was making fun of me and i said no more to him for he was not in the right frame of mind to listen to me but i did not stop thinking  i now became very intimate with miss temple i began to like her very much and i think she liked me i continued to study her and i became convinced that she was a woman to whom a very fastidious man might be attractedi do not mean that he would fall in love with her but that he would be perfectly satisfied with her in fact i summed up her character by assuring myself that in every way she was perfectly satisfactory i have known other women who were more charming but they all had faults and i do not see how any one could have found fault with miss temple  one day we had taken a long walk and were on our way home when i began to talk to her about my own affairs i thought i knew her so well in a general way that the time had come for me to find out some things more definitely i began in an offhand but cautious manner to talk about bernard i alluded to his love of outdoor sports and mentioned that i thought it my duty frequently to speak to him in regard to the terrible consequences which might follow a false step when he was out fishing and that i thought it necessary to repeat this advice very often for it was my opinion he paid very little attention to it i also made several other allusions to his indisposition to take care of himself and remarked how very necessary it was for me to look after his health i mentioned his great carelessness in regard to flannel and told her that it was often quite late in the autumn before he would make any change in his clothing  then i spoke of his domestic habits and as i saw miss temple seemed much interested i talked a good deal about them he was the most loving husband in the world i said and was always anxious to know what he could do for me more than he was already doing but when we were in the city he did like to go out in the evenings and i thought he went to his club too often of course i said i did not say anything to him about it for i would not want him to think that i desired him to deny himself the company of other gentlemen but the habit of club attendance was one that might grow on a man especially a young one and there were a good many other things that might result from it such as excessive smoking so i had thought it well to offer him additional inducements for spending his evenings at home and i had begun a regular system of reading aloud it had proved very beneficial to both of us for i chose good standard books and although he sometimes went to sleep that was to be expected for bernard was a hardworking man as for myself i liked this reading aloud very much although at first it was rather tiresome as i had never been used to it then i asked her if she liked reading aloudit is such a good way of giving pleasure to others at the same time that you are pleasing yourself she smiled and said she was very fond of reading aloud  then i changed the subject to churches and preachers for i did not want her to think i was saying too much about my husband and asked her who was the best preacher in the village when she said it was mrÂ barnes i asked her if she went to his church she answered that she did and then i told her that i was also an episcopalian but that bernards parents were methodists i did not think however that this would make much difference for when he began to go regularly to church i was sure he would rather go with me than to travel off somewhere by himself  i did not suppose that miss temple would care so much about what i was saying but she did seem to care and listened attentively to every word  you must not think i am talking too much about my family affairs i remarked but doesnt it strike you that a really good wife ought to try just as hard as she can to be on good terms with her husbands family no matter how queer they may be i mean the women in it for they are more likely to be queer than the men for if she does not do this i continued the worst of the trouble if there is any will come on him he will have to take sides either with his wife or his sistersand mother too if he happens to have oneand that would be sure to make him unhappy if he is a goodhearted man such as bernard is  at this miss temple burst out laughing and it was the first time i had ever heard her laugh so heartily as soon as she could speak she exclaimed are you going to ask me to marry your husband if you should happen to die  i must have turned as red as the most scarlet poppy for i felt my face burn i hesitated a little but i was obliged to tell the truth and so i stammered out that i had been thinking of something of the kind  oh please dont look so troubled said she several persons have spoken to me on the same subject but i never should have dreamed that such an idea would come into your head i think it is the funniest thing in the world and then she laughed again  i was greatly embarrassed and all i could say was that i hoped i had not offended her  oh not in the least she said i am getting used to this sort of thing and i can bear it  this remark helped me very much for i resented it i do not see what there is to bear i said such a man as bernardand then i have special reasons  oh yes she interrupted quickly each one has a special reason but there is one general reason that is common to all now tell me my dearand as she spoke she took both my hands and looked steadily into my facewere you not about to ask me to marry your husband in case of your death because you could think of it without being jealous of me and because you are afraid he might marry some one of whom you would probably be jealous if you knew of it  she looked at me in such a kind strong way that i was obliged to confess that this was my reason for speaking to her about bernard i cannot exactly explain i added and my face burned again why i should think about you in this way but i hope you will not imagine  oh i shall not imagine anything that will be disagreeable to you she said and she looked just as goodhumored as possible  does that lady live in any place where my wife can get at her asked the master of the house as the next neighbor paused to take breath  i have not yet developed a disease said the mistress of the house  well when you do please find that woman she is a very good sort  i shall have an opinion on that subject papa said the daughter of the house  you little minx he replied i shall see that you are provided for before that  it is not well to joke about so serious a matter said the next neighbor as you will see when i finish my story  for a little while miss temple walked on in silence and i tried hard to think of what would be proper for me to say next when suddenly she stopped  we are not far from the house now she said and before we get there i want to set your mind at rest by telling you that if you should die before your husband and if nothing should happen at any time or in any way to interfere with such a plan i will marry your bernard and take good care of him i have never made such a positive promise to any one but i do not mind making it to you i am sure i need not ask you to say nothing about this compact to your husband  i was stunned but i managed to stammer oh no indeed  fortunately for me miss temple did not stay to supper i do not think i could have borne to see her and bernard together it was bad enough as it was i felt greatly humiliated i could not understand how i could have done such a thing it was worse than selling a birthrightit was giving away the dearest thing on earth i trembled from head to foot when bernard came home from fishing i do not believe i ever before greeted him so affectionately my emotion troubled him and he asked me if i were ill and if i had been lonely and bored while he was away he was just as good as good could be and began to talk again about going to the seashore i did not object this time for i could not know what would be best to do  in the evening after every one else had gone indoors i begged him to sit longer on the piazza and to smoke another cigar he was quite surprised because as he said i had never asked him to do such a thing before but had rather discouraged his smoking but i declared i wanted to sit with him in the moonlight all by ourselves and so we did until his cigar was finished  for the first hour of that night i did not sleep a wink my mind was so troubled i felt as though i were not really bernards wife but some sort of a guardian angel who was watching over him to see that somebody else made him happy after i had thus been in the depths of grief for a long while i became angry  she shall never have him i said to myself i will make it the object of my life to live longer than he does my grandfather lived to be much older than ordinary men and why should not i have as long a life perhaps it was the things he ate and drank and his jovial disposition that gave him such longevity if i were sure of this i would be willing to take hot drinks at night and wine at dinner no bernard must not be left behind it was while making up my mind very firmly about this that i fell asleep  the next morning i was possessed with an overwhelming desire to go to see miss temple why i should do so i could not tell myself i certainly did not want to see her i did not wish to speak to her i did not want her to say anything to me but i felt that i must go and i went she received me very pleasantly and did not say one word about our conversation of the day before there were a good many things i should have liked to say but i did not know how unless she gave me the opportunity but she did not and so it happened that we talked only about something she was sewingi do not know whether it was a shirtwaist or an army blanket in fact i did not hear one word she said about her stupid work whatever it was i was so busy restudying her face her character and everything about her i now found she was much more than satisfactoryshe was really goodlooking her eyes were not very large but they were soft and dark her voice was clear and sweet i had noticed this before but until now i had not thought of it as an objection there were a good many other things that might be very effective to a man especially to one with halfhealed sorrows i acknowledged to myself that i had been mistaken in her and i did not doubt she had deceived a good many other people in that neighborhood  when i rose to leave she stood for a moment looking at me as though she expected me to say something on the subject which was certainly interesting to her as well as to me but now i did not want to talk and i gave her no chance to say anything i walked rapidly home feeling as jealous of margaret temple as any woman could feel of another  i was glad that day that bernard liked to go fishing for my mind was in such a condition that i did not think of anything that might happen to himat least anything but just one thing and that was awful emily cheston supposed i had a headache and i let her think so for it gave me more time to myself i looked at the thing that threatened to crush all my happiness on every possible side early in the morning a ray of relief had come to my troubled mind and this was that i did not believe he would have her anyway but i had seen her since and no such ray comforted me now  i knew as i had not known before what a power she might have over a man widowers i thought are generally ready enough to marry again but no matter what they think about it they mostly wait a good while for the sake of appearances but this would be different when a man knows that his wife had selected some one as her successorand he would be sure to know this the woman would see to thathe would not feel it necessary to wait he would be carrying out his dead wifes wishes and of course in this there should be no delay oh horrible when i thought of myself as bernards dead wife and that woman living i actually kicked the stool my feet were resting on i vowed in my mind the thing should never be i felt better after i had made this vow although i had not thought of any way by which i could carry it out certainly i was not going to say anything to bernard about it one way or another  here the next neighbor paused again and at that moment the red thrush gave a little low trill as much as to say listen to me now then he twittered and chirped in a tentative way as if he had not made up his mind about singing and the party on the terrace felt like clapping to encourage him  i wonder if he knows he has an audience said the daughter of the house in a very low tone  he knows it is impolite to interrupt the story said her father no there he goes  and sure enough the bird having decided that on the whole it would help matters in whatever direction he wished them to be helped sang out clear and loud what seemed to his audience the most delightful song he had yet given them  when he had finished the next neighbor said that was so full of soul i hate to go on with my very material story  it strikes me said the old professor that there is a good deal of soul in your story  thank you said the next neighbor as she again took up the thread of her narrative  that evening prompted by a sudden impulse i went up to bernard and looking into his face i declared that i would never leave him  what he exclaimed has any one been asking you to leave me  of course not said i a little irritatedhe has such queer ways of taking what i say i mean i am not going to die before you do i am not going to leave you in this world to take care of yourself  he looked at me as though he did not understand me and i do not suppose he did although he only said i am delighted to hear that my dear girl but how are you going to manage it how about that hereditary disease you were talking of the other day  i have nothing to say about that i answered but if i live as long as my grandfather did i do not believe that your being a little older than i am wouldi mean that you would not be left alone dont you understand  bernard did not laugh you are the dearest little woman in the world he said and i believe you would do anything to make me happyyou would even be willing to survive me so that i should never lose you but dont let us talk any more about such doleful things we are both going to live to be a great deal older than your grandfather now i will tell you something pleasant i had a letter this morning just as i was starting out i put it in my pocket and did not have time to open it until we were eating our lunch it is from my brother george who is going to england next month you know and as he wants to see something of us before he starts he intends to spend a few days in the village so that he can be with us he is coming tomorrow  a ray of hope shot into my heart so bright that i could almost feel it burn  well said bernard what have you to say to this arent you glad that george is coming  glad i replied i am more than delighted  bernard looked as though he did not understand this extraordinary ecstasy but as he was used to not understanding me i do not suppose he thought it worth while to bother himself about it  george was a fine young fellow and next to bernard i thought he was the best man in the world it will be remembered that i had no brother and george was always as kind and brotherly as he could be i was fond of him even before i was married in fact i knew him quite well before i became acquainted with bernard and i was always glad to see him but i had never been so delighted to think he was coming as i was then my face must have shown this for bernard laughingly said  you must be awfully glad to see george  i am glad i answered and as i spoke i thought that if he knew everything he would understand why my eyes glistened as i am sure they did  the reason of my great joy was that a plan had suddenly come into my mind george had spoken to me several times about marrying and he had told me just what kind of a wife he wanted and now as i remembered what he had said on the subject it seemed to me he had been describing margaret temple he wanted a wife who was goodlooking but not a belle and she must be sensible and practical a good housekeeper and a charming hostess besides she must be intellectual and fond of books and appreciate art and all that moreover he had said he would like her to be just about a year older than himself because he thought that was a good proportion in a young couple it was apt to make the man look up to his wife a little which might not be the case if he were the elder i remembered this because when he told me i wished very much that i were a year older than bernard  now as i said before all this seemed as though he had been talking of miss temple and i knowing her so well could see other points than those he mentioned in which she would suit him as no other woman could if george would fall in love with miss templeand there was no earthly reason why he should not for bernard told me he was going to make him stay a weekthen everything would be all right all my anxieties my forebodings and my jealousies would be gone and i should be as happy as i was before i met that dear girl miss temple  this was not all idle fancy my plan was founded on good practical ideas if george married margaret everything would be settled in an absolutely perfect way if i should die bernard would not need to marry anybody in fact i did not believe that in this case he would want to he would go to live with george and margaret their home would be his home and he would always have both of them to take care of him and to make him happy in every possible way in which anybody could make him happy in my minds eye i could see him in the best room in the house with all sorts of comforts and luxuries about himour present comforts and luxuries would make a great show gathered together in one room and then i saw margaret and george standing at the open door asking if there were anything he would like and what they could do for him as this mental picture came before me my eyes involuntarily went around that room to see if there were a picture of me on the wall and there it was and no portrait of any other woman anywhere about  in a flash the whole thing became so horrible to me that i threw myself on the bed and began to cry convulsively bernard heard me and came upstairs and i was obliged to tell him i had a sudden pain he does not like sudden pains and sat down and talked to me a good while about what i had been eating before long however i grew calm and was able to think about my plans in a commonsense practical way truly there could be nothing better for my present comfort and bernards future happiness margaret and george to take care of him and my image undimmed in his heart i felt like one who has insured his life for the benefit of a loved one so no matter what might happen to him he would have as long as he lived the joy of knowing what he had done for the loved one  when george came the next day he was just the same splendid old george and i do not believe any one ever received a warmer welcome from a sisterinlaw than i gave him bernard made a little fun of me as usual and said he believed i would rather see george than him  nonsense said i i am always glad to see you but i am especially glad to see george  bernard whistled and looked at me in the same queer way that he looked at me when he once had said laughingly that he believed if i had never met him i would have married george and i had answered that if i had been sure he did not exist it might have been a good thing for me to marry george  miss temple did not come to the house that morning as she so often did but i asked emily to send over and invite her to tea for i did not wish to lose any time in the carrying out of my plans it was about the middle of the afternoon when bernard and his brother came in from a walk i had been anxious to see george because i wanted to talk with him about margaret before he met her i was going to speak very guardedly of course but i knew it would be well to prepare his mind and i had made up my mind exactly what i was going to say  i artfully managed so that george and i walked over the lawn to a bench in the shade of a big tree where there was something or otheri entirely forget what it waswhich i said i would show him mr and mrsÂ cheston and bernard were on the piazza but i did not ask them to join us  we sat down on the bench and in a general sort of way i asked him what he had been doing meaning presently to bring up the subject of margaret for i did not know what time she might drop in but george was just as anxious to talk as i was and being a man he was a little more pushing and he said  now little rosa i am so glad you came down here with me for i have something on my mind i want to tell you and i want to do it myself before anybody else interferes it is just this i am engaged to be married and as soon as i get back from england i am going to and then he opened his eyes very wide and looked hard at me what is the matter rosa he exclaimed dont you feel well  in one instant all my plans and hopes and happy dreams of the future had dropped to the ground and had been crushed into atoms  well said i and i think i spoke in a queer voice i am very well there is nothing the matter with me what is her name  he told me but i had never heard it before and it was of no more importance to me than the buzzing of a bee  it will be very nice i said and now let us go up to the house and tell the others  i think that for a woman who had just received such a blow as had been dealt to me i behaved very well indeed but i was cold and i suspect pale i listened as the others talked but i did not say much myself and as soon as i could make some excuse i went up to my room there i threw myself into a great chair and gently cried myself to sleep i did not sob loudly because i did not want bernard to come up again when i awoke i had a dreadful headache and i made up my mind i would not go down to tea i could do no good by going down and so far as i was concerned it did not matter in the least whether margaret was there or not in fact i did not care about anything let george marry whoever he pleased if i should die margaret temple had promised to take care of bernard everything was settled and there was no sense in making any more plans so i got ready for another nap and when bernard came up i told him i had a headache and did not want any tea  that evening bernard sat and looked at me without speaking as was sometimes his habit and then he said  rosa i do not understand this at all and i want you to tell me why you were so extravagantly glad when you found my brother george was coming here and why you were so overcome by your emotions when you heard of his engagement  oh bernard i cried if it were anybody else i might tell everything but i cannot tell youi cannot tell you and i am sure i spoke truly for how could i have told that dear man what i had said to margaret temple and how jealous i had been of her afterwards and how i had planned for her to marry george and that after my funeral he should go to live with them and about my picture on the wall and all the rest of it it was simply impossible and if he did not know all this how could he understand my feelings when i heard that george was engaged  i could not answer him i could only sob and repeat what i had said beforethat if it were anybody else i might speak but that i could never tell him soon after that he went downstairs and i went to sleep  bernard was never cross with mei do not believe he could be if he triedbut the next morning he was very quiet and soon after breakfast he and mrÂ cheston and george went fishing if the incidents of the day before had not occurred i suppose they would have done something in which emily and i could have joined but some sort of change had come over things and it was plain enough that even george did not want me so i sat alone under the tree where george had told me of his engagement feeling very much troubled and very lonely i wanted to tell everything to somebody but there was no one to tell it would be impossible to speak to emily she would have no sympathy with me and if i should tell her everything i had planned i knew she would laugh at me unmercifully i think it would have pleased me better to speak to george than to any one else he had always been so sympathetic and kind but now things were changed and he would not care to interest himself in the affairs of any woman except the one to whom he was engaged it was terrible to sit there and think that there was not a person in the world not even my husband to whom i could look for sympathy and comfort if i had not been out in the open air where people could have seen me i should have cried  happening to look up i saw some one on the piazza it was that horrible margaret temple and when she gazed about from side to side she saw me under the tree and as i apparently took no notice of her she stepped down from the piazza and came walking across the lawn toward me if i had been a man i should have cursed my fate not only was i deprived of every comfort but here came the disturber of my peace to make me still more unhappy  i do not remember what she said when she reached me but i know she spoke very pleasantly nor do i remember what i replied but i am sure i did not speak pleasantly i was out of humor with the whole world and particularly with her she brought a little chair that was near by and sat down by me she was a very straightforward person about speaking and so she said without any preface  have you told your husband of that arrangement you made with me if he should survive you  of course i have not i exclaimed do you think i would tell him a thing like that especially when i said i would not the fact is i continuedand it was very hard for me to keep from crying as i spokei am just loaded down with trouble and i cannot tell anybody  i knew you were troubled she replied and that is the reason i came this morning why cant you tell me what is the matter  at first this made me angry and i felt like bouncing off to the house and never speaking to her again but in the next instant i changed my mind it would serve her right if i told her everything and so i did i made her feel exactly how i had felt when i had thought of her in my place and how i had determined that it should never be then i went on and told her all my plans about george and herself and how bernard was to board with them if i died i made the story a good deal longer than i have made it here then i finished by telling her of georges engagement and how nothing had come of the whole thing except that bernard had supposed that i thought too much of george and had gone away that morning as cold as a common acquaintance and that i felt as though my whole life had been wrecked and that she had done it  it was easy to see that she was not affected as she should have been by what i said in fact she looked as though she wanted to laugh but her respect for me prevented that  i do not see she said how i have wrecked your life  that may be so i answered but it is because you do not want to see it i should think that even you would admit that it is enough to drive me crazy to see any woman waiting and longing for the day which would give her that which i prize more than anything else in the world and to think what you are aspiring to none of the old leftovers that other people have offered to you but my bernard the very prince of men i do not wonder you were so quick to promise me you would take him  she jumped up and i thought she was going away but she did not go and turned again toward me and remarked just as coolly as anybody could speak well i do not wonder either your bernard is a most estimable man and if nothing should happen in any way or at any time to interfere in the case of his surviving you i shall be happy to marry him i think i would make him a very good wife  at this i sprang to my feet and i am sure my eyes and cheeks were blazing do you mean i cried that you would make him a better wife than i do  that is a question she said that is not easy to answer and needs a good deal of consideration and she spoke with as much deliberation as if she were trying to decide whether it would be better to cover a floor with matting or carpet for one thing i do not believe i would nag him  nag i exclaimed what do you mean by that do you suppose i nag him  i do not know anything about it she answered except what you told me yourself and what you said was my reason for agreeing so quickly to your proposition  nag i cried but then i stopped i thought it would be better to wait until i could think over what i had said to her before i pursued this subject but i can tell you one thing i continued and that is that you need not have any hopes in the direction of my husband i am going to tell him everything just as soon as he comes home even about you and george and i am going to make him promise that no matter what happens he will never marry you  illustration do you mean i cried that you would make him a better wife than i do  i think these words made some impression on her for she answered very quickly i am not sure that it will be wise to tell him everything but if you are determined to do so i must insist that you will tell him something more and that is that i am engaged to be married and have been for nearly a year  and you have been deceiving all these anxious wives i cried  i never made promises to any one but to you she answered and i would not have done that if i had not liked you so much  you have a funny way of liking i remarked  she merely smiled and went on and i should not have told you of my engagement if i had not thought it would be safer to do so considering the story you are going to tell your husband  and it is because i consider it safer that i am going to tell him that story i replied                                                that afternoon as soon as i was alone with bernardi did not give him any time to show me any of his commonacquaintance coolnessi told him the whole thing from beginning to end he listened so earnestly that one might have thought he was in church but when i came to the part about his boarding with george and miss temple he could not help laughing he excused himself however and told me to go on he looked very happy when i had told him my story and no one would have supposed that he had ever assumed the air of a mere common acquaintance  you are such a good little wife he exclaimed and you are always trying to do things to make me happy but you must not take so much labor and anxiety upon yourself i want to help you in every way that i can and in such a case you ought to let me do it  but how could you help me in the trouble i have been telling you about i asked  easily enough he answered now if you had taken me into your confidence i would have told you that i consider miss temple too tall a woman for my fancy  she is i said i did not think so at first but i can see it plainly now  then again she is too practicalminded  entirely too much so i agreed  and in other respects she is not up to my standard continued bernard so i think rosa that if you should ever take up such a scheme again we should act together i am sure my opinion would be of great advantage to you in helping you to select some one who should take up the work of making me happy  you are perfectly horrid i exclaimed and i stopped his mouth  that was the end of the matter but i never learned to like margaret temple to be sure i thought seriously of some things she had said but then people can consider things people say without liking the people who say them i pity her husband  just then came the summons to luncheon and this story was not commented upon                           this story is told by                             john gayther                            and is called                        blackgum agin thunder     xi  blackgum agin thunder   john gayther and the daughter of the house walked in the garden the melons were ripe now and it was a pleasure to push aside the coarse leaves and find beneath them the tropicallooking fruit with the pretty network tracery covering the graygreen rind the grapevines too were things of beauty hanging full of great white yellow red and purple clusters the tomatoes gleamed scarlet and purplered thickly among the plants the cabbages had curled themselves up into compact heads that looked like big folded roses set in an open cluster of leaves there were rows of greenleaved turnips redleaved beets and featheryleaved carrots the ears were standing stiff in the corn rows  in the orchard the peaches were rosy and downy the plums ready to drop with lusciousness ruddycheeked pears were crowded on the drooping branches the apples not so plentiful were taking on the colors that proclaimed their near fruition and even the knotty quinces were growing fair and golden on the upper terrace the stately delicate cosmos was waving in the wind great beds of low marigolds were flaunting their rich colors in the bright sunlight the dahlias lifted into the air stiffly and proudly their great blossoms of varying forms the clovepinks lowly and delicate in color gave forth the fragrance of the springtime which they had held stored up in their tender blossoms and the early chrysanthemums were unfolding their plumes  i love the late augusttime said john gayther as the two sat down to rest in the summerhouse after a long stay in the garden i have a singular feeling which i hope is not irreverent that the great creator is pleased with me for having brought this work to perfection and the thought gives me great peace of mind  it does sound a little presumptuous john said the young lady  not in the way i mean it replied john we are told that god gives abundantly of the fruits and blossoms that gladden our hearts and eyes but this is only partly true there may be some lands where nothing need be done to these godgiven fruits and vegetables and flowers i do not know but in this happy land although he does abundantly give us the material to work upon he expects us to do the work else what would be the use of gardens and if there were no need of gardens there would be no gardens and how desolate would life be without gardens  i see what you mean john said the young lady we could not go into the woods or on to the plains and find the fruits and vegetables that grow so well in this garden if they were there at all they would be poor and undeveloped  exactly so said john and in my garden i garner up gods gifts and i select the best and then the best of the best and so on and on and i watch oh so carefully for everything hurtful and i water and i prune off the dead branches and enrich the ground and so i work and work with gods help of the sunshine and the rain and at last when it all comes to what we see today i cannot but feel that god is pleased with me for bringing about the fruition he knew i could accomplish with the material given by what some people call nature and i call god that is what a garden is for and in that way it glorifies him  they were both silent for some time the young girl was thinking that while all that john had said was true she could not like him love this season best of all its very perfection and full fruition were saddening for that must inevitably be followed by decay the old man was thinking that while youth and its promise for the future was beautiful the resignation and peacefulness of an accomplished life was far more beautiful  the red thrush broke into song and startled them both the old man listened to it as if it were a pÃ¦an of thanksgiving for the garden and all that it had given and wished he were able to join his voice with the music of the bird as the young girl listened it seemed to her that the song was as clear and sweet and happy as it had been in the spring and she marvelled  what a pity we have missed the bird a voice broke into the stillness that had followed the song it was the mistress of the house who was approaching followed by the master of the house the next neighbor and the old professor  i was wondering why you were not all here some time ago said the daughter of the house  kept by company said the master of the house as they all came forward and took their accustomed places not half as agreeable as the bird nor as interesting as the story john promised to tell i hope it will not be as solemn as your countenance john  nobody was ever solemn long when the master of the house was present and john gaythers countenance immediately was lighted up by a smile i could not think of telling you a solemn story he said and this one is about a peculiar character i knew his name was abner batterfield and he was a farmer one day he was fortyfive years old he was also tired having finished hoeing his last row of corn he sat down on a bench at his front door took off his wide and dilapidated straw hat and wiped his brow presently his wife came out she was a little more than fortyfive years old and of phenomenal physical and mental endurance she had lived seventeen years with abner and her natural vigor was not impaired  suppers ready said she  her husband heaved a sigh and stretched out his weary legs in unison  supper he repeated its allus eat and work and sleep  perhaps youd like to leave out the eatin said mrsÂ batterfield that would save lots  her husband ignored this remark his farm was small but it was too big for him he had no family except himself and wife but the support of that family taxed his energies there was a certain monotony connected with coming out short at the end of the year which was wearisome to his soul  mrsÂ b said he ive made up my mind to start over again  goin back to the cornfield she asked youd better have your supper first  no said he its different ive been thinkin about it all day and im goin to begin life over agin  at your age it would be more fit fer you to consider the proper endin of it said she  i knew youd say that mrsÂ b i knew youd say that you never do agree with me in any of my plans and undertakins  which accounts fer our still havin a roof over our heads said she  but i can tell you this time im agoin ahead i dont care what people say i dont care what they do or what they dont do im goin ahead itll be blackgum agin thunder this time and im blackgum youve heard about the thunder and lightnin tacklin a blackgumtree  ever since i was born said she  well theres a awful scatterin of dust and chips when that sort of a fight is on but nobody ever yet heard of thunder gettin the better of a blackgumtree and im goin to be a blackgum  mrsÂ batterfield made no reply to this remark but in her heart she said and im goin to be thunder  the next morning abner batterfield put on his best clothes and walked to the little town about two miles distant he didnt enter the business part of the place but turned into a shady side street where stood a small onestory building almost by itself this was the village library and the librarian was sitting in the doorway reading a book he was an elderly man of comfortable contour and wore no glasses even for the finest print  mornin abner said the librarian have you brought back that book  abner seated himself on the doorstep no i havent mrÂ brownsill said he i forgot it i forgot it but i remember some things thats in it and ive come to talk about em  very good said the librarian closing the volume of salmons geographical grammar with his finger at page 35 treating of paradoxes and remarked well abner what is it  then abner batterfield told his tale he was going to make a fresh start he was going to spend the rest of his life in some manner worthy of him he hadnt read much of the book he had taken out of the library for in his present way of spending his life there didnt seem to be any very good time for reading but he had read enough of it to make him feel that it was time for him to make a fresh start and he was going to do it  and i may have a tough time said abner but itll be blackgum agin thunder and im blackgum  the librarian smiled what are you going to do said he  thats a thing said abner im not so certain about ive been thinkin of enterin the ministry but the bother about that is i cant make up my mind which particular denomination to enter theres such a difference in em  thats true said mrÂ brownsill thats very true but havent you a leaning for some one of them in particular  in thinkin it over said abner ive been drawn to the quakers so fars i kin find out theres nothin a quaker preacher has to do if he dont want to  but then on the other hand said the librarian theres no pay  which wont work at all said abner so thats got to be dropped as to the methodists theres too much work a man might as well stick to hoein corn  what do you think of the catholics asked the librarian meditatively i should think a monk in a cell might suit you i dont believe youd be expected to do much work in a cell  abner cogitated but there aint no pay to that no moren if i was a quaker and theres mrsÂ b to be considered i tell you mrÂ brownsill its awful hard makin a chice  the librarian opened his book and took a good look at the number of the page on which paradoxes were treated so that he might remember it then he rose and put the book upon the table and turning to abner he looked at him steadfastly  abner batterfield said he i understand the state of your mind and it is plain enough that its pretty hard for you to make a choice of a new path in life but perhaps i can help you how would you like to be a librarian  me exclaimed abner amazed  i dont mean said mrÂ brownsill that you should take up this business for life without knowing whether you like it or not but i can offer you what might be called a sample situation i want to go away for a couple of weeks to visit my relations and if you will come and attend to the library while i am gone it might be a good thing for both of us then if you dont like the business of a librarian you might sample some other calling or profession  abner rose from the doorstep and entering the room stood before mrÂ brownsill thats the most sensible thing said he that i ever heard said in all my life sample first and go into afterwards thats sound reason mrÂ brownsill i will do it  good said the librarian and the duties are not difficult  and the pay asked abner  just what i get said mrÂ brownsill  the bargain was made and abner immediately began taking lessons in the duties of a librarian  when he went home he told his tale to mrsÂ b i have hoed my last row of corn said he and when its fit to cut and shock well hire a man theres librarians mrsÂ b so mrÂ brownsill told me that gets thousands a year think of that mrsÂ bthousands a year  mrsÂ batterfield made no reply to this remark but in her heart she said and i am thunder  early the next morning long before the ordinary time for opening the library abner was at his post he took the key from the concealed nail where mrÂ brownsill was wont to hang it he opened the door and windows as the librarian told him he must do he swept the floor he dusted the books and then he took the waterpail and proceeded to the pump hard by he filled it then he sat down and wiped his brow he had done so much sitting down and browwiping in his life that it had become a habit with him even when he was neither hot nor tired  this little library was certainly a very pleasant place in which to earn ones livingten thousand times more to his taste than the richest cornfield around the walls were bookshelves some of them nearly filled with books most of which judging from their bindings were of a sober if not a sombre turn of mind  some of these days said abner i am goin to read those books i never did have time to read books  from the ceiling there hung too high to be conveniently dusted a few stuffed birds and one small alligator some of these days said abner to himself i am goin to get on a stepladder and look at them birds and things i never did properly know what they was  now footsteps were heard on the sidewalk and abner jumped up quickly and redusted a book upon the table there entered two little girls the elder one with her hair plaited down her back they looked in surprise at abner who smiled  i guess you want to see mrÂ brownsill he said well i am in his place now and all you got to do is to tell me what book you want  please sir said the one with plaits mother wants to know if you can change a quarter of a dollar  this proposed transaction seemed to abner to be a little outside of a librarians business but he put his hand in his pocket and said he would see when he had extracted all the change that pocket contained he found that he was the owner of three nickels and five copper cents he tried some other pockets but there was no money in any of them he was disappointed he did not want to begin his intercourse with the townspeople by failing to do the first favor asked of him he looked around the room he rubbed his nose in a moment an idea struck him  how much do you want to get out of this quarter said he  ten cents sir said the girl with the plaits the womans waitin fer it now  ill tell you said abner what i can do all i have got is twenty cents two of these nickels will do for the woman and then for the other five cents you can take out a book for a week a duodecimo volume for a week is five cents is there any duodecimo volume you would like  the girl with the plaits said she didnt know and that all she wanted was change for a quarter  which this will be said abner  asking the little girls to follow him he approached the bookshelves now heres something said he presently taking down a book its bucks theological dictionary and its got a lot of different things in it some of them your mother might like to read to you and some of them she might like to read to herself i once read one piece in that book myself it is about the inquisition and when i began it i couldnt stop until i got to the end of it i guess your mother might like to read that even if she dont read it to you  the little girl said she didnt know whether her mother would like it or not but what she had been sent for was change for a quarter  this will be the same thing said abner twenty cents in money and five cents for a duodecimo for one week so take the money and the book my dear and tell your mother that if she keeps it out longer than one week therell be a fine  the child and the duodecimo departed and abner sat down again and wiped his brow theres one customer said he and thats the way to do business they come to get you to do somethin for them and before they know it theyre doin business with you payin cash in advance but theres one thing i forgot i oughter asked them young ones what their mothers name was but ill remember em specially the one with the plaited hair so its all the same  the little girls went home its a new man at the library said the one with the plaits and he hadnt got no moren twenty cents in money but he sent you a book for the other five cents  the mother with her baby in her lap sent the ten cents to the woman who was waiting and then took the book which opened quite naturally at the article on the inquisition and began to read and although the baby grew restless and began to cry she didnt stop reading until she had finished that article its fully worth five cents she said to herself as she put it on the shelf for future perusal  it was not long before the thought struck abner that he was losing opportunities which spread themselves around him so he jumped up and took down a book the volume proved to be one of elegant extracts but after reading certain reflections upon seeing mrÂ popes house at binfield he thought he would like something more in the nature of a story and took up a thinner volume entitled dicks future state he turned over the leaves hoping to meet with some of the adventures of dick but his attention was arrested by a passage which asserted that arithmetic would be one of the occupations to be followed in heaven he was about to put away the book in disgustfor to him there was no need of a mans being good in this world if he were to be condemned to arithmetic in the nextwhen the light from the open door was darkened by a large body who approached in carpet slippers making no noise this proved to be a round and doleful negro woman a greater part of her face wrapped up in a redandgreen handkerchief her attire was somewhat nondescript and entirely unsuggestive of literary inclinations she groaned as she entered the room  whar mrÂ bronsill she asked with one hand to her face  abner was amazed was it possible that this woman could read and that she cared for books he explained the situation and assured her that he could attend to her just as well as the regular librarian  is mighty glad to hear dat said the woman is mighty glad to hear dat for i hasnt slep one wink for dis tooth mrÂ bronsill he allus pulls my teeth and dey nebber has been one what ached as bad as dis  with this she began to unwrap her swollen face  you neednt do that cried abner i cant pull teeth you must go to the dentist  thatll be fifty cents said the woman and mrÂ bronsill he don charge nothin i know whar he keeps his pinchers deys in dat drawer in de table and you kin pull it out jes as well as anudder pusson id pull hit out ef i wuz anudder pusson  abner shook his head i never pulled a tooth he said i dont know nothin about it  don dey tell somethin about pullin teeth in dese here books said the woman  abner shook his head there may be he said but i dont know where to find it  and yous de librarian said she in a tone of supreme contempt and don know how to fin whats in de books and with this she rewrapped her face and wabbled away  i hope the next one will want a book said abner to himself and wont want nothin else if im to be librarian i want to fork out books  the morning passed and no one else appeared the forenoon was not the time when people generally came for books in that town  after he had eaten the dinner he had brought abner sat down to meditate a little he was not sure that the life of a librarian would suit him it was almost as lonesome as hoeing corn  some time after these reflectionsit might have been a minute it might have been an hourhe was awakened by a mans voice and suddenly started upright in his chair  hello said the voice you keepin library for old brownsill  thats what im doin said abner hes away for his holiday  the newcomer joe pearson was an odd creature i remember him well he had been assistant to the town clerk but was now out of a position he was a stout man with little eyes and wore a shiny black coat and no collar  i am glad to hear it he said mrÂ brownsills a little too sharp for my fancy id rather do business with you have you got any books on eggs  i dont know said abner but i can look what kind of eggs  i dont suppose theres a different book for every kind of egg said joe i guess theyre lumped  all right said abner step up to the shelves and well take a look now heres one that ive just been glancin over myself it seems to have a lot of different things in it its called elegant extracts  elegant extracts wont do said joe they aint eggs  e e e said abner looking along the line and anxious to make a good show in the eyes of his acquaintance who had the reputation of being a man of considerable learning experimental christianitybut that wont do  after fifteen or twenty minutes occupied in scrutiny of backs of books joe pearson gave up the search i dont believe theres a book on eggs in the whole darned place said he thats just like brownsill he hasnt got no fancy for nothin practical  what do you want to know about eggs said abner  mrÂ pearson did not immediately answer but after a few moments of silent consideration he walked to the door and closed it then he sat down and invited abner to sit by him look here abner batterfield said he ive got a idee thats goin to make my fortune i want somebody to help me and i dont see why you couldnt do it as well as anybody else for one thing youve got a farm  as he said this abner started back confound the farm he said ive given up farmin and i dont want nothin more to do with it  yes you will said pearson when ive told you what im goin to do but it wont be common farmin itll be mighty different theres money in this kind of farmin and no work nuther to mention  abner now became interested  it concerns eggs said pearson abner did you ever hear about the eggs of the great auk  great hawk said abner  not hawk aukauk  never seen the bird said abner  i reckon not said the other they say they disappeared some time before the war but i dont believe that ive been readin a piece about em abner and i tell you it just roused me up and thats the reason ive come here sposin i might find a book that might give me some new pints but i reckon i know enough to work on  is there anything uncommon about em asked abner  uncommon exclaimed the other do you know what a great auks egg is wuth its one thousand eight hundred dollars  a carload asked abner  stuff ejaculated mrÂ pearson its that much for one and that one blowednothin but a shellnot a thing inside and eighteen hundred dollars  by george exclaimed abner eighteen hundred dollars  and thats the lowest figure great auk eggs is wuth twentyone thousand and six hundred dollars a dozen  abner rose from his chair joe pearson he said what are you talkin about  im talkin about makin the biggest kind of money and if you choose to go in with me you can make big money too im all correct and i can show you the figures  abner now sat down and leaned over toward pearson whars it likely to fin nests said he  nests exclaimed pearson in disdain if i could find two of emfresh onesid call my fortune made  i should say so said abner sellin for thirtysix hundred dollars but what is there so allfired good about em to make em sell like that  scerceness said joe apart from scerceness they aint no bettern any other egg but theres mighty few of em in market now and all of thems blowed  and no good said abner  they say not said the other for scerceness theyre better blowed than stale which theyre bound to be if theyre kept  but whats your idea about em said abner  thats what im goin to tell you replied pearson theres a general notion that there aint no more great auks specially hen great auks and thats why their eggs are so scerce but i dont see the pint of that it dont stand to reason for now and then somebody gets a great auk egg if you find em theyve got to be laid and if theyre laid theres got to be hen great auks somewhere now the pint is to find out where them great auks lay it may be a awful job to do it but if i can do it and get just two eggs my fortunes made and yourn too  illustration abner did you ever hear about the eggs of the great auk  would you divide the thirtysix hundred dollars evennow very much interested  divide sneered pearson do you suppose id sell em no sir id set em under a turkey or perhaps a big hen then sir id go into the great auk business id sell auk eggs and make my fortune and yourn too  and young ones if we get a lot  no sir exclaimed pearson nobodyd own no auks but me you cant catch em alive and i wouldnt sell no eggs at all till theyd first been blowed id keep the business all in my own hands abner ive been thinkin a great deal about this thing youve heard about the lively sixpence and the slow dollar well sir im goin to sell them auk eggs for sixteen hundred dollars two for three thousand  john gayther said the master of the house you will not make me believe that you ever knew two such fools  in the course of my life said the old professor i have known several of them  not looking for auks eggs inquired the next neighbor  something just as impracticable he said  the north pole for instance suggested the mistress of the house  i think said john they are more likely to find that than my friends were to find what they sought but we shall see abner looked at his companion that would be better than most any other kind of business said he where do you go to get them eggs  way up north said pearson and the furder north you go the more likely you are to find em  i dont know about goin north said abner reflectively theres mrsÂ b to consider  but i dont want you to go said pearson im goin north and when ive found a couple o auk eggs ill pack em up nice and warm in cotton and send em down to you and have em hatched thats where your farmll come in youve got to have a farm and turkeys or big hens if you want to raise auks then ill go on lookin and most likely ill get a couple more  thatll be a good thing said abner the more the merrier ill go in with you joe pearson thats the sort of business thatll just suit me but ill tell you one thing joe i wouldnt put the price of them eggs down at first id wait until a couple of dozen had been laid and blowed and then perhaps id put the price down  no sir said joe ill put the price down at the very beginning sixteen hundred dollars or three thousand for two is enough for any eggs and we oughter be satisfied with it  and when are you goin to start north asked abner  thats the pint said pearson thats the pint you see abner i aint got no family and i can start north whenever i please as far as thats concerned but theres obstacles for one thing i aint got the right kind of clothes and then theres other things its awful hard lines startin out on a business like this and the more money there is in it the harder the lines  but you can do it joe said abner i feel in my bones you can do it itll be blackgum agin thunder but youll be blackgum and youll come out all right  i cant be blackgum nor nothin else said pearson if i dont get no help specially if i dont get no help from the party whats goin to get a lot of the money  abner reflected if we was to set any auk eggs next month itll be well on into next summer before wed have eggs to sell  pearson also reflected yes he said and it might be a little later than that youve got to leave a margin i allus leave a margin then im safe  yes said abner then youre safe  joe pearson was a man of resourceful discretion he rose now abner said he ive got to go ive got a lot of things on my hands and i want you to remember that what ive said to you i said to you and i wouldnt have no other man know nothin about it if anybody else should hear of this thing and go north and get ahead of me it would bewell i dont know what to say it would be ive such feelins about it ive offered to take you in because youve got a farm and because i think youre a good man and would know how to take care of auks when they was hatched but theres a lot for me to do theres maps to look over and timetables and i must be off but ill stop in tomorrer abner and well talk this over again  when pearson had gone abner sat and stared steadily at a knothole in the floor mrsÂ b he said to himself has allus been a great one on eggs shes the greatest one on eggs i ever knowed if shed go in now the thing ud be just as good as done when she knows whats ahead of us she oughter go in thats all ive got to say about it  the significance of these reflections depended upon the fact that mrsÂ batterfield had a small income it was upon this fact that there depended the other fact that there were three meals a day in the batterfield household it was this fact also which was the cause of mrÂ joe pearsons visit to the library he was very well acquainted with abner although he knew mrsÂ batterfield but slightly but he was aware of her income  after reflecting for about twenty minutes or half an hour upon the exciting proposition which had been made to him abner grew very impatient no use of my stayin here he said theres nobody goin to get out books in this hot weather so ill just shut up shop and go home i never did want to see mrsÂ batterfield as much as i want to see her now  libraries seem to shut up early said mrsÂ batterfield as her husband walked into the front yard  yes they do said abner in summertime  all the way from town he had been rehearsing to himself the story he was going to tell but he hadnt finished it yet and he wanted to get it all straight before he began so he walked over to the barn and sat down on an inverted horsebucket to get his story all straight before he began when he got it all straight he concluded not to tell it until after supper but when that meal was finished and everything had been cleared away and mrsÂ batterfield had gone to sit on the front porch as was her evening custom he sat down by her and told his story  he made the tale as attractive as he possibly could make it he even omitted the fact that joe pearson intended to sell his first eggs for sixteen hundred dollars instead of eighteen hundred and he diminished by very many hundred miles the length of joe pearsons probable journey to the north in fact had his suppositions been nearly correct the remaining specimens of the great auk would have been birds of very temperate dispositions so far as latitude was concerned  mrsÂ batterfield listened with great attention she was engaged upon some sewing on which her eyes were fixed but her ears drank in every word that abner said when he had finished she laid down her sewing for it was beginning to get a little dark for even her sharp eyes and remarked and he wants some warm clothes furs i suppose  yes said abner i expect theyd be furs  and travelling expenses she asked  yes i suppose hed want help in that way of course since hes makin me such a big offer hell expect me to put in somethin  mrsÂ batterfield made no reply but folded up her sewing and went indoors he waited until she had time to retire then he closed the house and went up himself  shell want to sleep on that said he itll be a good thing for her to sleep on it she maynt like it at first but ill go at her agin tomorrer and im goin to stick to it i reckon itll be the worst rassle we ever had but its blackgum agin thunder and im blackgum  when abner reached his chamber he found his wife sitting quietly by the table on which burned a lamp  hello said he i thought youd be abed and asleep  i didnt want to do my talkin out front said she for there might be people passin along the road i think you said this was to be a case of blackgum agin thunder  yes said abner in a somewhat uncertain tone  well then said mrsÂ batterfield im thunder  it was very late when that couple went to bed but it was very early the next morning when abner rose he split a great deal of firewood before breakfast and very soon after that meal he put his hoe on his shoulder and went to his cornfield he remembered that there were three rows of corn which he had hoed upon only one side  the library was not opened that day and it remained closed until mrÂ brownsill returned the failure in the supply of books did not occasion very much comment in the town for everybody agreed that mrÂ brownsill was a good man and ought to have a holiday there were four persons in the placea little girl with plaited hair and a sister a colored woman with a bad tooth and joe pearsonwho knew that abner batterfield had held for a time the office of librarian  when his vacation had expired mrÂ brownsill came home and on the second morning after his arrival abner batterfield appeared before him  i had to come in town said abner and so i thought id step in here and see about my pay  the librarian looked at him how long were you here he asked ive been told that the library was shut up for two weeks  i was here for three quarters of a day said abner thats about as near as i can calculate  the librarian took up a pencil and made a calculation  by the way said he you must have done some business i miss our copy of bucks theological dictionary but i find no entry about it  that was took out as change said abner five cents for a duodecimo for a week and the rest in change if the woman hasnt brought it back she owes a weeks fine  who was the woman asked the librarian  i dont know said abner but she has a daughter with plaited hair and a small sister while im in town ill try to look em up  in the meantime said mrÂ brownsill ill have to charge you for the book and deducting your pay for three quarters of a day you now owe me seventyfive cents i dont suppose theres any use talking about the fines i have got down against you  i dont believe there is said abner  the librarian could not help smiling so dejected was the tone in which these last words were spoken  by the way said he how about your great fight you were talking aboutblackgum agin thunder how did that turn out  abner in his turn smiled  blackgum was split as fine as matches said he  i cant help feeling sorry for the old fellow said the next neighbor when john had concluded his story i always have sympathy with great ambitions  and if joe pearson had got far enough north said the mistress of the house he would have found no eggs but he might have stumbled over the north pole  it is a pity the old fellow had to tell his wife said the master of the house women ruin great ambitions by too much commonsense a great many of the inventions we now consider necessary would have been utterly lost to us if some mens brains had not been a little addled a woman would have set them straight and that would have been the end that is the reason so few women are inventors they have too much sense  that is a very lefthanded compliment said the daughter of the house you are always decrying inventions which is strange how would you like to sail a ship without steam  it would be a great deal pleasanter my dear and much cleaner  there are patent contrivances for gardenwork said john gayther and i dont say that they dont help especially in plantingtime but like the captain i prefer the old ways that bring the gardener and the earth close together the old simple instruments seem like friends i feel as if something went from me through the hoehandle to the plants and when the seed drops from my hands instead of from a seeder it seems to me it takes a message direct from me to the earth that receives it                                                the stories are all told the winter has come the orchard is stripped of its leaves and sere and brown they cover the garden paths and are strewn over the box borders the fruits are all garnered the bare vines that cover the summerhouse are like dead memories of what has been the vegetablebeds are empty the black frost has settled upon bloom and foliage on the upper terrace the sweet blithe song of the red thrush has ceased the family have gone to a sunnier clime and john gayther walks alone in his garden
