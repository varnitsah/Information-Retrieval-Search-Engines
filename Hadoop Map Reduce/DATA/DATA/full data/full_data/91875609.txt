91875609	a crystal age  by w h hudson     preface  romances of the future however fantastic they may be have for most of us a perennial if mild interest since they are born of a very common feelinga sense of dissatisfaction with the existing order of things combined with a vague faith in or hope of a better one to come the picture put before us is false we knew it would be false before looking at it since we cannot imagine what is unknown any more than we can build without materials our mental atmosphere surrounds and shuts us in like our own skins no one can boast that he has broken out of that prison the vast unbounded prospect lies before us but as the poet mournfully adds clouds and darkness rest upon it nevertheless we cannot suppress all curiosity or help asking one another what is your dreamyour ideal what is your news from nowhere or rather what is the result of the little shake your hand has given to the old pasteboard toy with a dozen bits of colored glass for contents and most important of all can you present it in a narrative or romance which will enable me to pass an idle hour not disagreeably how for instance does it compare in this respect with other prophetic books on the shelf  i am not referring to living authors least of all to that flamingo of letters who for the last decade or so has been a wonder to our island birds for what could i say of him that is not known to every onethat he is the tallest of fowls land or water of a most singular shape and has blacktipped crimson wings folded under his delicate rosecolored plumage these other books referred to written let us say from thirty or forty years to a century or two ago amuse us in a way their poor dead authors never intended most amusing are the dead ones who take themselves seriously whose books are pulpits quaintly carved and decorated with precious stones and silken canopies in which they stand and preach to or at their contemporaries  in like manner in going through this book of mine after so many years i am amused at the way it is colored by the little cults and crazes and modes of thought of the eighties of the last century they were so important then and now if remembered at all they appear so trivial it pleases me to be diverted in this way at a crystal ageto find in fact that i have not stood still while the world has been moving  this criticism refers to the case the habit of the book rather than to its spirit since when we write we do as the red man thought impart something of our souls to the paper and it is probable that if i were to write a new dream of the future it would though in some respects very different from this still be a dream and picture of the human race in its forest period  alas that in this case the wish cannot induce belief for now i remember another thing which nature saidthat earthly excellence can come in no way but one and the ending of passion and strife is the beginning of decay it is indeed a hard saying and the hardest lesson we can learn of her without losing love and bidding goodby forever to hope  w h h       a crystal age   chapter 1  i do not quite know how it happened my recollection of the whole matter ebbing in a somewhat clouded condition i fancy i had gone somewhere on a botanizing expedition but whether at home or abroad i dont know at all events i remember that i had taken up the study of plants with a good deal of enthusiasm and that while hunting for some variety in the mountains i sat down to rest on the edge of a ravine perhaps it was on the ledge of an overhanging rock anyhow if i remember rightly the ground gave way all about me precipitating me below the fall was a very considerable oneprobably thirty or forty feet or more and i was rendered unconscious how long i lay there under the heap of earth and stones carried down in my fall it is impossible to say perhaps a long time but at last i came to myself and struggled up from the debris like a mole coming to the surface of the earth to feel the genial sunshine on his dim eyeballs i found myself standing oddly enough on all fours in an immense pit created by the overthrow of a gigantic dead tree with a girth of about thirty or forty feet the tree itself had rolled down to the bottom of the ravine but the pit in which it had left the huge stumps of severed roots was i found situated in a gentle slope at the top of the bank how then i could have fallen seemingly so far from no height at all puzzled me greatly it looked as if the solid earth had been indulging in some curious transformation pranks during those moments or minutes of insensibility another singular circumstance was that i had a great mass of small fibrous rootlets tightly woven about my whole person so that i was like a colossal basketworm in its case or a big manshaped bottle covered with wickerwork it appeared as if the roots had grown round me luckily they were quite sapless and brittle and without bothering my brains too much about the matter i set to work to rid myself of them after stripping the woody covering off i found that my tourist suit of rough scotch homespun had not suffered much harm although the cloth exuded a damp moldy smell also that my thicksoled climbing boots had assumed a cracked rusty appearance as if i had been engaged in some brickfield operations while my felt hat was in such a discolored and battered condition that i felt almost ashamed to put it on my head my watch was gone perhaps i had not been wearing it but my pocketbook in which i had my money was safe in my breast pocket  glad and grateful at having escaped with unbroken bones from such a dangerous accident i set out walking along the edge of the ravine which soon broadened to a valley running between two steep hills and then seeing water at the bottom and feeling very dry i ran down the slope to get a drink lying flat on my chest to slake my thirst animal fashion i was amazed at the reflection the water gave back of my face it was skin and hair thickly encrusted with clay and rootlets having taken a long drink i threw off my clothes to have a bath and after splashing about for half an hour managed to rid my skin of its accumulations of dirt while drying in the wind i shook the loose sand and clay from my garments then dressed and feeling greatly refreshed proceeded on my walk  for an hour or so i followed the valley in its many windings but failing to see any dwellingplace i ascended a hill to get a view of the surrounding country the prospect which disclosed itself when i had got a couple of hundred feet above the surrounding level appeared unfamiliar the hills among which i had been wandering were now behind me before me spread a wide rolling country beyond which rose a mountain range resembling in the distance blue bankedup clouds with summits and peaks of pearly whiteness looking on this scene i could hardly refrain from shouting with joy so glad did the sunlit expanse of earth and the pure exhilarating mountain breeze make me feel the season was late summerthat was plain to see the ground was moist as if from recent showers and the earth everywhere had that intense living greenness with which it reclothes itself when the greater heats are over but the foliage of the woods was already beginning to be touched here and there with the yellow and russet hues of decay a more tranquil and soulsatisfying scene could not be imagined the dear old mother earth was looking her very best while the shifting golden sunlight the mysterious haze in the distance and the glint of a wide stream not very far off seemed to spiritualize her happy autumn fields and bring them into a closer kinship with the blue overarching sky there was one large house or mansion in sight but no town nor even a hamlet and not one solitary spire in vain i scanned the horizon waiting impatiently to see the distant puff of white steam from some passing engine this troubled me not a little for i had no idea that i had drifted so far from civilization in my search for specimens or whatever it was that brought me to this pretty primitive wilderness not quite a wilderness however for there within a short hours walk of the hill stood the one great stone mansion close to the river i had mentioned there were also horses and cows in sight and a number of scattered sheep were grazing on the hillside beneath me  strange to relate i met with a little misadventure on account of the sheepan animal which one is accustomed to regard as of a timid and inoffensive nature when i set out at a brisk pace to walk to the house i have spoken of in order to make some inquiries there a few of the sheep that happened to be near began to bleat loudly as if alarmed and by and by they came hurrying after me apparently in a great state of excitement i did not mind them much but presently a pair of horses attracted by their bleatings also seemed struck at my appearance and came at a swift gallop to within twenty yards of me they were magnificentlooking brutes evidently a pair of wellgroomed carriage horses for their coats which were of a fine bronze color sparkled wonderfully in the sunshine in other respects they were very unlike carriage animals for they had tails reaching to the ground like funeral horses and immense black leonine manes which gave them a strikingly bold and somewhat formidable appearance for some moments they stood with heads erect gazing fixedly at me and then simultaneously delivered a snort of defiance or astonishment so loud and sudden that it startled me like the report of a gun this tremendous equine blast brought yet another enemy on the field in the shape of a huge milkwhite bull with long horns a very noble kind of animal but one which i always prefer to admire from behind a hedge or at a distance through a fieldglass fortunately his wrathful mutterings gave me timely notice of his approach and without waiting to discover his intentions i incontinently fled down the slope to the refuge of a grove or belt of trees clothing the lower portion of the hillside spent and panting from my run i embraced a big tree and turning to face the foe found that i had not been followed sheep horses and bull were all grouped together just where i had left them apparently holding a consultation or comparing notes  the trees where i had sought shelter were old and grew here and there singly or in scattered groups it was a pretty wilderness of mingled tree shrub and flower i was surprised to find here some very large and ancientlooking figtrees and numbers of wasps and flies were busy feeding on a few overripe figs on the higher branches honeybees also roamed about everywhere extracting sweets from the autumn bloom and filling the sunny glades with a soft monotonous murmur of sound walking on full of happy thoughts and a keen sense of the sweetness of life pervading me i presently noticed that a multitude of small birds were gathering about me flitting through the trees overhead and the bushes on either hand but always keeping near me apparently as much excited at my presence as if i had been a gigantic owl or some such unnatural monster their increasing numbers and incessant excited chirping and chattering at first served to amuse but in the end began to irritate me i observed too that the alarm was spreading and that larger birds usually shy of menpigeons jays and magpies i fancied they werenow began to make their appearance could it be thought i with some concern that i had wandered into some uninhabited wilderness to cause so great a commotion among the little feathered people i very soon dismissed this as an idle thought for one does not find houses domestic animals and fruittrees in desert places no it was simply the inherent cantankerousness of little birds which caused them to annoy me looking about on the ground for something to throw at them i found in the grass a freshlyfallen walnut and breaking the shell i quickly ate the contents never had anything tasted so pleasant to me before but it had a curious effect on me for whereas before eating it i had not felt hungry i now seemed to be famishing and began excitedly searching about for more nuts they were lying everywhere in the greatest abundance for without knowing it i had been walking through a grove composed in large part of old walnuttrees nut after nut was picked up and eagerly devoured and i must have eaten four or five dozen before my ravenous appetite was thoroughly appeased during this feast i had paid no attention to the birds but when my hunger was over i began again to feel annoyed at their trivial persecutions and so continued to gather the fallen nuts to throw at them it amused and piqued me at the same time to see how wide of the mark my missiles went i could hardly have hit a haystack at a distance of ten yards after half an hours vigorous practice my right hand began to recover its lost cunning and i was at last greatly delighted when of my nuts went hissing like a bullet through the leaves not further than a yard from the wren or whatever the little beggar was i had aimed at their impertinences did not like this at all they began to find out that i was a rather dangerous person to meddle with their ranks were broken they became demoralized and scattered in all directions and i was finally left master of the field  dolt that i am i suddenly exclaimed to be fooling away my time when the nearest railway station or hotel is perhaps twenty miles away  i hurried on but when i got to the end of the grove on the green sward near some laurel and juniper bushes i came on an excavation apparently just made the loose earth which had been dug out looking quite fresh and moist the hole or foss was narrow about five feet deep and seven feet long and looked i imagined curiously like a grave a few yards away was a pile of dry brushwood and some faggots bound together with ropes of straw all apparently freshly cut from the neighboring bushes as i stood there wondering what these things meant i happened to glance away in the direction of the house where i intended to call which was not now visible owing to an intervening grove of tall trees and was surprised to discover a troop of about fifteen persons advancing along the valley in my direction before them marched a tall whitebearded old man next came eight men bearing a platform on their shoulders with some heavy burden resting upon it and behind these followed the others i began to think that they were actually carrying a corpse with the intention of giving it burial in that very pit beside which i was standing and although it looked most unlike a funeral for no person in the procession wore black the thought strengthened to a conviction when i became able to distinguish a recumbent humanlike form in a shroudlike covering on the platform it seemed altogether a very unusual proceeding and made me feel extremely uncomfortable so much so that i considered it prudent to step back behind the bushes where i could watch the doings of the processionists without being observed  led by the old manwho carried suspended by thin chains a large bronze censer or brazier rather which sent out a thin continuous wreath of smokethey came straight on to the pit and after depositing their burden on the grass remained standing for some minutes apparently to rest after their walk all conversing together but in subdued tones so that i could not catch their words although standing within fifteen yards of the grave the uncoffined corpse which seemed that of a fullgrown man was covered with a white cloth and rested on a thick straw mat provided with handles along the sides on these things however i bestowed but a hasty glance so profoundly absorbed had i become in watching the group of living human beings before me for they were certainly utterly unlike any fellowcreatures i had ever encountered before the old man was tall and spare and from his snowywhite majestic beard i took him to be about seventy years old but he was straight as an arrow and his free movements and elastic tread were those of a much younger man his head was adorned with a dark red skullcap and he wore a robe covering the whole body and reaching to the ankles of a deep yellow or rhubarb color but his long wide sleeves under his robe were dark red embroidered with yellow flowers the other men had no covering on their heads and their luxuriant hair worn to the shoulders was in most cases very dark their garments were also made in a different fashion and consisted of a kiltlike dress which came halfway to the knees a pale yellow shirt fitting tight to the skin and over it a loose sleeveless vest the entire legs were cased in stockings curious in pattern and color the women wore garments resembling those of the men but the tightfitting sleeves reached only halfway to the elbow the rest of the arm being bare and the outergarment was all in one piece resembling a long sleeveless jacket reaching below the hips the color of their dresses varied but in most cases different shades of blue and subdued yellow predominated in all the stockings showed deeper and richer shades of color than the other garments and in their curiously segmented appearance and in the harmonious arrangement of the tints they seemed to represent the skins of pythons and other beautifully variegated serpents all wore low shoes of an orangebrown color fitting closely so as to display the shape of the foot  from the moment of first seeing them i had had no doubt about the sex of the tall old leader of the procession his shining white beard being as conspicuous at a distance as a shield or a banner but looking at the others i was at first puzzled to know whether the party was composed of men or women or of both so much did they resemble each other in height in their smooth faces and in the length of their hair on a closer inspection i noticed the difference of dress of the sexes also that the men if not sterner had faces at all events less mild and soft in expression than the women and also a slight perceptible down on the cheeks and upper lip  after a first hasty survey of the group in general i had eyes for only one person in ita fine graceful girl about fourteen years old and the youngest by far of the party a description of this girl will give some idea albeit a very poor one of the faces and general appearance of this strange people i had stumbled on her dress if a garment so brief can be called a dress showed a slatyblue pattern on a strawcolored ground while her stockings were darker shades of the same colors her eyes at the distance i stood from her appeared black or nearly black but when seen closely they proved to be greena wonderfully pure tender seagreen and the others i found had eyes of the same hue her hair fell to her shoulders but it was very wavy or curly and strayed in small tendrillike tresses over her neck forehead and cheeks in color it was golden blackthat is black in shade but when touched with sunlight every hair became a thread of shining redgold and in some lights it looked like ravenblack hair powdered with golddust as to her features the forehead was broader and lower the nose larger and the lips more slender than in our most beautiful female types the color was also different the delicately molded mouth being purplered instead of the approved cherry or coral hue while the complexion was a clear dark and the color which mantled the cheeks in moments of excitement was a dim or dusky rather than a rosy red  the exquisite form and face of this young girl from the first moment of seeing her produced a very deep impression and i continued watching her every movement and gesture with an intense even a passionate interest she had a quantity of flowers in her hand but these sweet emblems i observed were all gayly colored which seemed strange for in most places white flowers are used in funeral ceremonies some of the men who had followed the body carried in their hands broad threecornered bronze shovels with short black handles and these they had dropped upon the grass on arriving at the grave presently the old man stooped and drew the covering back from the dead ones facea rigid marblewhite face set in a loose mass of black hair the others gathered round and some standing others kneeling bent on the still countenance before them a long earnest gaze as if taking an eternal farewell of one they had deeply loved at this moment the the beautiful girl i have described all at once threw herself with a sobbing cry on her knees before the corpse and stooping kissed the face with passionate grief oh my beloved must we now leave you alone forever she cried between the sobs that shook her whole frame oh my lovemy lovemy love will you come back to us no more  the others all appeared deeply affected at her grief and presently a young man standing by raised her from the ground and drew her gently against his side where for some minutes she continued convulsively weeping some of the other men now passed ropes through the handles of the straw mat on which the corpse rested and raising it from the platform lowered it into the foss each person in turn then advanced and dropped some flowers into the grave uttering the one word farewell as they did so after which the loose earth was shoveled in with the bronze implements over the mound the hurdle on which the straw mat had rested was then placed the dry brushwood and faggots heaped over it and ignited with a coal from the brazier white smoke and crackling flames issued anon from the pile and in a few moments the whole was in a fierce blaze  standing around they all waited in silence until the fire had burnt itself out then the old man advancing stretched his arms above the white and still smoking ashes and cried in a loud voice farewell forever o well beloved son with deep sorrow and tears we have given you back to earth but not until she has made the sweet grass and flowers grow again on this spot scorched and made desolate with fire shall our hearts be healed of their wound and forget their grief       chapter 2  the thrilling pathetic tone in which these words were uttered affected me not a little and when the ceremony was over i continued staring vacantly at the speaker ignorant of the fact that the beautiful young girl had her wideopen startled eyes fixed on the bush which i vainly imagined concealed me from view  all at once she cried out oh father look there who is that strangelooking man watching us from behind the bushes  they all turned and then i felt that fourteen or fifteen pairs of very keen eyes were on me seeing me very plainly indeed for in my curiosity and excitement i had come out from the thicker bushes to place myself behind a ragged almost leafless shrub which afforded the merest apology for a shelter putting a bold face on the matter although i did not feel very easy i came out and advanced to them removing my battered old hat on the way and bowing repeatedly to the assembled company my courteous salutation was not returned but all with increasing astonishment pictured on their faces continued staring at me as if they were looking on some grotesque apparition thinking it best to give an account of myself at once and to apologize for intruding on their mysteries i addressed myself to the old man  i really beg your pardon i said for having disturbed you at such an inconvenient time and while you are engaged in thesethese solemn rites but i assure you sir it has been quite accidental i happened to be walking here when i saw you coming and thought it best to step out of the way untilwell until the funeral was over the fact is i met with a serious accident in the mountains over there i fell down into a ravine and a great heap of earth and stones fell on and stunned me and i do not know how long i lay there before i recovered my senses i daresay i am trespassing but i am a perfect stranger here and quite lost andand perhaps a little confused after my fall and perhaps you will kindly tell me where to go to get some refreshment and find out where i am  your story is a very strange one said the old man in reply after a pause of considerable duration that you are a perfect stranger in this place is evident from your appearance your uncouth dress and your thick speech  his words made me blush hotly although i should not have minded his very personal remarks much if that beautiful girl had not been standing there listening to everything my uncouth garments by the way were made by a fashionable west end tailor and fitted me perfectly although just now they were of course very dirty it was also a surprise to hear that i had a thick speech since i had always been considered a remarkably clear speaker and good singer and had frequently both sung and recited in public at amateur entertainments  after a distressing interval of silence during which they all continued regarding me with unabated curiosity the old gentleman condescended to address me again and asked me my name and country  my country said i with the natural pride of a briton is england and my name is smith  no such country is known to me he returned nor have i ever heard such a name as yours  i was rather taken aback at his words and yet did not just then by any means realize their full import i was thinking only about my name for without having penetrated into any perfectly savage country i had been about the world a great deal for a young man visiting the colonies india yokohama and other distant places and i had never yet been told that the name of smith was an unfamiliar one  i hardly know what to say i returned for he was evidently waiting for me to add something more to what i had stated it rather staggers me to hear that my namewell you have not heard of me of course but there have been a great many distinguished men of the same name sydney smith for instance andand several others it mortified me just then to find that i had forgotten all the other distinguished smiths  he shook his head and continued watching my face  not heard of them i exclaimed well i suppose you have heard of some of my great countrymen beaconsfield gladstone darwin burnejones ruskin queen victoria tennyson george eliot herbert spencer general gordon lord randolph churchill  as he continued to shake his head after each name i at length paused  who are all these people you have named he asked  they are all great and illustrious men and women who have a worldwide reputation i answered  and are there no more of themhave you told me the names of all the great people you have ever known or heard of he said with a curious smile  no indeed i answered nettled at his words and manner it would take me until tomorrow to name all the great men i have ever heard of i suppose you have heard the names of napoleon wellington nelson dante luther calvin bismarck voltaire  he still shook his head  well then i continued homer socrates alexander the great confucius zoroaster plato shakespeare then growing thoroughly desperate i added in a burst noah moses columbus hannibal adam and eve  i am quite sure that i have never heard of any of these names he answered still with that curious smile nevertheless i can understand your surprise it sometimes happens that the mind owing an an imperfect adjustment of its faculties resembles the uneducated vision in its method of judgment regarding the things which are near as great and important and those further away as less important according to their distance in such a case the individuals one hears about or associates with come to be looked upon as the great and illustrious beings of the world and all men in all places are expected to be familiar with their names but come my children our sorrowful task is over let us now return to the house come with us smith and you shall have the refreshment you require  i was of course pleased with the invitation but did not relish being addressed as smith like some mere laborer or other common person tramping about the country  the long disconcerting scrutiny i had been subjected to had naturally made me very uncomfortable and caused me to drop a little behind the others as we walked towards the house the old man however still kept at my side but whether from motives of courtesy or because he wished to badger me a little more about my uncouth appearance and defective intellect i was not sure i was not anxious to continue the conversation which had not proved very satisfactory moreover the beautiful girl i have already mentioned so frequently was now walking just before me hand in hand with the young man who had raised her from the ground i was absorbed in admiration of her graceful figure andshall i be forgiven for mentioning such a detailher exquisitely rounded legs under her brief and beautiful garments to my mind the garment was quite long enough every time i spoke for my companion still maintained the conversation and i was obliged to reply she hung back a little to catch my words at such times she would also turn her pretty head partially round so as to see me then her glances beginning at my face would wander down to my legs and her lips would twitch and curl a little seeming to express disgust and amusement at the same time i was beginning to hate my legs or rather my trousers for i considered that under them i had as good a pair of calves as any man in the company  presently i thought of something to say something very simple which my dignified old friend would be able to answer without intimating that he considered me a wild man of the woods or an escaped lunatic  can you tell me i said pleasantly what is the name of your nearest town or city how far it is from this place and how i can get there  at this question or series of questions the young girl turned quite round and waiting until i was even with her she continued her walk at my side although still holding her companions hand  the old man looked at me with a grave smilethat smile was fast becoming intolerableand said are you so fond of honey smith you shall have as much as you require without disturbing the bees they are now taking advantage of this second spring to lay by a sufficient provision before winter sets in  after pondering some time over these enigmatical words i said i daresay we are at cross purposes again i mean i added hurriedly seeing the inquiring look on his face that we do not exactly understand each other for the subject of honey was not in my thoughts  what then do you mean by a city he asked  what do i mean why a city i take it is nothing more than a collection or congeries of houseshundreds and thousands or hundreds of thousands of houses all built close together where one can live very comfortably for years without seeing a blade of grass  i am afraid he returned that the accident you met with in the mountains must have caused some injury to your brain for i cannot in any other way account for these strange fantasies  do you mean seriously to tell me sir that you have never even heard of the existence of a city where millions of human beings live crowded together in a small space of course i mean a small space comparatively for in some cities you might walk all day without getting into the fields and a city like that might be compared to a beehive so large that a bee might fly in a straight line all day without getting out of it  it struck me the moment i finished speaking that this comparison was not quite right somehow but he did not ask me to explain he had evidently ceased to pay any attention to what i said the girl looked at me with an expression of pity not to say contempt and i felt at the same time ashamed and vexed this served to rouse a kind of dogged spirit in me and i returned to the subject once more  surely i said you have heard of such cities as paris vienna rome athens babylon jerusalem  he only shook his head and walked on in silence  and london london is the capital of england why i exclaimed beginning to see light and wondering at myself for not having seen it sooner you are at present talking to me in the english language  i fail to understand your meaning and am even inclined to doubt that you have any said he a little ruffled i am addressing you in the language of human beingsthat is all  well it seems awfully puzzling said i but i hope you dont think i have been indulging inwell tarradiddles then seeing that i was making matters no clearer i added i mean that i have not been telling untruths  i could not think that he answered sternly it would indeed be a clouded mind which could mistake mere disordered fancies for willful offenses against the truth i have no doubt that when you have recovered from the effects of your late accident these vain thoughts and imaginations will cease to trouble you  and in the meantime perhaps i had better say as little as possible said i with considerable temper at present we do not seem able to understand each other at all  you are right we do not he said and then added with a grave smile although i must allow that this last remark of yours is quite intelligible  im glad of that i returned it is distressing to talk and not to be understood it is like men calling to each other in a high wind hearing voices but not able to distinguish words  again i understand you said he approvingly while the beautiful girl bestowed on me the coveted reward of a smile which had no pity or contempt in it  i think i continued determined to follow up this new train of ideas on which i had so luckily stumbled that we are not so far apart in mind after all about some things we stand quite away from each other like the widely diverging branches of a tree but like the branches we have a meetingplace and this is i fancy in that part of our nature where our feelings are my accident in the hills has not disarranged that part of me i am sure and i can give you an instance a little while ago when i was standing behind the bushes watching you all i saw this young lady  here a look of surprise and inquiry from the girl warned me that i was once more plunging into obscurity  when i saw you i continued somewhat amused at her manner cast yourself on the earth to kiss the cold face of one you had loved in life i felt the tears of sympathy come to my own eyes  oh how strange she exclaimed flashing on me a glance from her green mysterious eyes and then to increase my wonder and delight she deliberately placed her hand in mine  and yet not strange said the old man by way of comment on her words  it seemed strange to yoletta that one so unlike us outwardly should be so like us in heart remarked the young man at her side  there was something about this speech which i did not altogether like though i could not detect anything like sarcasm in the tone of the speaker  and yet continued the lovely girl you never saw him livingnever heard his sweet voice which still seems to come back to me like a melody from the distance  was he your father i asked  the question seemed to surprise her very much he is our father she returned with a glance at the old gentleman which seemed strange for he certainly looked aged enough to be her greatgrandfather  he smiled and said you forget my daughter that i am as little known to this stranger to our country as all the great and illustrious personages he has mentioned are to us  at this point i began to lose interest in the conversation it was enough for me to feel that i held that precious hand in mine and presently i felt tempted to administer a gentle squeeze she looked at me and smiled then glanced over my whole person the survey finishing at my boots which seemed to have a disagreeable fascination for her she shivered slightly and withdrew her hand from mine and in my heart i cursed those rusty thicksoled monstrosities in which my feet were cased however we were all on a better footing now and i resolved for the future to avoid all dangerous topics historical and geographical and confine myself to subjects relating to the emotional side of our natures  at the end our way to the house was over a green turf among great trees as in a park and as there was no road or path the first sight of the building seen near when we emerged from the trees came as a surprise there were no gardens lawns inclosures or hedges near it nor cultivation of any kind it was like a wilderness and the house produced the effect of a noble ruin it was a hilly stone country where masses of stone cropped out here and there among the woods and on the green slopes and it appeared that the house had been raised on the natural foundation of one of these rocks standing a little above the river that flowed behind it the stone was gray tinged with red and the whole rock covering an acre or so of ground had been worn or hewn down to form a vast platform which stood about a dozen feet above the surrounding green level the sloping and buttressed sides of the platform were clothed with ivy wild shrubs and various flowering plants broad shallow steps led up to the house which was all of the same materialreddishgray stone and the main entrance was beneath a lofty portico the sculptured entablature of which was supported by sixteen huge caryatides standing on round massive pedestals the building was not high as a castle or cathedral it was a dwellingplace and had but one floor and resembled a ruin to my eyes because of the extreme antiquity of its appearance the weatherworn condition and massiveness of the sculptured surfaces and the masses of ancient ivy covering it in places on the central portion of the building rested a great domeshaped roof resembling ground glass of a pale reddish tint producing the effect of a cloud resting on the stony summit of a hill  i remained standing on the grass about thirty yards from the first steps after the others had gone in all but the old gentleman who still kept with me byandby withdrawing to a stone bench under an oaktree he motioned to me to take a seat by his side he said nothing but appeared to be quietly enjoying my undisguised surprise and admiration  a noble mansion i remarked at length to my venerable host feeling englishmanlike a sudden great access of respect towards the owner of a big house men in such a position can afford to be as eccentric as they like even to the wearing of carnivalesque garments burying their friends or relations in a park and shaking their heads over such names as smith or shakespeare a glorious place it must have cost a pot of money and taken a long time to build  what you mean by a pot of money i do not know said he when you add a long time to build i am also puzzled to understand you for are not all houses like the forest of trees the human race the world we live in eternal  if they stand forever they are so in one sense i suppose i answered beginning to fear that i had already unfortunately broken the rule i had so recently laid down for my own guidance but the trees of the forest to which you compare a house spring from seed do they not and so have a beginning their end also like the end of man is to die and return to the dust  that is true he returned it is moreover a truth which i do not now hear for the first time but it has no connection with the subject we are discussing men pass away and others take their places trees also decay but the forest does not die or suffer for the loss of individual trees is it not the same with the house and the family inhabiting it which is one with the house and endures forever albeit the members composing it must all in time return to the dust  is there no decay then of the materials composing a house  assuredly there is even the hardest stone is worn in time by the elements or by the footsteps of many generations of men but the stone that decays is removed and the house does not suffer  i have never looked at it quite in this light before said i but surely we can build a house whenever we wish  build a house whenever we wish he repeated with that astonished look which threatened to become the permanent expression of his faceso long as he had me to talk with at any rate  yes or pull one down if we find it unsuitable but his look of horror here made me pause and to finish the sentence i added of course you must admit that a house had a beginning  yes and so had the forest the mountain the human race the world itself but the origin of all these things is covered with the mists of time  does it never happen then that a house however substantially built  however what but never mind you continue to speak in riddles pray finish what you were saying  does it never happen that a house is overthrown by some natural forceby floods or subsidence of the earth or is destroyed by lightning or fire  no he answered with such tremendous emphasis that he almost made me jump from my seat are you alone so ignorant of these things that you speak of building and of pulling down a house  well i fancied i knew a lot of things once i answered with a sigh but perhaps i was mistakenpeople often are i should like to hear you say something more about all these thingsi mean about the house and the family and the rest of it  are you not then able to readhave you been taught absolutely nothing  oh yes certainly i can read i answered joyfully seizing at once on the suggestion which seemed to open a simple pleasant way of escape from the difficulty i am by no means a studious person perhaps i am never so happy as when i have nothing to read nevertheless i do occasionally look into books and greatly appreciate their gentle kindly ways they never shut themselves up with a sound like a slap or throw themselves at your head for a duffer but seem silently grateful for being read even by a stupid person and teach you very patiently like a pretty meekspirited young girl  i am very pleased to hear it said he you shall read and learn all these things for yourself which is the best method or perhaps i ought rather to say you shall by reading recall them to your mind for it is impossible to believe that it has always been in its present pitiable condition i can only attribute such a mental state with its disordered fancies about cities or immense hives of human beings and other things equally frightful to contemplate and its absolute vacancy concerning ordinary matters of knowledge to the grave accident you met with in the hills doubtless in falling your head was struck and injured by a stone let us hope that you will soon recover possession of your memory and other faculties and now let us repair to the eatingroom for it is best to refresh the body first and the mind afterwards       chapter 3  we ascended the steps and passing through the portico went into the hall by what seemed to me a doorless way it was not really so as i discovered later the doors of which there were several some of colored glass others of some other material were simply thrust back into receptacles within the wall itself which was five or six feet thick the hall was the noblest i had ever seen it had a stone and bronze fireplace some twenty or thirty feet long on one side and several tall arched doorways on the other the spaces between the doors were covered with sculpture its material being a bluegray stone combined or inlaid with a yellow metal the effect being indescribably rich the floor was mosaic of many dark colors but with no definite pattern and the concave roof was deep red in color though beautiful it was somewhat somber as the light was not strong at all events that is how it struck me at first on coming in from the bright sunlight nor it appeared was i alone in experiencing such a feeling as soon as we were inside the old gentleman removing his cap and passing his thin fingers through his white hair looked around him and addressing some of the others who were bringing in small round tables and placing them about the hall said no no let us sup this evening where we can look at the sky  the tables were immediately taken away  now some of those who were in the hall or who came in with the tables had not attended the funeral and these were all astonished on seeing me they did not stare at me but i of course saw the expression on their faces and noticed that the others who had made my acquaintance at the graveside whispered in their ears to explain my presence this made me extremely uncomfortable and it was a relief when they began to go out again  one of the men was seated near me he was of those who had assisted in carrying the corpse and he now turned to me and remarked you have been a long time in the open air and probably feel the change as much as we do  i assented and he rose and walked away to the far end of the hall where a great door stood facing the one by which we had entered from the spot where i wasa distance of forty or fifty feet perhapsthis door appeared to be of polished slate of a very dark gray its surface ornamented with very large horsechestnut leaves of brass or copper or both for they varied in shade from bright yellow to deepest copperred it was a double door with agate handles and first pressing on one handle then on the other he thrust it back into the walls on either side revealing a new thing of beauty to my eyes for behind the vanished door was a window the sight of which came suddenly before me like a celestial vision sunshine wind cloud and rain had evidently inspired the artist who designed it but i did not at the time understand the meaning of the symbolic figures appearing in the picture below with loosened dark goldenred hair and ambercolored garments fluttering in the wind stood a graceful female figure on the summit of a gray rock over the rock and as high as her knees slanted the thin branches of some mountain shrub the strong wind even now stripping them of their remaining yellow and russet leaves whirling them aloft and away round the womans head was a garland of ivy leaves and she was gazing aloft with expectant face stretching up her arms as if to implore or receive some precious gift from the sky above against the slatygray cloudwrack four exquisite slender girlforms appeared with loose hair silvergray drapery and gauzy wings as of ephemerae flying in pursuit of the cloud each carried a quantity of flowers shaped like lilies in her dress held up with the left hand one carried red lilies another yellow the third violet and the last blue and the gauzy wings and drapery of each was also touched in places with the same hue as the flowers she carried looking back in their flight they were all with the disengaged hand throwing down lilies to the standing figure  this lovely window gave a fresh charm to the whole apartment while the sunlight falling through it served also to reveal other beauties which i had not observed one that quickly drew and absorbed my attention was a piece of statuary on the floor at some distance from me and going to it i stood for some time gazing on it in the greatest delight it was a statue about onethird the size of life of a young woman seated on a white bull with golden horns she had a graceful figure and beautiful countenance the face arms and feet were alabaster the flesh tinted but with colors more delicate than in nature on her arms were broad golden armlets and the drapery a long flowing robe was blue embroidered with yellow flowers a stringed instrument rested on her knee and she was represented playing and singing the bull with lowered horns appeared walking about his chest hung a garland of flowers mingled with ears of yellow corn oak ivy and various other leaves green and russet and acorns and crimson berries the garland and blue dress were made of malachite lapis lazuli and various precious stones  aha my fair phoenician i know you well thought i exultingly though i never saw you before with a harp in your hand but were you not gathering flowers o lovely daughter of agenor when that celestial animal that masquerading god put himself so cunningly in your way to be admired and caressed until you unsuspiciously placed yourself on his back that explains the garland i shall have a word to say about this pretty thing to my learned and very superior host  the statue stood on an octagonal pedestal of a highly polished slatygray stone and on each of its eight faces was a picture in which one human figure appeared now from gazing on the statue itself i fell to contemplating one of these pictures with a very keen interest for the figure i recognized was a portrait of the beautiful girl yoletta the picture was a winter landscape the earth was white not with snow but with hoar frost the distant trees clothed by the frozen moisture as if with a feathery foliage looked misty against the whiteyblue wintry sky in the foreground on the pale frosted grass stood the girl in a dark maroon dress with silver embroidery on the bosom and a dark red cap on her head close to her drooped the slender terminal twigs of a tree sparkling with rime and icicle and on the twigs were several small snowwhite birds hopping and fluttering down towards her outstretched hand while she gazed up at them with flushed cheeks and lips parting with a bright joyous smile  presently while i stood admiring this most lovely work the young man i have mentioned as having raised yoletta from the ground at the grave came to my side and remarked smiling you have noticed the resemblance  yes indeed i returned she is painted to the life  this is not yolettas portrait he replied though it is very like her and then when i looked at him incredulously he pointed to some letters under the picture saying do you not see the name and date  finding that i could not read the words i hazarded the remark that it was yolettas mother perhaps  this portrait was painted four centuries ago he said with surprise in his accent and then he turned aside thinking me perhaps a rather dull and ignorant person  i did not want him to go away with that impression and remarked pointing to the statue i have spoken of i fancy i know very well who that isthat is europa  europa that is a name i never heard i doubt that any one in the house ever bore it then with a halfpuzzled smile he added how could you possibly know unless you were told no that is mistrelde it was formerly the custom of the house for the mother to ride on a white bull at the harvest festival mistrelde was the last to observe it  oh i see i returned lamely though i didnt see at all the indifferent way in which he spoke of centuries in connection with this brilliant and apparently freshpainted picture rather took me aback  presently he condescended to say something more pointing to the marks or characters which i could not read he said you have seen the name of yoletta here and that and the resemblance misled you you must know that there has always been a yoletta in this house this was the daughter of mistrelde the mother who died young and left but eight children and when this work was made their portraits were placed on the eight faces of the pedestal  thanks for telling me i said wondering if it was all true or only a fantastic romance  he then motioned me to follow him and we quitted that room where it had been decided that we were not to sup       chapter 4  we came to a large porticolike place open on three sides to the air the roof being supported by slender columns we were now on the opposite side of the house and looked upon the river which was not more than a couple of hundred yards from the terrace or platform on which it stood the ground here sloped rapidly to the banks and like that in the front was a wilderness with rock and patches of tall fern and thickets of thorn and bramble with a few trees of great size nor was wild life wanting in this natural park some deer were feeding near the bank while on the water numbers of wild duck and other waterfowl were disporting themselves splashing and flapping over the surface and uttering shrill cries  the people of the house were already assembled standing and sitting by the small tables there was a lively hum of conversation which ceased on my entrance then those who were sitting stood up and the whole company fixed its eyes on me which was rather disconcerting  the old gentleman standing in the midst of the people now bent on me a long scrutinizing gaze he appeared to be waiting for me to speak and finding that i remained silent he finally addressed me with solemnity smith he saidand i did not like itthe meeting with you today was to me and to all of us a very strange experience i little thought that an even stranger one awaited me that before you break bread in this house in which you have found shelter i should have to remind you that you are now in a house  yes i know i am i said and then added im sure sir i appreciate your kindness in bringing me here  he had perhaps expected something more or something entirely different from me as he continued standing with his eyes fixed on me then with a sigh and looking round him he said in a dissatisfied tone my children let us begin and for the present put out of our minds this matter which has been troubling us  he then motioned me to a seat at his own table where i was pleased to have a place since the lovely yoletta was also there  i am not particular about what i eat as with me good digestion waits on appetite and so long as i get a bellyfulto use a good old english wordi am satisfied on this particular occasion with or without a pretty girl at the table i could have consumed a haggisthat greatest abomination ever invented by flesheating barbariansi was so desperately hungry it was therefore a disappointment when nothing more substantial than a plate of whiteygreen crisplooking stuff resembling endive was placed before me by one of the picturesque handmaidens it was cold and somewhat bitter to the taste but hunger compelled me to eat it even to the last green leaf then when i began to wonder if it would be right to ask for more to my great relief other more succulent dishes followed composed of various vegetables we also had some pleasant drinks made i suppose from the juices of fruits but the delicious alcoholic sting was not in them we had fruits too of unfamiliar flavors and a confection of crushed nuts and honey  we sat at tableor tablesa long time and the meal was enlivened with conversation for all now appeared in a cheerful frame of mind notwithstanding the melancholy event which had occupied them during the day it was in fact a kind of supper and the one great meal of the day the only other meals being a breakfast and at noon a crust of brown bread a handful of dried fruit and drink of milk  at the conclusion of the repast during which i had been too much occupied to take notice of everything that passed i observed that a number of small birds had flown in and were briskly hopping over the floor and tables also perching quite fearlessly on the heads or shoulders of the company and that they were being fed with the fragments i took them to be sparrows and things of that kind but they did not look altogether familiar to me one little fellow most lively in his motions was remarkably like my old friend the robin only the bosom was more vivid running almost into orange and the wings and tail were tipped with the same hue giving it quite a distinguished appearance another small olivegreen bird which i at first took for a green linnet was even prettier the throat and bosom being of a most delicate buff crossed with a belt of velvet black the bird that really seemed most like a common sparrow was chestnut with a white throat and mousecolored wings and tail these pretty little pensioners systematically avoided my neighborhood although i tempted them with crumbs and fruit only one flew onto my table but had no sooner done so than it darted away again and out of the room as if greatly alarmed i caught the pretty girls eye just then and having finished eating and being anxious to join the conversation for i hate to sit silent when others are talking i remarked that it was strange the little birds so persistently avoided me  oh no not at all strange she replied with surprising readiness showing that she too had noticed it they are frightened at your appearance  i must indeed appear strange to them said i with some bitterness and recalling the adventures of the morning it is to me a new and very painful experience to walk about the world frightening men cattle and birds yet i suppose it is entirely due to the clothes i am wearingand the boots i wish some kind person would suggest a remedy for this state of things for just now my greatest desire is to be dressed in accordance with the fashion  allow me to interrupt you for one moment smith said the old gentleman who had been listening attentively to my words we understood what you said so well on this occasion that it seems a pity you should suddenly again render yourself unintelligible can you explain to us what you mean by dressing in accordance with the fashion  my meaning is that i simply desire to dress like one of yourselves to see the last of these uncouth garments i could not help putting a little vicious emphasis on that hateful word  he inclined his head and said yes  thus encouraged i dashed boldly into the middle of matter for now having dined albeit without wine i was inflamed with an intense craving to see myself arrayed in their rich mysterious dress this being so i continued may i ask you if it is in your power to provide me with the necessary garments so that i may cease to be an object of aversion and offense to every living thing and person myself included  a long and uncomfortable silence ensued which was perhaps not strange considering the nature of the request that i had blundered once more seemed likely enough from the general suspense and the somewhat alarmed expression of the old gentlemans countenance nevertheless my motives had been good i had expressed my wish in that way for the sake of peace and quietness and fearing that if i had asked to be directed to the nearest clothing establishment a new fit of amazement would have been the result  finding the silence intolerable i at length ventured to remark that i feared he had not understood me to the end  perhaps not he answered gravely or rather let me say i hope not  may i explain my meaning said i greatly distressed  assuredly you may he replied with dignity only before you speak let me put this plain question to you do you ask us to provide you with garmentsthat is to say to bestow them as a gift on you  certainly not i exclaimed turning crimson with shame to think that they were all taking me for a beggar my wish is to obtain them somehow from somebody since i cannot make them for myself and to give in return their full value  i had no sooner spoken than i greatly feared that i had made matters worse for here was i a guest in the house actually offering to purchase clothingreadymade or to to orderfrom my host who for all i knew might be one of the aristocracy of the country my fears however proved quite groundless  i am glad to hear your explanation he answered for it has completely removed the unpleasant impression caused by your former words what can you do in return for the garments you are anxious to possess and here let me remark i approve highly of your wish to escape with the least possible delay from your present covering do you wish to confine yourself to the finishing of some work in a particular lineas woodcarving or stone metal clay or glass work or in making or using colors or have you only that general knowledge of the various arts which would enable you to assist the more skilled in preparing materials  no i am not an artist i replied surprised at his question all i can do is to buy the clothesto pay for them in money  what do you mean by that what is money  surely i began but fortunately checked myself in time for i had meant to suggest that he was pulling my leg but it was really hard to believe that a person of his years did not know what money was besides i could not answer the question having always abhorred the study of political economy which tells you all about it so that i had never learned to define money but only how to spend it presently i thought the best way out of the muddle was to show him some and i accordingly pulled out my big leather bookpurse from my breast pocket it had an ancient musty smell like everything else about me but seemed pretty heavy and wellfilled and i proceeded to open it and turn the contents on the table eleven bright sovereigns and three halfcrowns or florins i forget which rolled out then unfolding the papers i discovered three fivepound bank of england notes  surely this is very little for me to have about me said i feeling greatly disappointed i fancy i must have been making ducks and drakes of a lot of cash beforebeforewell before i wasi dont know what or when or where  little notice was taken of this somewhat incoherent speech for all were now gathering round the table examining the gold and notes with eager curiosity at length the old gentleman pointing to the gold pieces said what are these  sovereigns i answered not a little amused have you never seen any like them before  never let me examine them again yes these eleven are of gold they are all marked alike on one side with a roughlyexecuted figure of a womans head with the hair gathered on its summit in a kind of ball there are also other things on them which i do not understand  can you not read the letters i asked  no the lettersif these marks are lettersare incomprehensible to me but what have these small pieces of metal to do with the question of your garments you puzzle me  why everything these pieces of metal as you call them are money and represent of course so much buying power i dont know yet what your currency is and whether you have the dollar or the rupeehere i paused seeing that he did not follow me my idea is this i resumed and coming down to very plain speaking i can give one of these fivepound notes or its equivalent in gold if you prefer thatfive of these sovereigns i meanfor a suit of clothes such as you all wear  so great was my desire to possess the clothes that i was about to double the offer which struck me as poor and add that i would give ten sovereigns but when i had spoken he dropped the piece he held in his hand upon the table and stared fixedly at me assisted by all the others presently in the profound silence which ensued a low silvery gurgling became audible as of some merry mountain burna sweet warbling sound swelling louder by degrees until it ended in a long ringing peal of laughter  this was from the girl yoletta i stared at her surprised at her unseasonable levity but the only effect of my doing so was a general explosion men and women joining in such a tempest of merriment that one might have imagined they had just heard the most wonderful joke ever invented since man acquired the sense of the ludicrous  the old gentleman was the first to recover a decent gravity although it was plain to see that he struggled severely at intervals to prevent a relapse  smith said he of all the extraordinary delusions you appear to be suffering from this that you can have garments to wear in return for a small piece of paper or for a few bits of this metal is the most astounding you cannot exchange these trifles for clothes because clothes are the fruit of much labor of many hands  and yet sir you said you understood me when i proposed to pay for the things i require said i in an aggrieved tone you seemed even to approve of the offer i made how then am i to pay for them if all i possess is not considered of any value  all you possess he replied surely i did not say that surely you possess the strength and skill common to all men and can acquire anything you wish by the labor of your hands  i began once more to see light although my skill i knew would not count for much ah yes i answered to go back to that subject i do not know anything about woodcarving or using colors but i might be able to do somethingsome work of a simpler kind  there are trees to be felled land to be plowed and many other things to be done if you will do these things some one else will be released to perform works of skill and as these are the most agreeable to the worker it would please us more to have you labor in the fields than in the workhouse  i am strong i answered and will gladly undertake labor of the kind you speak of there is however one difficulty my desire is to change these clothes for others which will be more pleasing to the eye at once but the work i shall have to do in return will not be finished in a day perhaps not inwell several days  no of course not said he a years labor will be necessary to pay for the garments you require  this staggered me for if the clothes were given to me at the beginning then before the end of the year they would be worn to rags and i should make myself a slave for life i was sorely perplexed in mind and pulled about this way and that by the fear of incurring a debt and the desire to see myself and to be seen by yoletta in those strangely fascinating garments that i had a decent figure and was not a badlooking young fellow i was pretty sure and the hope that i should be able to create an impression favorable i mean on the heart of that supremely beautiful girl was very strong in me at all events by closing with the offer i should have a year of happiness in her society and a year of healthy work in the fields could not hurt me or interfere much with my prospects besides i was not quite sure that my prospects were really worth thinking about just now certainly i had always lived comfortably spending money eating and drinking of the best and dressing wellthat is according to the london standard and there was my dear old bachelor uncle jackjohn smith member of parliament for wormwood scrubbs that is to say exmember for being a liberal when the great change came at the last general election he was ignominiously ousted from his seat the scrubbs proving at the finish a bitter place to him he was put out in more ways than one and tried to comfort himself by saying that there would soon be another dissolutionthinking of his own possibly being an old man i remembered that i had rather looked forward to such a contingency thinking how pleasant it would be to have all that money and cruise about the world in my own yacht enjoying myself as i knew how and really i had some reason to hope i remember he used to wind up the talk of an evening when i dined with him and got a check by saying my boy you have talents if youd only use em where were those talents now certainly they had not made me shine much during the last few hours  now all this seemed unsubstantial and i remembered these things dimly like a dream or a story told to me in childhood and sometimes when recalling the past i seemed to be thinking about ancient historysesostris and the babylonians and assyrians and that sort of thing and besides it would be very hard to get back from a place where even the name of london was unknown and perhaps if i ever should succeed in getting back it would only be to encounter a second roger tichborne case or to be confronted with the statute of limitations anyhow a year could not make much difference and i should also keep my money which seemed an advantage though it wasnt much i looked up they were all once more studying the coins and notes and exchanging remarks about them  if i bind myself to work one year said i shall i have to wait until the end of that time before i get the clothes  the reply to this question i thought would settle the matter one way or the other  no said he it is your wish and also ours that you should be differently clothed at once and the garments you require would be made for you immediately  then said i taking the desperate plunge i should like to have them as soon as possible and i am ready to commence work at once  you shall commence tomorrow morning he answered smiling at my impetuosity the daughters of the house whose province it is to make these things shall also suspend other work until your garments are finished and now my son from this evening you are one of the house and one of us and the things which we possess you also possess in common with us  i rose and thanked him he too rose and after looking round on us with a fatherly smile went away to the interior of the house       chapter 5  when he was gone and yoletta had followed leaving some of the others still studying those wretched sovereigns i sat down again and rested my chin on my hand for i was now thinkingdeeply thinking on the terms of the agreement i daresay i have succeeded in making a precious ass of myself was the mental reflection that occurred to meone i had not infrequently made and what is more been justified in making on former occasions then remembering that i had come to supper with an extravagant appetite it struck me that my host quietly observant had when proposing terms taken into account the quantity of food necessary for my sustenance i regretted too late that i had not exercised more restraint but the hungry man does not and cannot consider consequences else a certain hairy gentleman who figures in ancient history had never lent himself to that nefarious compact which gave so great an advantage to a younger but sleek and wellnourished brother in spite of all this i felt a secret satisfaction in the thought of the clothes and it was also good to know that the nature of the work i had undertaken would not lower my status in the house  occupied with these reflections i had failed to observe that the company had gradually been drifting away until but one person was left with methe young man who had talked with me before on his invitation i now rose put by my money and followed him returning by the hall we went through a passage and entered a room of vast extent which in its form and great length and high arched roof was like the nave of a cathedral and yet how unlike in that something ethereal in its aspect as of a nave in a cloud cathedral its farstretching shining floors and walls and columns pure white and pearlgray faintly touched with colors of exquisite delicacy and over it all was the roof of white or pale gray glass tinged with goldenredthe roof which i had seen from the outside when it seemed to me like a cloud resting on the stony summit of a hill  on coming in i had the impression of an empty silent place yet the inmates of the house were all there they were sitting and reclining on low couches some lying at their ease on straw mats on the floor some were reading others were occupied with some work in their hands and some were conversing the sound coming to me like a faint murmur from a distance  at one side somewhere about the center of the room there was a broad raised place or dais with a couch on it on which the father was reclining at his ease beside the couch stood a lectern on which a large volume rested and before him there was a brass box or cabinet and behind the couch seven polished brass globes were ranged suspended on axles resting on bronze frames these globes varied in size the largest being not less than about twelve feet in circumference  i noticed that there were books on a low stand near me they were all folios very much alike in form and thickness and seeing presently that the others were all following their own inclinations and considering that i had been left to my own resources and that it is a good plan when at rome to do as the romans do i byandby ventured to help myself to a volume which i carried to one of the readingstands  books are grand thingssometimes thought i prepared to follow the advice i had received and find out by reading all about the customs of this people especially their ideas concerning the house which appeared to be an object of almost religious regard with them this would make me quite independent and teach me how to avoid blundering in the future or giving expression to any more extraordinary delusions on opening the volume i was greatly surprised to find that it was richly illuminated on every leaf the middle only of each page being occupied with a rather narrow strip of writing but the minute letters resembling hebrew characters were incomprehensible to me i bore the disappointment very cheerfully i must say for i am not overfond of study and besides i could not have paid proper attention to the text surrounded with all that distracting beauty of graceful design and brilliant coloring  after a while yoletta came slowly across the room her fingers engaged with some kind of woolwork as she walked and my heart beat fast when she paused by my side  you are not reading she said looking curiously at me i have been watching you for some time  have you indeed said i not knowing whether to feel flattered or not no unfortunately i cant read this book as i do not understand the letters but what a wonderfully beautiful book it is i was just thinking what some of the great london bookbuyersquaritch for instancewould be tempted to give for it oh i am forgettingyou have never heard his name of course butbut what a beautiful book it is  she said nothing in reply and only looked a little surpriseddisgusted i fearedat my ignorance then walked away i had hoped that she was going to talk to me and with keen disappointment watched her moving across the floor all the glory seemed now to have gone out of the leaves of the volume and i continued turning them over listlessly glancing at intervals at the beautiful girl who was also like one of the pages before me wonderful to look at and hard to understand in a distant part of the room i saw her place some cushions on the floor and settle herself on them to do her work  the sun had set by this time and the interior was growing darker by degrees the fading light however seemed to make no difference to those who worked or read they appeared to be gifted with an owlish vision able to see with very little light the father alone did nothing but still rested on his couch perhaps indulging in a postprandial nap at length he roused himself and looked around him  there is no melody in our hearts this evening my children he said when another day has passed over us it will perhaps be different tonight the voice so recently stilled in death forever would be too painfully missed by all of us  some one then rose and brought a tall wax taper and placed it near him the flame threw a little brightness on the volume which he now proceeded to open and here and there further away it flashed and trembled in points of rainbowcolored light on a tall column but the greater part of the room still remained in twilight obscurity  he began to read aloud and although he did not seem to raise his voice above its usual pitch the words he uttered fell on my ears with a distinctness and purity of sound which made them seem like a melody sweetly played in tune the words he read related to life and death and such solemn matters but to my mind his theology seemed somewhat fantastical although it is right to confess that i am no judge of such matters there was also a great deal about the house which did not enlighten me much being too rhapsodical and when he spoke about our conduct and aims in life and things of that kind i understood him little better here is a part of his discourse  it is natural to grieve for those that die because light and knowledge and love and joy are no longer theirs but they grieve not any more being now asleep on the lap of the universal mother the bride of the father who is with us sharing our sorrow which was his first but it dims not his everlasting brightness and his desire and our glory is that we should always and in all things resemble him  the end of every day is darkness but the father of life through our reason has taught us to mitigate the exceeding bitterness of our end otherwise we that are above all other creatures in the earth should have been at the last more miserable than they for in the irrational world between the different kinds there reigns perpetual strife and bloodshed the strong devouring the weak and the incapable and when failure of life clouds the brightness of that lower soul which is theirs the end is not long delayed thus the life that has lasted many days goes out with a brief pang and in its going gives new vigor to the strong that have yet many days to live thus also does the everliving earth from the dust of dead generations of leaves remake a fresh foliage and for herself a new garment  we only of all things having life being like the father slay not nor are slain and are without enemies in the earth for even the lower kinds which have not reason know without reason that we are highest on the earth and see in us alone of all his works the majesty of the father and lose all their rage in our presence therefore when the night is near when life is a burden and we remember our mortality we hasten the end that those we love may cease to sorrow at the sight of our decline and we know that this is his will who called us into being and gave us life and joy on the earth for a season but not forever  it is better to lay down the life that is ours to leave all thingsthe love of our kindred the beauty of the world and of the house the labor in which we take delight to go forth and be no more but the bitterness endures not and is scarcely tasted when in our last moments we remember that our labor has borne fruit that the letters we have written perish not with us but remain as a testimony and a joy to succeeding generations and live in the house forever  for the house is the image of the world and we that live and labor in it are the image of our father who made the world and like him we labor to make for ourselves a worthy habitation which shall not shame our teacher this is his desire for in all his works and that knowledge which is like pure water to one that thirsts and satisfies and leaves no taste of bitterness on the palate we learn the will of him that called us into life all the knowledge we seek the invention and skill we possess and the labor of our hands has this purpose only for all knowledge and invention and labor having any other purpose whatsoever is empty and vain in comparison and unworthy of those that are made in the image of the father of life for just as the bodily senses may become perverted and the taste lose its discrimination so that the hungry man will devour acrid fruits and poisonous herbs for aliment so is the mind capable of seeking out new paths and a knowledge which leads only to misery and destruction  thus we know that in the past men sought after knowledge of various kinds asking not whether it was for good or for evil but every offense of the mind and the body has its appropriate reward and while their knowledge grew apace that better knowledge and discrimination which the father gives to every living soul both in man and in beast was taken from them thus by increasing their riches they were made poorer and like one who forgetting the limits that are set to his faculties gazes steadfastly on the sun by seeing much they become afflicted with blindness but they know not their poverty and blindness and were not satisfied but were like shipwrecked men on a lonely and barren rock in the midst of the sea who are consumed with thirst and drink of no sweet spring but of the bitter wave and thirst and drink again until madness possesses their brains and death releases them from their misery thus did they thirst and drink again and were crazed being inflamed with the desire to learn the secrets of nature hesitating not to dip their hands in blood seeking in the living tissues of animals for the hidden springs of life for in their madness they hoped by knowledge to gain absolute dominion over nature thereby taking from the father of the world his prerogative  but their vain ambition lasted not and the end of it was death the madness of their minds preyed on their bodies and worms were bred in their corrupted flesh and these after feeding on their tissues changed their forms and becoming winged flew out in the breath of their nostrils like clouds of winged ants that issue in the springtime from their breedingplaces and flying from body to body filled the race of men in all places with corruption and decay and the mother of men was thus avenged of her children for their pride and folly for they perished miserably devoured of worms  of the human race only a small remnant survived these being men of an humble mind who had lived apart and unknown to their fellows and after long centuries they went forth into the wilderness of earth and repeopled it but nowhere did they find any trace or record of those that had passed away for earth had covered all their ruined works with her dark mold and green forests even as a man hides unsightly scars on his body with a new and beautiful garment nor is it known to us when this destruction fell upon the race of men we only know that the history thereof was graven an hundred centuries ago on the granite pillars of the house of evor on the plains between the sea and the snowcovered mountains of elf thither in past ages some of our pilgrims journeyed and have brought a record of these things nor in our house only are they known but in many houses throughout the world have they been written for the instruction of all men and a warning for all time  but to mankind there shall come no second darkness of error nor seeking after vain knowledge and in the fathers house there shall be no second desolation but the sounds of joy and melody which were silent shall be heard everlastingly since we had now continued long in this even mind seeking only to inform ourselves of his will until as in a clear crystal without flaw shining with colored light or as a glassy lake reflecting within itself the heavens and every cloud and star so is he reflected in our minds and in the house we are his viceregents and in the world his coworkers and for the glory which he has in his work we have a like glory in ours  he is our teacher morning and evening throughout the various world in the procession of the seasons and in the blue heavens powdered with stars in mountain and plain and manytoned forest in the sounding walls of the ocean and in the billowy seas through which we pass in peril from land to land we read his thoughts and listen to his voice here do we learn with what farseeing intelligence he has laid the foundations of his everlasting mansion how skillfully he has builded its walls and with what prodigal richness he has decorated all his works for the sunlight and moonlight and the blueness of heaven are his the sea with its tides the blackness and the lightnings of the tempest and snow and changeful winds and green and yellow leaf his are also the silver rain and the rainbow the shadows and the manycolored mists which he flings like a mantle over all the world herein do we learn that he loves a stable building and that the foundations and walls shall endure for ever yet loves not sameness thus from day to day and from season to season do all things change their aspect and the walls and floor and roof of his dwelling are covered with a new glory but to us it is not given to rise to this supreme majesty in our works therefore do we like him yet unable to reach so great a height borrow nothing one from the other but in each house learn separately from him alone who has infinite riches so that every habitation changeless and eternal in itself shall yet differ from all others having its own special beauty and splendor for we inhabit one house only but the father of men inhabits all  these things are written for the refreshment and delight of those who may no longer journey into distant lands and they are in the library of the house in the seven thousand volumes of the houses of the world which our pilgrims have visited in past ages for once in a lifetime is it ordained that a man shall leave his own place and travel for the space of ten years visiting the most famous houses in every land he enters and also seeking out those of which no report has reached us  when the time for this chief adventure comes and we go forth for a long period there is compensation for every weariness with absence of kindred and the sweet shelter of our own home for now do we learn the infinite riches of the father for just as the day changes every hour from the morning to the evening twilight so does the aspect of the world alter as we progress from day to day and in all places our fellowmen learning as we do from him only and seeing that which is nearest give a special color of nature to their lives and their houses and every house with the family which inhabits it in their conversation and the arts in which they excel is like a round lake set about with hills wherein may be seen that visible world and in all the earth there is no land without inhabitants whether on wide continents or islands of the sea and in all nature there is no grandeur or beauty or grace which men have not copied knowing that this is pleasing to the father for we that are made like him delight not to work without witnesses and we are his witnesses in the earth taking pleasure in his works even as he also does in ours  thus at the beginning of our journey to the far south where we go to look first on those bright lands which have hotter suns and a greater variety than ours we come to the wilderness of coradine which seems barren and desolate to our sight accustomed to the deep verdure of woods and valleys and the blue mists of an abundant moisture there a stony soil brings forth only thorns and thistles and sere tufts of grass and blustering winds rush over the unsheltered reaches where the roughhaired goats huddle for warmth and there is no melody save the manytoned voices of the wind and the plovers wild cry there dwell the children of coradine on the threshold of the windvexed wilderness where the stupendous columns of green glass uphold the roof of the house of coradine the oceans voice is in their rooms and the inlandblowing wind brings to them the salt spray and yellow sand swept at low tide from the desolate floors of the sea and the whitewinged bird flying from the black tempest screams aloud in their shadowy halls there from the high terraces when the moon is at its full we see the children of coradine gathered together arrayed like no others in shining garments of gossamer threads when like thistledown chased by eddying winds now whirling in a cloud now scattering far apart they dance their moonlight dances on the wide alabaster floors and coming and going they pass away and seem to melt into the moonlight yet ever to return again with changeful melody and new measures and seeing this all those things in which we ourselves excel seem poor in comparison becoming pale in our memories for the winds and waves and the whiteness and grace has been ever with them and the winged seed of the thistle and the flight of the gull and the stormvexed sea flowering in foam and the light of the moon on sea and barren land have taught them this art and a swiftness and grace which they alone possess  yet does this moonlight dance which is the chief glory of the house of coradine grow pale in the mind and is speedily forgotten when another is seen and going on our way from house to house we learn how everywhere the various riches of the world have been taken into his soul by man and made part of his life nor are we inferior to others having also an art and chief excellence which is ours only and the fame of which has long gone forth into the world so that from many distant lands pilgrims gather yearly to our fields to listen to our harvest melody when the sunripened fruits have been garnered and our lips and hands make undying music to gladden the hearts of those that hear it all their lives long for then do we rejoice beyond others rising like brightwinged insects from our lowly state to a higher life of glory and joy which is ours for the space of three whole days then the august mother in a brazen chariot is drawn from field to field by milkwhite bulls with golden horns then her children are gathered about her in shining yellow garments with armlets of gold upon their arms and with voice and instruments of forms unknown to the stranger they make glad the listening fields with the great harvest melody  in ancient days the children of our house conceived it in their hearts hearing it in all natures voices and it was with them day and night and they whispered it to one another when it was no louder than the whisper of the wind in the forest leaves and as the builder of the world brings from an hundred far places the mist and the dew and the sunshine and the light west wind to give to the morning hour its freshness and glory and as we his humbler followers seek far off in caverns of the hills and in the dark bowels of the earth for minerals and dyes that outshine the flowers and the sun to beautify the walls of our house so everywhere by night and day for long centuries did we listen to all sounds and made their mystery and melody ours until this great song was perfected in our hearts and the fame of it in all lands has caused our house to be called the house of the harvest melody and when the yearly pilgrims behold our procession in the fields and listen to our song all the glory of the world seems to pass before them overcoming their hearts until bursting into tears and loud cries they cast themselves upon the earth and worship the father of the whole world  this shall be the chief glory of our house for ever when a thousand years have gone by and we that are now living like those that have been are mingled with the nature we come from and speak to our children only in the winds voice and the cry of the passagebird pilgrims shall still come to these sunbright fields to rejoice and worship the father of the world and bless the august mother of the house from whose sacred womb ever comes to it life and love and joy and the harvest melody that shall endure for ever       chapter 6  the reading went on not of course for ever like that harvest melody he spoke of but for a considerable time the words i concluded were for the initiated and not for me and after a while i gave up trying to make out what it was all about those last expressions i have quoted about the august mother of the house were unintelligible and appeared to me meaningless i had already come to the conclusion that however many of the ladies of the establishment might have experienced the pleasures and pains of maternity there was really no mother of the house in the sense that there was a father of the house that is to say one possessing authority over the others and calling them all her children indiscriminately yet this mysterious nonexistent mother of the house was continually being spoken of as i found now and afterwards when i listened to the talk around me after thinking the matter over i came to the conclusion that mother of the house was merely a convenient fiction and simply stood for the general sense of the womenfolk or something of the sort it was perhaps stupid of me but the story of mistrelde who died young leaving only eight children i had regarded as a mere legend or fable of antiquity  to return to the reading just as i had been absorbed before in that beautiful book without being able to read it so now i listened to that melodious and majestic voice experiencing a singular pleasure without properly understanding the sense i remembered now with a painful feeling of inferiority that my thick speech had been remarked on earlier in the day and i could not but think that compared with the speech of this people it was thick in their rare physical beauty the color of their eyes and hair and in their fascinating dress they had struck me as being utterly unlike any people ever seen by me but it was perhaps in their clear sweet penetrative voice which sometimes reminded me of a tendertoned wind instrument that they most differed from others  the reading i have said had struck me as almost of the nature of a religious service nevertheless everything went on as beforereading working and occasional conversation but the subdued talking and moving about did not interfere with ones pleasure in the old mans musical speech any more than the soft murmur and flying about of honey bees would prevent one from enjoying the singing of a skylark emboldened by what i saw the others doing i left my seat and made my way across the floor to yolettas side stealing through the gloom with great caution to avoid making a clatter with those abominable boots  may i sit down near you said i with some hesitation but she encouraged me with a smile and placed a cushion for me  i settled myself down in the most graceful position i could assume which was not at all graceful doubling my objectionable legs out of her sight and then began my trouble for i was greatly perplexed to know what to say to her i thought of lawntennis and archery ellen terrys acting the royal academy exhibition private theatricals and twenty things besides but they all seemed unsuitable subjects to start conversation with in this case there was i began to fear no common ground on which we could meet and exchange thoughts or at any rate words then i remembered that ground common and broad enough of our human feelings especially the sweet and important feeling of love but how was i to lead up to it the work she was engaged with at length suggested an opening and the opportunity to make a pretty little speech  your sight must be as good as your eyes are pretty said i to enable you to work in such a dim light  oh the light is good enough she answered taking no notice of the compliment besides this is such easy work i could do it in the dark  it is very pretty workmay i look at it  she handed the stuff to me but instead of taking it in the ordinary way i placed my hand under hers and holding up cloth and hand together proceeded to give a minute and prolonged scrutiny to her work  do you know that i am enjoying two distinct pleasures at one and the same time said i one is in seeing your work the other in holding your hand and i think the last pleasure even greater than the first as she made no reply i added somewhat lamely may ikeep on holding it  that would prevent me from working she answered with the utmost gravity but you may hold it for a little while  oh thank you i exclaimed delighted with the privilege and then to make the most of my precious little while i pressed it warmly whereupon she cried out aloud oh smith you are squeezing too hardyou hurt my hand  i dropped it instantly in the greatest confusion oh for goodness sake i stammered please do not make such an outcry you dont know what a hobble youll get me into  fortunately no notice was taken of the exclamation though it was hard to believe that her words had not been overheard and presently recovering from my fright i apologized for hurting her and hoped she would forgive me  there is nothing to forgive she returned gently you did not really squeeze hard only my hand hurts because today when i pressed it on the ground beside the grave i ran a small thorn into it then the remembrance of that scene at the burial brought a sudden mist of tears into her lovely eyes  i am so sorry i hurt you yolettamay i call you yoletta said i all at once remembering that she had called me smith without the customary prefix  why that is my namewhat else should you call me she returned evidently with surprise  it is a pretty name and so sweet on the lips that i should like to be repeating it continually i answered but it is only right that you should have a pretty name becausewell if i may tell you because you are so very beautiful  yes but is that strangeare not all people beautiful  i thought of certain london types especially among the criminal classes and of the old women with withered simian faces and wearing shawls slinking in or out of publichouses at the street corners and also of some people of a better class i had known personallysome even in the house of commons and i felt that i could not agree with her much as i wished to do so without straining my conscience  at all events you will allow said i evading the question that there are degrees of beauty just as there are degrees of light you may be able to see to work in this light but it is very faint compared with the noonday light when the sun is shining  oh there is not so great a difference between people as that she replied with the air of a philosopher there are different kinds of beauty i allow and some people seem more beautiful to us than others but that is only because we love them more the best loved are always the most beautiful  this seemed to reverse the usual idea that the more beautiful the person is the more he or she gets loved however i was not going to disagree with her any more and only said how sweetly you talk yoletta you are as wise as you are beautiful i could wish for no greater pleasure than to sit here listening to you the whole evening  ah then i am sorry i must leave you now she answered with a bright smile which made me think that perhaps my little speech had pleased her  do you wonder why i smile she added as if able to read my thoughts it is because i have often heard words like yours from one who is waiting for me now  this speech caused me a jealous pang but for a few moments after speaking she continued regarding me with that bright spiritual smile on her lips then it faded and her face clouded and her glance fell i did not ask her to tell me nor did i ask myself the reason of that change and afterwards how often i noticed that same change in her and in the others toothat sudden silence and clouding of the face such as may be seen in one who freely expresses himself to a person who cannot hear and then all at once but too late remembers the others infirmity  must you go i only said what shall i do alone  oh you shall not be alone she replied and going away returned presently with another lady this is edra she said simply she will take my place by your side and talk with you  i could not tell her that she had taken my words too literally that being alone simply meant being separated from her but there was no help for it and some one alas some one i greatly hated was waiting for her i could only thank her and her friend for their kind intentions but what in the name of goodness was i to say to this beautiful woman who was sitting by me she was certainly very beautiful with a far more mature and perhaps a nobler beauty than yolettas her age being about twentyseven or twentyeight but the divine charm in the young girls face could for me exist in no other  presently she opened the conversation by asking me if i disliked being alone  well no perhaps not exactly that i said but i think it much jolliermuch more pleasant i meanto have some very nice person to talk to  she assented and pleased at her ready intelligence i added and it is particularly pleasant when you are understood but i have no fear that you at any rate will fail to understand anything i may say  you have had some trouble today she returned with a charming smile i sometimes think that women can understand even more readily than men  theres not a doubt of it i returned warmly glad to find that with edra it was all plain sailing it must be patent to every one that women have far quicker finer intellects than men although their brains are smaller but then quality is more important than mere quantity and yet i continued some people hold that women ought not to have the franchise or suffrage or whatever it is not that i care two straws about the question myself and i only hope theyll never get it but then i think it is so illogicaldont you  i am afraid i do not understand you smith she returned looking much distressed  well no i suppose not but what i said was of no consequence i replied then wishing to make a fresh start i added but i am so glad to hear you call me smith it makes it so much more pleasant and homelike to be treated without formality it is very kind of you im sure  but surely your name is smith said she looking very much surprised  oh yes my name is smith only of coursewell the tact is i was just wondering what to call you  my name is edra she replied looking more bewildered than ever and from that moment the conversation which had begun so favorably was nothing but a series of entanglements from which i could only escape in each case by breaking the threads of the subject under discussion and introducing a new one       chapter 7  the moment of retiring to which i had been looking forward with considerable interest as one likely to bring fresh surprises arrived at last it brought only extreme discomfort i was conducted without a flat candlestick along an obscure passage then at right angles with the first a second broader lighter passage leading past a great many doors placed near together these i ascertained later were the dormitories or sleepingcells and were placed side by side in a row opening on the terrace at the back of the house having reached the door of my box my conductor pushed back the slidingpanel and when i had groped my way to the dark interior closed it again behind me there was no light for me except the light of the stars for directly opposite the door by which i had entered stood another open wide to the night which was apparently not intended ever to be closed the prospect was the one i had already seenthe wilderness sloping to the river and the glassy surface of the broad water reflecting the stars and the black masses of large trees there was no sound save the hooting of an owl in the distance and the wailing note of some mournfulminded waterfowl the night air blew in cold and moist which made my bones ache though they were not broken and feeling very sleepy and miserable i groped about until i was rewarded by discovering a narrow bed or cot of trelliswork on which was a hard straw pallet and a small straw pillow also folded small a kind of woolen sleeping garment too tired to keep out of even such an uninviting bed i flung off my clothes and with my moldy tweeds for only covering i laid me down but not to sleep the misery of it for although my body was warmtoo warm in factthe wind blew on my face and bare feet and legs and made it impossible to sleep  about midnight i was just falling into a doze when a sound as of a person coming with a series of jumps into the room disturbed me and starting up i was horrified to see sitting on the floor a great beast much too big for a dog with large erect ears he was intently watching me his round eyes shining like a pair of green phosphorescent globes having no weapon i was at the brutes mercy and was about to utter a loud shout to summon assistance but as he sat so still i refrained and began even to hope that he would go quietly away then he stood up went back to the door and sniffed audibly at it and thinking that he was about to relieve me of his unwelcome presence i dropped my head on the pillow and lay perfectly still then he turned and glared at me again and finally advancing deliberately to my side sniffed at my face it was all over with me now i thought and closing my eyes and feeling my forehead growing remarkably moist in spite of the cold i murmured a little prayer when i looked again the brute had vanished to my inexpressible relief  it seemed very astonishing that an animal like a wolf should come into the house but i soon remembered that i had seen no dogs about so that all kinds of savage prowling beasts could come in with impunity it was getting beyond a joke but then all this seemed only a fit ending to the perfectly absurd arrangement into which i had been induced to enter goodness gracious i exclaimed sitting bolt upright on my straw bed am i a rational being or an inebriated donkey or what to have consented to such a proposal it is clear that i was not quite in my right mind when i made the agreement and i am therefore not morally bound to observe it what be a field laborer a hewer of wood and drawer of water and sleep on a miserable straw mat in an open porch with wolves for visitors at all hours of the night and all for a few barbarous rags i dont know much about plowing and that sort of thing but i suppose any ablebodied man can earn a pound a week and that would be fiftytwo pounds for a suit of clothes who ever heard of such a thing wolves and all thrown in for nothing i daresay i shall have a tiger dropping in presently just to have a look round no no my venerable friend that was all excellent acting about my extraordinary delusions and the rest of it but i am not going to be carried so far by them as to adhere to such an outrageously onesided bargain  presently i remembered two thingsdivine yoletta was the first and the second was that thought of the rare pleasure it would be to array myself in those same barbarous rags as i had blasphemously called them these things had entered into my soul and had become a part of meespeciallywell both those strange garments had looked so refreshingly picturesque and i had conceived such an intense longing to wear them was it a very contemptible ambition on my part is it sinful to wish for any adornments other than wisdom and sobriety a meek and loving spirit good works and other things of the kind straight into my brain flashed the words of a sentence i had recently readthat is to say just before my accidentin a biological work and it comforted me as much as if an angel with shining face and rainbowcolored wings had paid me a visit in my dusky cell unto adam also and his wife did the lord god make coats of skin and clothed them this has become as every one knows a custom among the race of men and shows at present no sign of becoming obsolete moreover that first correlation namely milkglands and a hairy covering appears to have entered the very soul of creatures of this class and to have become psychical as well as physical for in that type which is only for a while inferior to the angels the fondness for this kind of outer covering is a strong ineradicable passion most true and noble words o biologist of the fiery soul it was a delight to remember them a strong and ineradicable passion not merely to clothe the body but to clothe it appropriately that is to say beautifully and by so doing please god and ourselves this being so must we go on for ever scraping our faces with a sharp iron until they are blue and spotty with manifold scrapings and cropping our hair short to give ourselves an artificial resemblance to old dogs and monkeyscreatures lower than us in the scale of beingand array our bodies like mutes at a funeral in repulsive blackwe eutheria of the eutheria the noble of the noble and all for what since it pleases not heaven nor accords with our own desires for the sake of respectability perhaps whatever that may mean oh then a million curses take itrespectability i mean may it sink into the bottomless pit and the smoke of its torment ascend for ever and ever and having thus by taking thought brought my mind into this temper i once more finally determined to have the clothes and religiously to observe the compact  it made me quite happy to end it in this way the hard bed the cold night wind blowing on me my wolfish visitor were all forgotten once more i gave loose to my imagination and saw myself clothed and in my right mind sitting at yolettas feet learning the mystery of that sweet tranquil life from her precious lips a whole year was mine in which to love her and win her gentle heart but her handah that was another matter what had i to give in return for such a boon as that only that strength concerning which my venerable host had spoken somewhat encouragingly he had also been so good as to mention my skill but i could scarcely trade on that and if a whole years labor was only sufficient to pay for a suit of clothing how many years of toil would be required to win yolettas hand  naturally at this juncture i began to draw a parallel between my case and that of an ancient historical personage whose name is familiar to most history repeats itselfwith variations jacobnamely smithcometh to the well of haran he taketh acquaintance of rachel here called yoletta and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept that is a touch of nature i can thoroughly appreciatethe kissing i mean but why he wept i cannot tell unless it be because he was not an englishman and jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother i am glad to have no such startling piece of information to give to the object of my affections we are not even distant relations and her age being say fifteen and mine twentyone we are so far well suited to each other according to my notions smith covenanted for yoletta and said i will serve thee seven years for yoletta thy younger daughter and the old gentleman answered abide with me for i would rather you should have her than some other person now i wonder whether the matter will be complicated with leahthat is edra leah was considerably older than rachel and like edra tendereyed i do not aspire or desire to marry both especially if i should like jacob have to begin with the wrong one however tendereyed but for divine yoletta i could serve seven years yea and fourteen if it comes to it  thus i mused and thus i questioned tossing and turning on my inhospitable hard bed until merciful sleep laid her quieting hands on the strings of my brain and hushed their weary jangling       chapter 8  fortunately i woke early next morning for i was now a member of an earlyrising family and anxious to conform to rules on going to the door i found to my inexpressible disgust that i might easily have closed it in the way i had seen the other door closed by simply pulling a sliding panel there was ventilation enough without having the place open to prowling beasts of prey i also found that if i had turned up the little stray bed i should have had warm woolen sheets to sleep in  i resolved to say nothing about my nocturnal visitor not wishing to begin the day by furnishing fresh instances of what might seem like crass stupidity on my part while occupied with these matters i began to hear people moving about and talking on the terrace and peeping out i beheld a curious and interesting spectacle down the broad steps leading to the water the people of the house were hurrying and flinging themselves like agile startled frogs on the bosom of the stream there in the midst of his family my venerable host was already disporting himself his long silvery beard and hair floating like a foam on the waves of his own creating and presently from other sleepingrooms on a line with mine shot forth new bewitching forms each sparsely clothed in a slender clinging garment which concealed no beauteous curve beneath and nimbly running and leaping down the slope they quickly joined the masculine bathers  looking about i soon found a pretty thing in which to array myself and quickly started after the others risking my neck in my desire to imitate the new mode of motion i had just witnessed the water was delightfully cool and refreshing and the company very agreeable ladies and gentlemen all swimming and diving about together with the unconventional freedom and grace of a company of grebes  after dressing we assembled in the eatingroom or portico where we had supped just when the red disk of the sun was showing itself above the horizon kindling the clouds with yellow flame and filling the green world with new light i felt happy and strong that morning very able and willing to work in the fields and better than all very hopeful about that affair of the heart happiness however is seldom perfect and in the clear tender morning light i could not help contrasting my own repulsively ugly garments with the bright and beautiful costumes worn by the others which seemed to harmonize so well with their fresh happy morning mood i also missed the fragrant cup of coffee the streaky rasher from the dear familiar pig and after breakfast the wellflavored cigar but these lesser drawbacks were soon forgotten  after the meal a small closed basket was handed to me and one of the young men led me out to a little distance from the house then pointing to a belt of wood about a mile away told me to walk towards it until i came to a plowed field on the slope of a valley where i could do some plowing before leaving me he took from his own person a metal dogwhistle with a string attached and hung it round my neck but without explaining its use  basket in hand i went away over the dewy grass whistling lightheartedly and after half an hours walk found the spot indicated where about an acre and a half of land had been recently turned there also lying in the furrow i found the plow an implement i knew very little about this particular plow however appeared to be a simple primitive thing consisting of a long beam of wood with an upright pole to guide it a metal share in the center going off to one side balanced on the other by a couple of small wheels and there were also some long ropes attached to a crossstick at the end of the beam there being no horses or bullocks to do the work and being unable to draw the plow myself as well as guide it i sat down leisurely to examine the contents of my basket which i found consisted of brown bread dried fruit and a stone bottle of milk then not knowing what else to do i began to amuse myself by blowing on the whistle and emitted a most shrill and piercing sound which very soon produced an unexpected effect two noblelooking horses resembling those i had seen the day before came galloping towards me as if in response to the sound i had made approaching swiftly to within fifty yards they stood still staring and snorting as if alarmed or astonished after which they swept round me three or four times neighing in a sharp ringing manner and finally after having exhausted their superfluous energy they walked to the plow and placed themselves deliberately before it it looked as if these animals had come at my call to do the work i therefore approached them with more than needful caution using many soothing conciliatory sounds and words the while and after a little further study i discovered how to adjust the ropes to them there were no blinkers or reins nor did these superb animals seem to think any were wanted but after i had taken the pole in my hand and said gee up dobbin in a tone of command followed by some inarticulate clicks with the tongue they rewarded me with a disconcerting stare and then began dragging the plow as long as i held the pole straight the share cut its way evenly through the mold but occasionally owing to my inadvertence it would go off at a tangent or curve quite out of the ground and whenever this happened the horses would stop turn round and stare at me then touching their noses together seem to exchange ideas on the subject when the first furrow was finished they did not double back as i expected but went straight away to a distance of thirty yards and then turning marched back cutting a fresh furrow parallel with the first and as straight as a line then they returned to the original startingpoint and cut another then again to the new furrow and so on progressively all this seemed very wonderful to me giving the impression that i had been a skillful plowman all my life without knowing it it was interesting work and i was also amused to see the little birds that came in numbers from the wood to devour the worms in the freshturned mold for between their fear of me and their desire to get the worms they were in a highly perplexed state and generally confined their operations to one end of the furrow while i was away at the other the space the horses had marked out for themselves was plowed up in due time whereupon they marched off and made a fresh furrow as before where there was nothing to guide them and so the work went on agreeably for some hours until i felt myself growing desperately hungry sitting down on the beam of the plow i opened my basket and discussed the homely fare with a keen appetite  after finishing the food i resumed work again but not as cheerfully as at first i began to feel a little stiff and tired and the immense quantity of mold adhering to my boots made it heavy walking moreover the novelty had now worn off the horses also did not work as smoothly as at the commencement they seemed to have something on their minds for at the end of every furrow they would turn and stare at me in the most exasperating manner  phew i ejaculated as i stood wiping the honest sweat from my face with my moldy ancient and extremely dirty pockethandkerchief three hundred and sixtyfour days of this sort of thing is a rather long price to pay for a suit of clothes  while standing there i saw an animal coming swiftly towards me from the direction of the forest bounding along over the earth with a speed like that of a greyhounda huge fiercelooking brute and when close to me i felt convinced that it was an animal of the same kind as the one i had seen during the night before i had made up my mind what to do he was within a few yards of me and then coming to a sudden halt he sat down on his haunches and gravely watched me calling to mind some things i had heard about the terrifying effect of the human eye on royal tigers and other savage beasts i gazed steadily at him and then almost lost my fear in admiration of his beauty he was taller than a boarhound but slender in figure with keen foxlike features and very large erect ears his coat was silverygray and long there were two black spots above his eyes and the feet muzzle eartips and end of the bushy tail were also velvetblack after watching me quietly for two or three minutes he started up and much to my relief trotted away towards the wood but after going about fifty yards he looked back and seeing me still gazing after him wheeled round and rushed at me and when quite close uttered a sound like a ringing metallic yelp after which he once more bounded away and disappeared from sight  the horses now turned round and deliberately walking up to me stood still in spite of all i could do to make them continue the work after waiting a while they proceeded to wriggle themselves out of the ropes and galloped off loudly neighing to each other and flinging up their disdainful heels so as to send a shower of dirt over me left alone in this unceremonious fashion i presently began to think that they knew more about the work than i did and that finding me indisposed to release them at the proper moment they had taken the matter into their own hands or hoofs rather a little more pondering and i also came to the conclusion that the singular wolflike animal was only one of the housedogs that he had visited me in the night to remind me that i was sleeping with the door open and had come now to insist on a suspension of work  glad at having discovered all these things without displaying my ignorance by asking questions i took up my basket and started home       chapter 9  when i arrived at the house i was met by the young man who had set me the mornings task but he was taciturn now and wore a cold estranged look which seemed to portend trouble he at once led me to a part of the house at a distance from the hall and into a large apartment i now saw for the first time in a few moments the master of the house followed by most of the other inmates also entered and on the faces of all of them i noticed the same cold offended look  the dickens take my luck said i to myself beginning to feel extremely uncomfortable i suppose i have offended against the laws and customs by working the horses too long  smith said the old man advancing to the table and depositing thereon a large volume he had brought with him come here and read to me in this book  advancing to the table i saw that it was written in the same minute hebrewlike characters of the folio i had examined on the previous evening i cannot read it i do not understand the letters i said feeling some shame at having thus publicly to confess my ignorance  then said he bending on me a look of the utmost severity there is indeed little more to be said nevertheless we take into account the confused state of your intellect yesterday and judge you leniently and let us hope that the pangs of an outraged conscience will be more painful to you than the light punishment i am about to inflict for so destestable a crime  i now concluded that i had offended by squeezing yolettas hand and had been told to read from the book merely to make myself acquainted with the pains and penalties attendant on such an indiscretion for to call it a detestable crime seemed to me a very great abuse of language  if i have offended was my answer delivered with little humility i can only plead my ignorance of the customs of the house  no man he returned with increased severity is so ignorant as not to know right from wrong had the matter come to my knowledge sooner i should have said depart from us for your continued presence in the house offends us but we have made a compact with you and until the year expires we must suffer you for the space of sixty days you must dwell apart from us never leaving the room where each day a task will be assigned to you and subsisting on bread and water only let us hope that in this period of solitude and silence you will sufficiently repent your crime and rejoin us afterwards with a changed heart for all offenses may be forgiven a man but it is impossible to forgive a lie  a lie i exclaimed in amazement i have told no lie  this said he with an access of wrath is an aggravation of your former offense it is even a worse offense than the first and must be dealt with separatelywhen the sixty days have expired  are you then going to condemn me without hearing me speak or telling me anything about it what lie have i told  after a pause during which he closely scrutinized my face he said pointing to the open page before him yesterday in answer to my question you told me that you could read last evening you made a contrary statement to yoletta and now here is the book and you confess that you cannot read it  but that is easily explained said i immensely relieved for i certainly had felt a little guilty about the handsqueezing performance although it was not a very serious matter i can read the books of my own country and naturally concluded that your books were written in the same kind of letters but last evening i discovered that it was not so you have already seen the letters of my country on the coins i showed you last evening  and here i again pulled out my pocketbook and emptied the contents on the table  he began to pick up the sovereigns one by one to examine them meanwhile finding my beautiful black and gold stylograph pen inserted in the book i thought i could not do better than to show him how i wrote fortunately the fluid in it had not become dry tearing a blank page from my book i hastily scribbled a few lines and handed the paper to him saying this is how i write  he began studying the paper but his eyes i perceived wandered often to the stylograph pen in my hand  presently he remarked this writing or these marks you have made on the paper are not the same as the letters on the gold  i took the paper and proceeded to copy the sentence i had written but in printing letters beneath it then returned it to him  he examined it again and after comparing my letters with those on the sovereigns said pray tell me now what you have written here and explain why you write in two different ways  i told him as well as i could why letters of one form were used to stamp on gold and other substances and of a different form for writing then with a modest blush i read the words of the sentence in different parts of the world men have different customs and write different letters but alike to all men in all places a lie is hateful  smith he said addressing me in an impressive manner but happily not to charge me with a third and bigger lie i have lived long in the world and the knowledge others possess concerning it is mine also it is common knowledge that in the hotter and colder regions men are compelled to live differently owing to the conditions they are placed in but we know that everywhere they have the same law of right and wrong inscribed on the heart and as you have said hate a lie also that they all speak the same language and until this moment i also believed that they wrote in similar characters you however have now succeeded in convincing me that this is not the case that in some obscure valley cut off from all intercourse by inaccessible mountains or in some small unknown island of the sea a people may existah did you not tell me that you came from an island  yes my home was on an island i answered  so i imagined an island of which no report has ever reached us where the people isolated from their fellows have in the course of many centuries changed their customseven their manner of writing although i had seen these gold pieces i did not understand or did not realize that such a human family existed now i am persuaded of it and as i alone am to blame for having brought this charge against you i must now ask your forgiveness we rejoice at your innocence and hope with increased love to atone for our injustice my son he concluded placing a hand on my shoulder i am now deeply in your debt  i am glad it has ended so happily i replied wondering whether his being in my debt would increase my chances with yoletta or not  seeing him again directing curious glances at the stylograph which i was turning about in my fingers i offered it to him  he examined it with interest  i have only been waiting for an opportunity he said to look closely at this wonderful contrivance for i had perceived that your writing was not made with a pencil but with a fluid it is black polished stone beautifully fashioned and encircled with gold bands and contains the writingfluid within itself this surprises me as much as anything you have told me  allow me to make you a present of it said i seeing him so taken with it  no not so he returned but i should greatly like to possess it and will keep it if i may bestow in return something you desire  yolettas hand was really the only thing in life i desired but it was too early to speak yet as i knew nothing about their matrimonial usagesnot even whether or not the ladys consent was necessary to a compact of the kind i therefore made a more modest request there is one thing i greatly desire i said i am very anxious to be able to read in your books and shall consider myself more than compensated if you will permit yoletta to teach me  she shall teach you in any case my son he returned that and much more is already owning to you  there is nothing else i desire said i pray keep the pen and make me happy  and thus ended a disagreeable matter  the cloud having blown over we all repaired to the supperroom and nothing could exceed our happiness as we sat at meator vegetables not feeling so ravenously hungry as on the previous evening and moreover seeing them all in so lively a mood i did not hesitate to join in the conversation nor did i succeed so very badly considering the strangeness of it all for like the bee that has been much hindered at his flowery work by geometric webs i began to acquire some skill in pushing my way gracefully through the tangling meshes of thought and phrases that were new to me  the afternoons experiences had certainly been remarkablea strange mixture of pain and pleasure not blending into homogeneous gray but resembling rather a bright embroidery on a dark somber ground and of these surprising contrasts i was destined to have more that same evening  we were again assembled in the great room the venerable father reclining at his ease on his thronelike couch near the brass globes while the others pursued their various occupations as on the former evening not being able to get near yoletta and having nothing to do i settled myself comfortably in one of the spacious seats and gave up my mind to pleasant dreams at length to my surprise the father who had been regarding me for some time said will you lead my son  i started up turning very red in the face for i did not wish to trouble him with questions yet was at a loss to know what he meant by leading i thought of several thingswhist evening prayers dancing etc but being still in doubt i was compelled to ask him to explain  will you lead the singing he returned looking a little surprised  oh yes with pleasure said i there being no music about and no piano i concluded naturally that my friends amused themselves with solo songs without accompaniment of an evening and having a good tenor voice i was not unwilling to lead off with a song clearing my rusty throat with a ghrrghrrhram which made them all jump i launched forth with the vicar of braya grand old song and a great favorite of mine they all started when i commenced exchanging glances and casting astonished looks towards me but it was getting so dusky in the room that i could not feel sure that my eyes were not deceiving me presently some that were near me began retiring to distant seats and this distressed me so that it made me hoarse and my singing became very bad indeed but still i thought it best to go bravely on to the end suddenly the old gentleman who had been staring wildly at me for some time drew up his long yellow robe and wrapped it round his face and head i glanced at yoletta sitting at some distance and saw that she was holding her hands pressed to her ears  i thought it about time to leave off then and stopping abruptly in the middle of the fourth stanza i sat down feeling extremely hot and uncomfortable i was almost choking and unable to utter a word but there was no word for me to utter it was of course for them to thank me for singing or to say something but not a word was spoken yoletta dropped her hands and resumed her work while the old man slowly emerged with a somewhat frightened look from the wrappings and then the long dead silence becoming unendurable i remarked that i feared my singing was not to their taste no reply was made only the father putting out one of his hands touched a handle or key near him whereupon one of the brass globes began slowly revolving a low murmur of sound arose and seemed to pass like a wave through the room dying away in the distance soon to be succeeded by another and then another each marked by an increase of power and often as this solemn sound died away faint flutelike notes were heard as if approaching but still at a great distance and in the ensuing wave of sound from the great globes they would cease to be distinguishable still the mysterious coming sounds continued at intervals to grow louder and clearer joined by other tones as they progressed now altogether bursting out in joyous chorus then one purest liquid note soaring birdlike alone but whether from voices or windinstruments i was unable to tell until the whole air about me was filled and palpitating with the strange exquisite harmony which passed onwards the tones growing fewer and fainter by degrees until they almost died out of hearing in the opposite direction that all were now taking part in the performance i became convinced by watching in turn different individuals some of them having small curiouslyshaped instruments in their hands but there was a blending of voices and a something like ventriloquism in the tones which made it impossible to distinguish the notes of any one person deeper more sonorous tones now issued from the revolving globes sometimes resembling in character the vox humana of an organ and every time they rose to a certain pitch there were responsive soundsnot certainly from any of the performerslow tremulous and aeolian in character wandering over the entire room as if walls and ceiling were honeycombed with sensitive musical cells answering to the deeper vibrations these floating aerial sounds also answered to the higher notes of some of the female singers resembling soprano voices brightened and spiritualized in a wonderful degree and then the wide room would be filled with a mist as it were of this floating formless melody which seemed to come from invisible harpers hovering in the shadows above  lying back on my couch listening with closed eyes to this mysterious soulstirring concert i was affected to tears and almost feared that i had been snatched away into some supramundane region inhabited by beings of an angelic or halfangelic orderfeared i say for with this new love in my heart no elysium or starry abode could compare with this green earth for a dwellingplace but when i remembered my own brutal bull of bashan performance my face there in the dark was on fire with shame and i cursed the ignorant presumptuous folly i had been guilty of in roaring out that abominable vicar of bray ballad which had now become as hateful to me as my trousers or boots the composer of that song the writer of the words and its subject the doublefaced vicar himself presented themselves to my mind as the three most damnable beings that had ever existed the devil take my luck i muttered grinding my teeth with impotent anger for it seemed such hard lines just when i had succeeded in getting into favor to go and spoil it all in that unhappy way now that i had become acquainted with their style of singing the supposed fib about which there had been such a pother seemed a very venial offense compared with my attempt to lead the singing nevertheless when the concert was over not a word was said on the subject by any one though i had quite expected to be taken at once to the magisterial chamber to hear some dreadful sentence passed on me and when before retiring anxious to propitiate my host i began to express regret for having inflicted pain on them by attempting to sing the venerable gentleman raised his hands deprecatingly and begged me to say no more about it for painful subjects were best forgotten no doubt he kindly added when you were lying there buried among the hills you swallowed a large amount of earth and gravel in your efforts to breathe and have not yet freed your lungs from it  this was the most charitable view he could take of the matter and i was thankful that no worse result followed       chapter 10  at length the joyful day arrived when i was to cease in outward appearance at all events to be an alien for returning at noon from the fields on entering my cell i beheld my beautiful new garmentstwo complete suits besides underwear one the most soberly colored intended only for working hours but the second which was for the house claimed my first attention trembling with eagerness i flung off the old tweeds the cracked boots and other vestiges of a civilization which they had perhaps survived and soon found that i had been measured with faultless accuracy for everything down to the shoes fitted to perfection green was the prevailing or ground tinta soft sap green the pattern on it which was very beautiful being a somewhat obscure red inclining to purple my delight culminated when i drew on the hose which had like those worn by the others a curious design evidently borrowed from the skin of some kind of snake the ground color was light green almost citron yellow in fact and the pattern a bright maroon red with bronze reflections  i had no sooner arrayed myself than with a flushed face and palpitating heart i flew to exhibit myself to my friends and found them assembled and waiting to see and admire the result of their work the pleasure i saw reflected in their transparent faces increased my happiness a hundredfold and i quite astonished them with the torrent of eloquence in which i expressed my overflowing gratitude  now tell me one secret i exclaimed when the excitement began to abate a little why is green the principal color in my clothes when no other person in the house wears more than a very little of it  i had no sooner spoken than i heartily wished that i had held my peace for it all at once occurred to me that green was perhaps the color for an alien or mere hireling in which light they perhaps regarded me  oh smith can you not guess so simple a thing said edra placing her white hands on my shoulders and smiling straight into my face  how beautiful she looked standing there with her eyes so near to mine tell me why edra i said still with a lingering apprehension  why look at the color of my eyes and skinwould this green tint be suitable for me to wear  oh is that the reason cried i immensely relieved i think edra you would look very beautiful in any color that is on the earth or in the rainbow above the earth but am i so different from you all  oh yes quite differenthave you never looked at yourself your skin is whiter and redder and your hair has a very different color it will look better when it grows long i think and your eyesdo you know that they never change for when we look at you closely they are still bluegray and not green  no i wish they were said i now i shall value my clothes a hundred times more since you have taken so much pains to make themwell what shall i sayharmonize i suppose with the peculiar color of my mug dash it all im blundering again i meani meandont you know  edra laughed and gave it up then we all laughed for now evidently my blundering did not so much matter since i had shed my outer integument and come forth like a snake with a divided tail in a brand new skin  presently i missed yoletta from the room and desiring above all things to have some word of congratulation from her lips i went off to seek her she was standing under the portico waiting for me come she said and proceeded to lead me into the musicroom where we sat down on one of the couches close to the dais there she produced some large white tablets and red chalk pencils or crayons  now smith i am going to begin teaching you said she with the grave air of a young schoolmistress and every afternoon when your work is done you must come to me here  i hope i am very stupid and that it will take me a long time to learn said i  ohshe laugheddo you think it will be so pleasant sitting by me here i am glad you think that but if you prefer me for a teacher you must not try to be stupid because if you do i shall ask some one else to take my place  would you really do that yoletta  yes shall i tell you why because i have a quick impatient temper everything wrong i have ever done for which i have been punished has been through my hasty temper  and have you ever undergone that sad punishment of being shut up by yourself for many days yoletta  yes often for what other punishment is there but oh i hope it will never happen again because i thinki know that i suffer more than any one can imagine to tread on the grass to feel the sun and wind on my face to see the earth and sky and animalsthis is like life to me and when i am shut up alone every day seemsoh a year at least she did not know how much dearer this confession of one little human weakness made her seem to me come let us begin she said i waited for your new clothes to be finished and we must make up for lost time  but do you know yoletta that you have not said anything about them do i look nice and will you like me any better now  yes much better you were a poor caterpillar before i liked you a little because i knew what a pretty butterfly you would be in time i helped to make your wings now listen  for two hours she taught me making her red letters or marks which i copied on my tablet and explaining them to me and at the conclusion of the lesson i had got a general idea that the writing was to a great extent phonographic and that i was in for rather a tough job  do you think that you will be able to teach me to sing also i asked when she had put the tablets aside  the memory of that miserable failure when i had led the singing was a constant sore in my mind i had begun to think that i had not done myself justice on that memorable occasion and the desire to make another trial under more favorable circumstances was very strong in me  she looked a little startled at my question but said nothing  i know now i continued pleadingly that you all sing softly if you will only consent to try me once i promise to stick like cobblers waxi beg your pardon i mean i will endeavor to adhere to the morendo and perdendosi styledont you know what am i saying but i promise you yoletta i shant frighten you if you will only let me try and sing to you once  she turned from me with a somewhat clouded expression of face and walked with slow steps to the dais and placing her hands on the keys caused two of the small globes to revolve sending soft waves of sound through the room  i advanced towards her but she raised her hand apprehensively no no no stand there she said and sing low  it was hard to see her troubled face and obey but i was not going to bellow at her like a bull and i had set my heart on this trial for the last three days while working in the fields i had been incessantly practicing my dear old master campanas exquisite mappar sulla tomba the only melody i happened to know which had any resemblance to their divine music to my surprise she seemed to play as i sang a suitable accompaniment on the globes which aided and encouraged me and although singing in a subdued tone i felt that i had never sung so well before when i finished i quite expected some word of praise or to be asked why i had not sung this melody on that unhappy evening when i was asked to lead but she spoke no word  will you sing something now i said  not nowthis evening she replied absently slowly walking across the floor with eyes cast down  what are you thinking of yoletta that you look so serious i asked  nothing she returned a little impatiently  you look very solemn about nothing then but you have not said one word about my singingdid you not like it  your singing oh no it was a pleasanttasting little kernel in a very rough rindi should like one without the other  you talk in riddles yoletta but im afraid the answers to them would not sound very flattering to me but if you would like to know the song i shall be only too glad to teach it to you the words are in italian but i can translate them  the words she said absently  the words of the song i said  i do not know what you mean by the words of a song do not speak to me now smith  oh very well said i thinking it all very strange and sitting down i divided my attention between my beautiful hose and yoletta still slowly pacing the floor with that absent look on her face  at length the curious mood changed but i did not venture to talk any more about music and before very long we repaired to the eatingroom where for the next two or three hours we occupied ourselves very agreeably with those processes which some new theorist informs us constitute our chief pleasure in life  that evening i overheard a curious little dialogue the father of the house as i had now grown accustomed to call our head after rising from his seat stood for a few minutes talking near me while yoletta with her hand on his arm waited for him to finish when he had done speaking and turned to her she said in a low voice which i however overheard father i shall lead tonight  he put his hand on her head and looking down studied her upturned face ah my daughter he said with a smile shall i guess what has inspired you today you have been listening to the passage birds i also heard them this morning passing in flocks and you have been following them in thought far away into those sunbright lands where winter never comes  no father she returned i have only been a little way from home in thoughtonly to that spot where the grass has not yet grown to hide the ashes and loose mold he stooped and kissed her forehead and then left the room and she never noticing the hungry look with which i witnessed the tender caress also went away  that some person was supposed to lead the singing every evening i knew but it was impossible for me ever to discover who the leader was now however after overhearing this conversation i knew that on this particular occasion it would be yoletta and in spite of the very poor opinion she had expressed of my musical abilities i was prepared to admire the performance more than i had ever done before  it commenced in the usual mysterious and indefinable manner but after a time when it began to shape itself into melodies the idea possessed me that i was listening to strains once familiar but long unheard and forgotten at length i discovered that this was campanas music only not as i had ever heard it sung for the melody of mappar sulla tomba had been so transmuted and etherealized as it were that the composer himself would have listened in wondering ecstasy to the mournful strains which had passed through the alembic of their more delicately organized minds listening i remembered with an unaccountable feeling of sadness that poor campana had recently died in london and almost at the same moment there came to me a remembrance of my beloved mother whose early death was my first great grief in boyhood all the songs i had ever heard her sing came back to me ringing in my mind with a wonderful joy but ever ending in a strange funereal sadness and not only my mother but many a dear one besides returned in beauty from the dust appeared to be presentwhitehaired old men who had spoken treasured words to me in bygone years schoolfellows and other boyish friends and companions and men too in the prime of life of whose premature death in this or that faroff region of the worldwide english empire i had heard from time to time they came back to me until the whole room seemed filled with a pale shadowy procession moving past me to the sound of that mysterious melody through all the evening it came back in a hundred bewildering disguises filling me with a melancholy infinitely precious which was yet almost more than my heart could bear again and yet again that despairing ahime fell like a long shuddering sob from the revolving globes and from voices far and near to be taken up and borne yet further away by faroff dying sounds yet again responded to by nearer clearer voices in tones which seemed wrung from the depths of some divine despair then to pass away but not wholly pass for all the hidden cells were stirred and the vibrating air like mysterious invisible hands swept the suspended strings until the exquisite bliss and pain of it made me tremble and shed tears as i sat there in the dark wondering as men will wonder at such moments what this tempest of the soul which music wakes in us can mean whether it is merely a growth of this our earthlife or a something added a divine hunger of the heart which is part of our immortality       chapter 11  it seemed to me now that i had never really lived before so sweet was this new lifeso healthy and free from care and regret the old life which i had lived in cities was less in my thoughts on each succeeding day it came to me now like the memory of a repulsive dream which i was only too glad to forget how i had ever found that listless wornout luxurious donothing existence endurable seemed a greater mystery every morning when i went forth to my appointed task in the fields or the workhouse so natural and so pleasant did it now seem to labor with my own hands and to eat my bread in the sweat of my face if there was one kind of work i preferred above all others it was woodcutting and as a great deal of timber was required at this season i was allowed to follow my own inclination in the forest a couple of miles from the house several tough old giantschiefly oak chestnut elm and beechhad been marked out for destruction in some cases because they had been scorched and riven by lightnings and were an eyesore in others because time had robbed them of their glory withering their long desolate arms and bestowing on their crowns that lusterless scanty foliage which has a mournful meaning like the thin white hairs on the bowed head of a very old man at this distance from the house i could freely indulge my propensity for singing albeit in that coarser tone which had failed to win favor with my new friends  among the grand trees out of earshot of them all i could shout aloud to my hearts content rejoicing in the boisterous old english ballads which like john peeles viewhallo    might awaken the dead   or the fox from his lair in the morning   meanwhile with the frantic energy of a gladstone out of office i plied my ax its echoing strokes making fit accompaniment to my strains until for many yards about me the ground was littered with white and yellow chips then exhausted with my efforts i would sit down to rest and eat my simple midday fare to admire myself in my deepgreen and chocolate workingdress and above everything to think and dream of yoletta        in my walks to and from the forest i cast many a wistful look at a solitary flattopped hill almost a mountain in height which stood two or three miles from the house north of it on the other side of the river from its summit i felt sure that a very extensive view of the surrounding country might be had and i often wished to pay this hill a visit one afternoon while taking my lesson in reading i mentioned this desire to yoletta  come then let us go there now said she laying the tablets aside  i joyfully agreed i had never walked alone with her nor in fact with her at all since that first day when she had placed her hand in mine and now we were so much nearer in heart to each other  she led me to a point half a mile from the house where the stream rushed noisily over its stony bed and formed numerous deep channels between the rocks and one could cross over by jumping from rock to rock yoletta led the way leaping airily from stone to stone while i anxious to escape a wetting followed her with caution but when i was safe over and thought our delightful walk was about to begin she suddenly started off towards the hill at a swift pace which quickly left me far behind finding that i could not overtake her i shouted to her to wait for me then she stood still until i was within three or four yards of her when off she fled like the wind once more at length she reached the foot of the hill and sat down there until i joined her  for goodness sake yoletta let us behave like rational beings and walk quietly i was beginning when away she went again dancing up the mountainside with a tireless energy that amazed as well as exasperated me wait for me just once more i screamed after her then halfway up the side she stopped and sat down on a stone  now my chance has come thought i ready to make up for insufficient speed and wind by superior cunning which would make us equal i will go quietly up and catch her napping and hold her fast by the arm until the walk is finished so far it has been nothing but a mad chase  slowly i toiled on and then when i got near her and was just about to execute my plan she started nimbly away with a merry laugh and never paused again until the summit was reached thoroughly tired and beaten i sat down to rest but presently looking up i saw her at the top standing motionless on a stone looking like a statue outlined against the clear blue sky once more i got up and pressed on until i reached her and then sank down on the grass overcome with fatigue  when you ask me to walk again yoletta i panted i shall not move unless i have a rope round your waist to pull you back when you try to rush off in that mad fashion you have knocked all the wind out of me and yet i was in pretty good trim  she laughed and jumping to the ground sat down at my side on the grass  i caught her hand and held it tight now you shall not escape and run away again said i  you may keep my hand she replied it has nothing to do up here  may i put it to some useful purposemay i do what i like with it  yes you may then she added with a smile there is no thorn in it now  i kissed it many times on the back the palm the wrist then bestowed a separate caress on each fingertip  why do you kiss my hand she asked  do you not knowcan you not guess because it is the sweetest thing i can kiss except one other thing shall i tell you  my face and why do you not kiss that  oh may i said i and drawing her to me i kissed her soft cheek may i kiss the other cheek now i asked she turned it to me and when i had kissed it rapturously i gazed into her eyes which looked back bright and unabashed into mine i thinki think i made a slight mistake yoletta i said what i meant to ask was will you let me kiss you where i likeon your chin for instance or just where i like  yes but you are keeping me too long kiss me as many times as you like and then let us admire the prospect  i drew her closer and kissed her mouth not once nor twice but clinging to it with all the ardor of passion as if my lips had become glued to hers  suddenly she disengaged herself from me why do you kiss my mouth in that violent way she exclaimed her eyes sparkling her cheeks flushed you seem like some hungry animal that wanted to devour me  that was oddly enough just how i felt do you not not know sweetest why i kiss you in that way because i love you  i know you do smith i can understand and appreciate your love without having my lips bruised  and do you love me yoletta  yes certainlydid you not know that  and is it not sweet to kiss when you love do you know what love is darling do you love me a thousand times more than any one else in the world  how extravangantly you talk she replied what strange things you say  yes dear because love is strangethe strangest sweetest thing in life it comes once only to the heart and the one person loved is infinitely more than all others do you not understand that  oh no what do you mean smith  is there any other person dearer to your heart than i am  i love every one in the house some more than others those that are closely related to me i love most  oh please say no more you love your people with one kind of love but me with a different loveis it not so  there is only one kind of love said she  ah you say that because you are a child yet and do not know you are even younger than i thought perhaps how old are you dear  thirtyone years old she replied with the utmost gravity  oh yoletta what an awful cram i meanoh i beg your pardon for being so rude butbut dont you think you can draw it mild thirtyonewhat a joke why im an old fellow compared with you and im not twentytwo yet do tell me what you mean yoletta  she was not listening to me i saw she had risen from the grass and seated herself again on the stone for only answer to my question she pointed to the west with her hand saying look there smith  i stood up and looked the sun was near the horizon now and partially concealed by low clouds which were beginning to formgray and tinged with purple and red but their misty edges burned with an intense yellow flame above the sky was clear as blue glass barred with paleyellow rays shot forth by the sinking sun and resembling the spokes of an immense celestial wheel reaching to the zenith the billowy earth with its forests in deep green and manycolored autumnal foliage stretched far before us here in shadow and there flushed with rich light while the mountain range looming near and stupendous on our right had changed its color from dark blue to violet  the doubts and fears agitating my heart made me indifferent to the surpassing beauty of the scene i turned impatiently from it to gaze again on her graceful figure girlish still in its slim proportions but her face flushed with sunlight and crowned with its dark shining hair seemed to me like the face of one of the immortals the expression of rapt devotion on it made me silent for it seemed as if she too had been touched by natures magic like earth and sky and been transfigured and waiting for the mood to pass i stood by her side resting my hand on her knee byandby she looked down and smiled and then i returned to the subject of her age  surely yoletta said i you were only poking fun at mei mean amusing yourself at my expense you cant possibly be more than about fifteen or sixteen at the very outside  she smiled again and shook her head  oh i know i can solve the riddle now your years are different of course like everything else in this latitude a month is called a year with you and that would make you let me seehow much is twelve times thirtyone oh hang it nearly five hundred i should think why am i such a duffer at mental arithmetic it is just the contraryhow many twelves in thirtyone about two and a half in round numbers and thats absurd as you are not a baby oh i have it your seasons are called years of coursewhy didnt i see it before no that would make you only seven and a half ah yes i see it now a year means two years or two of your yearssummer and wintermean a year and that just makes you sixteen exactly what i had imagined is it not so yoletta  i do not know what you are talking about smith and i am not listening  well listen for one moment and tell me how long does a year last  it lasts from the time the leaves fall in the autumn until they fall again and it lasts from the time the swallows come in spring until they come again  and seriously honestly you are thirtyone years old  did i not tell you so yes i am thirtyone years old  well i never heard anything to equal this good heavens what does it mean i know it is awfully rude to inquire a ladys age but what am i to do will you kindly tell me edras age  edra i forget oh yes she is sixtythree  sixtythree ill be shot if shes a day more than twentyeight idiot that i am why cant i keep calm but yoletta how you distress me it almost frightens me to ask another question but do tell me how old your father is  he is nearly two hundred years olda hundred and ninetyeight i think she replied  heavens on earthi shall go stark staring mad but i could say no more leaving her side i sat down on a low stone at some distance with a stunned feeling in my brain and something like despair in my heart that she had told me the truth i could no longer doubt for one moment it was impossible for her crystal nature to be anything but truthful the number of her years mattered nothing to me the virgin sweetness of girlhood was on her lips the freshness and glory of early youth on her forehead the misery was that she had lived thirtyone years in the world and did not understand the words i had spoken to herdid not know what love or passion was would it always be sowould my heart consume itself to ashes and kindle no fire in hers  then as i sat there filled with these despairing thoughts she came down from her perch and dropping on her knees before me put her arms about my neck and gazed steadily into my face why are you troubled smithhave i said anything to hurt you said she and do you not know that you have offended me  have i tell me how dearest yoletta  by asking questions and saying wild meaningless things while i sat there watching the setting sun it troubled me and spoiled my pleasure but i will forgive you smith because i love you do you not think i love you enough you are very dear to medearer every day and drawing down my face she kissed my lips  darling you make me happy again i returned for if your love increases every day the time will perhaps come when you will understand me and be all i wish to me  what is it that you wish she questioned  that you should be minemine alone wholly mineand give yourself to me body and soul  she continued gazing up into my eyes in a sense we do i suppose give ourselves body and soul to those we love she said and if you are not yet satisfied that i have given myself to you in that way you must wait patiently saying and doing nothing willfully to alienate my heart until the time arrives when my love will be equal to your desire come she added and rising pulled me up by the hand  silently and somewhat pensively we started hand in hand on our walk down the hill presently she dropped on her knees and opening the grass with her hands displayed a small slender bud on a round smooth stem springing without leaves from the soil do you see she said looking up at me with a bright smile  yes dear i see a bud but i do not know anything more about it  oh smith do you not know that it is a rainbow lily and rising she took my hand and walked on again  what is the rainbow lily  byandby in a few days it will be in fullest bloom and the earth will be covered with its glory  it is so late in the season yoletta spring is the time to see the earth covered with the glory of flowers  there is nothing to equal the rainbow lily which comes when most flowers are dead or have their bright colors tarnished have you lived in the moon smith that i have to tell you these things  no dear but in that island where all things including flowers were different  ah yes tell me about the island  now that island was an unfortunate subject and i was not prepared to break the resolution i had made of prudently holding my tongue about its peculiar institutions how can i tell youhow could you imagine it if i were to tell you i said evading the question you have seen the heavens black with tempests and have felt the lightnings blinding your eyes and have heard the crash of the thunder could you imagine all that if you had never witnessed it and i described it to you  no  then it would be useless to tell you and now tell me about the rainbow lilies for i am a great lover of flowers  are you is it strange you should have a taste common to all human beings she returned with a pretty smile but it is easier to ask questions than to answer them if you had never seen the sun setting in glory or the midnight sky shining with myriads of stars could you imagine these things if i described them to you  no  that word is an echo smith you must wait for the earth to bring forth her rainbow lilies and the heart its love  with or without flowers the world is a paradise to me with you at my side yoletta ah if you will be my eve how sweet it is to walk hand in hand with you in the twilight but it was not so nice when you were scuttling from me like a wild rabbit im glad to find that you do walk sometimes  yes sometimeson solemn occasions  yes tell me about these solemn occasions  this is not one of them she replied suddenly withdrawing her hand from mine then with a ringing laugh she sped from me bounding down the hillside with the speed and grace of a gazelle  i instantly gave chase but it was a very vain chase although i put forth all my powers occasionally she would drop on her knees to admire some wild flower or search for a lily bud and whenever she came to a large stone she would spring on to it and stand for some time motionless gazing at the rich hues of the afterglow but always at my approach she would spring lightly away escaping from me as easily as a wild bird tired with running i at last gave up the hunt and walked soberly home by myself wondering whether that conversation on the summit of the hill and all the curious information i had gathered from it should make me the most miserable or the most happy being upon earth       chapter 12  the question whether i had reason to feel happy or the reverse still occupied me after going to bed and kept me awake far into the night i put it to myself in a variety of ways concentrating my faculties on it but the result still remained doubtful mine was a curious position for a man to be in for here was i very much in love with yoletta who said that her age was thirtyone and yet who knew of only one kind of lovethat sisterly affection which she gave me so unstintingly of course i was surrounded with mysteries being in the house but not of it to the manner born and i had already arrived at the conclusion that these mysteries could only be known to me through reading once that accomplishment was mine for it seemed rather a dangerous thing to ask questions since the most innocent interrogatory might be taken as an offense only to be expiated by solitary confinement and a breadandwater diet or if not punishable in that way it would probably be regarded as a result of the supposed collision of my head with a stone to be reticent observant and studious was a safe plan this had served to make me diligent and attentive with my lessons and my gentle teacher had been much pleased with the progress i had made even in a few days her words on the hill had now however filled me with anxiety and i wanted to go a little below the surface of this strange system of life why was this large familytwentytwo members present besides some absent pilgrims as they are calledcomposed only of adults again more curious still why was the father of the house adorned with a majestic beard while the other men of various ages had smooth faces or at any rate nothing more than a slight down on the upper lip and cheeks it was plain that they never shaved and were these people all really brothers and sisters so far i had been unable even with the most jealous watching to detect anything like lovemaking or flirting they all treated each other as yoletta treated me with kindness and affection and nothing more and if the head of the house was in fact the father of them allsince in two centuries a man might have an indefinite number of childrenwho was the mother or mothers i was never good at guessing but the result of my cogitations was one happy ideato ask yoletta whether she had a living mother or not she was my teacher my friend and guardian in the house and if it should turn out that the question was an unfortunate one an offense she would be readier to forgive than another  accordingly next day as soon as we were alone together i put the question to her although not without a nervous qualm  she looked at me with the greatest surprise do you mean to say she answered that you do not know i have a motherthat there is a mother of the house  how should i know yoletta i returned i have not heard you address any one as mother besides how is one to know anything in a strange place unless he is told  how strange then that you never asked till now there is a mother of the housethe mother of us all of you since you were made one of us and it happens too that i am her daughterher only child you have not seen her because you have never asked to be taken to her and she is not among us because of her illness for very long she has been afflicted with a malady from which she cannot recover and for a whole year she has not left the mothers room  she spoke with eyes cast down in a low and very sad voice it was only too plain now that in my ignorance i had been guilty of a grave breach of the etiquette or laws of the house and anxious to repair my fault also to know more of the one female in this mysterious community who had loved or at all events had known marriage i asked if i might see her  yes she answered after some hesitation still standing with eyes cast down then suddenly bursting into tears she exclaimed oh smith how could you be in the world and not know that there is a mother in every house how could you travel and not know that when you enter a house after greeting the father you first of all ask to be taken to the mother to worship her and feel her hand on your head did you not see that we were astonished and grieved at your silence when you came and we waited in vain for you to speak  i was dumb with shame at her words how well i remembered that first evening in the house when i could not but see that something was expected of me yet never ventured to ask for enlightment  presently recovering from her tears she went from the room and left alone i was more than ever filled with wonder at what she had told me i had not imagined that she had come into the world without a mother nevertheless the fact that this passionless girl who had told me that there was only one kind of love was the daughter of a woman actually living in the house of whose existence i had never before heard except in an indirect way which i failed to understand seemed like a dream to me now i was about to see this hidden woman and the interview would reveal something to me for i would discover in her face and conversation whether she was in the same mystic state of mind as the others which made them seem like the dwellers in some better place than this poor old sinful sorrowful world my wishes however were not to be gratified for presently yoletta returned and said that her mother did not desire to see me then she looked so distressed when she told me this putting her white arms about my neck as if to console me for my disappointment that i refrained from pressing her with questions and for several days nothing more was spoken between us on the subject  at length one day when our lesson was over with an expression of mingled pleasure and anxiety on her face she rose and took my hand saying come  i knew she was going to take me to her mother and rose to obey her gladly for since the conversation i had had with her the desire to know the lady of the house had given me no peace  leaving the music room we entered another apartment of the same navelike form but vaster or at all events considerably longer there i started and stood still amazed at the scene before me the light which found entrance through tall narrow windows was dim but sufficient to show the whole room with everything in it ending at the further extremity at a flight of broad stone steps the middle part of the floor running the entire length of the apartment was about twenty feet wide but on either side of this passage which was covered with mosaic the floor was raised and on this higher level i saw as i imagined a great company of men and women singly and in groups standing or seated on great stone chairs in various positions and attitudes presently i perceived that these were not living beings but lifelike effigies of stone the drapery they were represented as wearing being of many different richlycolored stones having the appearance of real garments so natural did the hair look that only when i ascended the steps and touched the head of one of the statues was i convinced that it was also of stone even more wonderful in their resemblance to life were the eyes which seemed to return my halffearful glances with a calm questioning scrutiny i found it hard to endure i hurried on after my guide without speaking but when i got to the middle of the room i paused involuntarily once more so profoundly did one of the statues impress me it was of a woman of a majestic figure and proud beautiful face with an abundance of silverywhite hair she sat bending forward with her eyes fixed on mine as i advanced one hand pressed to her bosom while with the other she seemed in the act of throwing back her white unbound tresses from her forehead there was i thought a look of calm unbending pride on the face but on coming closer this expression disappeared giving place to one so wistful and pleading so charged with subtle pain that i stood gazing like one fascinated until yoletta took my hand and gently drew me away still in spite of the absorbing nature of the matter on which i was bound that strange face continued to haunt me and glancing up and down through that long array of calmbrowed beautiful women i could see no one that was like it  arrived at the end of the gallery we ascended the broad stone steps and came to a landing twenty or thirty feet above the level of the floor we had traversed here yoletta pushed a glass door aside and ushered me into another apartmentthe mothers room it was spacious and unlike the gallery welllighted the air in it was also warm and balmy and seemed charged with a subtle aroma but now my whole attention was concentrated on a group of persons before me and chiefly on its central figurethe woman i had so much desired to see she was seated leaning back in a somewhat listless attitude on a very large low couchlike seat covered with a soft violetcolored material my very first glance at her face revealed to me that she differed in appearance and expression from other inmates of the house one reason was that she was extremely pale and bore on her worn countenance the impress of longcontinued suffering but that was not all she wore her hair which fell unbound on her shoulders longer than the others and her eyes looked larger and of a deeper green there was something wonderfully fascinating to me in that pale suffering face for in spite of suffering it was beautiful and loving but dearer than all these things to my mind were the marks of passion it exhibited the petulant almost scornful mouth and the halfeager halfweary expression of the eyes for these seemed rather to belong to that imperfect world from which i had been severed and which was still dear to my unregenerate heart in other respects also she differed from the rest of the women her dress being a long paleblue robe embroidered with saffroncolored flowers and foliage down the middle and also on the neck and the wide sleeves on the couch at her side sat the father of the house holding her hand and talking in low tones to her two of the young women sat at her feet on cushions engaged on embroidery work while another stood behind her one of the young men was also there and was just now showing her a sketch and apparently explaining something in it  i had expected to find a sick feeble lady in a dimlylighted chamber with perhaps one attendant at her side now coming so unexpectedly before this proudlooking beautiful woman with so many about her i was completely abashed and feeling too confused to say anything stood silent and awkward in her presence  this is our stranger chastel said the old man to her at the same time bestowing an encouraging look on me  she turned from the sketch she had been studying and raising herself slightly from her halfrecumbent attitude fixed her dark eyes on me with some interest  i do not see why you were so much impressed she remarked after a while there is nothing very strange in him after all  i felt my face grow hot with shame and anger for she seemed to look on me and speak of menot to meas if i had been some strange semihuman creature discovered in the woods and brought in as a great curiosity  no it was not his countenance only his curious garments and his words that astonished us said the father in reply  she made no answer to this but presently addressing me directly said you were a long time in the house before you expressed a wish to see me  i found my speech thena wretched hesitating speech for which i hated myselfand replied that i had asked to be allowed to see her as soon as i had been informed of her existence  she turned on the father a look of surprise and inquiry  you must remember chastel said he that he comes to us from some strange distant island having customs different from oursa thing i had never heard of before i can give you no other explanation  her lip curled and then turning to me she continued if there are houses in your island without mothers in them it is not so elsewhere in the world that you went out to travel so poorly provided with knowledge is a marvel to us and as i have had the pain of telling you this i must regret that you ever left your own home  i could make no reply to these words which fell on me like whipstrokes and looking at the other faces i could see no sympathy in them for me as they looked at hertheir motherand listened to her words the expression they wore was love and devotion to her only reminding me a little of the angel faces on guides canvas of the coronation of the virgin  go now she presently added in a petulant tone i am tired and wish to rest and yoletta who had been standing silently by me all the time took my hand and led me from the room  with eyes cast down i passed through the gallery paying no attention to its strange stony occupants and leaving my gentle conductress without a word at the door of the musicroom i hurried away from the house for i could feel love and compassion in the touch of the dear girls hand and it seemed to me that if she had spoken one word my overcharged heart would have found vent in tears i only wished to be alone to brood in secret on my pain and the bitterness of defeat for it was plain that the woman i had so wished to see and since seeing her so wished to be allowed to love felt towards me nothing but contempt and aversion and that from no fault of my own she whose friendship i most needed was become my enemy in the house  my steps took me to the river following its banks for about a mile i came at last to a grove of stately old trees and there i seated myself on a large twisted root projecting over the water to this sequestered spot i had come to indulge my resentful feelings for here i could speak out my bitterness aloud if i felt so minded where there were no witnesses to hear me i had restrained those unmanly tears so nearly shed in yolettas presence and kept back by dark thoughts on the way now i was sitting quietly by myself safe from observation safe even from that sympathy my bruised spirit could not suffer  scarcely had i seated myself before a great brown animal with black eyes round and fierce rose to the surface of the stream half a dozen yards from my feet then quickly catching sight of me it plunged noisily again under water breaking the clear image reflected there with a hundred ripples i waited for the last wavelet to fade away but when the surface was once more still and smooth as dark glass i began to be affected by the profounded silence and melancholy of nature and by a something proceeding from naturephantom emanation essence i know not what my soul not my sense perceived it standing with finger on lips there close to me its feet resting on the motionless water which gave no reflection of its image the clear amber sunlight passing undimmed through its substance to my soul its spoken hush was audible and again and yet again it said hush until the tumult in me was still and i could not think my own thoughts i could thereafter only listen breathless straining my senses to catch some natural sound however faint far away in the dim distance in some blue pasture a cow was lowing and the recurring sound passed me like the humming flight of an insect then fainter still like an imagined sound until it ceased a withered leaf fell from the treetop i heard it fluttering downwards touching other leaves in its fall until the silent grass received it then as i listened for another leaf suddenly from overhead came the brief gushing melody of some late singer a robinlike sound ringing out clear and distinct as a flourish on a clarionet brilliant joyous and unexpected yet in keeping with that melancholy quiet affecting the mind like a spray of gold and scarlet embroidery on a pale neutral ground the sun went down and in setting kindled the boles of the old trees here and there into pillars of red fire while others in deeper shade looked by contrast like pillars of ebony and wherever the foliage was thinnest the level rays shining through imparted to the sere leaves a translucence and splendor that was like the stained glass in the windows of some darkening cathedral all along the river a white mist began to rise a slight wind sprang up and the vapor drifted drowning the reeds and bushes and wreathing its ghostly arms about the old trees and watching the mist and listening to the hallowed airs and symphonies whispered by the low wind i felt that there was no longer any anger in my heart nature and something in and yet more than nature had imparted her soft influences and healed her wandering and distempered child until he could no more be a jarring and discordant thing in her sweet and sacred presence  when i looked up a change had come over the scene the round full moon had risen silvering the mist and filling the wide dim earth with a new mysterious glory i rose from my seat and returned to the house and with that new insight and comprehension which had come to methat message as i could not but regard iti now felt nothing but love and sympathy for the suffering woman who had wounded me with her unmerited displeasure and my only desire was to show my devotion to her       chapter 13  as i approached the building soft strains floating far out into the nightair became audible and i knew that the sweet spirit of music to which they were all so devoted was present with them after listening for awhile in the shadow of the portico i went in and anxious to avoid disturbing the singers stole away into a dusky corner where i sat down by myself yoletta had however seen me enter for presently she came to me  why did you not come in to supper smith she said and why do you look so sad  do you need to ask yoletta ah it would have made me so happy if i could have won your mothers affection if she only knew how much i wish for it and how much i sympathize with her but she will never like me and all i wished to say to her must be left unsaid  no not so she said come with me to her now if you feel like that she will be kind to youhow should it be otherwise  i greatly feared that she advised me to take an imprudent step but she was my guide my teacher and friend in the house and i resolved to do as she wished there were no lights in the long gallery when we entered it again only the white moonbeams coming through the tall windows here and there lit up a column or a group of statues which threw long black shadows on floor and wall giving the chamber a weird appearance once more when i reached the middle of the room i paused for there before me ever bending forward sat that wonderful woman of stone the moonlight streaming full on her pale wistful face and silvery hair  tell me yoletta who is this i whispered is it a statue of some one who lived in this house  yes you can read about her in the history of the house and in this inscription on the stone she was a mother and her name was isarte  but why has she that strange haunting expression on her face was she unhappy  oh can you not see that she was unhappy she endured many sorrows and the crowning calamity of her life was the loss of seven loved sons they were away in the mountains together and did not return when expected for many years she waited for tidings of them it was conjectured that a great rock had fallen on and crushed them beneath it grief for her lost children made her hair white and gave that expression to her face  and when did this happen  over two thousand years ago  oh then it is a very old family tradition but the statuewhen was that made and placed here  she had it made and placed here herself it was her wish that the grief she endured should be remembered in the house for all time for no one had ever suffered like her and the inscription which she caused to be put on the stone says that if there shall ever come to a mother in the house a sorrow exceeding hers the statue shall be removed from its place and destroyed and the fragments buried in the earth with all forgotten things and the name of isarte forgotten in the house  it oppressed my mind to think of so long a period of time during which that unutterably sad face had gazed down on so many generations of the living it is most strange i murmured but do you think it right yoletta that the grief of one person should be perpetuated like that in the house for who can look on this face without pain even when it is remembered that the sorrow it expresses ended so many centuries ago  but she was a mother smith do you not understand it would not be right for us to wish to have our griefs remembered for ever to cause sorrow to those who succeed us but a mother is different her wishes are sacred and what she wills is right  her words surprised me not a little for i had heard of infallible men but never of women moreover the woman i was now going to see was also a mother in the house a successor to this very isarte fearing that i had touched on a dangerous topic i said no more and proceeding on our way we soon reached the mothers room the large glass door of which now stood wide open in the pale light of the moonfor there was no other in the roomwe found chastel on the couch where i had seen her before but she was lying extended at full length now and had only one attendant with her  yoletta approached her and stooping touched her lips to the pale still face mother she said i have brought smith again he is anxious to say something to you if you will hear him  yes i will hear him she replied let him sit near me and now go back for your voice is needed and you may also leave me now she added addressing the other lady  the two then departed together and i proceeded to seat myself on a cushion beside the couch  what is it you wish to say to me she asked the words were not very encouraging but her voice sounded gentler now and i at once began hush she said before i had spoken two words wait until this endsi am listening to yolettas voice  through the long dusky gallery and the open doors soft strains of music were floating to us and now mingling with the others a clearer belllike voice was heard which soared to greater heights but soon this ceased to be distinguishable and then she sighed and addressed me again where have you been all the evening for you were not at supper  did you know that i asked in surprise  yes i know everything that passes in the house reading and work of all kinds are a pain and weariness the only thing left to me is to listen to what others do or say and to know all their comings and goings my life is nothing now but a shadow of other peoples lives  then i said i must tell you how i spent the time after seeing you today for i was alone and no other person can say what i did i went away along the river until i came to the grove of great trees on the bank and there i sat until the moon rose with my heart full of unspeakable pain and bitterness  what made you have those feelings  when i heard of you and saw you my heart was drawn to you and i wished above all things in the world to be allowed to love and serve you and to have a share in your affection but your looks and words expressed only contempt and dislike towards me would it not have been strange if i had not felt extremely unhappy  oh she replied now i can understand the reason of the surprise your words have often caused in the house your very feelings seem unlike ours no other person would have experienced the feelings you speak of for such a cause it is right to repent your faults and to bear the burden of them quietly but it is a sign of an undisciplined spirit to feel bitterness and to wish to cast the blame of your suffering on another you forget that i had reason to be deeply offended with you you also forget my continual suffering which sometimes makes me seem harsh and unkind against my will  your words seem only sweet and gracious now i returned they have lifted a great weight from my heart and i wish i could repay you for them by taking some portion of your suffering on myself  it is right that you should have that feeling but idle to express it she answered gravely if such wishes could be fulfilled my sufferings would have long ceased since any one of my children would gladly lay down his life to procure me ease  to this speech which sounded like another rebuke i made no reply  oh this is bitterness indeeda bitterness you cannot know she resumed after a while for you and for others there is always the refuge of death from continued sufferings the brief pang of dissolution bravely met is nothing in comparison with a lingering agony like mine with its long days and longer nights extending to years and that great blackness of the end ever before the mind this only a mother can know since the horror of utter darkness and vain clinging to life even when it has ceased to have any hope or joy in it is the penalty she must pay for her higher state  i could not understand all her words and only murmured in reply you are young to speak of death  yes young that is why it is so bitter to think of in old age the feelings are not so keen then suddenly she put out her hands towards me and when i offered mine caught my fingers with a nervous grasp and drew herself to a sitting position ah why must i be afflicted with a misery others have not known she exclaimed excitedly to be lifted above the others when so young to have one child only then after so brief a period of happiness to be smitten with barrenness and this lingering malady ever gnawing like a canker at the roots of life who has suffered like me in the house you only isarte among the dead i will go to you for my grief is more than i can bear and it may be that i shall find comfort even in speaking to the dead and to a stone can you bear me in your arms she said clasping me round the neck take me up in your arms and carry me to isarte  i knew what she meant having so recently heard the story of isarte and in obedience to her command i raised her from the couch she was tall and heavier than i had expected though so greatly emaciated but the thought that she was yolettas mother and the mother of the house nerved me to my task and cautiously moving step by step through the gloom i carried her safely to that whitehaired moonlit woman of stone in the long gallery when i had ascended the steps and brought her sufficiently near she put her arms about the statue and pressed its stony lips with hers  isarte isarte how cold your lips are she murmured in low desponding tones now when i look into these eyes which are yours and yet not yours and kiss these stony lips how sorely does the hunger in my heart tempt me to sin but suffering has not darkened my reason i know it is an offense to ask anything of him who gives us life and all good things freely and has no pleasure in seeing us miserable this thought restrains me else i would cry to him to turn this stone to flesh and for one brief hour to bring back to it the vanished spirit of isarte for there is no one living that can understand my pain but you would understand it and put my tired head against your breast and cover me with your griefwhitened hair as with a mantle for your pain was like mine and exceeded mine and no soul could measure it therefore in the hunger of your heart you looked far off into the future where some one would perhaps have a like affliction and suffer without hope as you suffered and measure your pain and love your memory and feel united with you even over the gulf of long centuries of time you would speak to me of it all and tell me that the greatest grief was to go away into darkness leaving no one with your blood and your spirit to inherit the house this also is my grief isarte for i am barren and eaten up by death and must soon go away to be where you are when i am gone the father of the house will take no other one to his bosom for he is old and his life is nearly complete and in a little while he will follow me but with no pain and anguish like mine to cloud his serene spirit and who will then inherit our place ah my sister how bitter to think of it for then a stranger will be the mother of the house and my one only child will sit at her feet calling her mother serving her with her hands and loving and worshiping her with her heart  the excitement had now burned itself out she had dropped her head wearily on my shoulder and bade me take her back when i had safely deposited her on the couch again she remained for some minutes with her face covered silently weeping  the scene in the gallery had deeply affected me now however while i sat by her pondering over it my mind reverted to that vanished world of sorrow and different social conditions in which i had lived and where the lot of so many poor suffering souls seemed to me so much more desolate than that of this unhappy lady who had i imagined much to console her it even seemed to me that the grief i had witnessed was somewhat morbid and overstrained and thinking that it would perhaps divert her mind from brooding too much over her own troubles i ventured when she had grown calm again to tell her some of my memories i asked her to imagine a state of the world and the human family in which all women were in one sense on an equalityall possessing the same capacity for suffering and where all were or would be wives and mothers and without any such mysterious remedy against lingering pain as she had spoken of but i had not proceeded far with my picture before she interrupted me  do not say more she said with an accent of displeasure this i suppose is another of those grotesque fancies you sometimes give expression to about which i heard a great deal when you first came to us that all people should be equal and all women wives and mothers seems to me a very disordered and a very repulsive idea the one consolation in my pain the one glory of my life could not exist in such a state as that and my condition would be pitiable indeed all others would be equally miserable the human race would multiply until the fruits of the soil would be insufficient for its support and earth would be filled with degenerate beings starved in body and debased in mindall clinging to an existence utterly without joy life is dark to me but not to others these are matters beyond you and it is presumptuous in one of your condition to attempt to comfort me with idle fancies  after some moments of silence she resumed the father has said today that you came to us from an island where even the customs of the people are different from ours and perhaps one of their unhappy methods is to seek to medicine a real misery by imagining some impossible and immeasurably greater one in no other way can i account for your strange words to me for i cannot believe that any race exists so debased as actually to practice the things you speak of remember that i do not ask or desire to be informed we have a different way for although it is conceivable that present misery might be mitigated or forgotten for a season by giving up the soul to delusions even by summoning before the mind repulsive and horrible images that would be to put to an unlawful use and to pervert the brightest faculties our father has given us therefore we seek no other support in all sufferings and calamities but that of reason only if you wish for my affection you will not speak of such things again but will endeavor to purify yourself from a mental vice which may sometimes in periods of suffering give you a false comfort for a brief season only to degrade you and sink you later in a deeper misery you must now leave me  this unexpected and sharp rebuke did not anger me but it made me very sad for i now perceived plainly enough that no great advantage would come to me from chastels acquaintance since it was necessary to be so very circumspect with her deeply troubled and in a somewhat confused state of mind i rose to depart then she placed her thin feverish white hand on mine you need not go away again she said to indulge in bitter feelings by yourself because i have said this to you you may come with the others to see me and talk to me whenever i am able to sit here and bear it i shall not remember your offense but shall be glad to know that there is another soul in the house to love and honor me  with such comfort as these words afforded i returned to the musicroom and finding it empty went out to the terrace where the others were now strolling about in knots and couples conversing and enjoying the lovely moonlight wandering a little distance away by myself i sat down on a bench under a tree and presently yoletta came to me there and closely scrutinized my face  have you nothing to tell me she asked are you happier now  yes dearest for i have been spoke to very kindly and i should have been happier if only but i checked myself in time and said no more to her about my conversation with the mother to myself i said oh that island that island why cant i forget its miserable customs or at any rate stick to my own resolution to hold my tongue about them       chapter 14  from that day i was frequently allowed to enter the mothers room but as i had feared these visits failed to bring me into any closer relationship with the lady of the house she had indeed forgotten my offense i was one of her children sharing equally with the others in her impartial affection and privileged to sit at her feet to relate to her the incidents of the day or describe all i had seen and sometimes to touch her thin white hand with my lips but the distance separating us was not forgotten at the two first interviews she had taught me once for all that it was for me to love honor and serve her and that anything beyond thatany attempt to win her confidence to enter into her thoughts or make her understand my feelings and aspirationswas regarded as pure presumption on my part the result was that i was less happy than i had been before knowing her my naturally buoyant and hopeful temper became tinged with melancholy and that vision of exquisite bliss in the future which had floated before me luring me on now began to look pale and to seem further and further away  after my walk with yolettaif it can be called a walki began to look out for the rainbow lilies and soon discovered that everywhere under the grass they were beginning to sprout from the soil at first i found them in the moist valley of the river but very soon they were equally abundant on the higher lands and even on barren stony places where they appeared latest i felt very curious about these flowers of which yoletta had spoken so enthusiastically and watched the slow growth of the long slender buds from day to day with considerable impatience at length in a moist hollow of the forest i was delighted to find the fullblown flower in shape it resembled a tulip but was more open and the color a most vivid orange yellow it had a slight delicate perfume and was very pretty with a peculiar waxy gloss on the thick petals still i was rather disappointed since the name of rainbow lily and yolettas words had led me to expect a manycolored flower of surpassing beauty  i plucked the lily carefully and was taking it home to present it to her when all at once i remembered that only on one occasion had i seen flowers in her hand and in the hands of the others and that was when they were burying their dead they never wore a flower nor had i ever seen one in the house not even in that room where chastel was kept a prisoner by her malady and where her greatest delight was to have nature in all its beauty and fragrance brought to her in the conversation of her children the only flowers in the house were in their illuminations and those wrought in metal and carved in wood and the immortal stony flowers of many brilliant hues in their mosaics i began to fear that there was some superstition which made it seem wrong to them to gather flowers except for funeral ceremonies and afraid of offending from want of thought i dropped the lily on the ground and said nothing about it to any one  then before any more open lilies were found an unexpected sorrow came to me after changing my dress on returning from the fields one afternoon i was taken to the hall of judgment and at once jumped to the conclusion that i had again unwittingly fallen into disgrace but on arriving at that uncomfortable apartment i perceived that this was not the case looking round at the assembled company i missed yoletta and my heart sank in me and i even wished that my first impression had proved correct on the great stone table before which the father was seated lay an open folio the leaf displayed being only illuminated at the top and inner margin the colored part at the top i noticed was torn the rent extending down to about the middle of the page  presently the dear girl appeared with tearful eyes and flushed face and advancing hurriedly to the father she stood before him with downcast eyes  my daughter tell me how and why you did this he demanded pointing to the open volume  oh father look at this she returned halfsobbing and touching the lower end of the colored margin with her finger do you see how badly it is colored and i had spent three days in altering and retouching it and still it displeased me then in sudden anger i pushed the book from me and seeing it slipping from the stand i caught the leaf to prevent it from falling and it was torn by the weight of the book oh dear father will you forgive me  forgive you my daughter do you not know how it grieves my heart to punish you but how can this offense to the house be forgiven which must stand in evidence against us from generation to generation for we cease to be but the house remains and the writing we leave on it whether it be good or evil that too remains for ever an unkind word is an evil thing an unkind deed a worse but when these are repented they may be forgiven and forgotten but an injury done to the house cannot be forgotten for it is the flaw in the stone that keeps its place the crude inharmonious color which cannot be washed out with water consider my daughter in the long life of the house how many unborn men will turn the leaves of this book and coming to this leaf will be offended at so grievous a disfigurement if we of this generation were destined to live for ever then it might be written on this page for a punishment and warning yoletta tore it in her anger but we must pass away and be nothing to succeeding generations and it would not be right that yolettas name should be remembered for the wrong she did to the house and all she did for its good forgotten  a painful silence ensued then lifting her tearstained face she said oh father what must my punishment be  dear child it will be a light one for we consider your youth and impulsive nature and also that the wrong you did was partly the result of accident for thirty days you must live apart from us subsisting on bread and water and holding intercourse with one person only who will assist you with your work and provide you with all things necessary  this seemed to me a harsh even a cruel punishment for so trivial an offense or accident rather but she was not perhaps of the same mind for she kissed his hand as if in gratitude for his leniency  tell me child he said putting his hand on her head and regarding her with misty eyes who shall attend you in your seclusion  edra she murmured and the other coming forward took her by the hand and led her away  i gazed eagerly after her as she retired hungering for one look from her dear eyes before that long separation but they were filled with tears and bent on the floor and in a moment she was gone from sight  the succeeding days were to me dreary beyond description for the first time i became fully conscious of the strength of a passion which had now become a consuming fire in my breast and could only end in utter miseryperhaps in destructionor else in a degree of happiness no mortal had ever tasted before i went about listlessly like one on whom some heavy calamity has fallen all interest in my work was lost my food seemed tasteless study and conversation had become a weariness even in those divine concerts which fitly brought each tranquil day to its close there was no charm now since yolettas voice which love had taught my dull ear to distinguish no longer had any part in it i was not allowed to enter the mothers room of an evening now and the exclusion extended also to the others edra only excepted for at this hour when it was customary for the family to gather in the musicroom yoletta was taken from her lonely chamber to be with her mother this was told me and i also elicited by means of some roundabout questioning that it was always in the mothers power to have any person undergoing punishment taken to her she being as it were above the law she could even pardon a delinquent and set him free if she felt so minded although in this case she had not chosen to exercise her prerogative probably because her sufferings had not clouded her understanding they were treating her very hardlyfather and mother bothi thought in my bitterness  the gradual opening of the rainbow lilies served only to remind me every hour and every minute of that bright young spirit thus harshly deprived of the pleasure she had so eagerly anticipated she above them all rejoiced in the beauty of this visible world regarding nature in some of its moods and aspects with a feeling almost bordering on adoration but alas she alone was shut out from this glory which god had spread over the earth for the delight of all his children  now i knew why these autumnal flowers were called rainbow lilies and remembered how yoletta had told me that they gave a beauty to the earth which could not be described or imagined the flowers were all undoubtedly of one species having the same shape and perfume although varying greatly in size according to the nature of the soil on which they grew but in different situations they varied in color one color blending with or passing by degrees into another wherever the soil altered its character along the valleys where they first began to bloom and in all moist situations the hue was yellow varying according to the amount of moisture in different places from pale primrose to deep orange this passing again into vivid scarlet and reds of many shades on the plains the reds prevailed changing into various purples on hills and mountain slopes but high on the mountains the color was blue and this also had many gradations from the lower deep cornflower blue to a delicate azure on the summits resembling that of the forgetmenot and hairbell  the weather proved singularly favorable to those who spent their time in admiring the lilies and this now seemed to be almost the only occupation of the inmates excepting of course sick chastel imprisoned yoletta and myselfi being too forlorn to admire anything calm bright days without a cloud succeeded each other as if the very elements held the lilies sacred and ventured not to cast any shadow over their mystic splendor each morning one of the men would go out some distance from the house and blow on a horn which could be heard distinctly two miles away and presently a number of horses in couples and troops would come galloping in after which they would remain all the morning grazing and gamboling about the house these horses were now in constant requisition all the members of the family male and female spending several hours every day in careering over the surrounding country seemingly without any particular object the contagion did not affect me however for although i had always been a bold rider in my own country and excessively fond of horseback exercise their fashion of riding without bridles and on diminutive straw saddles seemed to me neither safe nor pleasant  one morning after breakfasting i took my ax and was proceeding slowly immersed in thought to the forest when hearing a slight swishing sound of hoofs on the grass i turned and beheld the venerable father mounted on his charger and rushing away towards the hills at an insanely breakneck pace his long garment was gathered tightly round his spare form his feet drawn up and his head bent far forward while the wind of his speed divided his beard which flew out in two long streamers behind all at once he caught sight of me and touching the animals neck swept gracefully round in narrowing circles each circle bringing him nearer until he came to a stand at my side then his horse began rubbing his nose on my hand its breath feeling like fire on my skin  smith said he with a grave smile if you cannot be happy unless you are laboring in the forest with your ax you must proceed with your woodcutting but i confess it surprises me as much to see you going to work on a day like this as it would to see you walking inverted on your hands and dangling your heels in the air  why said i surprised at this speech  if you do not know i must tell you at night we sleep in the morning we bathe we eat when we are hungry converse when we feel inclined and on most days labor a certain number of hours but more than these things which have a certain amount of pleasure in them are the precious moments when nature reveals herself to us in all her beauty we give ourselves wholly to her then and she refreshes us the splendor fades but the wealth it brings to the soul remains to gladden us that must be a dull spirit that cannot suspend its toil when the sun is setting in glory or the violet rainbow appears on the cloud every day brings us special moments to gladden us just as we have in the house every day our time of melody and recreation but this supreme and more enduring glory of nature comes only once every year and while it lasts all labor except that which is pressing and necessary is unseemly and an offense to the father of the world he paused but i did not know what to say in reply and presently he resumed my son there are horses waiting for you and unless you are more unlike us in mind than i ever imagined you will now take one and ride to the hills where owing to the absence of forests the earth can now be seen at its best  i was about to thank him and turn back but the thought of yoletta to whom each heavy day now seemed a year oppressed by heart and i continued standing motionless with downcast eyes wishing yet fearing to speak  why is your mind troubled my son he said kindly  father i answered that word which i now ventured to use for the first time trembling from my lips the beauty of the earth is very much to me but i cannot help remembering that to yoletta it is even more and the thought takes away all my pleasure the flowers will fade and she will not see them  my son i am glad to hear these words he answered somewhat to my surprise for i had greatly feared that i had adopted too bold a course for i see now he continued that this seeming indifference which gave me some pain does not proceed from an incapacity on your part to feel as we do but from a tender love and compassionthat most precious of all our emotions which will serve to draw you closer to us i have also thought much of yoletta during these beautiful days grieving for her and this morning i have allowed her to go out into the hills so that during this day at least she will be able to share in our pleasure  scarcely waiting for another word to be spoken i flew back to the house anxious enough for a ride now the little straw saddle seemed now as comfortable as a couch nor was the bridle missed for nerved with that intense desire to find and speak to my love i could have ridden securely on the slippery back of a giraffe charging over rough ground with a pack of lions at its heels away i went at a speed never perhaps attained by any winner of the derby which made the shining hairs of my horses mane whistle in the still air down valleys up hills flying like a bird over roaring burns rocks and thorny bushes never pausing until i was far away among those hills where that strange accident had befallen me and from which i had recovered to find the earth so changed i then ascended a great green hill the top of which must have been over a thousand feet above the surrounding country when i had at length reached this elevation which i did walking and climbing my steed docilely scrambling up after me the richness and novelty of the unimaginable and indescribable scene which opened before me affected me in a strange way smiting my heart with a pain intense and unfamiliar for the first time i experienced within myself that miraculous power the mind possesses of reproducing instantaneously and without perspective the events feelings and thoughts of long yearsan experience which sometimes comes to a person suddenly confronted with death and in other moments of supreme agitation a thousand memories and a thousand thoughts were stirring in me i was conscious now as i had not been before of the past and the present and these two existed in my mind yet separated by a great gulf of timea blank and a nothingness which yet oppressed me with its horrible vastness how aimless and solitary how awful my position seemed it was like that of one beneath whose feet the world suddenly crumbles into ashes and dust and is scattered throughout the illimitable void while he survives blown to some far planet whose strange aspect however beautiful fills him with an undefinable terror and i knew and the knowledge only intensified my pain that my agitation the strugglings of my soul to recover that lost life were like the vain wingbeats of some woodland bird blown away a thousand miles over the sea into which it must at last sink down and perish  such a mental state cannot endure for more than a few moments and passing away it left me weary and despondent with dull joyless eyes i continued gazing for upwards of an hour on the prospect beneath me for i had now given up all hopes of seeing yoletta not yet having encountered a single person since starting for my ride all about me the summit was dotted with small lilies of a delicate blue but at a little distance the sober green of the grass became absorbed as it were in the brighter flowertints and the neighboring summits all appeared of a pure cerulean hue lower down this passed into the purples of the slopes and the reds of the plains while the valleys fringed with scarlet were like rivers of crocuscolored fire distance and the light autumnal haze had a subduing and harmonizing effect on the sea of brilliant color and further away on the immense horizon it all faded into the soft universal blue over this flowery paradise my eyes wandered restlessly for my heart was restless in me and had lost the power of pleasure with a slight bitterness i recalled some of the words the father had spoken to me that morning it was all very well i thought for this venerable graybeard to talk about refreshing the soul with the sight of all this beauty but he seemed to lose sight of the important fact that there was a considerable difference in our respective ages that the raging hunger of the heart which he had doubtless experienced at one time of his life was like bodily hunger not to be appeased with splendid sunsets rainbows and rainbow lilies however beautiful they might seem to the eye  presently on a second and lower summit of the long mountain i had ascended i caught sight of a person on horseback standing motionless as a figure of stone at that distance the horse looked no bigger than a greyhound yet so marvelously transparent was the mountain air that i distinctly recognized yoletta in the rider i started up and sprang joyfully onto my own horse and waving my hand to attract her attention galloped recklessly down the slope but when i reached the opposing summit she was no longer there nor anywhere in sight and it was as if the earth had opened and swallowed her       chapter 15  during yolettas seclusion my education was not allowed to suffer her place as instructress having been taken by edra i was pleased with this arrangement thinking to derive some benefit from it beyond what she might teach me but very soon i was forced to abandon all hope of communicating with the imprisoned girl through her friend and jailer edra was much disturbed at the suggestion for i did venture to suggest it though in a tentative roundabout form not feeling sure of my ground previous mistakes had made me cautious her manner was a sufficient warning and i did not broach the subject a second time one afternoon however i met with a great and unexpected consolation though even this was mixed with some perplexing matters  one day after looking long and earnestly into my face said my gentle teacher to me do you know that you are changed all your gay spirits have left you and you are pale and thin and sad why is this  my face crimsoned at this very direct question for i knew of that change in me and went about in continual fear that others would presently notice it and draw their own conclusions she continued looking at me until for very shame i turned my face aside for if i had confessed that separation from yoletta caused my dejection she would know what that feeling meant and i feared that any such premature declaration would be the ruin of my prospects  i know the reason though i ask you she continued placing a hand on my shoulder you are grieving for yolettai saw it from the first i shall tell her how pale and sad you have grownhow different from what you were but why do you turn your face from me  i was perplexed but her sympathy gave me courage and made me determined to give her my confidence if you know said i that i am grieving for yoletta can you not also guess why i hesitate and hide my face from you  no why is it you love me also though not with so great a love but we do love each other smith and you can confide in me  i looked into her face now straight into her transparent eyes and it was plain to see that she had not yet guessed my meaning  dearest edra i said taking her hand i love you as much as if one mother had given us birth but i love yoletta with a different lovenot as one loves a sister she is more to me than any one else in the world so much is she that life without her would be a burden do you not know what that means and then remembering yolettas words on the hills i added do you not know of more than one kind of love  no she answered still gazing inquiringly into my face but i know that your love for her so greatly exceeds all others that it is like a different feeling i shall tell her since it is sweet to be loved and she will be glad to know it  and after you have told her edra shall you make known her reply to me  no smith it is an offense to suggest or even to think such a thing however much you may love her for she is not allowed to converse with any one directly or through me she told me that she saw you on the hills and that you tried to go to her and it distressed her very much but she will forgive you when i have told her how great your love is that the desire to look on her face made you forget how wrong it was to approach her  how strange and incomprehensible it seemed that edra had so misinterpreted my feeling it seemed also to me that they all from the father of the house downwards were very blind indeed to set down so strong an emotion to mere brotherly affection i had wished yet feared to remove the scales from their eyes and now in an unguarded moment i had made the attempt and my gentle confessor had failed to understand me nevertheless i extracted some comfort from this conversation for yoletta would know how greatly my love exceeded that of her own kindred and i hoped against hope that a responsive emotion would at last awaken in her breast  when the last of those leadenfooted thirty days arrivedthe day on which according to my computation yoletta would recover liberty before the sun seti rose early from the straw pallet where i had tossed all night prevented from sleeping by the prospect of reunion and the fever of impatience i was in the cold river revived me and when we were assembled in the breakfastroom i observed edra watching me with a curious questioning smile on her lips i asked her the reason  you are like a person suddenly recovered from sickness she replied your eyes sparkle like sunshine on the water and your cheeks that were so pallid yesterday burn redder than an autumn leaf then smiling she added these precious words yoletta will be glad to return to us more on your account than her own  after we had broken our fast i determined to go to the forest and spend the day there for many days past i had shirked woodcutting but now it seemed impossible for me to settle down to any quiet sedentary kind of work the consuming impatience and boundless energy i felt making me wish for some unusually violent task such as would exhaust the body and give perhaps a rest to the mind taking my ax and the usual small basket of provisions for my noonday meal i left the house and on this morning i did not walk but ran as if for a wager taking long flying leaps over bushes and streams that had never tempted me before arrived at the scene of action i selected a large tree which had been marked out for felling and for hours i hacked at it with an energy almost superhuman and at last before i had felt any disposition to rest the towering old giant bowing its head and rustling its sere foliage as if in eternal farewell to the skies came with a mighty crash to the earth scarcely was it fallen before i felt that i had labored too long and violently the dry fresh breeze stung my burning cheeks like needles of ice my knees trembled under me and the whole world seemed to spin round then casting myself upon a bed of chips and withered leaves i lay gasping for breath with only life enough left in me to wonder whether i had fainted or not recovered at length from this exhausted condition i sat up and rejoiced to observe that half the daythat last miserable dayhad already flown then the thoughts of the approaching evening and all the happiness it would bring inspired me with fresh zeal and strength and starting to my feet and taking no thought of my food i picked up the ax and made a fresh onslaught on the fallen tree i had already accomplished more than a days work but the fever in my blood and brain urged me on to the arduous task of lopping off the huge branches and my exertions did not cease until once more the world with everything on it began revolving like a whirligig compelling me to desist and take a still longer rest and sitting there i thought only of yoletta how would she look after that long seclusion pale and sad too perhaps and her sweet soulful eyesoh would i now see in them that new light for which i had watched and waited so long  then while i thus mused i heard not far off a slight rustling sound as of a hare startled at seeing me and bounding away over the withered leaves and lifting up my eyes from the ground i beheld yoletta herself hastening towards me her face shining with joy i sprang forward to meet her and in another moment she was locked in my arms that one moment of unspeakable happiness seemed to outweigh a hundred times all the misery i had endured oh my sweet darlingat last at last my pain is ended i murmured while pressing her again and again to my heart and kissing that dear face which looked now so much thinner than when i had last seen it  she bent back her head like genevieve in the ballad to look me in the face her eyes filled with tearscrystal happy drops which dimmed not their brightness but her face was pale with a pensive pallor like that of the gloire de dijon rose only now excitement had suffused her cheeks with the tints of that same rosethat red so unlike the bloom on other faces in vanished days so tender and delicate and precious above all tints in nature  i know she spoke how you were grieving for me that you were pale and dejected oh how strange you should love me so much  strange darlingthat word again it is the one sweetness and joy of life and are you not glad to be loved  oh i cannot tell you how glad but am i not here in your arms to show it when i heard that you had gone to the wood i did not wait but ran here as fast as i could do you remember that evening on the hill when you vexed me with questions and i could not understand your words now when i love you so much more i can understand them better tell me have i not done as you wished and given myself to you body and soul how thirty days have changed you oh smith do you love me so much  i love you so much dear that if you were to die there would be no more pleasure in life for me and i should prefer to lie near you underground all day long i am thinking of you and when i sleep you are in all ray dreams  she still continued gazing into my face those happy tears still shining in her eyes listening to my words but alas on that sweet beautiful face so full of changeful expression there was not the expression i sought and no sign of that maidenly shame which gave to genevieve in the ballad such an exquisite grace in her lovers eyes  i also had dreams of you she answered they came to me after edra had told me how pale and sad you had grown  tell me one of your dreams darling  i dreamed that i was lying awake on my bed with the moon shining on me i was cold and crying bitterly because i had been left so long alone all at once i saw you standing at my side in the moonlight poor yoletta you said your tears have chilled you like winter rain then you kissed them dry and when you had put your arms about me i drew your face against my bosom and rested warm and happy in your love  oh how her delicious words maddened me even my tongue and lips suddenly became dry as ashes with the fever in me and could only whisper huskily when i strove to answer i released her from my arms and sat down on the fallen tree all my blissful raptures turned to a great despondence would it always be thuswould she continue to embrace me and speak words that simulated passion while no such feeling touched her heart such a state of things could not endure and my passion mocked and baffled again and again would rend me to pieces and hurl me on to madness and selfdestruction for how many men had been driven by love to such an end and the women they had worshiped and miserably died for compared with yoletta were like creatures of clay compared with one of the immortals and was she not a being of a higher order than myself it was folly to think otherwise but how had mortals always fared when they aspired to mate with celestials i tried then to remember something bearing on this important point but my mind was becoming strangely confused i closed my eyes to think and presently opening them again saw yoletta kneeling before me gazing up into my face with an alarmed expression  what is the matter smith you seem ill she said and then laying her fresh palm on my forehead added your head burns like fire  no wonder i returned im worrying my brains trying to remember all about them what were their names and what did they do to those who loved themcant you tell me  oh you are illyou have a fever and may die she exclaimed throwing her arms about my neck and pressing her cheek to mine  i felt a strange imbecility of mind yet it seemed to anger me to be told that i was ill i am not ill i protested feebly i never felt better in my life but cant you answer mewho were they and what did they do tell me or i shall go mad  she started up and taking the small metal whistle hanging at her side blew a shrill note that seemed to pierce my brain like a steel weapon i tried to get up from my seat on the trunk but only slipped down to the ground a dull mist and gloom seemed to be settling down on everything daylight and hope with it was fast forsaking the world but something was coming to usout of that universal mist and darkness closing around us it came bounding swiftly through the wooda huge gray wolf no not a wolfa wolf was nothing to it a mighty roaring lion crashing through the forest a monster ever increasing in size vast and of horrible aspect surpassing all monsters of the imaginationall beasts gigantic and deformed that had ever existed in past geologic ages a lion with teeth like elephants tusks its head clothed as with a black thundercloud through which its eyes glared like twin bloodred suns and shemy lovewith a cry on her lips was springing forth to meet itlost lost for ever i struggled frantically to rise and fly to her assistance and rose after many efforts to my knees only to fall again to the earth insensible       chapter 16  the violent fever into which i had fallen did not abate until the third day when i fell into a profound slumber from which i woke refreshed and saved i did not on awakening find myself in my own familiar cell but in a spacious apartment new to me on a comfortable bed beside which edra was seated almost my first feeling was one of disappointment at not seeing yoletta there and presently i began to fear that in the ravings of delirium i had spoken things which had plucked the scales from the eyes of my kind friends in a very rough way indeed and that the being i loved best had been permanently withdrawn from my sight it was a blessed relief when edra in answer to the questions i put with some heartquakings to her informed me that i had talked a great deal in my fever but unintelligibly continually asking questions about venus diana juno and many other persons whose names had never before been heard in the house how fortunate that my crazy brain had thus continued vexing itself with this idle question she also told me that yoletta had watched day and night at my side that at last when the fever left me and i had fallen into that cooling slumber she too with her hand on mine had dropped her head on the pillow and fallen asleep then without waking her they had carried her away to her own room and edra had taken her place by my side  have you nothing more to ask she said at length with an accent of surprise  no nothing more what you have told me has made me very happywhat more can i wish to know  but there is more to tell you smith we know now that your illness is the result of your own imprudence and as soon as you are well enough to leave your room and bear it you must suffer the punishment  what punished for being ill i exclaimed sitting bolt upright in my bed what do you mean edra i never heard such outrageous nonsense in my life  she was disturbed at this outburst but quietly and gravely repeated that i must certainly be punished for my illness  remembering what their punishments were i had the prospect of a second long separation from yoletta and the thought of such excessive severity or rather of such cruel injustice made me wild by heaven i shall not submit to it i exclaimed punished for being illwho ever heard of such a thing i suppose that byandby it will be discovered that the bridge of my nose is not quite straight or that i cant see round the corner and that also will be set down as a crime to be expiated in solitary confinement on a breadandwater diet no you shall not punish me rather than give in to such tyranny ill walk off and leave the house for ever  she regarded me with an expression almost approaching to horror on her gentle face and for some moments made no reply then i remembered that if i carried out that insane threat i should indeed lose yoletta and the very thought of such a loss was more than i could endure and for a moment i almost hated the love which made me so helpless and miserableso powerless to oppose their stupid and barbarous practices it would have been sweet then to have felt freefree to fling them a curse and go away shaking the dust of their house from my shoes supposing that any dust had adhered to them  then edra began to speak again and gravely and sorrowfully but without a touch of austerity in her tone or manner censured me for making use of such irrational language and for allowing bitter resentful thoughts to enter my heart but the despondence and sullen rage into which i had been thrown made me proof even against the medicine of an admonition imparted so gently and turning my face away i stubbornly refused to make any reply for a while she was silent but i misjudged her when i imagined that she would now leave me offended to my own reflections  do you not know that you are giving me pain she said at last drawing a little closer to me a little while ago you told me that you loved me has that feeling faded so soon or do you take any pleasure in wounding those you love  her words and more than her words her tender pleading tone pierced me with compunction and i could not resist edra my sweet sister do not imagine such a thing i said i would rather endure many punishments than give you pain my love for you cannot fade while i have life and understanding it is in me like greenness in the leafthat beautiful color which can only be changed by sere decay  she smiled forgiveness and with a humid brightness in her eyes which somehow made me think of that joy of the angels over one sinner that repenteth bent down and touched her lips to mine how can you love any one more than that smith she said yet you say that your love for yoletta exceeds all others  yes dear exceeds all others as the light of the sun exceeds that of the moon and the stars can you not understand thathas no man ever loved you with a love like that my sister  she shook her head and sighed did she not understand my meaning nowhad not my words brought back some sweet and sorrowful memory with her hands folded idly on her lap and her face half averted she sat gazing at nothing it seemed impossible that this woman so tender and so beautiful should never have experienced in herself or witnessed in another the feeling i had questioned her about but she made no further reply to my words and as i lay there watching her the drowsy spirit the fever had left in me overcame my brain and i slept once more  for several days which brought me so little strength that i was not permitted to leave the sickroom i heard nothing further about my punishment for i purposely refrained from asking any questions and no person appeared inclined to bring forward so disagreeable a subject at length i was pronounced well enough to go about the house although still very feeble and i was conducted not to the judgmentroom where i had expected to be taken but to the mothers room and there i found the father of the house seated with chastel and with them seven or eight of the others they all welcomed me and seemed glad to see me out again but i could not help remarking a certain subdued almost solemn air about them which seemed to remind me that i was regarded as an offender already found guilty who had now been brought up to receive judgment  my son said the father addressing me in a calm judicial tone which at once put my last remaining hopes to flight it is a consolation to us to know that your offense is of such a nature that it cannot diminish our esteem for you or loosen the bonds of affection which unite you to us you are still feeble and perhaps a little confused in mind concerning the events of the last few days i do not therefore press you to give an account of them but shall simply state your offense and if i am mistaken in any particular you shall correct me the great love you have for yoletta he continuedand at this i started and blushed painfully but the succeeding words served to show that i had only too little cause for alarmthe great love you have for yoletta caused you much suffering during her thirty days seclusion from us so that you lost all enjoyment of life and eating little and being in continual dejection your strength was much diminished on the last day you were so much excited at the prospect of reunion with her that you went to your task in the woods almost fasting and probably after spending a restless night tell me if this is not so  i did not sleep that night i replied somewhat huskily  unrefreshed by sleep and with lessened strength he continued you went to the woods and in order to allay that excitement in your mind you labored with such energy that by noon you had accomplished a task which in another and calmer condition of mind and body would have occupied you more than one day in thus acting you had already been guilty of a serious offense against yourself but even then you might have escaped the consequences if after finishing your work you had rested and refreshed yourself with food and drink this however you neglected to do for when you had fallen insensible to the earth and yoletta had called the dog and sent it to the house to summon assistance the food you had taken with you was found untasted in the basket your life was thus placed in great peril and although it is good to lay life down when it has become a burden to ourselves and others being darkened by that failure of power from which there is no recovery wantonly or carelessly to endanger it in the flower of its strength and beauty is a great folly and a great offense consider how deep our grief would have been especially the grief of yoletta if this culpable disregard of your own safety and wellbeing had ended fatally as it came so near ending it is therefore just and righteous that an offense of such a nature should be recompensed but it is a light offense not like one committed against the house or even against another person and we also remember the occasion of it since it was no unworthy motive but exceeding love which clouded your judgment and therefore taking all these things into account it was my intention to put you away from us for the space of thirteen days  here he paused as if expecting me to make some reply he had reproved me so gently even approving of the emotion although still entirely in the dark as to its meaning which had caused my illness that i was made to feel very submissive and even grateful to him  it is only just i replied that i should suffer for my fault and you have tempered justice with more mercy than i deserve  you speak with the wisdom of a chastened spirit my son he said rising and placing his hand on my head and your words gladden me all the more for knowing that you were filled with surprise and resentment when told that your offense was one deserving punishment and now my son i have to tell you that you will not be separated from us for the mother of the house has willed that your offense shall be pardoned  i looked in surprise at chastel for this was very unexpected she was gazing at my face with the light of a strange tenderness in her eyes never seen there before she extended her hand and kneeling before her i took it in mine and raised it to my lips and tried with poor success to speak my thanks for this rare and beautiful act of mercy then the others surrounded me to express their congratulations the men pressing my hands but not so the women for they all freely kissed me but when yoletta coming last put her white arms about my neck and pressed her lips to mine the ecstasy i felt was so greatly overbalanced by the pain of my position and the thought now almost a conviction that i was powerless to enlighten them with regard to the nature of the love i felt for her that i almost shrank from her dear embrace       chapter 17  my attack of illness although sharp had passed off so quickly that i confidently looked to complete restoration to my former vigorous state of health in a very short time nevertheless many days went by and i failed to recover strength but remained pretty much in that condition of body in which i had quitted the sickroom this surprised and distressed me at first but in a little time i began to get reconciled to such a state and even to discover that it had certain advantages the chief of which was that the tumult of my mind was over for a season so that i craved for nothing very eagerly my friends advised me to do no work but not wishing to eat the bread of idlenessalthough the bread was little now as i had little appetitei made it a rule to go every morning to the workhouse and occupy myself for two or three hours with some light mechanical task which put no strain on me physical or mental even this playing at work fatigued me then after changing my dress i would repair to the musicroom to resume my search after hidden knowledge in any books that happened to be there for i could read now a result which my sweet schoolmistress had been the first to see and at once she had abandoned the lessons i had loved so much leaving me to wander at will but without a guide in that wilderness of a strange literature i had never been to the library and did not even know in what part of the house it was situated nor had i ever expressed a wish to see it and that for two reasons one was that i had already halfresolvedmy resolutions were usually of that complexionnever to run the risk of appearing desirous of knowing too much the other and weightier reason was that i had never loved libraries they oppress me with a painful sense of my mental inferiority for all those tens of thousands of volumes containing so much important but unappreciated matter seem to have a kind of collective existence and to look down on me like a man with great staring owlish eyes as an intruder on sacred grounda barbarian whose proper place is in the woods it is a mere fancy i know but it distresses me and i prefer not to put myself in the way of it once in a book i met with a scornful passage about people with bodily constitutions like those of horses and small brains which made me blush painfully but in the very next passage the writer makes amends saying that a man ought to think himself well off if in the lottery of life he draws the prize of a healthy stomach without a mind that it is better than a fine intellect with a crazy stomach i had drawn the healthy stomachliver lungs and heart to matchand had never felt dissatisfied with my prize now however it seemed expedient that i should give some hours each day to reading for so far my conversations and close intimacy with the people of the house had not dissipated the cloud of mystery in which their customs were hid and by customs i here refer to those relating to courtship and matrimony only for that was to me the main thing the books i read or dipped into were all highly interesting especially the odd volumes i looked at belonging to that long series on the houses of the world for these abounded in marvelous and entertaining matter there were also histories of the house and works on arts agriculture and various other subjects but they were not what i wanted after three or four hours spent in these fruitless researches i would proceed to the mothers room where i was now permitted to enter freely every afternoon and when there to remain as long as i wished it was so pleasant that i soon dropped into the custom of remaining until suppertime compelled me to leave it chastel invariably treating me now with a loving tenderness of manner which seemed strange when i recalled the extremely unfavorable impression i had made at our first interview  it was never my nature to be indolent or to love a quiet dreamy existence on the contrary my fault had lain in the opposite direction unlimited muscular exercise being as necessary to my wellbeing as fresh air and good food and the rougher the exercise the better i liked it but now in this novel condition of languor i experienced a wonderful restfulness both of body and mind and in the mothers room resting as if some weariness of labor still clung to me breathing and steeped in that fragrant summerlike atmosphere i had long intervals of perfect inactivity and silence while i sat or reclined not thinking but in a reverie while many dreams of pleasures to come drifted in a vague vaporous manner through my brain the very character of the roomits delicate richness the exquisitely harmonious disposition of colors and objects and the illusions of nature produced on the mindseemed to lend itself to this unaccustomed mood and to confirm me in it  the first impression produced was one of brightness coming to it by way of the long dim sculpture gallery was like passing out into the open air and this effect was partly due to the white and crystal surfaces and the brilliancy of the colors where any color appeared it was spacious and lofty and the central arched or domed portion of the roof which was of a light turquoise blue rested on graceful columns of polished crystal the doors were of ambercolored glass set in agate frames but the windows eight in number formed the principal attraction on the glass hill and mountain scenery was depicted the summits in some of them appearing beyond wide barren plains whitened with the noonday splendor and heat of midsummer untempered by a cloud the soaring peaks showing a pearly luster which seemed to remove them to an infinite distance to look out as it were from the imitation shade of such an arbor or pavilion over those faroff sunlit expanses where the light appeared to dance and quiver as one gazed was a neverfailing delight such was its effect on me combined with that of the mothers new tender graciousness resulting i knew not whether from compassion or affection that i could have wished to remain a permanent invalid in her room  another cause of the mild kind of happiness i now experienced was the consciousness of a change in my own mental disposition which made me less of an alien in the house for i was now able i imagined to appreciate the beautiful character of my friends their crystal purity of heart and the religion they professed far back in the old days i had heard first and last a great deal about sweetness and light and philistines and not quite knowing what this grand question was all about and hearing from some of my friends that i was without the qualities they valued most i thereafter proclaimed myself a philistine and was satisfied to have the controversy ended in that way so far as it concerned me personally now however i was like one to whom some important thing has been told who scarcely hearing and straightway forgetting goes about his affairs but lying awake at night in the silence of his chamber recalls the unheeded words and perceives their full significance my sojourn with this peopleangelic women and mildeyed men with downy unrazored lips so mild in manner yet in their arts laying broad bases for eternityabove all the invalid hours spent daily in the mothers room had taught me how unlovely a creature i had been it would have been strange indeed if in such an atmosphere i had not absorbed a little sweetness and light into my system  in this sweet refugethis slumberous valley where i had been cast up by that swift black current that had borne me to an immeasurable distance on its bosom and with such a change going on within mei sometimes thought that a little more and i would touch that serene enduring bliss which seemed to be the normal condition of my fellowinmates my passion for yoletta now burned with a gentle flame which did not consume but only imparted an agreeable sense of warmth to the system when she was there sitting with me at her mothers feet sometimes so near that her dark shining hair brushed against my cheek and her fragrant breath came on my face and when she caressed my hand and gazed full at me with those dear eyes that had no shadow of regret or anxiety in them but only unfathomable love i could imagine that our union was already complete that she was altogether and eternally mine  i knew that this could not continue sometimes i could not prevent my thoughts from flying away from the present then suddenly the complexion of my dream would change darkening like a fair landscape when a cloud obscures the sun not forever would the demon of passion slumber and dream in my breast with recovered strength it would wake again and ever increasing in power and ever baffled of its desire would raise once more that black tempest of that past to overwhelm me other darker visions followed i would see myself as in a magic glass lying with upturned ghastly face with many people about me hurrying to and fro wringing their hands and weeping aloud with grief shuddering at the abhorred sight of blood on their sacred shining floors or worse still i saw myself shivering in sordid rags and gaunt with longlasting famine a fugitive in some wintry desolate land far from all human companionship the very image of yoletta scorched by madness to formless ashes in my brain and for all sensations feelings memories thoughts nothing left to me but a distorted likeness of the visible world and a terrible unrest urging me as with a whip of scorpions ever on and on to ford yet other black icy torrents and tear myself bleeding through yet other thorny thickets and climb the ramparts of yet other gigantic barren hills  but these moments of terrible depression new to my life were infrequent and seldom lasted long chastel was my good angel a word a touch from her hand and the ugly spirits would vanish she appeared to possess a mysterious facultyperhaps only the keen insight and sympathy of a highly spiritualized naturewhich informed her of much that was passing in my heart if a shadow came there when she had no wish or strength to converse she would make me draw close to her seat and rest her hand on mine and the shadow would pass from me  i could not help reflecting often and wonderingly at this great change in her manner towards me her eyes dwelt lovingly on me and her keenest suffering and the unfortunate blundering expressions i frequently let fall seemed equally powerless to wring one harsh or impatient word from her i was not now only one among her children privileged to come and sit at her feet to have with them a share in her impartial affection and remembering that i was a stranger in the house and compared but poorly with the others the undisguised preference she showed for me and the wish to have me almost constantly with her seemed a great mystery  one afternoon as i sat alone with her she made the remark that my reading lessons had ceased  oh yes i can read perfectly well now i answered may i read to you from this book saying which i put my hand towards a volume lying on the couch at her side it differed from the other books i had seen in its smaller size and blue binding  no not in this book she said with a shade of annoyance in her voice putting out her hand to prevent my taking it  have i made another mistake i asked withdrawing my hand i am very ignorant  yes poor boy you are very ignorant she returned placing her hand on my forehead you must know that this is a mothers book and only a mother may read in it  i am afraid i said with a sigh that it will be a long time before i cease to offend you with such mistakes  there is no occasion to say that for you have not offended me only you make me feel sorry every day when you are with me i try to teach you something to smooth the path for you but you must remember my son that others cannot feel towards you as i do and it may come to pass that they will sometimes be offended with you because their love is less than mine  but why do you care so much for me i asked emboldened by her words once i thought that you only of all in the house would never love me what has changed your feelings towards me for i know that they have changed she looked at me smiling a little sadly but did not reply i think i should be happier for knowing i resumed caressing her hand will you not tell me  there was a strange trouble on her face as her eyes glanced away and then returned to mine again while her lips quivered as if with unspoken words then she answered no i cannot tell you now it would make you happy perhaps but the proper time has not yet arrived you must be patient and learn for you have much to learn it is my desire that you should know all those things concerning the family of which you are ignorant and when i say all i mean not only those suitable to one in your present condition as a son of the house but also those higher matters which belong to the heads of the houseto the father and mother  then casting away all caution i answered it is precisely a knowledge of those greater matters concerning the family which i have been hungering after ever since i came into the house  i know it she returned this hunger you speak of was partly the cause of your fever and it is in you keeping you feverish and feeble still but for this instead of being a prisoner here you would now be abroad feeling the sun and wind on your face  and if you know that i pleaded why do you not now impart the knowledge that can make me whole for surely all those lesser mattersthose things suitable for one in my condition to knowcan be learned afterwards in due time for they are not of pressing importance but the other is to me a matter of life and death if you only knew it  i know everything she returned quickly but a cloud had come over her face at my concluding words and a startled look into her eyes life and death do you know what you are saying she exclaimed fixing her eyes on me with such intense earnestness in them that mine fell abashed before their gaze then after a while she drew my head down against her knees and spoke with a strange tenderness do you then find it so hard to exercise a little patience my son that you do not acquiesce in what i say to you and fear to trust your future in my hands my time is short for all that i have to do yet i also must be patient and wait although for me it is hardest for now your coming which i did not regard at first seeing in you only a pilgrim like othersone who through accidents of travel had been cast away and left homeless in the world until we found and gave you shelternow it has brought something new into my life and if this fresh hope which is only an old perished hope born again ever finds fulfillment then death will lose much of its bitterness but there are difficulties in the way which only time and the energy of a soul that centers all its faculties in one desire one enterprise can overcome and the chief difficulty i find is in yourselfin that strange untoward disposition so often revealed in your conversation which you have shown even now for to be thus questioned and pressed and to have my judgment doubted would have greatly offended me in another remember this and do not abuse the privilege you enjoy remember that you must greatly change before i can share with you the secrets of my heart that concern you and bear in mind my son that i am not rebuking you for a want of knowledge for i know that for many deficiencies you are not blameworthy i know for instance that nature has denied to you that melodious and flexible voice in which it is our custom every day to render homage to the father to express all the sacred feelings of our hearts all our love for each other the joy we have in life and even our griefs and sorrows for grief is like a dark oppressive cloud until from lip and hand it breaks in the rain of melody and we are lightened so that even the things that are painful give to life a new and chastened glory and as with music so with all other arts there is a twofold pleasure in contemplating our fathers works in the first and lower kind you share with us but the second and more noble springing from the first is ours through that faculty by means of which the beauty and harmony of the visible world become transmuted in the soul which is like a pencil of glass receiving the white sunbeam into itself and changing it to red green and violetcolored light thus nature transmutes itself in our minds and is expressed in art but in you this second faculty is wanting else you would not willingly forego so great a pleasure as its exercise affords and love nature like one that loves his fellowman but has no words to express so sweet a feeling for the happiness of love with sympathy when made known and returned is increased an hundredfold and in all artistic work we commune not with blind irrational nature but with the unseen spirit which is in nature inspiring our hearts returning love for love and rewarding our labor with enduring bliss therefore it is your misfortune not your fault that you are deprived of this supreme solace and happiness  to this speech which had a depressing effect on me i answered sadly every day i feel my deficiencies more keenly and wish more ardently to lessen the great distance between us but nowsweet mother forgive me for saying ityour words almost make me despond  and yet my son i have spoken only to encourage you i know your limitations and expect nothing beyond your powers nor do your errors greatly trouble me believing as i do that in time you will be able to dismiss them from your mind but the temper of your mind must be changed to be worthy of the happiness i have designed for you patience must chasten that reckless spirit in you for feverish diligence alternating with indifference or despondence there must be unremitting effort and for that unsteady flame of hope which burns so brightly in the morning and in the evening sings so low there must be a bright unwavering and rational hope it would be strange indeed if after this you were cast down and lest you forget anything i will say again that only by giving you enduring happiness and the desire of your heart can my one hope be fulfilled consider how much i say to you in these words it saddens me to think that so much was necessary and do not think hardly of me my son for wishing to keep you a little longer in this prison with me for in a little while your weakness will pass away like a morning cloud but for me there shall come no change since i must remain day and night here with the shadow of death and when i am taken forth and the sunshine falls once more on my face i shall not feel it and shall not see it and i shall lie forgotten when you are in the midst of your happy years  her words smote on my heart with a keen pain of compassion do not say that you will be forgotten i exclaimed passionately for should you be taken away i shall still love and worship your memory as i worship you now when you are alive  she caressed my hand but did not speak and when i looked up her worn face had dropped on the pillow and her eyes were closed i am tiredtired she murmured stay with me a little longer but leave me if i sleep  and in a little while she slept the light was on her face resting on the purple pillow and with the soulful eyes closed and the lips that had no red color of life in them also closed and motionless it was like a face carved in ivory of one who had suffered like isarte in the house and perished long generations ago and the abundant dark lusterless hair that framed it looked dead too and of the color of wrought iron       chapter 18  chastels words sank deep in my heartdeeper than words had ever sunk before into that somewhat unpromising soil and although she had purposely left me in the dark with regard to many important matters i now resolved to win her esteem and bind her yet more closely to me by correcting those faults in my character she had pointed out with so much tenderness  alas the very next day was destined to bring me a sore trouble on entering the breakfastroom i became aware that a shadow had fallen on the house among his silent people the father sat with gray haggard face and troubled eyes then yoletta entered her sweet face looking paler than when i had first seen it after her long punishment while under her heavy drooping eyelids her skin was stained with that mournful purple which tells of a long vigil and a heart oppressed with anxiety i heard with profound concern that chastels malady had suddenly become aggravated that she had passed the night in the greatest suffering what would become of me and of all those bright dreams of happiness if she were to die was my first idea but at the same time i had the grace to feel ashamed of that selfish thought nevertheless i could not shake off the gloom it had produced in me and too distressed in mind to work or read i repaired to the mothers room to be as near as possible to the sufferer on whose recovery so much now depended how lonely and desolate it seemed there now that she was absent those mountain landscapes glowing with the white radiance of mimic sunshine still made perpetual summer yet there seemed to be a wintry chill and deathlike atmosphere which struck to the heart and made me shiver with cold the day dragged slowly to its close and no rest came to the sufferer nor sign of improvement to relieve our anxiety until past midnight i remained at my post then retired for three or four miserable anxious hours only to return once more when it was scarcely light chastels condition was still unchanged or if there had been any change it was for the worse for she had not slept again i remained a prey to desponding thoughts all day in the room but towards evening yoletta came to take me to her mother the summons so terrified me that for some moments i sat trembling and unable to articulate a word for i could not but think that chastels end was approaching yoletta however divining the cause of my agitation explained that her mother could not sleep for torturing pains in her head and wished me to place my hand on her forehead to try whether that would cause any relief this seemed to me a not very promising remedy but she told me that on former occasions they had often succeeded in procuring her ease by placing a hand on her forehead and that having failed now chastel had desired them to call me to her to try my hand i rose and for the first time entered that sacred chamber where chastel was lying on a low bed placed on a slightly raised platform in the center of the floor in the dim light her face looked white as the pillow on which it rested her forehead contracted with sharp pain while low moans came at short intervals from her twitching lips but her wideopen eyes were fixed on my face from the moment i entered the room and to me they seemed to express mental anguish rather than physical suffering at the head of the bed sat the father holding her hand in his but when i entered he rose and made way for me retiring to the foot of the bed where two of the women were seated i knelt beside the bed and yoletta raised and tenderly placed my right hand on the mothers forehead and after whispering to me to let it rest very gently there she also withdrew a few paces  chastel did not speak but for some minutes continued her low piteous moanings only her eyes remained fixed on my face and at last becoming uneasy at her scrutiny i said in a whisper dearest mother do you wish to say anything to me  yes come nearer she replied and when i had bent my cheek close to her face she continued do not fear my son i shall not die i cannot die until that of which i have spoken to you has been accomplished  i rejoiced at her words yet at the same time they gave me pain for it seemed as though she knew how much my heart had been troubled by that ignoble fear  dear mother may i say something i asked wishing to tell her of my resolutions  not now i know what you wish to say she returned be patient and hopeful always and fear nothing even though we should be long divided for it will be many days before i can leave this room to speak with you again  so softly had she whispered that the others who stood so near were not aware that she had spoken at all  after this brief colloquy she closed her eyes but for some time the low moans of pain continued gradually they sank lower and became less and less frequent while the lines of pain faded out of her white deathlike face and at length yoletta stealing softly to my side whispered she is sleeping and withdrawing my hand led me away  when we were again in the mothers room she threw her arms about my neck and burst into a tempest of tears  dearest yoletta be comforted i said pressing her to my breast she will not die  oh smith how do you know she returned quickly looking up with her eyes still shining with large drops  then of chastels whispered words to me i repeated those four i shall not die but nothing more they were however a great relief to her and her sweet sorrowful face brightened like a drooping flower after rain  ah she knew then that the touch of your hand would cause sleep that sleep would save her she said smiling up at me  and you my darling how long is it since you closed those sweet eyelids that seem so heavy  not since i slept three nights ago  will you sit by me here resting your head on me and sleep a little now  not there she cried quickly not on the mothers couch but if you will sit here it will be pleasant if i can sleep for a little while resting on you  i placed myself on the low seat she led me to and then when she had coiled herself up on the cushions with her arms still round my neck and her head resting on my bosom she breathed a long happy sigh and dropped like a tired child to sleep  how perfect my happiness would have been then with yoletta in my arms clasping her weary little ministering hands in mine and tenderly kissing her dark shining hair but for the fear that some person might come there to notice and disturb me and pretty soon i was startled to see the father himself coming from chastels chamber to us catching sight of me he paused smiling then advanced and deliberately sat down by my side  this one is sleeping also he said cheerfully touching the girls hair with his hand but you need not fear smith i think we shall be able to talk very well without waking her  i had feared something quite different if he had only known it and felt considerably relieved by his words nevertheless i was not overpleased at the prospect of a conversation just then and should have preferred being left alone with my precious burden  my son he continued placing a hand on my shoulder i sometimes recall not without a smile the effect your first appearance produced on us when we were startled at your somewhat grotesque pilgrim costume your attempts at singing and ignorance of art generally also impressed me unfavorably and gave me some concern when i thought about the futurethat is your future for it seemed to me that you had but slender foundations whereon to build a happy life these doubts however no longer trouble me for on several occasions you have shown us that you possess abundantly that richest of all gifts and safest guide to happinessthe capacity for deep affection to this spirit of love in youthis summer of the heart which causes it to blossom with beautiful thoughts and deedsi attribute your success just now when the contact of your hand produced the longdesired refreshing slumber so necessary to the mother at this stage of her malady i know that this is a mysterious thing and it is commonly said that in such cases relief is caused by an emanation from the brain through the fingers doubtless this is so and i also choose to believe that only a powerful spirit of love in the heart can rightly direct this subtle energy that where such a spirit is absent the desired effect cannot be produced  i do not know i replied great as my love and devotion is i cannot suppose it to equal much less to surpass that of others who yet failed on this occasion to give relief  yes yes only that is looking merely at the surface of the matter and leaving out of sight the unfathomable mysteries of a being compounded of flesh and spirit there are among our best instruments peculiar to this house especially those used chiefly in our harvest music some of such finelytempered materials and of so delicate a construction that the person wishing to perform on them must not only be inspired with the melodious passion but the entire systembody and soulmust be in the proper mood the flesh itself elevated into harmony with the exalted spirit else he will fail to elicit the tones or to give the expression desired this is a rough and a poor simile when we consider how wonderful an instrument a human being is with the body that burns with thought and the spirit that quivers and cries with pain and when we think how its innumerable complex chords may be injured and untuned by suffering the will may be ours but something we know not what interposes to defeat our best efforts that you have succeeded in producing so blessed a result after we had failed has served to deepen and widen in our hearts the love we already felt for you for how much more precious is this melody of repose this sweet interval of relief from cruel pain the mother now experiences than many melodies from clear voices and trained hands  in my secret heart i believed that he was taking much too lofty a view of the matter but i had no desire to argue against so flattering a delusion if it were one and only wished that i could share it with him  she is sleeping still he said presently perhaps without pain like yoletta here and her sleep will now probably last for some hours  i pray heaven that she may wake refreshed and free from pain i remarked  he seemed surprised at my words and looked searchingly into my face my son he said it grieves me at a moment like the present to have to point out a great error to you but it is an error hurtful to yourself and painful to those who see it and if i were to pass it over in silence or put off speaking of it to another time i should not be fulfilling the part of a loving father towards you  surprised at this speech i begged him to tell me what i had said that was wrong  do you not then know that it is unlawful to entertain such a thought as you have expressed he said in moments of supreme pain or bitterness or peril we sometimes so far forget ourselves as to cry out to heaven to save us or to give us ease but to make any such petition when we are in the full possession of our faculties is unworthy of a reasonable being and an offense to the father for we pray to each other and are moved by such prayers remembering that we are fallible and often err through haste and forgetfulness and imperfect knowledge but he who freely gave us life and reason and all good gifts needs not that we should remind him of anything therefore to ask him to give us the thing we desire is to make him like ourselves and charge him with an oversight or worse we attribute weakness and irresolution to him since the petitioner thinks my importunity to incline the balance in his favor  i was about to reply that i had always considered prayer to be an essential part of religion and not of my form of religion only but of all religions all over the world luckily i remembered in time that he probably knew more about matters all over the world than i did and so held my tongue  have you any doubts on the subject he asked after a while  i must confess that i still have some doubts i replied i believe that our creator and father desires the happiness of all his creatures and takes no pleasure in seeing us miserable for it would be impossible not to believe it seeing how greatly happiness overbalances misery in the world but he does not come to us in visible form to tell us in an audible voice that to cry out to him in sore pain and distress is unlawful how then do we know this thing for a child cries to its mother and a fledgling in the nest to its parent bird and he is infinitely more to us than parent to childinfinitely stronger to help and knows our griefs as no fellowmortal can know them may we not then believe without hurt to our souls that the cry of one of his children in affliction may reach him that in his compassion and by means of his sovereign power over nature he may give ease to the racked body and peace and joy to the desolate mind  you ask me how then do we know this thing and you answer the question yourself yet fail to perceive that you answer it when you say that although he does not come in a visible form to teach us this thing and that thing yet we know that he desires our happiness and to this you might have added a thousand or ten thousand other things which we know if the reason he gave us to start with makes it unnecessary that he should come to tell us in an audible voice that he desires our happiness it must also surely suffice to tell us which are lawful and which unlawful of all the thoughts continually rising in our hearts that any one should question so evident and universally accepted a truth the foundation of all religion seems very surprising to me if it had consisted with his plan to make these delicate mortal bodies capable of every agreeable sensation in the highest degree yet not liable to accident and not subject to misery and pain he would surely have done this for all of us but reason and nature show us that such an end did not consist with his plan therefore to ask him to suspend the operations of nature for the benefit of any individual sufferer however poignant and unmerited the sufferings may be is to shut our eyes to the only light he has given us all our highest and sweetest feelings unite with reason to tell us with one voice that he loves us and our knowledge of nature shows us plainly enough that he also loves all the creatures inferior to man to us he has given reason for a guide and for the guidance and protection of the lower kinds he has given instinct and though they do not know him it would make us doubt his impartial love for all his creatures if we by making use of our reason higher knowledge and articulate speech were able to call down benefits on ourselves and avert pain and disaster while the dumb irrational brutes suffered in silencethe languishing deer that leaves the herd with a festering thorn in its foot the passage bird blown from its course to perish miserably far out at sea  his conclusions were perhaps more logical than mine nevertheless although i could not argue the matter any more with him i was not yet prepared to abandon this last cherished shred of old beliefs although perhaps not cherished for its intrinsic worth but rather because it had been given to me by a sweet woman whose memory was sacred to my heartmy mother before chastel  fortunately it was not necessary to continue the discussion any longer for at this juncture one of the watchers from the sickroom came to report that the mother was still sleeping peacefully hearing which the father rose to seek a little needful rest in an adjoining room before going however he proposed with mistaken kindness to relieve me of my burden and place the girl without waking her on a couch but i would not consent to have her disturbed and finally to my great delight they left her still in my arms the father warmly pressing my hand and advising me to reflect well on his words concerning prayer  it was growing dark now and how welcome that obscurity seemed while with no one nigh to see or hear i kissed her soft tresses a hundred times and murmured a hundred endearing words in her sleeping ears  her waking which gave me a pang at first afforded me in the end a still greater bliss  oh how dark it iswhere am i she exclaimed starting suddenly from repose  with me sweetest i said do you not remember going to sleep on my breast  yes but oh why did you not wake me sooner my mothermy mother  she is still quietly sleeping dearest ah i wish you also had continued sleeping it was such a delight to have you in my arms  my love she said laying her soft cheek against mine how sweet it was to fall asleep in your arms when we came in here i could scarcely say a word for my heart was too full for speech and now i have a hundred things to say after all i should only finish by giving you a kiss which is more eloquent than speech so i shall kiss you at once and save myself the trouble of talking so much  say one of the hundred things yoletta  oh smith before this evening i did not think that i could love you more and sometimes when i recalled what i once said to youon the hill do you rememberit seemed to me that i already loved you a little too much but now i am convinced that i was mistaken for a thousand offenses could not alienate my heart which is all yours forever  mine for ever without a doubt darling i murmured holding her against my breast and in my rapture almost forgetting that this angelic affection she lavished on me would not long satisfy my heart  yes for ever for you shall never never leave the house your pilgrimage from which you derived so little benefit is over now and if you ever attempt to go forth again to find out new wonders in the world i shall clasp you round with my arms as i do now and keep you prisoner against your will and if you say farewell a hundred times to me i shall blot out that sad word every time with my lips and put a better one in its place until my word conquers yours       chapter 19  although deprived for the present of all intercourse with chastel and yoletta now in constant attendance on her mother i ought to have been happy for all things seemed conspiring to make my life precious to me nevertheless i was far from happy and having heard so much said about reason in my late conversations with the father and mother of the house i began to pay an unusual amount of attention to this faculty in me in order to discover by its aid the secret of the sadness which continued at all times during this period to oppress my heart i only discovered what others have discovered before me that the practice of introspection has a corrosive effect on the mind which only serves to aggravate the malady it is intended to cure during those restful days in the mothers room when i had sat with chastel this spirit of melancholy had been with me but the mothers hallowing presence had given something of a divine color to it my passions had slumbered and except at rare intervals i had thought of sorrow as of something at an immeasurable distance from me then to my spirit    the gushing of the wave    far far away did seem to mourn and rave    on alien shores  and so sweet had seemed that pause that i had hoped and prayed for its continuance no sooner was i separated from her than the charm dissolved and all my thoughts like evening clouds that appear luminous and rich in color until the sun has set began to be darkened with a mysterious gloom strive how i might i was unable to compose my mind to that serene trustful temper she had desired to see in me and without which there could be no blissful futurity after all the admonitions and the comforting assurances i had received and in spite of reason and all it could say to me each night i went to my bed with a heavy heart and each morning when i woke there by my pillow waited that sad phantom to go with me where i went to remind me at every pause of an implacable fate who held my future in its hands who was mightier than chastel and would shatter all her schemes for my happiness like vessels of brittle glass  several daysprobably about fifteen for i did not count themhad passed since i had been admitted into the mothers sleepingroom when there came an exceedingly lovely day which seemed to bring to me a pleasant sensation of returning health and made me long to escape from morbid dreams and vain cravings why should i sit at home and mope i thought it was better to be active sun and wind were full of healing such a day was in truth one of those captain jewels that seldom placed are among the blusterous days of late autumn with winter already present to speed its parting for a long time the sky had been overcast with multitudes and endless hurrying processions of wildlooking cloudstorn windchased fugitives of every mournful shade of color from palest gray to slateyblack and storms of rain had been frequent impetuous and suddenly intermitted or passing away phantomlike towards the misty hills there to lose themselves among other phantoms ever wandering sorrowfully in that vast shadowy borderland where earth and heaven mingled and gusts of wind which as they roared by over a thousand straining trees and passed off with hoarse volleying sounds seemed to mimic the echoing thunder and the leavesthe millions and myriads of sere castoff leaves heaped ankledeep under the desolate giants of the wood and everywhere in the hollows of the earth lying silent and motionless as became dead fallen thingssuddenly catching a mock fantastic life from the wind how they would all be up and stirring every leaf with a hiss like a viper racing many thousands at a time over the barren spaces all hurriedly talking together in their deadleaf language until smitten with a mightier gust they would rise in flight on flight in storms and stupendous eddying columns whirled up to the clouds to fall to the earth again in showers and freckle the grass for roods around then for a moment far off in heavens there would be a rift or a thinning of the clouds and the sunbeams striking like lightning through their ranks would illumine the pale blue mist the slanting rain the gaunt black boles and branches glittering with wet casting a momentary glory over the oceanlike tumult of nature  in the condition i was in with a relaxed body and dejected mind this tempestuous period which would have only afforded fresh delight to a person in perfect health had no charm for my spirit but on the contrary it only served to intensify my gloom and yet day after day it drew me forth although in my weakness i shivered in the rough gale and shrank from the touch of the big cold drops the clouds flung down on me it fascinated me like the sight of armies contending in battle or of some tragic action from which the spectator cannot withdraw his gaze for i had become infected with strange fancies so persistent and somber that they were like superstitions it seemed to me that not i but nature had changed that the familiar light had passed like a kindly expression from her countenance which was now charged with an awful menacing gloom that frightened my soul sometimes when straying alone like an unquiet ghost among the leafless trees when a deeper shadow swept over the earth i would pause pale with apprehension listening to the many dirgelike sounds of the forest ever prophesying evil until in my trepidation i would start and tremble and look to this side and to that as if considering which way to fly from some unimaginable calamity coming i knew not from where to wreck my life for ever  this bright day was better suited to my complaint the sun shone as in spring not a stain appeared on the crystal vault of heaven everywhere the unfailing grass gave rest to the eye with its verdure and a light wind blew fresh and bracing in my face making my pulses beat faster although feebly still remembering my happy woodcutting days before my trouble had come to me i got my ax and started to walk to the wood then seeing yoletta watching my departure from the terrace i waved my hand to her before i had gone far however she came running to me full of anxiety to warn me that i was not yet strong enough for such work i assured her that i had no intention of working hard and tiring myself then continued my walk while she returned to attend on her mother  the day was so bright with sunshine that it inspired me with a kind of passing gladness and i began to hum snatches of old halfremembered songs they were songs of departing summer tinged with melancholy and suggested other verses not meant for singing which i began repeating    rich flowers have perished on the silent earth    blossoms of valley and of wood that gave    a fragrance to the winds   and again    the blithesome birds have sought a sunnier shore    they lingered till the cold cold winds went in    and withered their green homes   and these also were fragments breathing only of sadness which made me resolve to dismiss poetry from my mind and think of nothing at all i tried to interest myself in a flight of buzzardlike hawks soaring in wide circles at an immense height above me gazing up into that far blue vault under which they moved so serenely and which seemed so infinite i remembered how often in former days when gazing up into such a sky i had breathed a prayer to the unseen spirit but now i recalled the words the father of the house had spoken to me and the prayer died unformed in my heart and a strange feeling of orphanhood saddened me and brought my eyes to earth again  halfway to the wood on an open reach where there were no trees or bushes i came on a great company of storks half a thousand of them at least apparently resting on their travels for they were all standing motionless with necks drawn in as if dozing they were very stately handsome birds clear gray in color with a black collar on the neck and red beak and legs my approach did not disturb them until i was within twenty yards of the nearestfor they were scattered over an acre of ground then they rose with a loud rustling noise of wings only to settle again at a short distance off  incredible numbers of birds chiefly waterfowl had appeared in the neighborhood since the beginning of the wet boisterous weather the river too was filled with these new visitors and i was told that most of them were passengers driven from distant northern regions which they made their summer home and were now flying south in search of a warmer climate  all this movement in the feathered world had during my troubled days brought me as little pleasure as the other changes going on about me those winged armies ever hurrying by in broken detachments wailing and clanging by day and by night in the clouds white with their own terror or blackplumed like messengers of doom to my distempered fancy only added a fresh element of fear to a nature racked with disorders and full of tremendous signs and omens  the interest with which i now remarked these pilgrim storks seemed to me a pleasant symptom of a return to a saner state of mind and before continuing my walk i wished that yoletta had been there with me to see them and tell me their history for she was curious about such matters and had a most wonderful affection for the whole feathered race she had her favorites among the birds at different seasons and the kind she most esteemed now had been arriving for over a month their numbers increasing day by day until the woods and fields were alive with their flocks  this kind was named the cloudbird on account of its starlinglike habit of wheeling about over its feedingground the birds throwing themselves into masses then scattering and gathering again many times so that when viewed at a distance a large flock had the appearance of a cloud growing dark and thin alternately and continually changing its form it was somewhat larger than a starling with a freer flight and had a richer plumage its color being deep glossy blue or blueblack and underneath bright chestnut when close at hand and in the bright sunshine the aerial gambols of a flock were beautiful to witness as the birds wheeled about and displayed in turn as if moved by one impulse first the rich blue then the bright chestnut surfaces to the eye the charming effect was increased by the belllike chirping notes they all uttered together and as they swept round or doubled in the air at intervals came these tempests of melodious sounda most perfect expression of wild jubilant birdlife yoletta discoursing in the most delightful way about her loved cloudbirds had told me that they spent the summer season in great solitary marshes where they built their nests in the rushes but with cold weather they flew abroad and at such times seemed always to prefer the neighborhood of man remaining in great flocks near the house until the next spring on this bright sunny morning i was amazed at the multitudes i saw during my walk yet it was not strange that birds were so abundant considering that there were no longer any savages on the earth with nothing to amuse their vacant minds except killing the feathered creatures with their bows and arrows and no innumerable company of squaws clamorous for trophiesunchristian women of the woods with painted faces insolence in their eyes and for ornaments the feathered skins torn from slain birds on their heads  when i at length arrived at the wood i went to that spot where i had felled the large tree on the occasion of my last and disastrous visit and where yoletta newly released from confinement had found me there lay the roughbarked giant exactly as i had left it and once more i began to hack at the large branches but my feeble strokes seemed to make little impression and becoming tired in a very short time i concluded that i was not yet equal to such work and sat myself down to rest i remembered how when sitting on that very spot i had heard a slight rustling of the withered leaves and looking up beheld yoletta coming swiftly towards me with outstretched arms and her face shining with joy perhaps she would come again to me today yes she would surely come when i wished for her so much for she had followed me out to try to dissuade me from going to the woods and would be anxiously thinking about me and she could spare an hour from the sickroom now the trees and bushes would prevent me from seeing her approach but i should hear her as i had heard her before i sat motionless scarcely breathing straining my sense to catch the first faint sound of her light swift step and every time a small bird hopping along the ground rustled a withered leaf i started up to greet and embrace her but she did not come and at last sick at heart with hope deferred i covered my face with my hands and weak with misery cried like a disappointed child  presently something touched me and removing my hands from my face i saw that great silvergray dog which had come to yolettas call when i fainted sitting before me with his chin resting on my knees no doubt he remembered that last woodcutting day very well and had come to take care of me now  welcome dear old friend said i and in my craving for sympathy of some kind i put my arms over him and pressed my face against his then i sat up again and gazed into the pair of clear brown eyes watching my face so gravely  look here old fellow said i talking audibly to him for want of something in human shape to address you didnt lick my face just now when you might have done so with impunity and when i speak to you you dont wag that beautiful bushy tail which serves you for ornament this reminds me that you are not like the dogs i used to knowthe dogs that talked with their tails caressed with their tongues and were never overclean or wellbehaved where are they nowcollies ratworrying terriers hounds spaniels pointers retrieversdogs rough and dogs smooth big brute boarhounds st bernards mastiffs nearly or quite as big as you are but not so slender silkyhaired and sharpnosed and without your refined expression of keenness without cunning and after these canine noblemen of the old regime whither has vanished the countless rabble of mongrels curs and pariah dogs and last of allbeing more degeneratethe corpulent bleareyed wheezy pet dogs of a hundred breeds they are all dead no doubt they have been dead so long that i daresay nature extracted all the valuable salts that were contained in their flesh and bones thousands of years ago and used it for better thingsraindrops froth of the sea flowers and fruit and blades of grass yet there was not a beast in all that crew of which its master or mistress was not ready to affirm that it could do everything but talk no one says that of you my gentle guardian for dogworship with all the ten thousand fungoid cults that sprang up and flourished exceedingly in the muddy marsh of mans intellect has withered quite away and left no seed yet in intelligence you are i fancy somewhat ahead of your faroff progenitors long use has also given you something like a conscience you are a good sensible beast thats all you love and serve your master according to your lights night and day you with your fellows guard his flocks and herds his house and fields into his sacred house however you do not intrude your comely countenance knowing your place  what then happened to earth and how long did that undreaming slumber last from which i woke to find things so altered i do not know nor does it matter very much i only know that there has been a sort of mighty savonarola bonfire in which most of the things once valued have been consumed to ashespolitics religions systems of philosophy isms and ologies of all descriptions schools churches prisons poorhouses stimulants and tobacco kings and parliaments cannon with its hostile roar and pianos that thundered peacefully history the press vice political economy money and a million things moreall consumed like so much worthless hay and stubble this being so why am i not overwhelmed at the thought of it in that feverish full ageso full and yet my god how emptyin the wilderness of every mans soul was not a voice heard crying out prophesying the end i know that a thought sometimes came to me passing through my brain like lightning through the foliage of a tree and in the quick blighting fire of that intolerable thought all hopes beliefs dreams and schemes seemed instantaneously to shrivel up and turn to ashes and drop from me and leave me naked and desolate sometimes it came when i read a book of philosophy or listened on a still hot sunday to a dull preacherthey were mostly dullprosing away to a sleepy fashionable congregation about daniel in the lions den or some other equally remote matter or when i walked in crowded thoroughfares or when i heard some great politician out of officeout in the cold like a miserable workingman with no work to dohurling anathemas at an iniquitous government and sometimes also when i lay awake in the silent watches of the night a little while the thought said and all this will be no more for we have not found out the secret of happiness and all our toil and effort is misdirected and those who are seeking for a mechanical equivalent of consciousness and those who are going about doing good are alike wasting their lives and on all our hopes beliefs dreams theories and enthusiasms passing away is written plainly as the mene mene tekel upharsin seen by belshazzar on the wall of his palace in babylon  that withering thought never comes to me now passing away is not written on the earth which is still gods green footstool the grass was not greener nor the flowers sweeter when man was first made out of clay and the breath of life breathed into his nostrils and the human family and raceoutcome of all that dead unimaginable pastthis also appears to have the stamp of everlastingness on it and in its tranquil power and majesty resembles some vast mountain that lifts its head above the clouds and has its granite roots deep down in the worlds center a feeling of awe is in me when i gaze on it but it is vain to ask myself now whether the vanished past with its manifold troubles and transitory delights was preferable to this unchanging peaceful present i care for nothing but yoletta and if the old world was consumed to ashes that she might be created i am pleased that it was so consumed for nobler than all perished hopes and ambitions is the hope that i may one day wear that bright consummate flower on my bosom  i have only one trouble nowa wolf that follows me everywhere always threatening to rend me to pieces with its black jaws not you old frienda great gaunt maneating metaphorical wolf far more terrible than that beast of the ancients which came to the poor mans door in the darkness its eyes glowing like coals are ever watching me and even in the bright daylight its shadowy form is ever near me stealing from bush to bush or from room to room always dogging my footsteps will it ever vanish like a mere phantoma wolf of the brainor will it come nearer and more near to spring upon and rend me at the last if they could only clothe my mind as they have my body to make me like themselves with no canker at my heart ever contented and calmly glad but nothing comes from taking thought i am sick of thoughti hate it away with it i shall go and look for yoletta since she does not come to me goodby old friend you have been wellbehaved and listened with considerable patience to a long discourse it will benefit you about as much as i have been benefited by many a lecture and many a sermon i was compelled to listen to in the old vanished days  bestowing another caress on him i got up and went back to the house thinking sadly as i walked that the bright weather had not yet greatly improved my spirits       chapter 20  arrived at the house i was again disappointed at not seeing yoletta yet without reasonable cause since it was scarcely past midday and she came out from attending on her mother only at long intervalsin the morning and again just before eveningto taste the freshness of nature for a few minutes  the musicroom was deserted when i went there but it was made warm and pleasant by the sun shining brightly in at the doors opening to the south i went on to the extreme end of the room remembering now that i had seen some volumes there when i had no time or inclination to look at them and i wanted something to read for although i found reading very irksome at this period there was really little else i could do i found the booksthree volumesin the lower part of an alcove in the wall above them within a niche in the alcove on a level with my face as i stood there i observed a bulbshaped bottle with a long thin neck very beautifully colored i had seen it before but without paying particular attention to it there being so many treasures of its kind in the house now seeing it so closely i could not help admiring its exquisite beauty and feeling puzzled at the scene depicted on it in the widest part it was encircled with a band and on it appeared slim youths and maidens in delicate rosecolored garments with butterfly wings on their shoulders running or hurriedly walking playing on instruments of various forms their faces shining with gladness their golden hair tossed by the winda gay procession without beginning or end behind these joyful ones in pale gray and halfobscured by the mists that formed the background appeared a second procession hurrying in an opposite directionmen and women of all ages but mostly old with haggard woebegone faces some bowed down their eyes fixed on the ground others wringing their hands or beating their breasts and all apparently suffering the utmost affliction of mind  above the bottle there was a deep circular cell in the alcove about fifteen inches in diameter fitted in it was a metal ring to which were attached golden strings fine as gossamer threads behind the first ring was a second and further in still others all stringed like the first so that looking into the cell it appeared filled with a mist of golden cobweb  drawing a cushioned seat to this secluded nook where no person passing casually through the room would be able to see me i sat down and feeling too indolent to get myself a readingstand i supported the volume i had taken up to read on my knees it was entitled conduct and ceremonial and the subjectmatter was divided into short sections each with an appropriate heading turning over the leaves and reading a sentence here and there in different sections it occurred to me that this might prove a most useful work for me to study whenever i could bring my mind into the right frame for such a task for it contained minute instructions upon all points relating to individual conduct in the houseas the entertainment of pilgrims the dress to be worn and the conduct to be observed at the various annual festivals with other matters of the kind glancing through it in this rapid way i soon finished with the first volume then went through the second in even less time for many of the concluding sections related to lugubrious subjects which i did not care to linger over the titles alone were enough to trouble medecay through age ailments of mind and of body then death and finally the disposal of the dead this done i took up the third volume the last of the series the first portion of which was headed renewal of the family this part i began to examine with some attention and pretty soon discovered that i had now at last accidentally stumbled upon a perfect mine of information of the precise kind i had so long and so vainly been seeking struggling to overcome my agitation i read on hurrying through page after page with the greatest rapidity for there was here much matter that had no special interest for me but incidentally the things which concerned me most to know were touched on and in some cases minutely explained as i proceeded the prophetic gloom which had oppressed me all that day and for so many days before darkened to the blackness of despair and suddenly throwing up my arms the book slipped from my knees and fell with a crash upon the floor there face downwards with its beautiful leaves doubled and broken under its weight it rested unheeded at my feet for now the desired knowledge was mine and that dream of happiness which had illumined my life was over now i possessed the secret of that passionless everlasting calm of beings who had for ever outlived and left as immeasurably far behind as the instincts of the wolf and ape the strongest emotion of which my heart was capable for the children of the house there could be no union by marriage in body and soul they differed from me they had no name for that feeling which i had so often and so vainly declared therefore they had told me again and again that there was only one kind of love for they alas could experience one kind only i did not for the moment seek further in the book or pause to reflect on that still unexplained mystery which was the very center and core of the whole mater namely the existence of the father and mother in the house from whose union the family was renewed and who fruitful themselves were yet the parents of a barren race nor did i ask who their successors would be for albeit longlived they were mortal like their own passionless children and in this particular house their lives appeared now to be drawing to an end these were questions i cared nothing about it was enough to know that yoletta could never love me as i loved herthat she could never be mine body and soul in my way and not in hers with unspeakable bitterness i recalled my conversation with chastel now all her professions of affection and goodwill all her schemes for smoothing my way and securing my happiness seemed to me the veriest mockery since even she had read my heart no better than the others and that chill moonlight felicity beyond which her children were powerless to imagine anything had no charm for my passiontorn heart  presently when i began to recover somewhat from my stupefaction and to realize the magnitude of my loss the misery of it almost drove me mad i wished that i had never made this fatal discovery that i might have continued still hoping and dreaming and wearing out my heart with striving after the impossible since any fate would have been preferable to the blank desolation which now confronted me i even wished to possess the power of some implacable god or demon that i might shatter the sacred houses of this later race and destroy them everlastingly and repeople the peaceful world with struggling starving millions as in the past so that the beautiful flower of love which had withered in mens hearts might blossom again  while these insane thoughts were passing through my brain i had risen from my seat and stood leaning against the edge of the alcove with that curious richlycolored bottle close to my eyes there were letters on it noticed now for the first timeminute hairlike lines beneath the strangecontrasted processionists depicted on the bandand even in my excited condition i was a little startled when these letters forming the end of a sentence shaped themselves into the wordsand for the old life there shall be a new life  turning the bottle round i read the whole sentence when time and disease oppress and the sun grows cold in heaven and there is no longer any joy on the earth and the fire of love grows cold in the heart drink of me and for the old life there shall be a new life  another important secret thought i this day has certainly been fruitful in discoveries a panacea for all diseases even for the disease of old age so that a man may live two hundred years and still find some pleasure in existence but for me life has lost its savor and i have no wish to last so long there is more writing hereanother secret perhaps but i doubt very much that it will give me any comfort  when your soul is darkened so that it is hard to know evil from good and the thoughts that are in you lead to madness drink of me and be cured  no i shall not drink and be cured better a thousand times the thoughts that lead to madness than this colorless existence without love i do not wish to recover from so sweet a malady  i took the bottle in my hand and unstopped it the stopper formed a curious little cup round the rim of which was written drink of me i poured some of the liquid out into the cup it was pale yellow in color and had a faint sickly smell as of honeysuckles then i poured it back again and replaced the bottle in its niche  drink and be cured no not yet some day perhaps my trouble increasing till it might no longer be borne would drive me to seek such dreary comfort as this cureall bottle contained to love without hope was sad enough but to be without love was even sadder  i had grown calm now the knowledge that i had it in my power to escape at once and for eyer from that rage of desire had served to sober my mind and at last i began to reason about the matter the nature of my secret feelings could never be suspected and in the unsubstantial realm of the imagination it would still be in my power to hide myself with my love and revel in all supreme delight would not that be better than this curethis calm contentment held out to me and in time also my feelings would lose their present intensity which often made them an agony and would come at last to exist only as a gentle rapture stirring in my heart when i clasped my darling to my bosom and pressed her sweet lips with mine ah no that was a vain dream i could not be deceived by it for who can say to the demon of passion in him thus far shalt thou go and no further  perplexed in mind and unable to decide which thing was best my troubled thoughts at length took me back to that faroff dead past when the passion of love was so much in mans life it was much but in that overpopulated world it divided the empire of his soul with a great evergrowing miserythe misery of the hungry ones whose minds were darkened through long years of decadence with a sullen rage against god and man and the misery of those who wanting nothing yet feared that the end of all things was coming to them  for the space of half an hour i pondered on these things then said if i were to tell a hundredth part of this black retrospect to yoletta would not she bid me drink and forget and herself pour out the divine liquor and press it to my lips  again i took the bottle with trembling hand and filled the same small cup to the brim saying for your sake then yoletta let me drink and be cured for this is what you desire and you are more to me than life or passion or happiness but when this consuming fire has left methis feeling which until now burns and palpitates in every drop of my blood every fiber of my beingi know that you shall still be to me a sweet sacred sister and immaculate bride worshipped more of my soul than any mother in the house that loving and being loved by you shall be my one great joy all my life long  i drained the cup deliberately then stopped the bottle and put it back in its place the liquor was tasteless but colder than ice and made me shiver when i swallowed it i began to wonder whether i would be conscious of the change it was destined to work in me or not and then half regretting what i had done i wished that yoletta would come to me so that i might clasp her in my arms with all the old fervor once more before that icycold liquor had done its work finally i carefully raised the fallen book and smoothed out its doubled leaves regretting that i had injured it and sitting down again i held the open volume as before resting on my knees now however i perceived that it had opened at a place some pages in advance of the passages which had excited me but feeling no desire to go back to resume my reading just where i had left off my eyes mechanically sought the top of the page before me and this is what i read  make choice of one of the daughters of the house it is fitting that she should rejoice for that brighter excellence which caused her to be raised to so high a state and to have authority over all others since in her with the father all the majesty and glory of the house is centered albeit with a solemn and chastened joy like that of the pilgrim who journeying to some distant tropical region of the earth and seeing the shores of his native country fading from sight thinks at one and the same time of the unimaginable beauties of nature and art that fire his mind and call him away and of the wide distance which will hold him for many years divided from all familiar scenes and the beings he loves best and of the storms and perils of the great wilderness of waves into which so many have ventured and have not returned for now a changed body and soul shall separate her forever from those who were one in nature with her and with that superior happiness destined to be hers there shall be the pains and perils of childbirth with new griefs and cares unknown to those of humbler condition but on that lesser gladness had by the children of the house in her exaltation and because there will be a new mother in the houseone chosen from themselvesthere shall be no cloud or shadow and taking her by the hand and kissing her face in token of joy and of that new filial love and obedience which will be theirs they shall lead her to the mothers room thereafter to be inhabited by her as long as life lasts and she shall no longer serve in the house or suffer rebuke but all shall serve her in love and hold her in reverence who is their predestined mother and for the space of one year she shall be without authority in the house being one apart instructing herself in the secret books which it is not lawful for another to read and observing day by day the directions contained therein until that new knowledge and practice shall ripen her for that state she has been chosen to fill        this passage was a fresh revelation to me again i recalled chastels words her repeated assurances that she knew what was passing in my mind that her eyes saw things more clearly than others could see them that only by giving me the desire of my heart could the one remaining hope of her life be fulfilled now i seemed able to understand these dark sayings and a new excitement full of the joy of hope sprang up in me making me forget the misery i had so recently experienced and even that increasing sensation of intense cold caused by the draught from the mysterious bottle  i continued reading but the above passage was succeeded by minute instructions extending over several pages concerning the dress both for ordinary and extraordinary occasions to be worn by the chosen daughter during her year of preparation the conduct to be observed by her towards other members of the family also towards pilgrims visiting the house in the interval with many other matters of secondary importance impatient to reach the end i tried to turn the leaves rapidly but now found that my arm had grown strangely stiff and cold and seemed like an arm of iron when i raised it so that the turning over of each leaf was an immense labor then i read yet another page but with the utmost difficulty for notwithstanding the eagerness of my mind my eyes began to remain more and more rigidly fixed on the center of the leaf so that i could scarcely force them to follow the lines here i read that the brideelect her year of preparation being over rises before daylight and goes out alone to an appointed place at a great distance from the house there to pass several hours in solitude and silence communing with her own heart meanwhile in the house all the others array themselves in purple garments and go out singing at sunrise to gather flowers to adorn their heads then proceeding to the appointed spot they seek for their new mother and finding her lead her home with music and rejoicing  when reading in this miserable painful way i had reached the bottom of the page and attempted to turn it over i found that i could no longer move my handmy arms being now like arms of iron absolutely devoid of sensation while my hands rigidly grasping the book like the hands of a frozen corpse held it upright and motionless before me i tried to start up and shake off this strange deadness from my body but was powerless to move a muscle what was the meaning of this condition for i had absolutely no pain no discomfort even for the sensation of intense cold had almost ceased and my mind was active and clear and i could hear and see and yet was as powerless as if i had been buried in a marble coffin a thousand fathoms deep in earth  suddenly i remembered the draught from the bottle and a terrible doubt shot through my heart alas had i mistaken the meaning of those strange words i had readwas death the cure which that mysterious vessel promised to those who drank of its contents when life becomes a burden it is good to lay it down now too late the words of the father when reproving me after my fever came back to my mind in all their awful significance  all at once i heard a voice calling my name and in a moment the tempest in me was stilled yes it was my darlings voiceshe was coming to meshe would save me in this dire extremity again and again she called but the voice now sounded further and further away and with ineffable anguish i remembered that she would not be able to see me where i sat i tried to cry out come quick yoletta and save me from death but though i mentally repeated the words again and again in an extreme agony of terror my frozen tongue refused to make a sound presently i heard a light quick step on the floor then yolettas clear voice  oh i have found you at last she cried i have been seeking you all over the house i have something glad to tell yousomething to make you happier than on that daydo you rememberwhen you saw me coming to you in the wood the mother has left her chamber at last she is in the mothers room again waiting impatiently to see you come come  her words sounded distinctly in my ears and although i could not lift or turn my rigid eyes to see her yet i seemed to see her now better than ever before with some fresh glory as of a new unaccustomed gladness or excitement enhancing her unsurpassed loveliness so clearly at that moment did her image shine in my soul and not hers only for now suddenly by a miracle of the mind the entire family appeared there before me and in the midst sat chastel my sweet suffering mother as on that day after my illness when she had pardoned me and put out her hand for me to kiss as on that occasion nownow she was gazing on me with such divine love and compassion in her eyes her lips half parted and a slight color flushing her pale face recalling to it the bloom and radiance of which cruel disease had robbed her and in my soul also at that supreme moment like a scene starting at the lightnings flash out of thick darkness shone the image of the house with all its wide tranquil rooms rich in art and ancient memories every stone within them glowing with everlasting beautya house enduring as the green plains and rushing rivers and solemn woods and worldold hills amid which it was set like a sacred gem o sweet abode of love and peace and purity of heart o bliss surpassing that of the angels o rich heritage must i lose you for ever save me from death yoletta my love my bridesave mesave mesave me  then something touched or fell on my neck and at the same moment a deeper shadow passed over the page before me with all its rich coloring floating formless like vapors mingling and separating or dancing before my vision like brightwinged insects hovering in the sunlight and i knew that she was bending over me her hand on my neck her loose hair falling on my forehead  in that enforced stillness and silence i waited expectant for some moments  then a great cry as of one who suddenly sees a black phantom rang out loud in the room jarring my brain with the madness of its terror and striking as with a hundred passionate hands on all the hidden harps in wall and roof and the troubled sounds came back to me now loud and now low burdened with an infinite anguish and despair as of voices of innumerable multitudes wandering in the sunless desolations of space every voice reverberating anguish and despair and the successive reverberations lifted me like waves and dropped me again and the waves grew less and the sounds fainter then fainter still and died in everlasting silence
