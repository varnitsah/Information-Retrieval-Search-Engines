90899866	the bedfordrow conspiracy  by william makepeace thackeray   contents    i   of the loves of mr perkins and miss gorgon and of the two   great factions in the town of oldborough    ii  shows how the plot began to thicken in or about bedford row    iii behind the scenes     note    a story of charles de bernard furnished the plot of   the bedfordrow conspiracy     the bedfordrow conspiracy     chapter i   of the loves of mr perkins and miss gorgon and of the two great factions in the town of oldborough  my dear john cried lucy with a very wise look indeed it must and shall be so as for doughty street with our means a house is out of the question we must keep three servants and aunt biggs says the taxes are oneandtwenty pounds a year  i have seen a sweet place at chelsea remarked john paradise row no 17gardengreenhousefifty pounds a yearomnibus to town within a mile  what that i may be left alone all day and you spend a fortune in driving backward and forward in those horrid breakneck cabs my darling i should die theredie of fright i know i should did you not say yourself that the road was not as yet lighted and that the place swarmed with publichouses and dreadful tipsy irish bricklayers would you kill me john  my daarling said john with tremendous fondness clutching miss lucy suddenly round the waist and rapping the hand of that young person violently against his waistcoatmy daarling dont say such things even in a joke if i objected to the chambers it is only because you my love with your birth and connections ought to have a house of your own the chambers are quite large enough and certainly quite good enough for me and so after some more sweet parley on the part of these young people it was agreed that they should take up their abode when married in a part of the house number one hundred and something bedford row  it will be necessary to explain to the reader that john was no other than john perkins esquire of the middle temple barristeratlaw and that miss lucy was the daughter of the late captain gorgon and marianne biggs his wife the captain being of noble connections younger son of a baronet cousin to lord x and related to the y family had angered all his relatives by marrying a very silly pretty young woman who kept a ladiesschool at canterbury she had six hundred pounds to her fortune which the captain laid out in the purchase of a sweet travellingcarriage and dressingcase for himself and going abroad with his lady spent several years in the principal prisons of europe in one of which he died his wife and daughter were meantime supported by the contributions of mrs jemima biggs who still kept the ladiesschool  at last a dear old relativesuch a one as one reads of in romancesdied and left seven thousand pounds apiece to the two sisters whereupon the elder gave up schooling and retired to london and the younger managed to live with some comfort and decency at brussels upon two hundred and ten pounds per annum mrs gorgon never touched a shilling of her capital for the very good reason that it was placed entirely out of her reach so that when she died her daughter found herself in possession of a sum of money that is not always to be met with in this world  her aunt the baronets lady and her aunt the exschoolmistress both wrote very pressing invitations to her and she resided with each for six months after her arrival in england now for a second time she had come to mrs biggs caroline place mecklenburgh square it was under the roof of that respectable old lady that john perkins esquire being invited to take tea wooed and won miss gorgon  having thus described the circumstances of miss gorgons life let us pass for a moment from that young lady and lift up the veil of mystery which envelopes the deeds and character of perkins  perkins too was an orphan and he and his lucy of summer evenings when sol descending lingered fondly yet about the minarets of the foundling and gilded the grassplots of mecklenburgh squareperkins i say and lucy would often sit together in the summerhouse of that pleasureground and muse upon the strange coincidences of their life lucy was motherless and fatherless so too was perkins if perkins was brotherless and sisterless was not lucy likewise an only child perkins was twentythree his age and lucys united amounted to fortysix and it was to be remarked as a fact still more extraordinary that while lucys relatives were aunts johns were uncles mysterious spirit of love let us treat thee with respect and whisper not too many of thy secrets the fact is john and lucy were a pair of fools as every young couple ought to be who have hearts that are worth a farthing and were ready to find coincidences sympathies hidden gushes of feeling mystic unions of the soul and what not in every single circumstance that occurred from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof and in the intervals bedford row where perkins lived is not very far from mecklenburgh square and john used to say that he felt a comfort that his house and lucys were served by the same muffinman  further comment is needless a more honest simple clever warmhearted soft whimsical romantical highspirited young fellow than john perkins did not exist when his father doctor perkins died this his only son was placed under the care of john perkins esquire of the house of perkins scully and perkins those celebrated attorneys in the trading town of oldborough which the second partner william pitt scully esquire represented in parliament and in london  all johns fortune was the house in bedford row which at his fathers death was let out into chambers and brought in a clear hundred a year under his uncles roof at oldborough where he lived with thirteen redhaired male and female cousins he was only charged fifty pounds for board clothes and pocketmoney and the remainder of his rents was carefully put by for him until his majority when he approached that periodwhen he came to belong to two spoutingclubs at oldborough among the young merchants and lawyersclerksto blow the flute nicely and play a good game at billiardsto have written one or two smart things in the oldborough sentinelto be fond of smoking in which act he was discovered by his fainting aunt at three oclock one morningin one word when john perkins arrived at manhood he discovered that he was quite unfit to be an attorney that he detested all the ways of his uncles stern dull vulgar regular redheaded family and he vowed that he would go to london and make his fortune thither he went his aunt and cousins who were all serious vowing that he was a lost boy and when his history opens john had been two years in the metropolis inhabiting his own garrets and a very nice compact set of apartments looking into the backgarden at this moment falling vacant the prudent lucy gorgon had visited them and vowed that she and her john should there commence housekeeping  all these explanations are tedious but necessary and furthermore it must be said that as johns uncles partner was the liberal member for oldborough so lucys uncle was its ministerial representative  this gentleman the brother of the deceased captain gorgon lived at the paternal mansion of gorgon castle and rejoiced in the name and title of sir george grimsby gorgon  he too like his younger brother had married a lady beneath his own rank in life having espoused the daughter and heiress of mr hicks the great brewer at oldborough who held numerous mortgages on the gorgon property all of which he yielded up together with his daughter juliana to the care of the baronet  what lady gorgon was in character this history will show in person if she may be compared to any vulgar animal one of her fathers heavy healthy broadflanked romannosed white drayhorses might to the poetic mind appear to resemble her at twenty she was a splendid creature and though not at her full growth yet remarkable for strength and sinew at fortyfive she was as fine a woman as any in his majestys dominions five feet seven in height thirteen stone her own teeth and hair she looked as if she were the mother of a regiment of grenadier guards she had three daughters of her own size and at length ten years after the birth of the last of the young ladies a sonone songeorge augustus frederick grimsby gorgon the godson of a royal duke whose steady officer in waiting sir george had been for many years  it is needless to say after entering so largely into a description of lady gorgon that her husband was a little shrivelled wizenfaced creature eight inches shorter than her ladyship this is the way of the world as every single reader of this book must have remarked for frolic love delights to join giants and pigmies of different sexes in the bonds of matrimony when you saw her ladyship in flamecoloured satin and gorgeous toque and feathers entering the drawingroom as footmen along the stairs shouted melodiously sir george and lady gorgon you beheld in her company a small withered old gentleman with powder and large royal household buttons who tripped at her elbow as a little weaklegged colt does at the side of a stout mare  the little general had been present at about a hundred and twenty pitched battles on hounslow heath and wormwood scrubs but had never drawn his sword against an enemy as might be expected therefore his talk and tenue were outrageously military he had the whole army list by heartthat is as far as the fieldofficers all below them he scorned a bugle at gorgon castle always sounded at breakfast and dinner a gun announced sunset he clung to his pigtail for many years after the army had forsaken that ornament and could never be brought to think much of the peninsular men for giving it up when he spoke of the duke he used to call him my lord wellingtoni recollect him as captain wellesley he swore fearfully in conversation was most regular at church and regularly read to his family and domestics the morning and evening prayer he bullied his daughters seemed to bully his wife who led him whither she chose gave grand entertainments and never asked a friend by chance had splendid liveries and starved his people and was as dull stingy pompous insolent cringing illtempered a little creature as ever was known  with such qualities you may fancy that he was generally admired in society and by his country so he was and i never knew a man so endowed whose way through life was not safewho had fewer pangs of consciencemore positive enjoymentsmore respect shown to himmore favours granted to him than such a one as my friend the general  her ladyship was just suited to him and they did in reality admire each other hugely previously to her marriage with the baronet many lovepassages had passed between her and william pitt scully esquire the attorney and there was especially one story a propos of certain syllabubs and sallylunn cakes which seemed to show that matters had gone very far be this as it may no sooner did the general major gorgon he was then cast an eye on her than scullys five years fabric of love was instantly dashed to the ground she cut him pitilessly cut sally scully his sister her dearest friend and confidante and bestowed her big person upon the little aidedecamp at the end of a fortnights wooing in the course of time their mutual fathers died the gorgon estates were unencumbered patron of both the seats in the borough of oldborough and occupant of one sir george grimsby gorgon baronet was a personage of no small importance  he was it scarcely need to be said a tory and this was the reason why william pitt scully esquire of the firm of perkins and scully deserted those principles in which he had been bred and christened deserted that church which he had frequented for he could not bear to see sir george and my lady flaunting in their grand pewdeserted i say the church adopted the conventicle and became one of the most zealous and eloquent supporters that freedom has known in our time scully of the house of scully and perkins was a dangerous enemy in five years from that marriage which snatched from the jilted solicitor his hearts young affections sir george gorgon found that he must actually spend seven hundred pounds to keep his two seats at the next election a liberal was set up against his man and actually ran him hard and finally at the end of eighteen years the rejected scullythe mean attorneywas actually the first member for oldborough sir george grimsby gorgon baronet being only the second  the agony of that day cannot be imaginedthe dreadful curses of sir george who saw fifteen hundred a year robbed from under his very nosethe religious resignation of my ladythe hideous windowsmashing that took place at the gorgon arms and the discomfiture of the pelted mayor and corporation the very next sunday scully was reconciled to the church or attended it in the morning and the meeting twice in the afternoon and as doctor snorter uttered the prayer for the high court of parliament his eye the eye of his whole partyturned towards lady gorgon and sir george in a most unholy triumph sir george who always stood during prayers like a military man fairly sank down among the hassocks and lady gorgon was heard to sob as audibly as ever did little beadlebelaboured urchin  scully when at oldborough came from that day forth to church what said he was it to him were we not all brethren old perkins however kept religiously to the squaretoes congregation in fact to tell the truth this subject had been debated between the partners who saw the advantage of courting both the establishment and the dissentersa manoeuvre which i need not say is repeated in almost every country town in england where a solicitors house has this kind of power and connection  three months after this election came the races at oldborough and the raceball gorgon was so infuriated by his defeat that he gave the gorgon cup and cover a matter of fifteen pounds scully although anxious as he wrote from town anxious beyond measure to preserve the breed of horses for which our beloved country has ever been famous could attend no such sports as these which but too often degenerated into vice it was voted a shabby excuse lady gorgon was radiant in her barouche and four and gladly became the patroness of the ball that was to ensue and which all the gentry and townspeople tory and whig were in the custom of attending the ball took place on the last day of the races on that day the walls of the markethouse the principal public buildings and the gorgon arms hotel itself were plastered with the following  letter from our distinguished representative william p scully esquire etc etc                             house of commons  june 1 18  my dear heeltapyou know my opinion about horseracing and though i blame neither you nor any brother englishman who enjoys that manly sport you will i am sure appreciate the conscientious motives which induce me not to appear among my friends and constituents on the festival of the 3rd 4th and 5th instant if i however cannot allow my name to appear among your list of stewards one at least of the representatives of oldborough has no such scruples sir george gorgon is among you and though i differ from that honourable baronet on more than one vital point i am glad to think that he is with you a gentleman a soldier a man of property in the county how can he be better employed than in forwarding the countys amusements and in forwarding the happiness of all  had i no such scruples as those to which i have just alluded i must still have refrained from coming among you your great oldborough commondrainage and inclosure bill comes on tomorrow and i shall be at my post i am sure if sir george gorgon were here he and i should on this occasion vote side by side and that party strife would be forgotten in the object of our common

from a wellwisher to oldborough  this amazing letter was published in defiance of mr scullys injunctions by the enthusiastic heeltap who said bluntly in a preface that he saw no reason why mr scully should be ashamed of his action and he for his part was glad to let all friends at oldborough know of it  the allusion about the gorgon soup was killing thirteen paupers in oldborough had it was confidently asserted died of it lady gorgon on the reading of this letter was struck completely dumb sir george gorgon was wild ten dozen of champagne was he obliged to send down to the gorgon arms to be added to the festival he would have stayed away if he could but he dared not  at nine oclock he in generals uniform his wife in blue satin and diamonds his daughters in blue crape and white roses his niece lucy gorgon in white muslin his son george augustus frederick grimsby gorgon in a blue velvet jacket sugarloaf buttons and nankeens entered the north door of the ballroom to much cheering and the sound of god save the king  at that very same moment and from the south door issued william pitt scully esquire mp and his staff mr scully had a brandnew blue coat and brass buttons buff waistcoat white kerseymere tights pumps with large rosettes and pink silk stockings  this wool said he to a friend was grown on oldborough sheep this cloth was spun in oldborough looms these buttons were cast in an oldborough manufactory these shoes were made by an oldborough tradesman this heart first beat in oldborough town and pray heaven may be buried there  could anything resist a man like this john perkins who had come down as one of scullys aidesdecamp in a fit of generous enthusiasm leaped on a whisttable flung up a pockethandkerchief and shriekedscully for ever  heeltap who was generally drunk fairly burst into tears and the grave tradesmen and whig gentry who had dined with the member at his inn and accompanied him thence to the gorgon arms lifted their deep voices and shouted hear good bravo noble scully for ever god bless him and hurrah  the scene was tumultuously affecting and when young perkins sprang down from the table and came blushing up to the member that gentleman said thank you jack thank you my boy thank you in a way which made perkins think that his supreme cup of bliss was quaffed that he had but to die for that life had no other such joy in store for him scully was perkinss napoleonhe yielded himself up to the attorney body and soul  whilst this scene was going on under one chandelier of the ballroom beneath the other scarlet little general gorgon sumptuous lady gorgon the daughters and niece gorgons were standing surrounded by their tory court who affected to sneer and titter at the whig demonstrations which were taking place  what a howwid thmell of whithkey lisped cornet fitch of the dragoons to miss lucy confidentially and thethe are what they call whigth are they he he  they are drunk me drunk by  said the general to the mayor  which is scully said lady gorgon lifting her glass gravely she was at that very moment thinking of the syllabubs is it that tipsy man in the green coat or that vulgar creature in the blue one  law my lady said the mayoress have you forgotten him why thats him in blue and buff  and a monthous fine man too said cornet fitch i wish we had him in our twoopheth thix feet thwee if heth an inch aint he genewal  no reply  and heavens mamma shrieked the three gorgons in a breath see one creature is on the whisttable oh the wretch  im sure hes very goodlooking said lucy simply  lady gorgon darted at her an angry look and was about to say something very contemptuous when at that instant john perkinss shout taking effect master george augustus frederick grimsby gorgon not knowing better incontinently raised a small shout on his side  hear good bravo exclaimed he scully for ever hurraaaay and fell skipping about like the whigs opposite  silence you brute you groaned lady gorgon and seizing him by the shirtfrill and coatcollar carried him away to his nurse who with many other maids of the whig and tory parties stood giggling and peeping at the landingplace  fancy how all these small incidents augmented the heap of lady gorgons anger and injuries she was a dull phlegmatic woman for the most part and contented herself generally with merely despising her neighbours but oh what a fine active hatred raged in her bosom for victorious scully at this moment mr perkins had finished shaking hands with his napoleonnapoleon seemed bent upon some tremendous enterprise he was looking at lady gorgon very hard  shes a fine woman said scully thoughtfully he was still holding the hand of perkins and then after a pause gad i think ill try  try what sir  shes a deuced fine woman burst out again the tender solicitor i will go springer tell the fiddlers to strike up  springer scuttled across the room and gave the leader of the band a knowing nod suddenly god save the king ceased and sir roger de coverley began the rival forces eyed each other mr scully accompanied by his friend came forward looking very red and fumbling two large kid gloves  hes going to ask me to dance hissed out lady gorgon with a dreadful intuition and she drew back behind her lord  d it madam then dance with him said the general dont you see that the scoundrel is carrying it all his own way  him and  him and  him all of which dashes the reader may fill up with oaths of such strength as may be requisite  general cried lady gorgon but could say no more scully was before her  madam exclaimed the liberal member for oldborough in a moment like thisi saythat isthat on the present occasionyour ladyshipunaccustomed as i ampooh pshawill your ladyship give me the distinguished honour and pleasure of going down the countrydance with your ladyship  an immense heave of her ladyships ample chest was perceptible yards of blond lace which might be compared to a foam of the sea were agitated at the same moment and by the same mighty emotion the river of diamonds which flowed round her ladyships neck seemed to swell and to shine more than ever the tall plumes on her ambrosial head bowed down beneath the storm in other words lady gorgon in a furious rage which she was compelled to restrain trembled drew up and bowing majestically said  sir i shall have much pleasure with this she extended her hand scully trembling thrust forward one of his huge kidgloves and led her to the head of the countrydance john perkinswho i presume had been drinking pretty freely so as to have forgotten his ordinary bashfulnesslooked at the three gorgons in blue then at the pretty smiling one in white and stepping up to her without the smallest hesitation asked her if she would dance with him  the young lady smilingly agreed the great example of scully and lady gorgon was followed by all dancing men and women political enmities were forgotten whig voters invited tory voters wives to the dance the daughters of reform accepted the hands of the sons of conservatism the reconciliation of the romans and sabines was not more touching than this sweet fusion whackwhack springer clapped his hands and the fiddlers adroitly obeying the cheerful signal began playing sir roger de coverley louder than ever  i do not know by what extraordinary charm nescio qua praeter solitum etc but young perkins who all his life had hated countrydances was delighted with this one and skipped and laughed poussetting crossing downthemiddling with his merry little partner till every one of the bettermost sort of the thirtynine couples had dropped panting away and till the youngest miss gorgon coming up to his partner said in a loud hissing scornful whisper lucy mamma thinks you have danced quite enough with thisthis person and lucy blushing starting back and looking at perkins in a very melancholy way made him a little curtsey and went off to the gorgonian party with her cousin perkins was too frightened to lead her back to her placetoo frightened at first and then too angry person said he his soul swelled with a desperate republicanism he went back to his patron more of a radical than ever  he found that gentleman in the solitary tearoom pacing up and down before the observant landlady and handmaidens of the gorgon arms wiping his brows gnawing his fingershis ears looming over his stiff white shirtcollar as red as fire once more the great man seized john perkinss hand as the latter came up  d the aristocrats roared the exfollower of squaretoes  and so say i but whats the matter sir  whats the matterwhy that womanthat infernal haughty straitlaced coldblooded brewers daughter i loved that woman siri kissed that woman sir twenty years ago we were all but engaged sir weve walked for hours and hours sirus and the governessive got a lock of her hair sir among my papers now and tonight would you believe itas soon as she got to the bottom of the set away she wentnot one word would she speak to me all the way down and when i wanted to lead her to her place and asked her if she would have a glass of negus sir says she i have done my duty i bear no malice but i consider you a traitor to sir george gorgons familya traitor and an upstart i consider your speaking to me as a piece of insolent vulgarity and beg you will leave me to myself theres her speech sir twenty people heard it and all of her tory set too ill tell you what jack at the next election ill put you up oh that woman that womanand to think that i love her still here mr scully paused and fiercely consoled himself by swallowing three cups of mrs rincers green tea  the fact is that lady gorgons passion had completely got the better of her reason her ladyship was naturally cold and artificially extremely squeamish and when this great redfaced enemy of hers looked tenderly at her through his red little eyes and squeezed her hand and attempted to renew old acquaintance she felt such an intolerable disgust at his triumph at his familiarity and at the remembrance of her own former liking for him that she gave utterance to the speech above correctly reported the tories were delighted with her spirit and cornet fitch with much glee told the story to the general but that officer who was at whist with some of his friends flung down his cards and coming up to his lady said briefly  madam you are a fool  i will not stay here to be bearded by that disgusting manmr fitch call my peoplehenrietta bring miss lucy from that linendraper with whom she is dancing i will not stay general once for all  henrietta ranshe hated her cousin cornet fitch was departing stop fitch said sir george seizing him by the arm you are a fool lady gorgon said he and i repeat ita  fool this fellow scully is carrying all before him he has talked with everybody laughed with everybodyand you with your infernal airsa brewers daughter by  must sit like a queen and not speak to a soul youve lost me one seat of my borough with your infernal pridefifteen hundred a year by joveand you think you will bully me out of another no madam you shall stay and stay supper tooand the girls shall dance with every cursed chimneysweep and butcher in the room they shallconfound me  her ladyship saw that it was necessary to submit and mr springer the master of the ceremonies was called and requested to point out some eligible partners for the young ladies one went off with a whig auctioneer another figured in a quadrille with a very liberal apothecary and the third miss henrietta remained  hallo you sir roared the little general to john perkins who was passing by john turned round and faced him  you were dancing with my niece just nowshow us your skill now and dance with one of my daughters stand up miss henrietta gorgonmr whatsyourname  my name said john with marked and majestic emphasis is perkins and he looked towards lucy who dared not look again  miss gorgonmr perkins there now go and dance  mr perkins regrets madam said john making a bow to miss henrietta that he is not able to dance this evening i am this moment obliged to look to the supper but you will find no doubt some other person who will have much pleasure  go to  sir screamed the general starting up and shaking his cane  calm yourself dearest george said lady gorgon clinging fondly to him fitch twiddled his moustaches miss henrietta gorgon stared with open mouth the silks of the surrounding dowagers rustledthe countenances of all looked grave  i will follow you sir wherever you please and you may hear of me whenever you like said mr perkins bowing and retiring he heard little lucy sobbing in a corner he was lost at oncelost in love he felt as if he could combat fifty generals he never was so happy in his life  the supper came but as that meal cost five shillings a head general gorgon dismissed the four spinsters of his family homewards in the carriage and so saved himself a pound this added to jack perkinss wrath he had hoped to have seen miss lucy once more he was a steward and in the generals teeth would have done his duty he was thinking how he would have helped her to the most delicate chickenwings and blancmanges how he would have made her take champagne under the noses of indignant aunt and uncle what glorious fun it would have been  out of place as mr scullys present was and though lady gorgon and her party sneered at the vulgar notion of venison and turtle for supper all the world at oldborough ate very greedily of those two substantial dishes and the mayors wife became from that day forth a mortal enemy of the gorgons for sitting near her ladyship who refused the proffered soup and meat the mayoress thought herself obliged to follow this disagreeable example she sent away the plate of turtle with a sigh saying however to the baronets lady i thought mem that the lord mayor of london always had turtle to his supper  and what if he didnt biddy said his honour the mayor a good things a good thing and here goes wherewith he plunged his spoon into the savoury mess the mayoress as we have said dared not but she hated lady gorgon and remembered it at the next election  the pride in fact and insolence of the gorgon party rendered every person in the room hostile to them so soon as gorged with meat they began to find that courage which britons invariably derive from their victuals the show of the gorgon plate seemed to offend the people the gorgon champagne was a long time too in making its appearance arrive however it did the people were waiting for it the young ladies not accustomed to that drink declined pledging their admirers until it was produced the men too despised the bucellas and sherry and were looking continually towards the door at last mr rincer the landlord mr hock sir georges butler and sundry others entered the room bang went the corksfizz the foamy liquor sparkled into all sorts of glasses that were held out for its reception mr hock helped sir george and his party who drank with great gusto the wine which was administered to the persons immediately around mr scully was likewise pronounced to be good but mr perkins who had taken his seat among the humbler individuals and in the very middle of the table observed that all these persons after drinking made to each other very wry and ominous faces and whispered much he tasted his wine it was a villanous compound of sugar vitriol sodawater and green gooseberries at this moment a great clatter of forks was made by the presidents and vicepresidents party silence for a toasttwas silence all  landlord said mr perkins starting up the rogue where did his impudence come from have you any champagne of your own  silence down roared the tories the ladies looking aghast silence sit down you shrieked the wellknown voice of the general  i beg your pardon general said young john perkins but where could you have bought this champagne my worthy friend i know is going to propose the ladies let us at any rate drink such a toast in good wine hear hear drink her ladyships health in this stuff i declare to goodness i would sooner drink it in beer  no pen can describe the uproar which arose the anguish of the gorgonitesthe shrieks jeers cheers ironic cries of swipes etc which proceeded from the less genteel but more enthusiastic scullyites  this vulgarity is too much said lady gorgon rising and mrs mayoress and the ladies of the party did so too  the general two squires the clergyman the gorgon apothecary and attorney with their respective ladies followed her they were plainly beaten from the field such of the tories as dared remained and in inglorious compromise shared the jovial whig feast  gentlemen and ladies hiccupped mr heeltap ill give you a toast champagne to our realhicfriends no real champagne to our friends andhicpooh champagne to our friends and real pain to our enemieshuzzay  the scully faction on this day bore the victory away and if the polite reader has been shocked by certain vulgarities on the part of mr scully and his friends he must remember imprimis that oldborough was an inconsiderable placethat the inhabitants thereof were chiefly tradespeople not of refined habitsthat mr scully himself had only for three months mingled among the aristocracythat his young friend perkins was violently angryand finally and to conclude that the proud vulgarity of the great sir george gorgon and his family was infinitely more odious and contemptible than the mean vulgarity of the scullyites and their leader  immediately after this event mr scully and his young friend perkins returned to town the latter to his garrets in bedford rowthe former to his apartments on the first floor of the same house he lived here to superintend his legal business his london agents messrs higgs biggs and blatherwick occupying the ground floor the junior partner mr gustavus blatherwick the second flat of the house scully made no secret of his profession or residence he was an attorney and proud of it he was the grandson of a labourer and thanked god for it he had made his fortune by his own honest labour and why should he be ashamed of it  and now having explained at full length who the several heroes and heroines of this history were and how they conducted themselves in the country let us describe their behaviour in london and the great events which occurred there  you must know that mr perkins bore away the tenderest recollections of the young lady with whom he had danced at the oldborough ball and having taken particular care to find out where she dwelt when in the metropolis managed soon to become acquainted with aunt biggs and made himself so amiable to that lady that she begged he would pass all his disengaged evenings at her lodgings in caroline place mrs biggs was perfectly aware that the young gentleman did not come for her bohea and muffins so much as for the sweeter conversation of her niece miss gorgon but seeing that these two young people were of an age when ideas of love and marriage will spring up do what you will seeing that her niece had a fortune and mr perkins had the prospect of a place and was moreover a very amiable and welldisposed young fellow she thought her niece could not do better than marry him and miss gorgon thought so too now the public will be able to understand the meaning of that important conversation which is recorded at the very commencement of this history  lady gorgon and her family were likewise in town but when in the metropolis they never took notice of their relative miss lucy the idea of acknowledging an exschoolmistress living in mecklenburgh square being much too preposterous for a person of my lady gorgons breeding and fashion she did not therefore know of the progress which sly perkins was making all this while for lucy gorgon did not think it was at all necessary to inform her ladyship how deeply she was smitten by the wicked young gentleman who had made all the disturbance at the oldborough ball  the intimacy of these young persons had in fact become so close that on a certain sunshiny sunday in december after having accompanied aunt biggs to church they had pursued their walk as far as that rendezvous of lovers the regents park and were talking of their coming marriage with much confidential tenderness before the bears in the zoological gardens  miss lucy was ever and anon feeding those interesting animals with buns to perform which act of charity she had clambered up on the parapet which surrounds their den mr perkins was below and miss lucy having distributed her buns was on the point of followingbut whether from timidity or whether from a desire to do young perkins an essential service i know not however she found herself quite unwilling to jump down unaided  my dearest john said she i never can jump that  whereupon john stepped up put one hand round lucys waist and as one of hers gently fell upon his shoulder mr perkins took the other and said  now jump  hoop jump she did and so excessively active and clever was mr john perkins that he jumped miss lucy plump into the middle of a group formed of  lady gorgon  the misses gorgon  master george augustus frederick grimsby gorgon  and a footman poodle and french governess who had all been for two or three minutes listening to the billings and cooings of these imprudent young lovers    chapter ii   shows how the plot began to thicken in or about bedford row  miss lucy  upon my word  im hanged if it arent lucy how do lucy uttered lady the misses and master gorgon in a breath  lucy came forward bending down her ambrosial curls and blushing as a modest young woman should for in truth the scrape was very awkward and as for john perkins he made a start and then a step forwards and then two backwards and then began laying hands upon his black satin stockin short the sun did not shine at that moment upon a man who looked so exquisitely foolish  miss lucy gorgon is your auntis mrs briggs here said lady gorgon drawing herself up with much state  mrs biggs aunt said lucy demurely  biggs or briggs madam it is not of the slightest consequence i presume that persons in my rank of life are not expected to know everybodys name in magdeburg square lady gorgon had a house in baker street and a dismal house it was not here continued she rightly interpreting lucys silence not hereand may i ask how long is it that young ladies have been allowed to walk abroad without chaperons and toto take a part in such scenes as that which we have just seen acted  to this questionand indeed it was rather difficult to answermiss gorgon had no reply there were the six grey eyes of her cousins glowering at her there was george augustus frederick examining her with an air of extreme wonder mademoiselle the governess turning her looks demurely away and awful lady gorgon glancing fiercely at her in front not mentioning the footman and poodle what could a poor modest timid girl plead before such an inquisition especially when she was clearly guilty add to this that as lady gorgon that majestic woman always remarkable for her size and insolence of demeanour had planted herself in the middle of the path and spoke at the extreme pitch of her voice many persons walking in the neighbourhood had heard her ladyships speech and stopped and seemed disposed to await the rejoinder  for heavens sake aunt dont draw a crowd around us said lucy who indeed was glad of the only escape that lay in her power i will tell you of theof the circumstances ofof my engagement with this gentlemanwith mr perkins added she in a softer toneso soft that the erkins was quite inaudible  a mr what an engagement without consulting your guardians screamed her ladyship this must be looked to jerningham call round my carriage mademoiselle you will have the goodness to walk home with master gorgon and carry him if you please where there is wet and girls as the day is fine you will do likewise jerningham you will attend the young ladies miss gorgon i will thank you to follow me immediately and so saying and looking at the crowd with ineffable scorn and at mr perkins not at all the lady bustled away forwards the files of gorgon daughters and governess closing round and enveloping poor lucy who found herself carried forward against her will and in a minute seated in her aunts coach along with that tremendous person  her case was bad enough but what was it to perkinss fancy his blank surprise and rage at having his love thus suddenly ravished from him and his delicious teteatete interrupted he managed in an inconceivably short space of time to conjure up halfamillion obstacles to his union what should he do he would rush on to baker street and wait there until his lucy left lady gorgons house  he could find no vehicle in the regents park and was in consequence obliged to make his journey on foot of course he nearly killed himself with running and ran so quick that he was just in time to see the two ladies step out of lady gorgons carriage at her own house and to hear jerninghams fellowfootman roar to the gorgonian coachman halfpast seven at which hour we are to this day convinced that lady gorgon was going out to dine mr jerninghams associate having banged to the door with an insolent look towards perkins who was prying in with the most suspicious and indecent curiosity retired exclaiming that chap has a hi to our greatcoats i reckon and left john perkins to pace the street and be miserable  john perkins then walked resolutely up and down dismal baker street determined on an eclaircissement he was for some time occupied in thinking how it was that the gorgons were not at church they who made such a parade of piety and john perkins smiled as he passed the chapel and saw that two charity sermons were to be preached that dayand therefore it was that general gorgon read prayers to his family at home in the morning  perkins at last saw that little general in blue frockcoat and spotless buff gloves saunter scowling home and half an hour before his arrival had witnessed the entrance of jerningham and the three gaunt miss gorgons poodle sonandheir and french governess protected by him into sir georges mansion  can she be going to stay all night mused poor john after being on the watch for three hours when presently to his inexpressible delight he saw a very dirty hackneycoach clatter up to the gorgon door out of which first issued the ruby plush breeches and stalwart calves of mr jerningham these were followed by his body and then the gentleman ringing modestly was admitted  again the door opened a lady came out nor was she followed by the footman who crossed his legs at the doorpost and allowed her to mount the jingling vehicle as best she might mr jerningham had witnessed the scene in the park gardens had listened to the altercation through the library keyhole and had been mighty sulky at being ordered to call a coach for this young woman he did not therefore deign to assist her to mount  but there was one who did perkins was by the side of his lucy he had seen her start back and cry la johnhad felt her squeeze his armhad mounted with her into the coach and then shouted with a voice of thunder to the coachman caroline place mecklenburgh square  but mr jerningham would have been much more surprised and puzzled if he had waited one minute longer and seen this mr perkins who had so gallantly escaladed the hackneycoach step out of it with the most mortified miserable chapfallen countenance possible  the fact is he had found poor lucy sobbing fit to break her heart and instead of consoling her as he expected he only seemed to irritate her further for she said mr perkinsi begi insist that you leave the carriage and when perkins made some movement which not being in the vehicle at the time we have never been able to comprehend she suddenly sprang from the backseat and began pulling at a large piece of cord which communicated with the wrist of the gentleman driving and screaming to him at the top of her voice bade him immediately stop  this mr coachman did with a curious puzzled grinning air  perkins descended and on being asked vere ham i to drive the young oman sir i am sorry to say muttered something like an oath and uttered the abovementioned words caroline place mecklenburgh square in a tone which i should be inclined to describe as both dogged and sheepishvery different from that cheery voice which he had used when he first gave the order  poor lucy in the course of those fatal three hours which had passed while mr perkins was pacing up and down baker street had received a lecture which lasted exactly one hundred and eighty minutesfrom her aunt first then from her uncle whom we have seen marching homewards and often from both together  sir george gorgon and his lady poured out such a flood of advice and abuse against the poor girl that she came away from the interview quite timid and cowering and when she saw john perkins the sly rogue how well he thought he had managed the trick she shrank from him as if he had been a demon of wickedness ordered him out of the carriage and went home by herself convinced that she had committed some tremendous sin  while then her coach jingled away to caroline place perkins once more alone bent his steps in the same direction a desperate heartstricken man he passed by the beloveds door saw lights in the front drawingroom felt probably that she was there but he could not go in moodily he paced down doughty street and turning abruptly into bedford row rushed into his own chambers where mrs snooks the laundress had prepared his humble sabbath meal  a cheerful fire blazed in his garret and mrs snooks had prepared for him the favourite bladebone he loved blest fourdays dinner for a bachelorroast cold hashed grilled bladebone the fourth being better than the first but although he usually did rejoice in this mealordinarily indeed grumbling that there was not enough to satisfy himhe on this occasion after two mouthfuls flung down his knife and fork and buried his two claws in his hair  snooks said he at last very moodily remove this d mutton give me my writing things and some hot brandyandwater  this was done without much alarm for you must know that perkins used to dabble in poetry and ordinarily prepare himself for composition by this kind of stimulus  he wrote hastily a few lines  snooks put on your bonnet said he and carry thisyou know where he added in a hollow heartbreaking tone of voice that affected poor snooks almost to tears she went however with the note which was to this purpose  lucy lucy my souls lovewhat what has happened i am writing thisa gulp of brandyandwaterin a state bordering on distractionmadnessinsanity another why did you send me out of the coach in that cruel cruel way write to me a word a linetell me tell me i may come to youand leave me not in this agonising condition your faithful glogglogglogthe whole glassjp  he never signed john perkins in fullhe couldnt it was so unromantic  well this missive was despatched by mrs snooks and perkins in a fearful state of excitement haggard wild and with more brandyandwater awaited the return of his messenger  when at length after about an absence of forty years as it seemed to him the old lady returned with a large packet perkins seized it with a trembling hand and was yet more frightened to see the handwriting of mrs or miss biggs  my dear mr perkins she beganalthough i am not your souls adored i performed her part for once since i have read your letter as i told her you need not be very much alarmed although lucy is at this moment in bed and unwell for the poor girl has had a sad scene at her grand uncles house in baker street and came home very much affected rest however will restore her for she is not one of your nervous sort and i hope when you come in the morning you will see her as blooming as she was when you went out today on that unlucky walk  see what sir george gorgon says of us all you wont challenge him i know as he is to be your uncle and so i may show you his letter  goodnight my dear john do not go quite distracted before morning and believe me your loving aunt                                            jemima biggs                                  41 baker street  11th december  majorgeneral sir george gorgon has heard with the utmost disgust and surprise of the engagement which miss lucy gorgon has thought fit to form  the majorgeneral cannot conceal his indignation at the share which miss biggs has taken in this disgraceful transaction  sir george gorgon puts an absolute veto upon all further communication between his niece and the lowborn adventurer who has been admitted into her society and begs to say that lieutenant fitch of the lifeguards is the gentleman who he intends shall marry miss gorgon  it is the majorgenerals wish that on the 28th miss gorgon should be ready to come to his house in baker street where she will be more safe from impertinent intrusions than she has been in mucklebury square         mrs biggs           caroline place               mecklenburgh square  when poor john perkins read this epistle blank rage and wonder filled his soul at the audacity of the little general who thus without the smallest title in the world pretended to dispose of the hand and fortune of his niece the fact is that sir george had such a transcendent notion of his own dignity and station that it never for a moment entered his head that his niece or anybody else connected with him should take a single step in life without previously receiving his orders and mr fitch a baronets son having expressed an admiration of lucy sir george had determined that his suit should be accepted and really considered lucys preference of another as downright treason  john perkins determined on the death of fitch as the very least reparation that should satisfy him and vowed too that some of the generals blood should be shed for the words which he had dared to utter  we have said that william pitt scully esquire mp occupied the first floor of mr perkinss house in bedford row and the reader is further to be informed that an immense friendship had sprung up between these two gentlemen the fact is that poor john was very much flattered by scullys notice and began in a very short time to fancy himself a political personage for he had made several of scullys speeches written more than one letter from him to his constituents and in a word acted as his gratis clerk at least a guinea a week did mr perkins save to the pockets of mr scully and with hearty good will too for he adored the great william pitt and believed every word that dropped from the pompous lips of that gentleman  well after having discussed sir george gorgons letter poor perkins in the utmost fury of mind that his darling should be slandered so feeling a desire for fresh air determined to descend to the garden and smoke a cigar in that rural quiet spot the night was very calm the moonbeams slept softly upon the herbage of grays inn gardens and bathed with silver splendour theobalds row a million of little frisky twinkling stars attended their queen who looked with bland round face upon their gambols as they peeped in and out from the azure heavens along grays inn wall a lazy row of cabs stood listlessly for who would call a cab on such a night meanwhile their drivers at the alehouse near smoked the short pipe or quaffed the foaming beer perhaps from grays inn lane some broken sounds of irish revelry might rise issuing perhaps from raymond buildings gate six lawyers clerks might whoop a tipsy songor the loud watchman yell the passing hour but beyond this all was silence and young perkins as he sat in the summerhouse at the bottom of the garden and contemplated the peaceful heaven felt some influences of it entering into his soul and almost forgetting revenge thought but of peace and love  presently he was aware there was someone else pacing the garden who could it benot blatherwick for he passed the sabbath with his grandmamma at clapham not scully surely for he always went to bethesda chapel and to a select prayermeeting afterwards alas it was scully for though that gentleman said that he went to chapel we have it for a fact that he did not always keep his promise and was at this moment employed in rehearsing an extempore speech which he proposed to deliver at st stephens  had i sir spouted he with folded arms slowly pacing to and frohad i sir entertained the smallest possible intention of addressing the house on the present occasionhum on the present occasioni would have endeavoured to prepare myself in a way that should have at least shown my sense of the greatness of the subject before the houses consideration and the nature of the distinguished audience i have the honour to address i am sir a plain manborn of the peoplemyself one of the people having won thank heaven an honourable fortune and position by my own honest labour and standing here as i do                                            here mr scully it may be said that he never made a speech without bragging about himself and an excellent plan it is for people cannot help believing you at lasthere i say mr scully who had one arm raised felt himself suddenly tipped on the shoulder and heard a voice saying your money or your life  the honourable gentleman twirled round as if he had been shot the papers on which a great part of this impromptu was written dropped from his lifted hand and some of them were actually borne on the air into neighbouring gardens the man was in fact in the direst fright  its only i said perkins with rather a forced laugh when he saw the effect that his wit had produced  only you and pray what the devwhat right have you toto come upon a man of my rank in that way and disturb me in the midst of very important meditations asked mr scully beginning to grow fierce  i want your advice said perkins on a matter of the very greatest importance to me you know my idea of marrying  marry said scully i thought you had given up that silly scheme and how pray do you intend to live  why my intended has a couple of hundreds a year and my clerkship in the tape and sealingwax office will be as much more  clerkshiptape and sealingwax officegovernment sinecurewhy good heavens john perkins you dont tell me that you are going to accept any such thing  it is a very small salary certainly said john who had a decent notion of his own merits but consider six months vacation two hours in the day and those spent over the newspapers after all its  after all its a swindle roared out mr scullya swindle upon the country an infamous tax upon the people who starve that you may fatten in idleness but take this clerkship in the tape and sealingwax office continued the patriot his bosom heaving with noble indignation and his eye flashing the purest firetake this clerkship john perkins and sanction tyranny by becoming one of its agents sanction dishonesty by sharing in its plunderdo this but never more be friend of mine had i a child said the patriot clasping his hands and raising his eyes to heaven i would rather see him dead sirdead dead at my feet than the servant of a government which all honest men despise and here giving a searching glance at perkins mr scully began tramping up and down the garden in a perfect fury  good heavens exclaimed the timid john perkinsdont say so my dear mr scully im not the dishonest character you suppose me to bei never looked at the matter in this light illill consider of it ill tell crampton that i will give up the place but for heavens sake dont let me forfeit your friendship which is dearer to me than any place in the world  mr scully pressed his hand and said nothing and though their interview lasted a full halfhour longer during which they paced up and down the gravel walk we shall not breathe a single syllable of their conversation as it has nothing to do with our tale  the next morning after an interview with miss lucy john perkins esquire was seen to issue from mrs biggss house looking particularly pale melancholy and thoughtful and he did not stop until he reached a certain door in downing street where was the office of a certain great minister and the offices of the clerks in his lordships department  the head of them was mr josiah crampton who has now to be introduced to the public he was a little old gentleman some sixty years of age maternal uncle to john perkins a bachelor who had been about fortytwo years employed in the department of which he was now the head  after waiting four hours in an anteroom where a number of irishmen some newspaper editors many pompouslooking political personages asking for the first lord a few sauntering clerks and numbers of swift active messengers passed to and froafter waiting for four hours making drawings on the blottingbook and reading the morning post for that day week mr perkins was informed that he might go into his uncles room and did so accordingly  he found a little hard old gentleman seated at a table covered with every variety of sealingwax blottingpaper envelopes despatchboxes green tapers etc etc an immense fire was blazing in the grate an immense sheetalmanack hung over that a screen three or four chairs and a faded turkey carpet formed the rest of the furniture of this remarkable roomwhich i have described thus particularly because in the course of a long official life i have remarked that such is the invariable decoration of political rooms  well john said the little hard old gentleman pointing to an armchair im told youve been here since eleven why the deuce do you come so early  i had important business answered mr perkins stoutly and as his uncle looked up with a comical expression of wonder john began in a solemn tone to deliver a little speech which he had composed and which proved him to be a very worthy easy silly fellow  sir said mr perkins you have known for some time past the nature of my political opinions and the intimacy which i have had the honour to form with onewith some of the leading members of the liberal party a grin from mr crampton when first by your kindness i was promised the clerkship in the tape and sealingwax office my opinions were not formed as they are now and having taken the advice of the gentlemen with whom i actan enormous grinthe advice i say of the gentlemen with whom i act and the counsel likewise of my own conscience i am compelled with the deepest grief to say my dear uncle that ii  that youwhat sir exclaimed little mr crampton bouncing off his chair you dont mean to say that you are such a fool as to decline the place  i do decline the place said perkins whose blood rose at the word fool as a man of honour i cannot take it  not take it and how are you to live on the rent of that house of yours for by gad sir if you give up the clerkship i never will give you a shilling  it cannot be helped said mr perkins looking as much like a martyr as he possibly could and thinking himself a very fine fellow i have talents sir which i hope to cultivate and am member of a profession by which a man may hope to rise to the very highest offices of the state  profession talents offices of the state are you mad john perkins that you come to me with such insufferable twaddle as this why do you think if you had been capable of rising at the bar i would have taken so much trouble about getting you a place no sir you are too fond of pleasure and bed and teaparties and smalltalk and reading novels and playing the flute and writing sonnets you would no more rise at the bar than my messenger sir it was because i knew your dispositionthat hopeless careless irresolute goodhumour of yoursthat i had determined to keep you out of danger by placing you in a snug shelter where the storms of the world would not come near you you must have principles forsooth and you must marry miss gorgon of course and by the time you have gone ten circuits and had six children you will have eaten up every shilling of your wifes fortune and be as briefless as you are now who the deuce has put all this nonsense into your head i think i know  mr perkinss ears tingled as these hard words saluted them and he scarcely knew whether he ought to knock his uncle down or fall at his feet and say uncle i have been a fool and i know it the fact is that in his interview with miss gorgon and her aunt in the morning when he came to tell them of the resolution he had formed to give up the place both the ladies and john himself had agreed with a thousand rapturous tears and exclamations that he was one of the noblest young men that ever lived had acted as became himself and might with perfect propriety give up the place his talents being so prodigious that no power on earth could hinder him from being lord chancellor indeed john and lucy had always thought the clerkship quite beneath him and were not a little glad perhaps at finding a pretext for decently refusing it but as perkins was a young gentleman whose candour was such that he was always swayed by the opinions of the last speaker he did begin to feel now the truth of his uncles statements however disagreeable they might be  mr crampton continued  i think i know the cause of your patriotism has not william pitt scully esquire had something to do with it  mr perkins could not turn any redder than he was but confessed with deep humiliation that he had consulted mr scully among other friends  mr crampton smileddrew a letter from a heap before him and tearing off the signature handed over the document to his nephew it contained the following paragraphs  hawksby has sounded scully we can have him any day we want him he talks very big at present and says he would not take anything under a this is absurd he has a yorkshire nephew coming up to town and wants a place for him there is one vacant in the tape office he says have you not a promise of it  i canti cant believe it said john this sir is some weak invention of the enemy scully is the most honourable man breathing  mr scully is a gentleman in a very fair way to make a fortune answered mr crampton look you johnit is just as well for your sake that i should give you the news a few weeks before the papers for i dont want you to be ruined if i can help it as i dont wish to have you on my hands we know all the particulars of scullys history he was a tory attorney at oldborough he was jilted by the present lady gorgon turned radical and fought sir george in his own borough sir george would have had the peerage he is dying for had he not lost that second seat bytheby my lady will be here in five minutes and scully is now quite firm there well my dear lad we have bought your incorruptible scully look hereand mr crampton produced three morning posts  the honourable henry hawksbys dinnerpartylord soandsoduke of soandsow pitt scully esq mp  hawksby is our neutral our dinnergiver  lady diana doldrums routw pitt scully esq again  the earl of mantraps grand dinnera dukefour lordsmr scully and sir george gorgon  well but i dont see how you have bought him look at his votes  my dear john said mr crampton jingling his watchseals very complacently i am letting you into fearful secrets the great common end of party is to buy your opponentsthe great statesman buys them for nothing  here the attendant genius of mr crampton made his appearance and whispered something to which the little gentleman said show her ladyship inwhen the attendant disappeared  john said mr crampton with a very queer smile you cant stay in this room while lady gorgon is with me but there is a little clerks room behind the screen there where you can wait until i call you  john retired and as he closed the door of communication strange to say little mr crampton sprang up and said confound the young ninny he has shut the door  mr crampton then remembering that he wanted a map in the next room sprang into it left the door half open in coming out and was in time to receive her ladyship with smiling face as she ushered by mr strongitharm majestically sailed in    chapter iii   behind the scenes  in issuing from and leaving open the door of the inner room mr crampton had bestowed upon mr perkins a look so peculiarly arch that even he simple as he was began to imagine that some mystery was about to be cleared up or some mighty matter to be discussed presently he heard the wellknown voice of lady gorgon in conversation with his uncle what could their talk be about mr perkins was dying to know andshall we say itadvanced to the door on tiptoe and listened with all his might  her ladyship that juno of a woman if she had not borrowed venuss girdle to render herself irresistible at least had adopted a tender coaxing wheedling frisky tone quite different from her ordinary dignified style of conversation she called mr crampton a naughty man for neglecting his old friends vowed that sir george was quite hurt at his not coming to dinenor fixing a day when he would comeand added with a most engaging ogle that she had three fine girls at home who would perhaps make an evening pass pleasantly even to such a gay bachelor as mr crampton  madam said he with much gravity the daughters of such a mother must be charming but i who have seen your ladyship am alas proof against even them  both parties here heaved tremendous sighs and affected to be wonderfully unhappy about something  i wish after a pause said lady gorgoni wish dear mr crampton you would not use that odious title my ladyship you know it always makes me melancholy  melancholy my dear lady gorgon and why  because it makes me think of another title that ought to have been mineours i speak for dear sir georges and my darling boys sake heaven knows not mine what a sad disappointment it has been to my husband that after all his services all the promises he has had they have never given him his peerage as for me you know  for you my dear madam i know quite well that you care for no such bauble as a coronet except in so far as it may confer honour upon those most dear to youexcellent wife and noble mother as you are heigho what a happy man is sir george  here there was another pause and if mr perkins could have seen what was taking place behind the screen he would have beheld little mr crampton looking into lady gorgons face with as lovesick a romeogaze as he could possibly counterfeit while her ladyship blushing somewhat and turning her own grey gogglers up to heaven received all his words for gospel and sat fancying herself to be the best most meritorious and most beautiful creature in the three kingdoms  you men are terrible flatterers continued she but you say right for myself i value not these empty distinctions i am growing old mr cramptonyes indeed i am although you smile so incredulouslyand let me add that my thoughts are fixed upon higher things than earthly crowns but tell me you who are all in all with lord bagwig are we never to have our peerage his majesty i know is not averse the services of dear sir george to a member of his majestys august family i know have been appreciated in the highest quarter ever since the peace we have had a promise four hundred pounds has sir george spent at the heralds office i myself am of one of the most ancient families in the kingdom mr crampton and the poor dear mans health is really ruined by the anxious sickening feeling of hope so long delayed  mr crampton now assumed an air of much solemnity  my dear lady gorgon said he will you let me be frank with you and will you promise solemnly that what i am going to tell you shall never be repeated to a single soul  lady gorgon promised  well then since the truth you must know you yourselves have been in part the cause of the delay of which you complain you gave us two votes five years ago you now only give us one if sir george were to go up to the peers we should lose even that one vote and would it be common sense in us to incur such a loss mr scully the liberal would return another member of his own way of thinking and as for the lords we have you know a majority there  oh that horrid man said lady gorgon cursing mr scully in her heart and beginning to play a rapid tattoo with her feet that miscreant that traitor thatthat attorney has been our ruin  horrid man if you please but give me leave to tell you that the horrid man is not the sole cause of your ruinif ruin you will call it i am sorry to say that i do candidly think ministers believe that sir george gorgon has lost his influence in oldborough as much through his own fault as through mr scullys cleverness  our own fault good heavens have we not done everythingeverything that persons of our station in the county could do to keep those misguided men have we not remonstrated threatened taken away our custom from the mayor established a conservative apothecaryin fact done all that gentlemen could do but these are such times mr crampton the spirit of revolution is abroad and the great families of england are menaced by democratic insolence  this was sir george gorgons speech always after dinner and was delivered by his lady with a great deal of stateliness somewhat perhaps to her annoyance mr crampton only smiled shook his head and said  nonsense my dear lady gorgonpardon the phrase but i am a plain old man and call things by their names now will you let me whisper in your ear one word of truth you have tried all sorts of remonstrances and exerted yourself to maintain your influence in every way except the right one and that is  what in heavens name  conciliation we know your situation in the borough mr scullys whole history and pardon me for saying so but we men in office know everything yours  lady gorgons ears and cheeks now assumed the hottest hue of crimson she thought of her former passages with scully and of the days whenbut never mind when for she suffered her veil to fall and buried her head in the folds of her handkerchief vain folds the wily little mr crampton could see all that passed behind the cambric and continued  yes madam we know the absurd hopes that were formed by a certain attorney twenty years since we know how up to this moment he boasts of certain walks  with the governesswe were always with the governess shrieked out lady gorgon clasping her hands she was not the wisest of women  with the governess of course said mr crampton firmly do you suppose that any man dare breathe a syllable against your spotless reputation never my dear madam but what i would urge is thisyou have treated your disappointed admirer too cruelly  what the traitor who has robbed us of our rights  he never would have robbed you of your rights if you had been more kind to him you should be gentle madam you should forgive himyou should be friends with him  with a traitor never  think what made him a traitor lady gorgon look in your glass and say if there be not some excuse for him think of the feelings of the man who saw beauty such as yoursi am a plain man and must speakvirtue such as yours in the possession of a rival by heavens madam i think he was right to hate sir george gorgon would you have him allow such a prize to be ravished from him without a pang on his part  he was i believe very much attached to me said lady gorgon quite delighted but you must be aware that a young man of his station in life could not look up to a person of my rank  surely not it was monstrous pride and arrogance in mr scully but que voulezvous such is the worlds way scully could not help loving youwho that knows you can i am a plain man and say what i think he loves you still why make an enemy of him who would at a word be at your feet dearest lady gorgon listen to me sir george gorgon and mr scully have already mettheir meeting was our contrivance it is for our interest for yours that they should be friends if there were two ministerial members for oldborough do you think your husbands peerage would be less secure i am not at liberty to tell you all i know on this subject but do i entreat you be reconciled to him  and after a little more conversation which was carried on by mr crampton in the same tender way this important interview closed and lady gorgon folding her shawl round her threaded certain mysterious passages and found her way to her carriage in whitehall  i hope you have not been listening you rogue said mr crampton to his nephew who blushed most absurdly by way of answer you would have heard great state secrets if you had dared to do so that woman is perpetually here and if peerages are to be had for the asking she ought to have been a duchess by this time i would not have admitted her but for a reason that i have go you now and ponder upon what you have heard and seen be on good terms with scully and above all speak not a word concerning our interviewno not a word even to your mistress by the way i presume sir you will recall your resignation  the bewildered perkins was about to stammer out a speech when his uncle cutting it short pushed him gently out of the door                                            at the period when the important events occurred which have been recorded here parties ran very high and a mighty struggle for the vacant speakership was about to come on the right honourable robert pincher was the ministerial candidate and sir charles macabaw was patronised by the opposition the two members for oldborough of course took different sides the baronet being of the pincher faction while mr william pitt scully strongly supported the macabaw party  it was mr scullys intention to deliver an impromptu speech upon the occasion of the election and he and his faithful perkins prepared it between them for the latter gentleman had wisely kept his uncles counsel and his own and mr scully was quite ignorant of the conspiracy that was brooding indeed so artfully had that young machiavel of a perkins conducted himself that when asked by his patron whether he had given up his place in the tape and sealing wax office he replied that he had tendered his resignation but did not say one word about having recalled it  you were right my boy quite right said mr scully a man of uncompromising principles should make no compromise and herewith he sat down and wrote off a couple of letters one to mr hawksby telling him that the place in the sealingwax office was as he had reason to know vacant and the other to his nephew stating that it was to be his under the rose my dear bob added mr scully it will cost you five hundred pounds but you cannot invest your money better  it is needless to state that the affair was to be conducted with the strictest secresy and honour and that the money was to pass through mr scullys hands  while however the great pincher and macabaw question was yet undecided an event occurred to mr scully which had a great influence upon his afterlife a second grand banquet was given at the earl of mantraps lady mantrap requested him to conduct lady gorgon to dinner and the latter with a charming timidity and a gracious melancholy look into his face after which her veined eyelids veiled her azure eyes put her hand into the trembling one of mr scully and said as much as looks could say forgive and forget  down went scully to dinner there were dukes on his right hand and earls on his left there were but two persons without title in the midst of that glittering assemblage the very servants looked like noblemen the cook had done wonders the wines were cool and rich and lady gorgon was splendid what attention did everybody pay to her and to him why would she go on gazing into his face with that tender imploring look in other words scully after partaking of soup and fish he during their discussion had been thinking over all the former loveandhate passages between himself and lady gorgon turned very red and began talking to her  were you not at the opera on tuesday began he assuming at once the airs of a man of fashion i thought i caught a glimpse of you in the duchess of diddleburys box  opera mr scully pronouncing the word scully with the utmost softness ah no we seldom go and yet too often for serious persons the enchantments of that place are too dangerous i am so nervousso delicate the smallest trifle so agitates depresses or irritates me that i dare not yield myself up to the excitement of music i am too passionately attached to it and shall i tell you it has such a strange influence upon me that the smallest false note almost drives me to distraction and for that very reason i hardly ever go to a concert or a ball  egad thought scully i recollect when she would dance down a matter of fiveandforty couple and jingle away at the battle of prague all day  she continued dont you recollect i do withoh what regretthat day at oldborough raceball when i behaved with such sad rudeness to you you will scarcely believe me and yet i assure you tis the fact the music had made me almost mad do let me ask your pardon for my conduct i was not myself oh mr scully i am no worldly woman i know my duties and i feel my wrongs nights and days have i lain awake weeping and thinking of that unhappy daythat i should ever speak so to an old friend for we were old friends were we not  scully did not speak but his eyes were bursting out of his head and his face was the exact colour of a deputylieutenants uniform  that i should ever forget myself and you so how i have been longing for this opportunity to ask you to forgive me i asked lady mantrap when i heard you were to be here to invite me to her party come i know you will forgive meyour eyes say you will you used to look so in old days and forgive me my caprices then do give me a little winewe will drink to the memory of old days  her eyes filled with tears and poor scullys hand caused such a rattling and trembling of the glass and the decanter that the duke of doldrumwho had been during the course of this whispered sentimentality describing a famous run with the queens hounds at the top of his voicestopped at the jingling of the glass and his tale was lost for ever scully hastily drank his wine and lady gorgon turned round to her next neighbour a little gentleman in black between whom and herself certain conscious looks passed  i am glad poor sir george is not here said he smiling  lady gorgon said pooh for shame the little gentleman was no other than josiah crampton esquire that eminent financier and he was now going through the curious calculation before mentioned by which you buy a man for nothing he intended to pay the very same price for sir george gorgon too but there was no need to tell the baronet so only of this the reader must be made aware  while mr crampton was conducting this intrigue which was to bring a new recruit to the ministerial ranks his mighty spirit condescended to ponder upon subjects of infinitely less importance and to arrange plans for the welfare of his nephew and the young woman to whom he had made a present of his heart these young persons as we said before had arranged to live in mr perkinss own house in bedford row it was of a peculiar construction and might more properly be called a house and a half for a snug little tenement of four chambers protruded from the back of the house into the garden these rooms communicated with the drawingrooms occupied by mr scully and perkins who acted as his friend and secretary used frequently to sit in the one nearest the members study in order that he might be close at hand to confer with that great man the rooms had a private entrance too were newly decorated and in them the young couple proposed to live the kitchen and garrets being theirs likewise what more could they need we are obliged to be particular in describing these apartments for extraordinary events occurred therein  to say the truth until the present period mr crampton had taken no great interest in his nephews marriage or indeed in the young man himself the old gentleman was of a saturnine turn and inclined to undervalue the qualities of mr perkins which were idleness simplicity enthusiasm and easy goodnature  such fellows never do anything in the world he would say and for such he had accordingly the most profound contempt but when after john perkinss repeated entreaties he had been induced to make the acquaintance of miss gorgon he became instantly charmed with her and warmly espoused her cause against her overbearing relations  at his suggestion she wrote back to decline sir george gorgons peremptory invitation and hinted at the same time that she had attained an age and a position which enabled her to be the mistress of her own actions to this letter there came an answer from lady gorgon which we shall not copy but which simply stated that miss lucy gorgons conduct was unchristian ungrateful unladylike and immodest that the gorgon family disowned her for the future and left her at liberty to form whatever base connections she pleased  a pretty world this said mr crampton in a great rage when the letter was shown to him this same fellow scully dissuades my nephew from taking a place because scully wants it for himself this prude of a lady gorgon cries out shame and disowns an innocent amiable girl she a heartless jilt herself once and a heartless flirt now the pharisees the pharisees and to call mine a base family too  now lady gorgon did not in the least know mr cramptons connection with mr perkins or she would have been much more guarded in her language but whether she knew it or not the old gentleman felt a huge indignation and determined to have his revenge  thats right uncle shall i call gorgon out said the impetuous young perkins who was all for blood  john you are a fool said his uncle you shall have a better revenge you shall be married from sir george gorgons house and you shall see mr william pitt scully sold for nothing this to the veteran diplomatist seemed to be the highest triumph which man could possibly enjoy  it was very soon to take place and as has been the case ever since the world began woman lovely woman was to be the cause of scullys fall the tender scene at lord mantraps was followed by many others equally sentimental sir george gorgon called upon his colleague the very next day and brought with him a card from lady gorgon inviting mr scully to dinner the attorney eagerly accepted the invitation was received in baker street by the whole amiable family with much respectful cordiality and was pressed to repeat his visits as country neighbours should more than once did he call and somehow always at the hour when sir george was away at his club or riding in the park or elsewhere engaged sir george gorgon was very old very feeble very much shattered in constitution lady gorgon used to impart her fears to mr scully every time he called there and the sympathising attorney used to console her as best he might sir georges country agent neglected the propertyhis lady consulted mr scully concerning it he knew to a fraction how large her jointure was how she was to have gorgon castle for her life and how in the event of the young baronets death he too was a sickly poor boy the chief part of the estates bought by her money would be at her absolute disposal  what a pity these odious politics prevent me from having you for our agent would lady gorgon say and indeed scully thought it was a pity too ambitious scully what wild notions filled his brain he used to take leave of lady gorgon and ruminate upon these things and when he was gone sir george and her ladyship used to laugh  if we can but commit himif we can but make him vote for pincher said the general my peerage is secure hawksby and crampton as good as told me so  the point had been urged upon mr scully repeatedly and adroitly is not pincher a more experienced man than macabaw would sir george say to his guest over their wine scully allowed it cant you vote for him on personal grounds and say so in the house scully wished he couldhow he wished he could every time the general coughed scully saw his friends desperate situation more and more and thought how pleasant it would be to be lord of gorgon castle knowing my property cried sir george as you do and with your talents and integrity what a comfort it would be could i leave you as guardian to my boy but these cursed politics prevent it my dear fellow why will you be a radical and scully cursed politics too hang the lowbred rogue added sir george when william pitt scully left the house he will do everything but promise  my dear general said lady gorgon sidling up to him and patting him on his old yellow cheekmy dear georgy tell me one thingare you jealous  jealous my dear and jealous of that fellowpshaw  well then give me leave and you shall have the promise tomorrow                                            tomorrow arrived it was a remarkably fine day and in the forenoon mr perkins gave his accustomed knock at scullys study which was only separated from his own sittingroom by a double door john had wisely followed his uncles advice and was on the best terms with the honourable member  here are a few sentences said he which i think may suit your purpose great public servicesundeniable merityears of integritycause of reform and macabaw for ever he put down the paper it was in fact a speech in favour of mr macabaw  hush said scully rather surlily for he was thinking how disagreeable it was to support macabaw and besides there were clerks in the room whom the thoughtless perkins had not at first perceived as soon as that gentleman saw them you are busy i see continued he in a lower tone i came to say that i must be off duty today for i am engaged to take a walk with some ladies of my acquaintance  so saying the lighthearted young man placed his hat unceremoniously on his head and went off through his own door humming a song he was in such high spirits that he did not even think of closing the doors of communication and scully looked after him with a sneer  ladies forsooth thought he i know who they are this precious girl that he is fooling with for one i suppose he was right perkins was off on the wings of love to see miss lucy and she and aunt biggs and uncle crampton had promised this very day to come and look at the apartments which mrs john perkins was to occupy with her happy husband  poor devil so continued mr scullys meditations it is almost too bad to do him out of his place but my bob wants it and johns girl has i hear seven thousand pounds his uncle will get him another place before all that money is spent and herewith mr scully began conning the speech which perkins had made for him  he had not read it more than six timesin truth he was getting it by heartwhen his head clerk came to him from the front room bearing a card a footman had brought it who said his lady was waiting below lady gorgons name was on the card to seize his hat and rush downstairs was with mr scully the work of an infinitesimal portion of time  it was indeed lady gorgon in her gorgonian chariot  mr scully said she popping her head out of window and smiling in a most engaging way i want to speak to you on something very particular indeedand she held him out her hand scully pressed it most tenderly he hoped all heads in bedford row were at the windows to see him i cant ask you into the carriage for you see the governess is with me and i want to talk secrets to you  shall i go and make a little promenade said mademoiselle innocently and her mistress hated her for that speech  no mr scully i am sure will let me come in for five minutes  mr scully was only too happy my lady descended and walked upstairs leaning on the happy solicitors arm but how should he manage the front room was consecrated to clerks there were clerks too as illluck would have it in his private room perkins is out for the day thought scully i will take her into his room and into perkinss room he took heray and he shut the double doors after him too and trembled as he thought of his own happiness  what a charming little study said lady gorgon seating herself and indeed it was very pretty for perkins had furnished it beautifully and laid out a neat tray with cakes a cold fowl and sherry to entertain his party withal and do you bachelors always live so well continued she pointing to the little cold collation  mr scully looked rather blank when he saw it and a dreadful suspicion crossed his soul but there was no need to trouble lady gorgon with explanations therefore at once and with much presence of mind he asked her to partake of his bachelors fare she would refuse mr scully nothing that day a pretty sight would it have been for young perkins to see strangers so unceremoniously devouring his feast she drankmr scully drankand so emboldened was he by the draught that he actually seated himself by the side of lady gorgon on john perkinss new sofa  her ladyship had of course something to say to him she was a pious woman and had suddenly conceived a violent wish for building a chapel of ease at oldborough to which she entreated him to subscribe she enlarged upon the benefits that the town would derive from it spoke of sundayschools sweet spiritual instruction and the duty of all wellminded persons to give aid to the scheme  i will subscribe a hundred pounds said scully at the end of her ladyships harangue would i not do anything for you  thank you thank you dear mr scully said the enthusiastic woman how the dear went burning through his soul ah added she if you would but do anything for meif you who are so eminently so truly distinguished in a religious point of view would but see the truth in politics too and if i could see your name among those of the true patriot party in this empire how blestoh how blest should i be poor sir george often says he should go to his grave happy could he but see you the guardian of his boy and i your old friend for we were friends william how have i wept to think of you as one of those who are bringing our monarchy to ruin do do promise me this too and she took his hand and pressed it between hers  the heart of william pitt scully during this speech was thumping up and down with a frightful velocity and strength his old love the agency of the gorgon propertythe dear widowfive thousand a year cleara thousand delicious hopes rushed madly through his brain and almost took away his reason and there she satshe the loved one pressing his hand and looking softly into his eyes  down down he plumped on his knees  juliana shrieked he dont take away your hand my lovemy only lovespeak but those blessed words again call me william once more and do with me what you will  juliana cast down her eyes and said in the very smallest type william                                           when the door opened and in walked mr crampton leading mrs biggs who could hardly contain herself for laughing and mr john perkins who was squeezing the arm of miss lucy they had heard every word of the two last speeches  for at the very moment when lady gorgon had stopped at mr scullys door the four abovenamed individuals had issued from great james street into bedford row  lucy cried out that it was her aunts carriage and they all saw mr scully come out bareheaded in the sunshine and my lady descend and the pair go into the house they meanwhile entered by mr perkinss own private door and had been occupied in examining the delightful rooms on the groundfloor which were to be his diningroom and libraryfrom which they ascended a stair to visit the other two rooms which were to form mrs john perkinss drawingroom and bedroom now whether it was that they trod softly or that the stairs were covered with a grand new carpet and drugget as was the case or that the party within were too much occupied in themselves to heed any outward disturbances i know not but lucy who was advancing with john he was saying something about one of the apartments the roguelucy started and whispered there is somebody in the rooms and at that instant began the speech already reported thank you thank you dear mr scully etc etc which was delivered by lady gorgon in a full clear voice for to do her ladyship justice she had not one single grain of love for mr scully and during the delivery of her little oration was as cool as the coolest cucumber  then began the impassioned rejoinder to which the four listened on the landingplace and then the little william as narrated above at which juncture mr crampton thought proper to rattle at the door and after a brief pause to enter with his party  william had had time to bounce off his knees and was on a chair at the other end of the room  what lady gorgon said mr crampton with excellent surprise how delighted i am to see you always i see employed in works of charity the chapelofease paper was on her knees and on such an occasion tooit is really the most wonderful coincidence my dear madam here is a silly fellow a nephew of mine who is going to marry a silly girl a niece of your own  sir i began lady gorgon rising  they heard every word whispered mr crampton eagerly come forward mr perkins and show yourself mr perkins made a genteel bow miss lucy please to shake hands with your aunt and this my dear madam is mrs biggs of mecklenburgh square who if she were not too old might marry a gentleman in the treasury who is your very humble servant and with this gallant speech old mr crampton began helping everybody to sherry and cake  as for william pitt scully he had disappeared evaporated in the most absurd sneaking way imaginable lady gorgon made good her retreat presently with much dignity her countenance undismayed and her face turned resolutely to the foe                                            about five days afterwards that memorable contest took place in the house of commons in which the partisans of mr macabaw were so very nearly getting him the speakership on the day that the report of the debate appeared in the times there appeared also an announcement in the gazette as follows  the king has been pleased to appoint john perkins esquire to be deputysubcomptroller of his majestys tape office and custos of the sealingwax department  mr crampton showed this to his nephew with great glee and was chuckling to think how mr william pitt scully would be annoyed who had expected the place when perkins burst out laughing and said by heavens here is my own speech scully has spoken every word of it he has only put in mr pinchers name in the place of mr macabaws  he is ours now responded his uncle and i told you we would have him for nothing i told you too that you should be married from sir george gorgons and here is proof of it  it was a letter from lady gorgon in which she said that had she known mr perkins to be a nephew of her friend mr crampton she never for a moment would have opposed his marriage with her niece and she had written that morning to her dear lucy begging that the marriage breakfast should take place in baker street  it shall be in mecklenburgh square said john perkins stoutly and in mecklenburgh square it was  william pitt scully esquire was as mr crampton said hugely annoyed at the loss of the place for his nephew he had still however his hopes to look forward to but these were unluckily dashed by the coming in of the whigs as for sir george gorgon when he came to ask about his peerage hawksby told him that they could not afford to lose him in the commons for a liberal member would infallibly fill his place  and now that the tories are out and the whigs are in strange to say a liberal does fill his place this liberal is no other than sir george gorgon himself who is still longing to be a lord and his lady is still devout and intriguing so that the members for oldborough have changed sides and taunt each other with apostasy and hate each other cordially mr crampton still chuckles over the manner in which he tricked them both and talks of those five minutes during which he stood on the landingplace and hatched and executed his bedfordrow conspiracy
