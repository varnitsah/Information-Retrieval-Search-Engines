96515168	a ward of the golden gate   by  bret harte   jtable 5 9 1  prologue   in san francisco the rainy season had been making itself a reality to the wondering eastern immigrant  there were short days of drifting clouds and flying sunshine and long succeeding nights of incessant downpour when the rain rattled on the thin shingles or drummed on the resounding zinc of pioneer roofs  the shifting sanddunes on the outskirts were beaten motionless and sodden by the onslaught of consecutive storms the southeast trades brought the saline breath of the outlying pacific even to the busy haunts of commercial and kearney streets the lowlying mission road was a quagmire along the city front despite of piles and pier and wharf the pacific tides still asserted themselves in mud and ooze as far as sansome street the wooden sidewalks of clay and montgomery streets were mere floating bridges or buoyant pontoons superposed on elastic bogs battery street was the silurian beach of that early period on which tin cans packingboxes freight household furniture and even the runaway crews of deserted ships had been cast away  there were dangerous and unknown depths in montgomery street and on the plaza and the wheels of a passing carriage hopelessly mired had to be lifted by the volunteer hands of a half dozen highbooted wayfarers whose wearers were sufficiently content to believe that a woman a child or an invalid was behind its closed windows without troubling themselves or the occupant by looking through the glass  it was a carriage that thus released eventually drew up before the superior public edifice known as the city hall  from it a woman closely veiled alighted and quickly entered the building a few passersby turned to look at her partly from the rarity of the female figure at that period and partly from the greater rarity of its being well formed and even ladylike  as she kept her way along the corridor and ascended an iron staircase she was passed by others more preoccupied in business at the various public offices  one of these visitors however stopped as if struck by some fancied resemblance in her appearance turned and followed her  but when she halted before a door marked mayors office he paused also and with a look of half humorous bewilderment and a slight glance around him as if seeking for some one to whom to impart his arch fancy he turned away  the woman then entered a large anteroom with a certain quick feminine gesture of relief and finding it empty of other callers summoned the porter and asked him some question in a voice so suppressed by the official severity of the apartment as to be hardly audible  the attendant replied by entering another room marked mayors secretary and reappeared with a stripling of seventeen or eighteen whose singularly bright eyes were all that was youthful in his composed features  after a slight scrutiny of the womanhalf boyish half officialhe desired her to be seated with a certain exaggerated gravity as if he was overacting a grownup part and taking a card from her reentered his office here however he did not stand on his head or call out a confederate youth from a closet as the woman might have expected  to the left was a green baize door outlined with brassstudded rivets like a cheerful coffinlid and bearing the mortuary inscription private  this he pushed open and entered the mayors private office  the municipal dignitary of san francisco although an erect soldierlike man of strong middle age was seated with his official chair tilted back against the wall and kept in position by his feet on the rungs of another which in turn acted as a support for a second man who was seated a few feet from him in an easychair both were lazily smoking  the mayor took the card from his secretary glanced at it said hullo and handed it to his companion who read aloud kate howard and gave a prolonged whistle  where is she asked the mayor  in the anteroom sir  any one else there  no sir  did you say i was engaged  yes sir but it appears she asked sam who was with you and when he told her she said all right she wanted to see colonel pendleton too  the men glanced interrogatively at each other but colonel pendleton abruptly anticipating the mayors functions said have her in and settled himself back in his chair  a moment later the door opened and the stranger appeared  as she closed the door behind her she removed her heavy veil and displayed the face of a very handsome woman of past thirty  it is only necessary to add that it was a face known to the two men and all san francisco  well kate said the mayor motioning to a chair but without rising or changing his attitude  here i am and here is colonel pendleton and these are office hours  what can we do for you  if he had received her with magisterial formality or even politely she would have been embarrassed in spite of a certain boldness of her dark eyes and an ever present consciousness of her power  it is possible that his own ease and that of his companion was part of their instinctive good nature and perception  she accepted it as such took the chair familiarly and seated herself sideways upon it her right arm half encircling its back and hanging over it altogether an easy and not ungraceful pose  thank you jacki mean mr mayorand you too harry  i came on business  i want you two men to act as guardians for my little daughter  your what asked the two men simultaneously  my daughter she repeated with a short laugh which however ended with a note of defiance  of course you dont know  well she added half aggressively and yet with the air of hurrying over a compromising and inexplicable weakness the long and short of it is ive got a little girl down at the convent of santa clara and have hadthere ive been taking care of hergood care too boysfor some time  and now i want to put things square for her for the future  see  i want to make over to her all my propertyits nigh on to seventyfive thousand dollars for bob snelling put me up to getting those water lots a year agoand you see ill have to have regular guardians trustees or whatever you call em to take care of the money for her  whos her father asked the mayor  whats that to do with it she said impetuously  everythingbecause hes her natural guardian  suppose he isnt known  say dead for instance  dead will do said the mayor gravely  yes dead will do repeated colonel pendleton  after a pause in which the two men seemed to have buried this vague relative the mayor looked keenly at the woman  kate have you and bob ridley had a quarrel  bob ridley knows too much to quarrel with me she said briefly  then you are doing this for no motive other than that which you tell me  certainly  thats motive enoughaint it  yes  the mayor took his feet off his companions chair and sat upright  colonel pendleton did the same also removing his cigar from his lips  i suppose youll think this thing over he added  noi want it done nowright herein this office  but you know it will be irrevocable  thats what i want itsomething might happen afterwards  but you are leaving nothing for yourself and if you are going to devote everything to this daughter and lead a different life youll  who said i was  the two men paused and looked at her  look here boys you dont understand  from the day that paper is signed ive nothing to do with the child  she passes out of my hands into yours to be schooled educated and made a rich girl out ofand never to know who or what or where i am  she doesnt know now  i havent given her and myself away in that styleyou bet  she thinks im only a friend  she hasnt seen me more than once or twice and not to know me again  why i was down there the other day and passed her walking out with the sisters and the other scholars and she didnt know methough one of the sisters did  but theyre mumthey are and dont let on  why now i think of it you were down there jack presiding in big style as mr mayor at the exercises  you must have noticed her  little thing about ninelot of hair the same color as mine and brown eyes  white and yellow sash  had a necklace on of real pearls i gave her  i bought them you understand myself at tuckersgave two hundred and fifty dollars for themand a big bouquet of white rosebuds and lilacs i sent her  i remember her now on the platform said the mayor gravely  so that is your child  you betno slouch either  but thats neither here nor there what i want now is you and harry to look after her and her property the same as if i didnt live  more than that as if i had never lived  ive come to you two boys because i reckon youre square men and wont give me away  but i want to fix it even firmer than that  i want you to take hold of this trust not as jack hammersley but as the mayor of san francisco  and when you make way for a new mayor he takes up the trust by virtue of his office you see so theres a trustee all along i reckon therell always be a san francisco and always a mayorat least till the childs of age and it gives her from the start a father and a pretty big one too  of course the new man isnt to know the why and wherefore of this  its enough for him to take on that duty with his others without asking questions  and hes only got to invest that money and pay it out as its wanted and consult harry at times  the two men looked at each other with approving intelligence  but have you thought of a successor for me in case somebody shoots me on sight any time in the next ten years asked pendleton with a gravity equal to her own  i reckon as youre president of the el dorado bank youll make that a part of every presidents duty too  youll get the directors to agree to it just as jack here will get the common council to make it the mayors business  the two men had risen to their feet and after exchanging glances gazed at her silently  presently the mayor said  it can be done kate and well do it for youeh harry  count me in said pendleton nodding  but youll want a third man  whats that for  the casting vote in case of any difficulty  the womans face fell  i reckoned to keep it a secret with only you two she said half bitterly  no matter  well find some one to act or youll think of somebody and let us know  but i wanted to finish this thing right here she said impatiently she was silent for a moment with her arched black brows knitted  then she said abruptly whos that smart little chap that let me in  he looks as if he might be trusted  thats paul hathaway my secretary  hes sensible but too young stop i dont know about that  theres no legal age necessary and hes got an awfully old head on him said the mayor thoughtfully  and i say his youths in his favor said colonel pendleton promptly hes been brought up in san francisco and hes got no dd oldfashioned eastern notions to get rid of and will drop into this as a matter of business without prying about or wondering  ill serve with him  call him in said the woman  he came  very luminous of eye and composed of lip and brow  yet with the same suggestion of making believe very much as if to offset the possible munching of forbidden cakes and apples in his own room or the hidden presence of some still in his pocket  the mayor explained the case briefly but with businesslike precision your duty mr hathaway he concluded at present will be merely nominal and above all confidential  colonel pendleton and myself will set the thing going  as the youthwho had apparently taken in and illuminated the whole subject with a single brighteyed glancebowed and was about to retire as if to relieve himself of his real feelings behind the door the woman stopped him with a gesture  lets have this thing over now she said to the mayor  you draw up something that we can all sign at once  she fixed her eyes on paul partly to satisfy her curiosity and justify her predilection for him and partly to detect him in any overt act of boyishness but the youth simply returned her glance with a cheerful easy prescience as if her past lay clearly open before him  for some minutes there was only the rapid scratching of the mayors pen over the paper  suddenly he stopped and looked up  whats her name  she mustnt have mine said the woman quickly  thats a part of my idea  i give that up with the rest  she must take a new name that gives no hint of me  think of one cant you you two men something that would kind of show that she was the daughter of the city you know  you couldnt call her santa francisca eh said colonel pendleton doubtingly  not much said the woman with a seriousness that defied any ulterior insinuation  nor chrysopolinia said the mayor musingly  but thats only a first name  she must have a family name said the woman impatiently  can you think of something paul said the mayor appealing to hathaway  youre a great reader and later from your classics than i am  the mayor albeit practical and western liked to be ostentatiously forgetful of his old alma mater harvard on occasions  how would yerba buena do sir responded the youth gravely its the old spanish title of the first settlement here  it comes from the name that father junipero serra gave to the pretty little vine that grows wild over the sandhills and means good herb  he called it a balm for the wounded and sore  for the wounded and sore repeated the woman slowly  thats what they say responded hathaway  you aint playing us eh she said with a half laugh that however scarcely curved the open mouth with which she had been regarding the young secretary  no said the mayor hurriedly  its true  ive often heard it and a capital name it would be for her too  yerba the first name buena the second  she could be called miss buena when she grows up  yerba buena it is she said suddenly  then indicating the youth with a slight toss of her handsome head his heads levelyou can see that  there was a silence again and the scratching of the mayors pen continued  colonel pendleton buttoned up his coat pulled his long moustache into shape slightly arranged his collar and walked to the window without looking at the woman  presently the mayor arose from his seat and with a certain formal courtesy that had been wanting in his previous manner handed her his pen and arranged his chair for her at the desk  she took the pen and rapidly appended her signature to the paper  the others followed and obedient to a sign from him the porter was summoned from the outer office to witness the signatures when this was over the mayor turned to his secretary  thats all just now paul  accepting this implied dismissal with undisturbed gravity the newly made youthful guardian bowed and retired  when the green baize door had closed upon him the mayor turned abruptly to the woman with the paper in his hand  look here kate there is still time for you to reconsider your action and tear up this solitary record of it  if you choose to do so say so and i promise you that this interview and all you have told us shall never pass beyond these walls  no one will be the wiser for it and we will give you full credit for having attempted something that was too much for you to perform  she had half risen from her chair when he began but fell back again in her former position and looked impatiently from him to his companion who was also regarding her earnestly  what are you talking about she said sharply  you kate said the mayor  you have given everything you possess to this child  what provision have you made for yourself  do i look played out she said facing them  she certainly did not look like anything but a strong handsome resolute woman but the men did not reply  that is not all kate continued the mayor folding his arms and looking down upon her  have you thought what this means  it is the complete renunciation not only of any claim but any interest in your child  that is what you have just signed and what it will be our duty now to keep you to  from this moment we stand between you and her as we stand between her and the world  are you ready to see her grow up away from you losing even the little recollection she has had of your kindnesspassing you in the street without knowing you perhaps even having you pointed out to her as a person she should avoid  are you prepared to shut your eyes and ears henceforth to all that you may hear of her new life when she is happy rich respectable a courted heiressperhaps the wife of some great man  are you ready to accept that she will never knowthat no one will ever knowthat you had any share in making her so and that if you should ever breathe it abroad we shall hold it our duty to deny it and brand the man who takes it up for you as a liar and the slanderer of an honest girl  thats what i came here for she said curtly then regarding them curiously and running her ringed hand up and down the railed back of her chair she added with a half laugh what are you playin me for boys  but said colonel pendleton without heeding her are you ready to know that in sickness or affliction you will be powerless to help her that a stranger will take your place at her bedside that as she has lived without knowing you she will die without that knowledge or that if through any weakness of yours it came to her then it would embitter her last thoughts of earth and dying she would curse you  the smile upon her halfopen mouth still fluttered around it and her curved fingers still ran up and down the rails of the chairback as if they were the cords of some mute instrument to which she was trying to give voice  her rings once or twice grated upon them as if she had at times gripped them closely  but she rose quickly when he paused said yes sharply and put the chair back against the wall  then i will send you copies of this tomorrow and take an assignment of the property  ive got the check here for it now she said drawing it from her pocket and laying it upon the desk  there i reckon thats finished goodby  the mayor took up his hat colonel pendleton did the same both men preceded her to the door and held it open with grave politeness for her to pass  where are you boys going she asked glancing from the one to the other  to see you to your carriage mrs howard said the mayor in a voice that had become somewhat deeper  through the whole building  past all the people in the hall and on the stairs  why i passed dan stewart as i came in  if you will allow us he said turning half appealing to colonel pendleton who without speaking made a low bow of assent  a slight flush rose to her facethe first and only change in the even healthy color she had shown during the interview  i reckon i wont trouble you boys if its all the same to you she said with her halfstrident laugh  you mightnt mind being seenbut i would  goodby  she held out a hand to each of the men who remained for an instant silently holding them  then she passed out of the door slipping on her close black veil as she did so with a halffunereal suggestion and they saw her tall handsome figure fade into the shadows of the long corridor  paul said the mayor reentering the office and turning to his secretary do you know who that woman is  yes sir  shes one in a million  and now forget that you have ever seen her    chapter i  the principal parlor of the new golden gate hotel in san francisco fairly reported by the local press as being truly palatial in its appointments and unrivaled in its upholstery was nevertheless on august 5 1860 of that startling newness that checked any familiarity and evidently had produced some embarrassment on the limbs of four visitors who had just been ushered into its glories after hesitating before one or two gorgeous fawncolored brocaded easychairs of appalling and spotless virginity one of them seated himself despairingly on a teteatete sofa in marked and painful isolation while another sat uncomfortably upright on a sofa  the two others remained standing vaguely gazing at the ceiling and exchanging ostentatiously admiring but hollow remarks about the furniture in unnecessary whispers  yet they were apparently men of a certain habit of importance and small authority with more or less critical attitude in their speech  to them presently entered a young man of about fiveandtwenty with remarkably bright and singularly sympathetic eyes  having swept the group in a smiling glance he singled out the lonely occupier of the teteatete and moved pleasantly towards him  the man rose instantly with an eager gratified look  well paul i didnt allow youd remember me  its a matter of four years since we met at marysville  and now youre bein a great man youve  no one could have known from the young mans smiling face that he really had not recognized his visitor at first and that his greeting was only an exhibition of one of those happy instincts for which he was remarkable  but following the clew suggested by his visitor he was able to say promptly and gayly  i dont know why i should forget tony shear or the marysville boys turning with a halfconfiding smile to the other visitors who after the human fashion were beginning to be resentfully impatient of this special attention  well nofor ive allus said that you took your first start from marysville  but ive brought a few friends of our party that i reckoned to introduce to you  capn stidger chairman of our central committee mr henry j hoskins of the firm of hoskins and bloomer and joe slate of the union press one of our most promising journalists  gentlemen he continued suddenly and without warning lifting his voice to an oratorical plane in startling contrast to his previous unaffected utterance i neednt say that this is the honorable paul hathaway the youngest state senator in the legislature you know his record  then recovering the ordinary accents of humanity he added we read of your departure last night from sacramento and i thought wed come early afore the crowd  proud to know you sir said captain stidger suddenly lifting the conversation to the platform again  i have followed your career sir ive read your speech mr hathaway and as i was telling our mutual friend mr shear as we came along i dont know any man that could state the real party issues as squarely your castigating exposition of socalled jeffersonian principles and your relentless indictment of the resolutions of 98 werewerecoughed the captain dropping into conversation againwere the biggest thing out  you have only to signify the day sir that you will address us and i can promise you the largest audience in san francisco  im instructed by the proprietor of the union press said mr slate feeling for his notebook and pencil to offer you its columns for any explanations you may desire to make in the form of a personal letter or an editorial in reply to the advertisers strictures on your speech or to take any information you may have for the benefit of our readers and the party  if you are ever down my way mr hathaway said mr hoskins placing a large business card in hathaways hand and will drop in as a friend i can show you about the largest business in the way of canned provisions and domestic groceries in the state and give you a look around battery street generally  or if youll name your day ive got a pair of 235 blue grass horses thatll spin you out to the cliff house to dinner and back  ive had governor fiske and senator doolan and that big english capitalist who was here last year and theywell sirthey were pleased  or if youd like to see the townif this is your first visitim a hand to show you  nothing could exceed mr hathaways sympathetic acceptance of their courtesies nor was there the least affectation in it  thoroughly enjoying his fellowmen even in their foibles they found him irresistibly attractive  i lived here seven years ago he said smiling to the last speaker  when the water came up to montgomery street interposed mr shear in a hoarse but admiring aside  when mr hammersley was mayor continued hathaway  had an official positionprivate secretaryafore he was twenty explained shear in perfectly audible confidence  since then the city has made great strides leaping fullgrown sir in a single night said captain stidger hastily ascending the rostrum again with a mixed metaphor to the apparent concern of a party of handsomely dressed young ladies who had recently entered the parlor stretching from south park to black point and running back to the mission dolores and the presidio we are building up a metropolis sir worthy to be placed beside the golden gate that opens to the broad pacific and the shores of far cathay  when the pacific railroad is built we shall be the natural terminus of the pathway of nations  mr hathaways face betrayed no consciousness that he had heard something like this eight years before and that much of it had come true as he again sympathetically responded  neither was his attention attracted by a singular similarity which the attitude of the group of ladies on the other side of the parlor bore to that of his own party they were clustered around one of their own numbera strikinglooking girlwho was apparently receiving their mingled flatteries and caresses with a youthful yet critical sympathy which singularly enough was not unlike his own  it was evident also that an odd sort of rivalry seemed to spring up between the two parties and that in proportion as hathaways admirers became more marked and ostentatious in their attentions the supporters of the young girl were equally effusive and enthusiastic in their devotion  as usual in such cases the real contest was between the partisans themselves each successive demonstration on either side was provocative or retaliatory and when they were apparently rendering homage to their idols they were really distracted by and listening to each other  at last hathaways party being reinforced by fresh visitors a tall brunette of the opposition remarked in a professedly confidential but perfectly audible tone  well my dear as i dont suppose you want to take part in a political caucus perhaps wed better return to the ladies boudoir unless theres a committee sitting there too  i know how valuable your time must be as you are all business men said hathaway turning to his party in an equally audible tone but before you go gentlemen you must let me offer you a little refreshment in a private room and he moved naturally towards the door  the rival fair who had already risen at their commanders suggestion here paused awkwardly over an embarrassing victory  should they go or stay  the object of their devotion however turned curiously towards hathaway  for an instant their eyes met  the young girl turned carelessly to her companions and said no stay hereits the public parlor and her followers evidently accustomed to her authority sat down again  a galaxy of young ladies from the convent of santa clara mr hathaway explained captain stidger naively oblivious of any discourtesy on their part as he followed hathaways glance and took his arm as they moved away  not the least of our treasures sir most of them daughters of pioneersand all californian bred and educated  connoisseurs have awarded them the palm and declare that for grace intelligence and womans highest charms the east cannot furnish their equal  having delivered this parthian compliment in an oratorical passage through the doorway the captain descended outside into familiar speech  but i suppose you will find that out for yourself if you stay here long  san francisco might furnish a fitting bride to californias youngest senator  i am afraid that my stay here must be brief and limited to business said hathaway who had merely noticed that the principal girl was handsome and originallooking  in fact i am here partly to see an old acquaintancecolonel pendleton  the three men looked at each other curiously  oh harry pendleton said mr hoskins incredulously you dont know him  an old pioneerof course interposed shear explanatorily and apologetically  why in pauls time the colonel was a big man here  i understand the colonel has been unfortunate said hathaway gravely but in my time he was president of the el dorado bank  and the bank hasnt got through its settlement yet said hoskins i hope you aint expecting to get anything out of it  no said hathaway smiling i was a boy at that time and lived up to my salary  i know nothing of his bank difficulties but it always struck me that colonel pendleton was himself an honorable man  it aint that said captain stidger energetically but the trouble with harry pendleton is that he hasnt grown with the state and never adjusted himself to it  and he wont  he thinks the millennium was between the fall of 49 and the spring of 50 and after that everything dropped  he belongs to the old days when a mans simple word was good for any amount if you knew him and they say that the old bank hadnt a scrap of paper for half that was owing to it  that was all very well sir in 49 and 50 andluck but it wont do for 59 and 60 andbusiness  and the old man cant see it  but he is ready to fight for it now as in the old time said mr slate and thats another trouble with his chronology  hes done more to keep up dueling than any other man in the state and dont know the whole spirit of progress and civilization is against it  it was impossible to tell from paul hathaways face whether his sympathy with colonel pendletons foibles or his assent to the criticisms of his visitors was the truer  both were no doubt equally sincere  but the party was presently engaged in the absorption of refreshment which being of a purely spirituous and exhilarating quality tended to increase their good humor with the host till they parted  even then a gratuitous advertisement of his virtues and their own intentions in calling upon him was oratorically voiced from available platforms and landings in the halls and stairways until it was pretty well known throughout the golden gate hotel that the hon mr paul hathaway had arrived from sacramento and had received a spontaneous ovation  meantime the object of it had dropped into an easychair by the window of his room and was endeavoring to recall a less profitable memory the process of human forgetfulness is not a difficult one between the ages of eighteen and twentysix and paul hathaway had not only fulfilled the mayors request by forgetting the particulars of a certain transfer that he had witnessed in the mayors office but in the year succeeding that request being about to try his fortunes in the mountains he had formally constituted colonel pendleton to act as his proxy in the administration of mrs howards singular trust in which however he had never participated except yearly to sign his name  he was consequently somewhat astonished to have received a letter a few days before from colonel pendleton asking him to call and see him regarding it  he vaguely remembered that it was eight years ago and eight years had worked considerable change in the original trustees greatest of all in his superior officer the mayor who had died the year following leaving his trusteeship to his successor in office whom paul hathaway had never seen  the bank of el dorado despite mrs howards sanguine belief had long been in bankruptcy and although colonel pendleton still survived it it was certain that no other president would succeed to his office as trustee and that the function would lapse with him paul himself a soldier of fortune although habitually lucky had only lately succeeded to a professionif his political functions could be so described  even with his luck energy and ambition while everything was possible nothing was secure  it seemed therefore as if the soulless official must eventually assume the duties of the two sympathizing friends who had originated them and had stood in loco parentis to the constructive orphan  the mother mrs howard had disappeared a year after the trust had been madeit was charitably presumed in order to prevent any complications that might arise from her presence in the country  with these facts before him paul hathaway was more concerned in wondering what pendleton could want with him than i fear any direct sympathy with the situation  on the contrary it appeared to him more favorable for keeping the secret of mrs howards relationship which would now die with colonel pendleton and himself and there was no danger of any emotional betrayal of it in the cold official administration of a man who had received the trust through the formal hands of successive predecessors  he had forgotten the time limited for the guardianship but the girl must soon be of age and off their hands if there had ever been any romantic or chivalrous impression left upon his memory by the scene in the mayors office i fear he had put it away with various other foolish illusions of his youth to which he now believed he was superior  nevertheless he would see the colonel and at once and settle the question  he looked at the address st charles hotel  he remembered an old hostelry of that name near the plaza  could it be possible that it had survived the alterations and improvements of the city  it was an easy walk through remembered streets yet with changed shops and houses and faces  when he reached the plaza scarce recognizable in its later frontages of brick and stone he found the old wooden building still intact with its villalike galleries and verandas incongruously and ostentatiously overlooked by two new and aspiring erections on either side  for an instant he tried to recall the glamour of old days  he remembered when his boyish eyes regarded it as the crowning work of opulence and distinction he remembered a ball given there on some public occasion which was to him the acme of social brilliancy and display  how tawdry and trivial it looked beside those later and more solid structures  how inconsistent were those long latticed verandas and balconies pathetic record of that first illusion of the pioneers that their climate was a tropical one  a restaurant and billiardsaloon had aggrandized all of the lower story but there was still the fanlight over which the remembered title of st charles in gilded letters was now reinforced by the too demonstrative legend apartments and board by the day or week was it possible that this narrow creaking staircase had once seemed to him the broad steps of fame and fortune  on the first landing a preoccupied irish servantgirl with a mop directed him to a door at the end of the passage at which he knocked  the door was opened by a grizzled negro servant who was still holding a piece of oily chamoisleather in his hand and the contents of a duelingcase scattered upon a table in the centre of the room showed what had been his occupation  admitting hathaway with great courtesy he said  marse harry bin havin his ole trubble sah and bin engaged just dis momen on his toylet ef yoll accommodate yoself on de sofa i inform him yo is heah  as the negro passed into the next room paul cast a hasty glance around the apartment  the furniture originally rich and elegant was now worn threadbare and lustreless  a bookcase containing among other volumes a few law booksthere being a vague tradition as paul remembered that colonel pendleton had once been connected with the lawa few french chairs of tarnished gilt a rifle in the corner a presentation sword in a mahogany case a few classical prints on the walls and one or two iron deedboxes marked el dorado bank were the principal objects  a mild flavor of dry decay and methylated spirits pervaded the apartment  yet it was scrupulously clean and well kept and a few clothes neatly brushed and folded on a chair bore witness to the servants care as paul however glanced behind the sofa he was concerned to see a coat which had evidently been thrust hurriedly in a corner with the sleeve lining inside out and a needle and thread still sticking in the seam  it struck him instantly that this had been the negros occupation and that the pistolcleaning was a polite fiction  yo ll have to skuse marse harry seein yo in bed but his laigs powful bad today and he cant stand said the servant reentering the room  skuse me sah he added in a dignified confidential whisper half closing the door with his hand but if yo wouldnt mind avoidin xcitin or controversical topics in yo conversation it would be de better fo him  paul smilingly assented and the black retainer with even more than the usual solemn ceremonious exaggeration of his race ushered him into the bedroom  it was furnished in the same faded glory as the sittingroom with the exception of a low iron campbedstead in which the tall soldierly figure of colonel pendleton clad in threadbare silk dressinggown was stretched  he had changed in eight years his hair had become gray and was thinned over the sunken temples but his irongray moustache was still particularly long and well pointed  his face bore marks of illness and care there were deep lines down the angle of the nostril that spoke of alternate savage outbreak and repression and gave his smile a sardonic rigidity  his dark eyes that shone with the exaltation of fever fixed pauls on entering and with the tyranny of an invalid never left them  well hathaway  with the sound of that voice paul felt the years slip away and he was again a boy looking up admiringly to the strong man who now lay helpless before him  he had entered the room with a faint sense of sympathizing superiority and a consciousness of having had experience in controlling men  but all this fled before colonel pendletons authoritative voice even its broken tones carried the old dominant spirit of the man and paul found himself admiring a quality in his old acquaintance that he missed in his newer friends  i havent seen you for eight years hathaway  come here and let me look at you  paul approached the bedside with boyish obedience  pendleton took his hand and gazed at him critically  i should have recognized you sir for all your moustache and your inches  the last time i saw you was in jack hammersleys office well jacks dead and here i am little better i reckon  you remember hammersleys house  yes said paul albeit wondering at the question  something like this swiss villa style  i remember when jack put it up  well the last time i was out i passed there  and what do you think theyve done to it  paul could not imagine  well sir said the colonel gravely theyve changed it into a church missionary shop and young mens christian readingroom  but thats progress and improvement  he paused and slowly withdrawing his hand from pauls added with grim apology youre young and belong to the new school perhaps  well sir ive read your speech i dont belong to your partymine died ten years agobut i congratulate you  george  confound it wheres that boy gone  the negro indicated by this youthful title although he must have been ten years older than his master after a hurried shuffling in the sittingroom eventually appeared at the door  george champagne and materials for cocktails for the gentleman the best you understand  no newfangled notions from that new barkeeper  paul who thought he observed a troubled blinking in georges eyelid and referred it to a fear of possible excitement for his patient here begged his host not to trouble himselfthat he seldom took anything in the morning  possibly not sir possibly not returned the colonel hastily i know the new ideas are prohibitive and some other blank thing but youre safe here from your constituents and by gad sir i shant force you to take it  its my custom hathawayan old oneplayed out perhaps like all the others but a custom nevertheless and im only surprised that george who knows it should have forgotten it  fack is marse harry said george with feverish apology it bin gone scaped my mind dis monin in de prerogation ob business but im goin now shuah and he disappeared  a good boy sir but beginning to be contaminated  brought him here from nashville over ten years ago  eight years ago they proved to him that he was no longer a slave and made him dd unhappy until i promised him it should make no difference to him and he could stay  i had to send for his wife and childof course a dead loss of eighteen hundred dollars when they set foot in the statebut im blanked if he isnt just as miserable with them here for he has to take two hours in the morning and three in the afternoon every day to be with em  i tried to get him to take his family to the mines and make his fortune like those fellows they call bankers and operators and stockbrokers nowadays or to go to oregon where theyll make him some kind of a mayor or sheriffbut he wont  he collects my rents on some little property i have left and pays my bills sir and if this blank civilization would only leave him alone hed be a good enough boy  paul couldnt help thinking that the rents george collected were somewhat inconsistent with those he was evidently mending when he arrived but at that moment the jingle of glasses was heard in the sittingroom and the old negro reappeared at the door  drawing himself up with ceremonious courtesy he addressed paul  wod yo mind sah taking a glance at de wine for yo choice  paul rose and followed him into the sittingroom when george carefully closed the door  to his surprise hathaway beheld a tray with two glasses of whiskey and bitters but no wine  skuse me sah said the old man with dignified apology but de kernel wont have any but de best champagne for honoble gemmen like yoself and ise despaired to say it cant be got in de house or de subburbs  de best champagne dat we gives visitors is de widder glencoe  wod yo mind sah for de sake o not xcitin de kernel wid triflin culinary matter to say dat yo don take but de one brand  certainly said paul smiling  i really dont care for anything so early then returning to the bedroom he said carelessly youll excuse me taking the liberty colonel of sending away the champagne and contenting myself with whiskey  even the best brandthe widow cliquotwith a glance at the gratified georgei find rather trying so early in the morning  as you please hathaway said the colonel somewhat stiffly  i dare say theres a new fashion in drinks now and a gentlemans stomach is a thing of the past  then i suppose we can spare the boy as this is his time for going home  put that tin box with the trust papers on the bed george and mr hathaway will excuse your waiting  as the old servant made an exaggerated obeisance to each paul remarked as the door closed upon him george certainly keeps his style colonel in the face of the progress you deplore  he was always a dandy nigger returned pendleton his face slightly relaxing as he glanced after his grizzled henchman but his exaggeration of courtesy is a blank sight more natural and manly than the exaggeration of discourtesy which your superior civilized helps think is selfrespect  the excuse of servitude of any kind is its spontaneity and affection  when you know a man hates you and serves you from interest you know hes a cur and youre a tyrant  its your blank progress thats made menial service degrading by teaching men to avoid it  why sir when i first arrived here jack hammersley and myself took turns as cook to the party  i didnt consider myself any the worse master for it  but enough of this  he paused and raising himself on his elbow gazed for some seconds half cautiously half doubtfully upon his companion  ive got something to tell you hathaway he said slowly  youve had an easy time with this trust your share of the work hasnt worried you kept you awake nights or interfered with your career  i understand perfectly he continued in reply to hathaways deprecating gesture  i accepted to act as your proxy and i have  im not complaining  but it is time that you should know what ive done and what you may still have to do  here is the record  on the day after that interview in the mayors office the el dorado bank of which i was and still am president received seventyfive thousand dollars in trust from mrs howard  two years afterwards on that same day the bank had by lucky speculations increased that sum to the credit of the trust one hundred and fifty thousand dollars or double the original capital  in the following year the bank suspended payment    chapter ii  in an instant the whole situation and his relations to it flashed upon paul with a terrible but almost grotesque completeness here he was at the outset of his career responsible for the wasted fortune of the daughter of a social outcast and saddled with her support  he now knew why colonel pendleton had wished to see him for one shameful moment he believed he also knew why he had been content to take his proxy  the questionable character of the whole transaction his own carelessness which sprang from that very confidence and trust that pendleton had lately extolledwhat would what could not be made of it  he already heard himself abused by his opponentsperhaps more terrible still faintly excused by his friends  all this was visible in his pale face and flashing eyes as he turned them on the helpless invalid  colonel pendleton received his look with the same critical halfcurious scrutiny that had accompanied his speech  at last his face changed slightly a faint look of disappointment crossed his eyes and a sardonic smile deepened the lines of his mouth  there sir he said hurriedly as if dismissing an unpleasant revelation dont alarm yourself  take a drink of that whiskey you look pale  well turn your eyes on those walls  you dont see any of that money laid out heredo you  look at me  i dont look like a man enriched with other peoples moneydo i  well let that content you every dollar of that trust fund hathaway with all the interests and profits that have accrued to it is safe every cent of it is locked up in government bonds with rothschilds agent  there are the receipts dated a week before the bank suspended  but enough of thatthat isnt what i asked you to come and see me for  the blood had rushed back to pauls cheeks uncomfortably  he saw now as impulsively as he had previously suspected his cotrustee that the man had probably ruined himself to save the trust  he stammered that he had not questioned the management of the fund nor asked to withdraw his proxy  no matter sir said the colonel impatiently you had the right and i suppose he added with halfconcealed scorn it was your duty but let that pass  the money is safe enough but mr hathawayand this is the point i want to discuss with youit begins to look as if the secret was safe no longer  he had raised himself with some pain and difficulty to draw nearer to paul and had again fixed his eyes eagerly upon him  but pauls responsive glance was so vague that he added quickly you understand sir i believe that there are houndsi say houndswho would be able to blurt out at any moment that that girl at santa clara is kate howards daughter  at any other moment paul might have questioned the gravity of any such contingency but the terrible earnestness of the speaker his dominant tone and a certain respect which had lately sprung up in his breast for him checked him and he only asked with as much concern as he could master for the moment  what makes you think so  thats what i want to tell you hathaway and how i and i alone am responsible for it  when the bank was in difficulty and i made up my mind to guard the trust with my own personal and private capital i knew that there might be some comment on my action  it was a delicate matter to show any preference or exclusion at such a moment and i took two or three of my brother directors whom i thought i could trust into my confidence  i told them the whole story and how the trust was sacred  i made a mistake sir continued pendleton sardonically a grave mistake  i did not take into account that even in three years civilization and religion had gained ground here  there was a hound therea blank judas in the trust  well he didnt see it  i think he talked scripture and morality  he said something about the wages of sin being infamous and only worthy of confiscation  he talked about the sins of the father being visited upon the children and justly  i stopped him well  do you know whats the matter with my ankle look  he stopped and with some difficulty and invincible gravity throwing aside his dressinggown turned down his stocking and exposed to pauls gaze the healed cicatrix of an old bulletwound  troubled me damnably near a year  where i hit himhasnt troubled him at all since  i think continued the colonel falling back upon the pillow with an air of relief that he told othersof his own kidney sirthough it was a secret among gentlemen  but they have preferred to be silent nowthan afterwards  they know that im ready  but i cant keep this up long some time you know theyre bound to improve in practice and hit higher up  as far as im concerned he added with a grim glance around the faded walls and threadbare furniture it dont mind but mine isnt the mouth to be stopped he paused and then abruptly yet with a sudden and pathetic dropping of his dominant note said hathaway youre young and hammersley liked youwhats to be done i thought of passing over my tools to you  you can shoot and i hear you have  but the hl of it is that if you dropped a man or two people would ask why and want to know what it was about while when i do nobody here thinks it anything but my way  i dont mean that it would hurt you with the crowd to wipe out one or two of these hounds during the canvass but the trouble is that they belong to your party and he added grimly that wouldnt help your career  but said paul ignoring the sarcasm are you not magnifying the effect of a disclosure  the girl is an heiress excellently brought up  who will bother about the antecedents of the mother who has disappeared whom she never knew and who is legally dead to her  in my day sir no one who knew the circumstances returned the colonel quickly  but we are living in a blessed era of christian retribution and civilized propriety and i believe there are a lot of men and women about who have no other way of showing their own virtue than by showing up anothers vice  were in a reaction of reform its the old drunkards who are always more clamorous for total abstinence than the moderately temperate  i tell you hathaway there couldnt be an unluckier moment for our secret coming out  but she will be of age soon  in two months  and sure to marry  marry repeated pendleton with grim irony  would you marry her  thats another question said the young man promptly and one of individual taste but it does not affect my general belief that she could easily find a husband as good and better  suppose she found one before the secret is out  ought he be told  certainly  and that would imply telling her  yes said paul but not so promptly  and you consider that fulfilling the promise of the trustthe pledges exchanged with that woman continued pendleton with glittering eyes and a return to his own dominant tone  my dear colonel said paul somewhat less positively but still smiling you have made a romantic almost impossible compact with mrs howard that you yourself are now obliged to admit circumstances may prevent your carrying out substantially  you forget also that you have just told me that you have already broken your pledgeunder circumstances it is true that do you honorand that now your desperate attempts to retrieve it have failed  now i really see nothing wrong in your telling to a presumptive wellwisher of the girl what you have told to her enemy  there was a dead silence  the prostrate man uttered a slight groan as if in pain and drew up his leg to change his position after a pause he said in a restrained voice i differ from you mr hathaway but enough of this for the present  i have something else to say  it will be necessary for one of us to go at once to santa clara and see miss yerba buena  good heavens said paul quickly  do you call her that  certainly sir  you gave her the name  have you forgotten  i only suggested it returned paul hopelessly but no mattergo on  i cannot go there as you see continued pendleton with a weary gesture towards his crippled ankle and i should particularly like you to see her before we make the joint disposition of her affairs with the mayor two months hence  i have some papers you can show her and i have already written a letter introducing you to the lady superior at the convent and to her  you have never seen her  no said paul  but of course you have  not for three years  pauls eyes evidently expressed some wonder for a moment after the colonel added i believe hathaway i am looked upon as a queer survival of a rather lawless and improper past  at least i have thought it better not socially to compromise her by my presence the mayor goes thereat the examinations and exercises i believe sir they make a sort of reception for himwith aabanquetlemonade and speeches  i had intended to leave for sacramento tomorrow night said paul glancing curiously at the helpless man but i will go there if you wish  thank you  it will be better  there were a few words of further explanation of the papers and pendleton placed the packet in his visitors hands  paul rose somehow it appeared to him that the room looked more faded and forgotten than when he entered it and the figure of the man before him more lonely helpless and abandoned  with one of his sympathetic impulses he said  i dont like to leave you here alone  are you sure you can help yourself without george  can i do anything before i go  i am quite accustomed to it said pendleton quietly  it happens once or twice a year and when i go outwelli miss more than i do here  he took pauls proffered hand mechanically with a slight return of the critical doubting look he had cast upon him when he entered his voice too had quite recovered its old dominance as he said with halfpatronizing conventionality youll have to find your way out alone  let me know how you have sped at santa clara will you goodby  the staircase and passage seemed to have grown shabbier and meaner as paul slowly and hesitatingly descended to the street  at the foot of the stairs he paused irresolutely and loitered with a vague idea of turning back on some pretense only that he might relieve himself of the sense of desertion  he had already determined upon making that inquiry into the colonels personal and pecuniary affairs which he had not dared to offer personally and had a halfformed plan of testing his own power and popularity in a certain line of relief that at once satisfied his sympathies and ambitions  nevertheless after reaching the street he lingered a moment when an odd idea of temporizing with his inclinations struck him  at the farther end of the hotelone of the parasites living on its decayed fortuneswas a small barbers shop  by having his hair trimmed and his clothes brushed he could linger a little longer beneath the same roof with the helpless solitary and perhaps come to some conclusion  he entered the clean but scantily furnished shop and threw himself into one of the nearest chairs hardly noting that there were no other customers and that a single assistant stropping a razor behind a glass door was the only occupant  but there was a familiar note of exaggerated politeness about the voice of this man as he opened the door and came towards the back of the chair with the formula  monin sah  shall we hab de pleshure of shavin or hahcuttin dis monin  paul raised his eyes quickly to the mirror before him  it reflected the black face and grizzled hair of george  more relieved at finding the old servant still near his master than caring to comprehend the reason hathaway said pleasantly well george is this the way you look after your family  the old man started for an instant his full red lips seemed to become dry and ashen the whites of his eyes were suffused and staring as he met pauls smiling face in the glass  but almost as quickly he recovered himself and with a polite but deprecating bow saidfor god sake sah  i admit de sarkumstances is agin me but de simple fack is dat im temperly occupyin de place of an ole frien sah who is called round de cornah  and im devilish glad of any fact george that gives me a chance of having my hair cut by colonel pendletons righthand man  so fire away  the gratified smile which now suddenly overspread the whole of the old mans face and seemed to quickly stiffen the rugged and wrinkled fingers that had at first trembled in drawing a pair of shears from a ragged pocket appeared to satisfy pauls curiosity for the present but after a few moments silent snipping during which he could detect in the mirror some traces of agitation still twitching the negros face he said with an air of conviction  look here georgewhy dont you regularly use your leisure moments in this trade  youd make your fortune by your taste and skill at it  for the next half minute the old mans frame shook with silent childlike laughter behind pauls chair  well marse hathaway yos an ole frien o my massa and a gemman yoself sah and a senetah and i doan mind tellin yodats jess what i bin gone done  it makes a little ready money for de ole woman and de chilleren  but de kernel don no  ah sah de kernel kill me or hisself if he so much as

might come befo yo  ill see about it said paul with an odd abstracted smile  shampoo dis mornen sah  nothing more in this line said paul rising from his chair but something more perhaps in the line of your other duties  youre a good barber for the public george and i dont take back what i said about your future but just now i think the colonel wants all your service  hes not at all well  take this he said putting a twentydollar gold piece in the astonished servants hand and for the next three or four days drop the shop and under some pretext or another arrange to be with him  that money will cover what you lose here and as soon as the colonels all right again you can come back to work  but are you not afraid of being recognized by some one  no sah dats just it  ony strangers dat dont know no better come yere  but suppose your master should drop in  its quite convenient to his rooms  marse harry in a barbershop said the old man with a silent laugh skuse me sah he added with an apologetic mixture of respect and dignity but fo twenty years no man hez touched de kernels chin but myself  when marse harry hez to go to a barbers shop it wont make no matter whos dar  lets hope he will not said paul gayly then anxious to evade the gratitude which since his munificence he had seen beaming in the old negros eye and evidently trying to find polysyllabic and elevated expression on his lips he said hurriedly i shall expect to find you with the colonel when i call again in a day or two and smilingly departed  at the end of two hours georges barberemployer returned to relieve his assistant and on receiving from him an account and a certain percentage of the afternoons fees minus the gift from paul was informed by george that he should pretermit his attendance for a few days  udder private and personal affairs explained the old negro who made no social distinction in his vocabulary peroccupyin dis niggahs time  the head barber unwilling to lose a really good assistant endeavored to dissuade him by the offer of increased emolument but george was firm  as he entered the sittingroom the colonel detected his step and called him in  another time george never allow a guest of mine to send away wine if he dont care for it put it on the sideboard  yes sah but as yo didnt like it yoself marse harry and de wine was de most xpensive quality ob glencoe  dn the expense he paused and gazed searchingly at his old retainer  george he said suddenly yet in a gentle voice dont lie to me orin a still kinder voiceill flog the black skin off you listen to me  have you got any money left  deed sah dere is said the negro earnestly  ill jist fetch it wid de accounts  hold on  ive been thinking lying here that if the widow molloy cant pay because she sold out and that tobacconist is ruined and weve had to pay the water tax for old bill soames the rent last week dont amount to much while theres the months bill for the restaurant and that blank druggists account for lotions and medicines to come out of it  it strikes me were pretty near touching bottom  ive everything i want here but by god sir if i find you skimping yourself or lying to me or borrowing money  yes marse harry but the widder molloy done gone and paid up dis afernoon  ill bring de books and money to prove it and he hurriedly reentered the sittingroom  then with trembling hands he emptied his pockets on the table including pauls gift and the fees he had just received and opening a deskdrawer took from it a striped cotton handkerchief such as negro women wear on their heads containing a small quantity of silver tied up in a hard knot and a boys purse  this he emptied on the table with his own money  they were the only rents of colonel henry pendleton  they were contributed by george washington thomson his wife otherwise known as aunt dinah washerwoman and scipio thomson their son aged fourteen bootblack  it did not amount to much  but in that happy moisture that dimmed the old mans eyes god knows it looked large enough    chapter iii  although the rays of an unclouded sun were hot in the santa clara roads and byways and the dry bleached dust had become an impalpable powder the perspiring and parched pedestrian who rashly sought relief in the shade of the wayside oak was speedily chilled to the bone by the northwest tradewinds that on those august afternoons swept through the defiles of the coast range and even penetrated the pastoral valley of san jose  the anomaly of straw hats and overcoats with the occupants of buggies and station wagons was thus accounted for and even in the sheltered garden of el rosario two young girls in light summer dresses had thrown wraps over their shoulders as they lounged down a broad rosealley at right angles with the deep long veranda of the casa  yet in spite of the chill the old spanish house and gardens presented a luxurious almost tropical picture from the roadside banks beds and bowers of roses lent their name and color to the grounds treelike clusters of hanging fuchsias moundlike masses of variegated verbena and tangled thickets of ceanothus and spreading heliotrope were set in boundaries of venerable olive fig and pear trees  the old house itself a picturesque relief to the glaring newness of the painted villas along the road had been tastefully modified to suit the needs and habits of a later civilization the galleries of the inner courtyard or patio had been transferred to the outside walls in the form of deep verandas while the old adobe walls themselves were hidden beneath flowing cape jessamine or bestarred passion vines and topped by roofs of cylindrical red tiles  miss yerba said a dry masculine voice from the veranda  the taller young girl started and drew herself suddenly behind a large castilian rosetree dragging her companion with her and putting her finger imperatively upon a pretty but somewhat passionate mouth  the other girl checked a laugh and remained watching her friends wickedly leveled brows in amused surprise  the call was repeated from the veranda  after a moments pause there was the sound of retreating footsteps and all was quiet again  why for goodness sake didnt you answer yerba asked the shorter girl  oh i hate him responded yerba  he only wanted to bore me with his stupid formal shamparental talk  because hes my official guardian he thinks it necessary to assume this manner towards me when we meet and treats me as if i were something between his stepdaughter and an almshouse orphan or a police board  its perfectly ridiculous for its only put on while he is in office and he knows it and i know it and im tired of making believe why my dear they change every election ive had seven of them all more or less of this kind since i can remember  but i thought there were two others dear that were not official said her companion coaxingly  yerba sighed  no there was another who was president of a bank but that was also to be official if he died  i used to like him he seemed to be the only gentleman among them but it appears that he is dreadfully improper shoots people now and then for nothing at all and burst up his bankand of course hes impossible and as theres no more bank when he dies therell be no more trustee  and theres the third you knowa stranger who never appears suggested the younger girl  and who do you suppose he turns out to be  do you remember that conceited little wretchthat baby senator i think they called himwho was in the parlor of the golden gate the other morning surrounded by his idiotic worshipers and toadies and ballotbox stuffers  well if you please thats mr paul hathawaythe honorable paul hathaway who washed his hands of me my dear at the beginning  but really yerba i thought that he looked and acted  you thought of nothing at all milly returned yerba with authority i tell you hes a mass of conceit  what else can you expect of a mantoadied and fawned upon to that extent  it made me sick  i could have just shaken them  as if to emphasize her statement she grasped one of the long willowy branches of the enormous rosebush where she stood and shook it lightly  the action detached a few of the maturer blossoms and sent down a shower of faded pink petals on her dark hair and yellow dress i cant bear conceit she added  oh yerba just stand as you are  i do wish the girls could see you you make the loveliest picture  she certainly did look very pretty as she stood therea few leaves lodged in her hair clinging to her dress and suggesting by reflection the color that her delicate satin skin would have resented in its own texture  but she turned impatiently awayperhaps not before she had allowed this passing vision to impress the mind of her devoted adherentand said come along or that dreadful man will be out on the veranda again  but if you dislike him so why did you accept the invitation to meet him here at luncheon said the curious milly  i didnt accept the mother superior did for me because hes the mayor of san francisco visiting your uncle and shes always anxious to placate the powers that be  and i thought he might have some information that i could get out of him  and it was better than being in the convent all day  and i thought i could stand him if you were here  milly gratefully accepted this doubtful proof of affection by squeezing her companions arm  and you didnt get any information dear  of course not  the idiot knows only the old tradition of his officethat i was a mysterious trust left in mayor hammersleys hands he actually informed me that buena meant good that it was likely the name of the captain of some whaler that put into san francisco in the early days whose child i was and that if i chose to call myself miss good he would allow it and get a bill passed in the legislature to legalize it  think of it my dear miss good like one of mrs barbaulds stories or a moral governess in the primary reader  miss good repeated milly innocently  yes you might put an e at the endgdoubleode  there are goodes in philadelphia and then you wont have to sacrifice that sweet pretty yerba thats so stylish and musical for youd still be yerba good but she added as yerba made an impatient gesture why do you worry yourself about that  you wouldnt keep your own name long whatever it was  an heiress like you dearlovely and accomplishedwould have the best names as well as the best men in america to choose from  now please dont repeat that idiots words  thats what he says thats what they all say returned yerba pettishly  one would really think it was necessary for me to get married to become anybody at all or have any standing whatever  and whatever you do dont go talking of me as if i were named after a vegetable yerba buena is the name of an island in the bay just off san francisco  im named after that  but i dont see the difference dear  the island was named after the vine that grows on it  you dont see the difference said yerba darkly  well i do but what are you looking at  her companion had caught her arm and was gazing intently at the house  yerba she said quickly theres the mayor and uncle and a strange gentleman coming down the walk  theyre looking for us and as i live yerb the strange gentleman is that young senator mr hathaway  mr hathaway  nonsense  look for yourself  yerba glanced at the three gentlemen who a hundred yards distant were slowly advancing in the direction of the ceanothushedge behind which the girls had instinctively strayed during their conversation  what are you going to do said milly eagerly  theyre coming straight this way  shall we stay here and let them pass or make a run for the house  no said yerba to millys great surprise  that would look as if we cared  besides i dont know that mr hathaway has come to see me well stroll out and meet them accidentally  milly was still more astonished  however she said wait a moment dear and with the instinctive deftness of her sex in three small tugs and a gentle hitch shook yerbas gown into perfect folds passed her fingers across her forehead and over her ears securing however with a hairpin on their passage three of the rose petals where they had fallen  then discharging their faces of any previous expression these two charming hypocrites sallied out innocently into the walk nothing could be more natural than their manner if a criticism might be ventured upon it was that their elbows were slightly drawn inwards and before them leaving their hands gracefully advanced in the line of their figures an attitude accepted throughout the civilized world of deportment as indicating fastidious refinement not unmingled with permissible hauteur  the three gentlemen lifted their hats at this ravishing apparition and halted  the mayor advanced with great politeness  i feared you didnt hear me call you miss yerba so we ventured to seek you  as the two girls exchanged almost infantile glances of surprise he continued mr paul hathaway has done us the honor of seeking you here as he did not find you at the convent  you may have forgotten that mr hathaway is the third one of your trustees  and so inefficient and worthless that i fear he doesnt count said paul but raising his eyes to yerbas i fancy that i have already had the pleasure of seeing you and i fear the mortification of having disturbed you and your friends in the parlor of the golden gate hotel yesterday  the two girls looked at each other with the same childlike surprise yerba broke the silence by suddenly turning to milly certainly you remember how greatly interested we were in the conversation of a party of gentlemen who were there when we came in  i am afraid our foolish prattle must have disturbed you  i know that we were struck with the intelligent and eloquent devotion of your friends  oh perfectly chimed in the loyal but somewhat infelix milly and it was so kind and thoughtful of mr hathaway to take them away as he did  i felt the more embarrassed continued hathaway smiling but still critically examining yerba for an indication of something characteristic beyond this palpable conventionality as i unfortunately must present my credentials from a gentleman as much of a stranger as myselfcolonel pendleton  the tradewind was evidently making itself felt even in this pastoral retreat for the two gentlemen appeared to shrink slightly within themselves and a chill seemed to have passed over the group  the mayor coughed  the avuncular woods gazed abstractedly at a large cactus  even paul prepared by previous experience stopped short  colonel pendleton  oh do tell me all about him flashed out yerba suddenly with clasped hands and eager girlish breath  paul cast a quick grateful glance at the girl  whether assumed or not her enthusiastic outburst was effective  the mayor looked uneasily at woods and turned to paul  ah yes  you and he are original cotrustees  i believe pendleton is in reduced circumstances  never quite got over that bank trouble  that is only a question of legislative investigation and relief said paul lightly yet with purposely vague official mystery of manner then turning quickly to yerba as if replying to the only real question at issue he continued pointedly i am sorry to say the colonels health is so poor that it keeps him quite a recluse i have a letter from him and a message for you  his bright eyes added plainlyas soon as we can get rid of those people  then you think that a billbegan the mayor eagerly  i think my dear sir said paul plaintively that i and my friends have already tried the patience of these two young ladies quite enough yesterday with politics and lawmaking  i have to catch the sixoclock train to san francisco this evening and have already lost the time i hoped to spend with miss yerba by missing her at the convent  let me stroll on here if you like and if i venture to monopolize the attention of this young lady for half an hour you my dear mr mayor who have more frequent access to her i know will not begrudge it to me  he placed himself beside yerba and milly and began an entertaining although i fear slightly exaggerated account of his reception by the lady superior and her evident doubts of his identity with the trustee mentioned in pendletons letter of introduction  i confess she frightened me he continued when she remarked that according to my statement i could have been only eighteen years old when i became your guardian and as much in want of one as you were  i think that only her belief that mr woods and the mayor would detect me as an impostor provoked her at last to tell me your whereabouts  but why did they ever make you a trustee for goodness sake said milly naively  was there no one grown up at that time that they could have called upon  those were the early days of california responded paul with great gravity although he was conscious that yerba was regarding him narrowly and i probably looked older and more intelligent than i really was  for candidly with the consciousness of yerbas eyes still upon him i remember very little about it  i dare say i was selected as you kindly suggest for goodness sake  after all said the volatile milly who seemed inclined as chaperone to direct the conversation there was something pretty and romantic about it  you two poor young things taking care of each other for of course there were no women here in those days  of course there were women here interrupted yerba quickly with a halfmeaning halfinterrogative glance at paul that made him instinctively uneasy  you later comersto millyalways seem to think that there was nothing here before you  she paused and then added with a naive mixture of reproach and coquetry that was as charming as it was unexpected as to taking care of each other mr hathaway very quickly got rid of me i believe  but i left you in better hands miss yerba and let me thank you now he added in a lower tone for recognizing it as you did a moment ago im glad that you instinctively liked colonel pendleton  had you known him better you would have seen how truthful that instinct was  his chief fault in the eyes of our worthy friends is that he reminds them of a great deal they cant perpetuate and much they would like to forget  he checked himself abruptly  but here is your letter he resumed drawing colonel pendletons missive from his pocket perhaps you would like to read it now in case you have any message to return by me  miss woods and i will excuse you  they had reached the end of the rosealley where a summerhouse that was in itself a rosebower partly disclosed itself  the other gentlemen had lagged behind  i will amuse myself and console your other guardian dear said the vivacious milly with a rapid exchange of glances with yerba until this horrid business is over  besides she added with cheerful vagueness after so long a separation you must have a great deal to say to each other  paul smiled as she rustled away and yerba entering the summerhouse sat down and opened the letter  the young man remained leaning against the rustic archway occasionally glancing at her and at the moving figures in the gardens  he was conscious of an odd excitement which he could trace to no particular cause  it was true that he had been annoyed at not finding the young girl at the convent and at having to justify himself to the lady superior for what he conceived to be an act of gratuitous kindness nor was he blind to the fact that his persistence in following her was more an act of aggression against the enemies of pendleton than of concern for yerba  she was certainly pretty he could not remember her mother sufficiently to trace any likeness and he had never admired the mothers pronounced beauty  she had flashed out for an instant into what seemed originality and feeling  but it had passed and she had asked no further questions in regard to the colonel  she had hurriedly skimmed through the letter which seemed to be composed of certain figures and accounts  i suppose its all right she said at least you can say so if he asks you  its only an explanation why he has transferred my money from the bank to rothschilds agent years ago  i dont see why it should interest me now  paul made no doubt that it was the same transfer that had shipwrecked the colonels fortune and alienated his friends and could not help replying somewhat pointedly but i think it should miss yerba  i dont know what the colonel explained to youdoubtless not the whole truth for he is not a man to praise himself but the fact is the bank was in difficulties at the time of that transfer and to make it he sacrificed his personal fortune and i think awakened some of that illfeeling you have just noticed  he checked himself too late he had again lost not only his tact and selfcontrol but had nearly betrayed himself he was surprised that the girls justifiable ignorance should have irritated him  yet she had evidently not noticed or misunderstood it for she said with a certain precision that was almost studied  yes i suppose it would have been a terrible thing to him to have been suspected of misappropriating a trust confided to him by parties who had already paid him the high compliment of confiding to his care a secret and a fortune  paul glanced at her quickly with astonishment  was this ignorance or suspicion  her manner however suddenly changed with the charming capriciousness of youth and conscious beauty  he speaks of you in this letter she said letting her dark eyes rest on him provokingly  that accounts for your lack of interest then said paul gayly relieved to turn a conversation fraught with so much danger  but he speaks very flatteringly she went on  he seems to be another one of your admirers  im sure mr hathaway after that scene in the hotel parlor yesterday you at least cannot complain of having been misrepresented before me  to tell you the truth i think i hated you a little for it  you were quite right returned paul  i must have been insufferable and i admit that i was slightly piqued against you for the idolatries showered upon you at the same moment by your friends  usually when two young people have reached the point of confidingly exchanging their first impressions of each other some progress has been made in first acquaintance  but it did not strike paul in that way and yerbas next remark was discouraging  but im rather disappointed for all that  colonel pendleton tells me you know nothing of my family or of the secret  paul was this time quite prepared and withstood the girls scrutiny calmly  do you think he asked lightly that even he knows  of course he does she returned quickly  do you suppose he would have taken all that trouble you have just talked about if he didnt know it  and feared the consequences perhaps she added with a slight return of her previous expressive manner  again paul was puzzled and irritated he knew not why  but he only said pleasantly i differ from you there  i am afraid that such a thing as fear never entered into colonel pendletons calculations on any subject  i think he would act the same towards the highest and the lowest the powerful or the most weak  as she glanced at him quickly and mischievously he added i am quite willing to believe that his knowledge of you made his duty pleasanter  he was again quite sincere and his slight sympathy had that irresistible quality of tone and look which made him so dangerous for he was struck with the pretty soothed selfcomplacency that had shone in her face since he had spoken of pendletons equal disinterestedness it seemed too as if what he had taken for passion or petulance in her manner had been only a resistance to some continual aggression of condition  with that remainder held in check a certain latent nobility was apparent as of her true self  in this moment of pleased abstraction she had drawn through the latticework of one of the windows a spray of roses clinging to the vine and with her graceful head a little on one side was softly caressing her cheek with it  she certainly was very pretty from the crown of her dark little head to the narrow rosetted slippers that had been idly tapping the ground but now seemed to press it more proudly with arched insteps and small ankles she was pleasant to look upon  but you surely have something else to think about miss yerba said the young man with conviction  in a few months you will be of age and rid of those dreadfully stupid guardians with your  the loosened rosespray flew from her hand out of the window as she made a gesture half real half assumed of imploring supplication oh please mr hathaway for heavens sake dont you begin too you are going to say that with my wealth my accomplishments my beauty my friends what more can i want  what do i care about a secret that can neither add to them nor take them away  yes you were  its the regular thing to sayeverybody says it  why i should have thought the youngest senator could afford to have been more original  i plead guilty to all the weaknesses of humanity said paul warmly again beginning to believe that he had been most unjust to her independence  well i forgive you because you have forgotten to say that if i dont like the name of yerba buena i could so easily change that too  but you do like it said paul touched with this first hearing of her name in her own musical accents or would like it if you heard yourself pronounce it  it suddenly recurred to him with a strange thrill of pleasure that he himself had given it to her it was as if he had created some musical instrument to which she had just given voice  in his enthusiasm he had thrown himself on the bench beside her in an attitude that i fear was not as dignified as became his elderly office  but you dont think that is my name said the girl quickly  i beg your pardon said paul hesitatingly  you dont think that anybody would have been so utterly idiotic as to call me after a groundvinea vegetable she continued petulantly  eh stammered paul  a name that could be so easily translated she went on half scornfully and when translated was no possible title for anybody think of itmiss good herb  it is too ridiculous for anything  paul was not usually wanting in selfpossession in an emergency or in skill to meet attack  but he was so convinced of the truth of the girls accusation and now recalled so vividly his own consternation on hearing the result of his youthful and romantic sponsorship for the first time from pendleton that he was struck with confusion  but what do you suppose it was intended for he said at last vaguely  it was certainly yerba buena in the trust  at least i suppose so he corrected himself hurriedly  it is only a supposition she said quietly for you know it cannot be proved  the trust was never recorded and the only copy could not be found among mr hammersleys papers  it is only part of the name of which the first is lost  part of the name repeated paul uneasily  part of it  it is a corruption of de la yerba buenaof the yerba buenaand refers to the island of yerba buena in the bay and not to the plant  that island was part of the property of my familythe arguellosyou will find it so recorded in the spanish grants  my name is arguello de la yerba buena  it is impossible to describe the timid yet triumphant the halfappealing yet complacent conviction of the girls utterance  a moment before paul would have believed it impossible for him to have kept his gravity and his respect for his companion under this egregious illusion  but he kept both  for a sudden conviction that she suspected the truth and had taken this audacious and original plan of crushing it overpowered all other sense  the arguellos it flashed upon him were an old spanish family former owners of yerba buena island who had in the last years become extinct  there had been a story that one of them had eloped with an american ship captains wife at monterey  the legendary history of early spanish california was filled with more remarkable incidents corroborated with little difficulty from spanish authorities who it was alleged lent themselves readily to any fabrication or forgery  there was no racial pride on the contrary they had shown an eager alacrity to ally themselves with their conquerors  the friends of the arguellos would be proud to recognize and remember in the american heiress the descendant of their countrymen  all this passed rapidly through his mind after the first moment of surprise all this must have been the deliberate reasoning of this girl of seventeen whose dark eyes were bent upon him  whether she was seeking corroboration or complicity he could not tell  have you found this out yourself he asked after a pause  yes  one of my friends at the convent was josita castro she knew all the history of the arguellos  she is perfectly satisfied  for an instant paul wondered if it was a joint conception of the two schoolgirls  but on reflection he was persuaded that yerba would commit herself to no accompliceof her own sex  she might have dominated the girl and would make her a firm partisan while the girl would be convinced of it herself and believe herself a free agent  he had had such experience with men himself  but why have you not spoken of it beforeand to colonel pendleton  he did not choose to tell me said yerba with feminine dexterity i have preferred to keep it myself a secret till i am of age  when colonel pendleton and some of the other trustees have no right to say anything thought paul quickly  she had evidently trusted him yet fascinated as he had been by her audacity he did not know whether to be pleased or the reverse  he would have preferred to be placed on an equal footing with josita castro  she anticipated his thoughts by saying with halfraised eyelids  what do you think of it  it seems to be so natural and obvious an explanation of the mystery that i only wonder it was not thought of before said paul with that perfect sincerity that made his sympathy so effective  you seestill under her pretty eyelids and the tender promise of a smile parting her little mouthim believing that you tell the truth when you say you dont know anything about it  it was a desperate moment with paul but his sympathetic instincts and possibly his luck triumphed  his momentary hesitation easily simulated the caution of a conscientious man his knit eyebrows and bright eyes lowered in an effort of memory did the rest  i remember it all so indistinctly he said with literal truthfulness there was a veiled lady present tall and dark to whom mayor hammersley and the colonel showed a singular and it struck me as an almost superstitious respect  i remember now distinctly i was impressed with the reverential way they both accompanied her to the door at the end of the interview  he raised his eyes slightly the young girls red lips were parted that illumination of the skin which was her nearest approach to color had quite transfigured her face  he felt suddenly that she believed it yet he had no sense of remorse  he half believed it himself at least he remembered the nobility of the mothers selfrenunciation and its effect upon the two men  why should not the daughter preserve this truthful picture of her mothers momentary exaltation  which was the most truthfulthat or the degrading facts  you speak of a secret he added  i can remember little more than that the mayor asked me to forget from that moment the whole occurrence  i did not know at the time how completely i should fulfill his request  you must remember miss yerba as your lady superior has that i was absurdly young at the time  i dont know but that i may have thought in my youthful inexperience that this sort of thing was of common occurrence and then i had my own future to makeand youth is brutally selfish  i was quite friendless and unknown when i left san francisco for the mines at the time you entered the convent as yerba buena  she smiled and made a slight impulsive gesture as if she would have drawn nearer to him but checked herself still smiling and without embarrassment  it may have been a movement of youthful camaraderie and that occasional maternal rather than sisterly instinct which sometimes influences a young girls masculine friendship and elevates the favored friend to the plane of the doll she has outgrown  as he turned towards her however she rose shook out her yellow dress and said with pretty petulance  then you must go so soonand this your first and last visit as my guardian  no one could regret that more than i looking at her with undefined meaning  yes she said with a tantalizing coquetry that might have suggested an underlying seriousness  i think you have lost a good deal perhaps so have i  we might have been good friends in all these years  but that is past  why  surely i hope my shortcomings with miss yerba buena will not be remembered by miss arguello sail paul earnestly  ah  she may be a very different person  i hope not said the young man warmly  but how different  well she may not put herself in the way of receiving such pointblank compliments as that said the young girl demurely  not from her guardian  she will have no guardian then  she said this gravely but almost at the same moment turned and sat down again throwing her linked hands over her knee and looked at him mischievously  you see what you have lost sir  i see said paul but with all the gravity that she had dropped  no but you dont see all  i had no brotherno friend  you might have been both  you might have made me what you liked  you might have educated me far better than these teachers or at least given me some pride in my studies  there were so many things i wanted to know that they couldnt teach me so many times i wanted advice from some one that i could trust  colonel pendleton was very good to me when he came he always treated me like a princess even when i wore short frocks  it was his manner that first made me think he knew my family but i never felt as if i could tell him anything and i dont think with all his chivalrous respect he ever understood me  as to the othersthe mayorswell you may judge from mr henderson  it is a wonder that i did not run away or do something desperate  now are you not a little sorry  her voice which had as many capricious changes as her manner had been alternately coquettish petulant and serious had now become playful again  but like the rest of her sex she was evidently more alert to her surroundings at such a moment than her companion for before he could make any reply she said without apparently looking but there is a deputation coming for you mr hathaway you see the case is hopeless  you never would be able to give to one what is claimed by the many  paul glanced down the rosealley and saw that the deputation in question was composed of the mayor mr woods a thin delicatelooking womanevidently mrs woodsand milly  the latter managed to reach the summerhouse first with apparently youthful alacrity but really to exchange in a single glance some mysterious feminine signal with yerba  then she said with breathless infelicity  before you two get bored with each other now i must tell you theres a chance of you having more time  aunty has promised to send off a note excusing you to the reverend mother if she can persuade mr hathaway to stay over tonight  but here they are to yerba  aunty is most anxious and wont hear of his going  indeed it seemed as if mrs woods was after a refined fashion most concerned that a distinguished visitor like mr hathaway should have to use her house as a mere accidental meetingplace with his ward without deigning to accept her hospitality  she was reinforced by mr woods who enunciated the same idea with more masculine vigor and by the mayor who expressed his conviction that a slight of this kind to rosario would be felt in the santa clara valley  after dinner my dear hathaway concluded mr woods a few of our neighbors may drop in who would be glad to shake you by the handno formal meeting my boybut hang it they expect it  paul looked around for yerba  there was really no reason why he shouldnt accept although an hour ago the idea had never entered his mind  yet if he did he would like the girl to know that it was for her sake  unfortunately far from exhibiting any concern in the matter she seemed to be preoccupied with milly and only the charming back of her head was visible behind mrs woods  he accepted however with a hesitation that took some of the graciousness from his yielding and a sense that he was giving a strange importance to a trivial circumstance  the necessity of attaching himself to his hostess and making a more extended tour of the grounds for a while diverted him from an uneasy consideration of his past interview  mrs woods had known yerba through the school friendship of milly and as far as the religious rules of the convent would allow had always been delighted to show her any hospitality  she was a beautiful girldid not mr hathaway think soand a girl of great character  it was a pity of course that she had never known a mothers care and that the present routine of a boardingschool had usurped the tender influences of home  she believed too that the singular rotation of guardianship had left the girl practically without a counseling friend to rely upon except perhaps colonel pendleton and while she mrs woods did not for a moment doubt that the colonel might be a good friend and a pleasant companion of men really he mr hathaway must admit that with his reputation and habits he was hardly a fit associate for a young lady indeed mr woods would have never allowed milly to invite yerba here if colonel pendleton was to have been her escort  of course the poor girl could not choose her own guardian but mr woods said he had a right to choose who should be his nieces company  perhaps mr woods was prejudicedmost men wereyet surely mr hathaway although a loyal friend of colonel pendletons must admit that when it was an open scandal that the colonel had fought a duel about a notoriously common woman and even blasphemously defended her before a party of gentlemen it was high time as mr woods said that he should be remanded to their company exclusively  no mrs woods could not admit that this was owing to the injustice of her own sex  men are really the ones who make the fuss over those things just as they as mr hathaway well knew made the laws no it was a great pity as she and her husband had just agreed that mr hathaway of all the guardians could not have been always the help and counselorin fact the elder brotherof poor yerba paul was conscious that he winced slightly consistently and conscientiously at the recollection of certain passages of his youth inconsistently and meanly at this suggestion of a joint relationship with yerbas mother  i think too continued mrs woods she has worried foolishly about this ridiculous mystery of her parentageas if it could make the slightest difference to a girl with a quarter of a million or as if that didnt show quite conclusively that she was somebody  certainly said paul quickly with a relief that he nevertheless felt was ridiculous  and of course i dare say it will all come out when she is of age  i suppose you know if any of the family are still living  i really do not  i beg your pardon said mrs woods with a smile  i forgot its a profound secret until then  but here we are at the house i see the girls have walked over to our neighbors  perhaps you would like to have a few moments to yourself before you dress for dinner and your portmanteau which has been sent for comes from your hotel  you must be tired of seeing so many people  paul was glad to accept any excuse for being alone and thanking his hostess followed a servant to his rooma lowceilinged but luxuriously furnished apartment on the first floor  here he threw himself on a cushioned lounge that filled the angle of the deep embrasurethe thickness of the old adobe wallsthat formed a part of the woodenlatticed window  a cape jessamine climbing beside it filled the room with its subtle intoxicating perfume  it was so strong and he felt himself so irresistibly overpowered and impelled towards a merely idle reverie that in order to think more clearly and shut out some strange and unreasoning enthrallment of his senses he rose and sharply closed the window  then he sat down and reflected  what was he doing here and what was the meaning of all this  he had come simply to fulfill a duty to his past and please a helpless and misunderstood old acquaintance  he had performed that duty  but he had incidentally learned a certain fact that might be important to this friend and clearly his duty was simply to go back and report it  he would gain nothing more in the way of corroboration of it by staying now if further corroboration were required  colonel pendleton had already been uselessly and absurdly perplexed about the possible discovery of the girls parentage and its effect upon her fortunes and herself  she had just settled that of her own accord and without committing herself or others had suggested a really sensible plan by which all trouble would be avoided in future  that was the commonsense way of looking at it  he would lay the plan before the colonel have him judge of its expediency and its ethicsand even the question whether she already knew the real truth or was selfdeceived that done he would return to his own affairs in sacramento  there was nothing difficult in this or that need worry him only he could have done it just as well an hour ago  he opened the window again  the scent of the jessamine came in as before but mingled with the cooler breath of the roses  there was nothing intoxicating or unreal in it now rather it seemed a gentle aromatic stimulantof thought  long shadows of unseen poplars beyond barred the garden lanes and alleys with bands of black and yellow  a slanting pencil of sunshine through the trees was for a moment focussed on a bed of waxen callas before a hedge of ceanothus and struck into dazzling relief the cold white chalices of the flowers and the vivid shining green of their background presently it slid beyond to a tiny fountain before invisible and wrought a blinding miracle out of its flashing and leaping spray yet even as he gazed the fountain seemed to vanish slowly the sunbeam slipped on and beyond it moved the shimmer of white and yellow dresses  it was yerba and milly returning to the house well he would not interrupt his reflections by idly watching them he would probably see a great deal of yerba that evening and by that time he would have come to some conclusion in regard to her  but he had not taken into consideration her voice which always musical in its southern intonation and quite audible in the quiet garden struck him now as being full of joyous sweetness  well she was certainly very happyor very thoughtless  she was actually romping with milly and was now evidently being chased down the rosealley by that volatile young woman  then these swift camillas apparently neared the house there was the rapid rustle of skirts the skurrying of little feet on the veranda a stumble a mouselike shriek from milly and her voice exhausted dying happy broken with halfhushed laughter rose to him on the breath of the jessamine and rose  surely she was a child and if a child how he had misjudged her what if all that he had believed was mature deliberation was only the innocent imaginings of a romantic girl all that he had taken seriously only a schoolgirls foolish dream  instead of combating it instead of reasoning with her instead of trying to interest her in other things he had even helped on her illusions  he had treated her as if the taint of her mothers worldliness and knowledge of evil was in her pure young flesh  he had recognized her as the daughter of an adventuress and not as his ward appealing to his chivalry through her very ignoranceit might be her very childish vanity  he had brought to a question of tender and pathetic interest only his selfish opinion of the world and the weaknesses of mankind  the blood came to his cheekswith all his experienced selfcontrol he had not lost the youthful trick of blushingand he turned away from the window as if it had breathed a reproach  but ought he have even contented himself with destroying her illusionsought he not have gone farther and told her the whole truth ought he not first have won her confidencehe remembered bitterly now how she had intimated that she had no one to confide inand after revealing her mothers history have still pledged himself to keep the secret from all others and assisted her in her plan  it would not have altered the state of affairs except so far as she was concerned they could have combined together his ready wit would have helped him and his sympathy would have sustained her but  how and in what way could he have told her  leaving out the delicate and difficult periphrase by which her mothers shame would have to be explained to an innocent schoolgirlwhat right could he have assumed to tell it  as the guardian who had never counseled or protected her as an acquaintance of hardly an hour ago  who would have such a right a loveron whose lips it would only seem a tacit appeal to her gratitude or her fears and whom no sensitive girl could accept thereafter  no  a husband  yes  he remembered with a sudden start what pendleton had said to him good heavens  had pendleton that idea in his mind  and yetit seemed the only solution  a knock at his door was followed by the appearance of mr woods mr hathaways portmanteau had come and mrs woods had sent a message saying that in view of the limited time that mr hathaway would have with his ward mrs woods would forego her right to keep him at her side at dinner and yield her place to yerba  paul thanked him with a grave inward smile  what if he made his dramatic disclosure to her confidentially over the soup and fish yet in his constantly recurring conviction of the girls independence he made no doubt she would have met his brutality with unflinching pride and selfpossession  he began to dress slowly at times almost forgetting himself in a new kind of pleasant apathy which he attributed to the odor of the flowers and the softer hush of twilight that had come on with the dying away of the trade winds and the restful spice of the baytrees near his window he presently found himself not so much thinking of yerba as of seeing her  a picture of her in the summerhouse caressing her cheek with the roses seemed to stand out from the shadows of the blank wall opposite him  when he passed into the dressingroom beyond it was not his own face he saw in the glass but hers  it was with a start as if he had heard her voice that he found upon his dressingtable a small vase containing a flower for his coat with the penciled words on a card in a schoolgirls hand from yerba with thanks for staying  it must have been placed there by a servant while he was musing at the window  half a dozen people were already in the drawingroom when paul descended  it appeared that mr woods had invited certain of his neighborsamong them a judge baker and his wife and don caesar briones of the adjacent rancho of los pajaros and his sister the dona anna  milly and yerba had not yet appeared  don caesar a young man of a toreador build roundly bland in face and murky in eye seemed to notice their absence and kept his glances towards the door while paul engaged in conversation with dona annaif that word could convey an impression of a conventionality which that goodhumored young lady converted into an animated flirtation at the second sentence with a single glance and two shakes of her fan  and then milly fluttered ina vision of schoolgirl freshness and white tulle and a moment laterwith a pause of expectationa tall graceful figure that at first paul scarcely recognized  it is a popular conceit of our sex that we are superior to any effect of feminine adornment and that a pretty girl is equally pretty in the simplest frock  yet there was not a man in the room who did not believe that yerba in her present attire was not only far prettier than before but that she indicated a new and more delicate form of beauty it was not the mere revelation of contour and color of an ordinary decollete dress it was a perfect presentment of pure symmetry and carriage  in this black grenadine dress trimmed with jet not only was the delicate satin sheen of her skin made clearer by contrast but she looked every inch her full height with an ideal exaltation of breeding and culture  she wore no jewelry except a small necklace of pearlsso small it might have been a childsthat fitted her slender throat so tightly that it could scarcely be told from the flesh that it clasped  paul did not know that it was the gift of the mother to the child that she had forsworn only a few weeks before she parted from her forever but he had a vague feeling that in that sable dress that seemed like mourning she walked at the funeral of her mothers past a few white flowers in her corsage the companions of the solitary one in his buttonhole were the only relief  their eyes met for a single moment the look of admiration in pauls being answered by the naive consciousness in yerbas of a woman looking her best but the next moment she appeared preoccupied with the others and the eager advances of don caesar  your brother seems to admire miss yerba said paul  ah yees returned dona anna  and you  oh said paul gayly i  i am her guardianwith me it is simple egotism you know  ah returned the arch dona anna you are then already so certain of her  good  i shall warn him  a precaution that did seem necessary as later when paul at a signal from his hostess offered his arm to yerba the young spaniard regarded him with a look of startled curiosity  i thank you for selecting me to wear your colors said paul with a glance at the flowers in her corsage as they sat at table and i think i deserve them since but for you i should have been on my way to san francisco at this moment  shall i have an opportunity of talking to you a few minutes later in the evening he added in a lower tone  why not now returned yerba mischievously  we are set here expressly for that purpose  surely not to talk of our own businessi should say of our family affairs said paul looking at her with equal playfulness though i believe your friend don caesar opposite would be more pleased if he were sure that was all we did  and you think his sister would share in that pleasure retorted yerba  i warn you mr hathaway that you have been quite justifying the reverend mothers doubts about your venerable pretensions everybody is staring at you now  paul looked up mechanically  it was true  whether from some occult sympathy from a human tendency to admire obvious fitness and symmetry or the innocent love with which the world regards innocent lovers they were all observing yerba and himself with undisguised attention  a good talker he quickly led the conversation to other topics  it was then that he discovered that yerba was not only accomplished but that this conventbred girl had acquired a singular breadth of knowledge apart from the ordinary routine of the school curriculum  she spoke and thought with independent perceptions and clearness yet without the tactlessness and masculine abruptness that is apt to detract from feminine originality of reflection  by some tacit understanding that had the charm of mutual confidence they both exerted themselves to please the company rather than each other and paul in the interchange of sallies with dona anna had a certain pleasure in hearing yerba converse in spanish with don caesar  but in a few moments he observed with some uneasiness that they were talking of the old spanish occupation and presently of the old spanish families  would she prematurely expose an ignorance that might be hereafter remembered against her or invite some dreadful genealogical reminiscence that would destroy her hopes and raze her spanish castles  or was she simply collecting information  he admired the dexterity with which without committing herself she made don caesar openly and even confidentially communicative  and yet he was on thorns at times it seemed as if he himself were playing a part in this imposture of yerbas  he was aware that his wandering attention was noticed by the quickwitted dona anna when he regained his selfpossession by what appeared to be a happy diversion  it was the voice of mrs judge baker calling across the table to yerba  by one of the peculiar accidents of general conversation it was the one apparently trivial remark that in a pause challenged the ears of all  we were admiring your necklace miss yerba  every eye was turned upon the slender throat of the handsome girl the excuse was so natural  yerba put her hand to her neck with a smile  you are joking mrs baker  i know it is ridiculously small but it is a childs necklace and i wear it because it was a gift from my mother  pauls heart sank again with consternation  it was the first time he had heard the girl distinctly connect herself with her actual mother and for an instant he felt as startled as if the forgotten outcast herself had returned and taken a seat at the board  i told you it couldnt be so remarked mrs baker to her husband  everybody naturally looked inquiringly upon the couple and mrs baker explained with a smile bob thinks hes seen it before men are so obstinate  pardon me miss yerba said the judge blandly would you mind showing it to me if it is not too much trouble  not at all said yerba smiling and detaching the circlet from her neck  im afraid youll find it rather oldfashioned  thats just what i hope to find it said judge baker with a triumphant glance at his wife  it was eight years ago when i saw it in tuckers jewelry shop  i wanted to buy it for my little minnie but as the price was steep i hesitated and when i did make up my mind he had disposed of it to another customer  yes he added examining the necklace which yerba had handed to him  i am certain it is the same it was unique like this  odd isnt it  everybody said it was odd and looked upon the occurrence with that unreasoning satisfaction with which average humanity receives the most trivial and unmeaning coincidences  it was left to don caesar to give it a gallant application  i have nota the pleasure of knowinga the miss minnie but the jewelry when she arrives to the throata of miss yerba she has not lost the valuethe beautythe charm  no said woods cheerily  the fact is baker you were too slow miss yerbas folks gobbled up the necklace while you were thinking you were a newcomer  old fortyniners did not hesitate over a thing they wanted  you never knew who was your successful rival eh said dona anna turning to judge baker with a curious glance at pauls pale face in passing  no said baker buthe stopped with a hesitating laugh and some little confusion  no ive mixed it up with something else its so long ago  i never knew or if i did ive forgotten  but the necklace i remember  he handed it back to yerba with a bow and the incident ended  paul had not looked at yerba during this conversation an unreasoning instinct that he might confuse her an equally unreasoning dread that he might see her confused by others possessing him  and when he did glance at her calm untroubled face that seemed only a little surprised at his own singular coldness he was by no means relieved he was only convinced of one thing  in the last five minutes he had settled upon the irrevocable determination that his present relations with the girl could exist no longer  he must either tell her everything or see her no more  there was no middle course  she was on the brink of an exposure at any moment either through her ignorance or her unhappy pretension  in his intolerable position he was equally unable to contemplate her peril accept her defense or himself defend her  as if with some feminine instinct she had attributed his silence to some jealousy of don caesars attentions she more than once turned from the spaniard to paul with an assuring smile  in his anxiety he half accepted the rather humiliating suggestion and managed to say to her in a lower tone  on this last visit of your american guardian one would think you need not already anticipate your spanish relations  he was thrilled with the mischievous yet faintly tender pleasure that sparkled in her eyes as she said  you forget it is my american guardians first visit as well as his last  and as your guardian he went on with halfveiled seriousness i protest against your allowing your treasures the property of the trust he gazed directly into her beautiful eyes being handled and commented upon by everybody  when the ladies had left the table he was for a moment relieved but only for a moment  judge baker drew his chair beside pauls and taking his cigar from his lips said with a perfunctory laugh  i say hathaway i pulled up just in time to save myself from making an awful speech just now to your ward  paul looked at him with cold curiosity  yes  gad  do you know who was my rival in that necklace transaction  no said paul with frigid carelessness  why kate howard  fact sir  she bought it right under my noseand overbid me too  paul did not lose his selfpossession  thanks to the fact that yerba was not present and that don caesar who had overheard the speech moved forward with a suggestive and unpleasant smile his agitation congealed into a coldly placid fury  and i suppose he returned with perfect calmness that after the usual habit of this class of women the necklace very soon found its way back through the pawnbroker to the jeweler again its a common fate  yes of course said judge baker cheerfully  youre quite right thats undoubtedly the solution of it  but with a laugh i had a narrow escape from saying somethingeh  a very narrow escape from an apparently gratuitous insult said paul gravely but fixing his eyes now more luminous than ever with anger not on the speakers but on the face of don caesar who was standing at his side  you were about to say  ehohah this kate howard  so  i have heard of heryees and miss yerbaahshe is of my countryi think  yeswe shall claim herof a truthyes  your countrymen i believe are in the habit of making claims that are more often founded on profit than verity said paul with smileless and insulting deliberation  he knew perfectly what he was saying and the result he expected  only twentyfour hours before he had smiled at pendletons idea of averting scandal and discovery by fighting yet he was endeavoring to pick a quarrel with a man merely on suspicion for the same purpose and he saw nothing strange in it  a vague idea too that this would irrevocably confirm him in opposition to yerbas illusions probably determined him  but don caesar albeit smiling lividly did not seem inclined to pick up the gauntlet and woods interfered hastily  don caesar means that your ward has some idea herself that she is of spanish originat least milly says so  but of course as one of the oldest trustees you know the facts  in another moment paul would have committed himself  i think well leave miss yerba out of the question he said coldly  my remark was a general one although of course i am responsible for any personal application of it  spoken like a politician hathaway said judge baker with an effusive enthusiasm which he hoped would atone for the alarming results of his infelicitous speech  thats right gentlemen  you cant get the facts from him before he is ready to give them  keep your secret mr hathaway the court is with you  nevertheless as they passed out of the room to join the ladies the mayor lingered a little behind with woods  its easy to see the influence of that pendleton on our young friend he said significantly  somebody ought to tell him that its played out down hereas pendleton is  its quite enough to ruin his career  paul was too observant not to notice this but it brought him no sense of remorse and his youthful belief in himself and his power kept him from concern  he felt as if he had done something if only to show don caesar that the girls weakness or ignorance could not be traded upon with impunity  but he was still undecided as to the course he should pursue  but he should determine that tonight  at present there seemed no chance of talking to her aloneshe was unconcernedly conversing with milly and mrs woods and already the visitors who had been invited to this hurried levee in his honor were arriving  in view of his late indiscretion he nervously exerted his fullest powers and in a very few minutes was surrounded by a breathless and admiring group of worshipers  a ludicrous resemblance to the scene in the golden gate hotel passed through his mind he involuntarily turned his eyes to seek yerba in the halffear halfexpectation of meeting her mischievous smile their glances met to his surprise hers was smileless and instantly withdrawn but not until he had been thrilled by an unconscious prepossession in its luminous depths that he scarcely dared to dwell upon  what mattered now this passage with don caesar or the plaudits of his friends  she was proud of him  yet after that glance she was shy preoccupying herself with milly or even listening sweetly to judge bakers somewhat practical and unromantic reminiscences of the deprivations and the hardships of california early days as if to condone his past infelicity  she was pleasantly unaffected with don caesar although she managed to draw dona anna into the conversation she was unconventional paul fancied to all but himself  once or twice when he had artfully drawn her towards the open french window that led to the moonlit garden and shadowed veranda she had managed to link millys arm in her own and he was confident that a suggestion to stroll with him in the open air would be followed by her invitation to milly to accompany them disappointed and mortified as he was he found some solace in her manner which he still believed suggested the hope that she might be made accessible to his persuasions  persuasions to what  he did not know  the last guest had departed he lingered on the veranda with a cigar begging his host and hostess not to trouble themselves to keep him company  milly and yerba had retired to the formers boudoir but as they had not yet formally bade him good night there was a chance of their returning  he still stayed on in this hope for half an hour and then accepting yerbas continued absence as a tacit refusal of his request he turned abruptly away but as he glanced around the garden before reentering the house he was struck by a singular circumstancea white patch like a forgotten shawl which he had observed on the distant ceanothus hedge and which had at first thrilled him with expectation had certainly changed its position before it seemed to be near the summerhouse now it was undoubtedly farther away  could they or she alone have slipped from the house and be awaiting him there  with a muttered exclamation at his stupidity he stepped hastily from the veranda and walked towards it but he had scarcely proceeded a dozen yards before it disappeared  he reached the summerhouseit was empty he followed the line of hedgeno one was there  it could not have been her or she would have waited unless he were the victim of a practical joke  he turned impatiently back to the house reentered the drawingroom by the french window and was crossing the halflit apartment when he heard a slight rustle in the shadow of the window  he looked around quickly and saw that it was yerba in a white loose gown for which she had already exchanged her black evening dress leaning back composedly on the sofa her hands clasped behind her shapely head  i am waiting for milly she said with a faint smile on her lips he fancied in the moonlight that streamed upon her that her beautiful face was pale  she has gone to the other wing to see one of the servants who is ill  we thought you were on the veranda smoking and i should have company until i saw you start off and rush up and down the hedge like mad  paul felt that he was losing his selfpossession and becoming nervous in her presence  i thought it was you he stammered  me  out in the garden at this hour alone and in the broad moonlight  what are you thinking of mr hathaway  do you know anything of convent rules or is that your idea of your wards education  he fancied that though she smiled faintly her voice was as tremulous as his own  i want to speak with you he said with awkward directness  i even thought of asking you to stroll with me in the garden  why not talk here she returned changing her position pointing to the other end of the sofa and drawing the whole overflow of her skirt to one side  it is not so very late and milly will return in a few moments  her face was in shadow now but there was a glowworm light in her beautiful eyes that seemed faintly to illuminate her whole face he sank down on the sofa at her side no longer the brilliant and ambitious politician but it seemed to him as hopelessly a dreaming inexperienced boy as when he had given her the name that now was all he could think of and the only word that rose to his feverish lips  yerba  i like to hear you say it she said quickly as if to gloss over his first omission of her formal prefix and leaning a little forward with her eyes on his  one would think you had created it  you almost make me regret to lose it  he stopped  he felt that the last sentence had saved him  it is of that i want to speak he broke out suddenly and almost rudely are you satisfied that it means nothing and can mean nothing to you does it awaken no memory in your mindrecall nothing you care to know think  i beg you i implore you to be frank with me  she looked at him with surprise  i have told you already that my present name must be some absurd blunder or some intentional concealment  but why do you want to know now she continued adding her faint smile to the emphasis  to help you he said eagerly  for that alone  to do all i can to assist you if you really believe and want to believe that you have another  to ask you to confide in me to tell me all you have been told all that you know think you know or want to know about your relationship to the arguellosor toany one  and then to devote myself entirely to proving what you shall say is your desire  you see i am frank with you yerba  i only ask you to be as frank with me to let me know your doubts that i may counsel you your fears that i may give you courage  is that all you came here to tell me she asked quietly  no yerba he said eagerly taking her unresisting but indifferent hand not all but all that i must say all that i have the right to say all that you yerba would permit me to tell you now  but let me hope that the day is not far distant when i can tell you all when you will understand that this silence has been the hardest sacrifice of the man who now speaks to you  and yet not unworthy of a rising politician she added quickly withdrawing her hand  i agree she went on looking towards the door yet without appearing to avoid his eager eyes and when i have settled upon a local habitation and a name we shall renew this interesting conversation  until then as my fourth official guardian used to sayhe was a lawyer mr hathaway like yourselfwhen he was winding up his conjectures on the subjectall that has passed is to be considered without prejudice  but yerbabegan paul bitterly  she slightly raised her hand as if to check him with a warning gesture yes dear she said suddenly lifting her musical voice with a mischievous sideglance at paul as if to indicate her conception of the irony of a possible application this way here we are waiting for you  her listening ear had detected millys step in the passage and in another moment that cheerful young woman discreetly stopped on the threshold of the room with every expression of apologetic indiscretion in her face  we have finished our talk and mr hathaway has been so concerned about my having no real name that he has been promising me everything but his own for a suitable one  havent you mr hathaway  she rose slowly and going over to milly put her arm around her waist and stood for one instant gazing at him between the curtains of the doorway good night  my very proper chaperon is dreadfully shocked at this midnight interview and is taking me away  only think of it milly he actually proposed to me to walk in the garden with him  good night or as my ancestorsdont forget my ancestorsused to say buena nochehasta manana she lingered over the spanish syllables with an imitation of dona annas lisp and with another smile but more faint and more ghostlike than before vanished with her companion  at eight oclock the next morning paul was standing beside his portmanteau on the veranda  but this is a sudden resolution of yours hathaway said mr woods can you not possibly wait for the next train  the girls will be down then and you can breakfast comfortably  i have much to domore than i imaginedin san francisco before i return said paul quickly  you must make my excuses to them and to your wife  i hope said woods with an uneasy laugh you have had no more words with don caesar or he with you  no said paul with a reassuring smile nothing more i assure you  for you know youre a devilish quick fellow hathaway continued woods quite as quick as your friend pendleton  and by the way baker is awfully cut up about that absurd speech of his you know came to me last night and wondered if anybody could think it was intentional  i told him it was dd stupid that was all  i guess his wife had been at him  ha ha  you see he remembers the old times when everybody talked of these things and that woman howard was quite a character  im told she went off to the states years ago  possibly said paul carelessly  after a pause as the carriage drove up to the door he turned to his host  by the way woods have you a ghost here  the house is old enough for one  but no  why  ill swear i saw a figure moving yonder in the shrubbery late last evening and when i came up to it it most unaccountably disappeared  one of don caesars servants i dare say  there is one of them an indian prowling about here ive been told at all hours  ill put a stop to it  well you must go then  dreadfully sorry you couldnt stop longer  goodby    chapter iv  it was two months later that mr tony shear of marysville but lately confidential clerk to the hon paul hathaway entered his employers chambers in sacramento and handed the latter a letter  i only got back from san francisco this morning but mr slate said i was to give you that and if it satisfied you and was what you wanted you would send it back to him  paul took the envelope and opened it  it contained a printers proofslip which he hurriedly glanced over  it read as follows  those of our readers who are familiar with the early history of san francisco will be interested to know that an eccentric and irregular trusteeship vested for the last eight years in the mayor of san francisco and two of our oldest citizens was terminated yesterday by the majority of a beautiful and accomplished young lady a pupil of the convent of santa clara  very few except the original trustees were cognizant of the fact that the administration of the trustees has been a recognized function of the successive mayors of san francisco during this period and the mystery surrounding it has been only lately divulged  it offers a touching and romantic instance of a survival of the old patriarchal duties of the former alcaldes and the simplicity of pioneer days it seems that in the unsettled conditions of the mexican landtitles that followed the american occupation the consumptive widow of a scion of one of the oldest californian families intrusted her property and the custody of her infant daughter virtually to the city of san francisco as represented by the trustees specified until the girl should become of age  within a year the invalid mother died with what loyalty sagacity and prudence these gentlemen fulfilled their trust may be gathered from the fact that the property left in their charge has not only been secured and protected but increased a hundredfold in value and that the young lady who yesterday attained her majority is not only one of the richest landed heiresses on the pacific slope but one of the most accomplished and thoroughly educated of her sex  it is now no secret that this favored child of chrysopolis is the dona maria concepcion de arguello de la yerba buena so called from her ancestral property on the island now owned by the federal government  but it is an affecting and poetic tribute to the parent of her adoption that she has preferred to pass under the old quaintly typical name of the city and has been known to her friends simply as miss yerba buena  it is a no less pleasant and suggestive circumstance that our youngest senator the honorable paul hathaway formerly private secretary to mayor hammersley is one of the original unofficial trustees while the chivalry of the older days is perpetuated in the person of colonel harry pendleton the remaining trustee  as soon as he had finished paul took a pencil and crossed out the last sentence but instead of laying the proof aside or returning it to the waiting secretary he remained with it in his hand his silent set face turned towards the window  whether the merely human secretary was tired of waiting or the devoted partisan saw something on his young chiefs face that disturbed him he turned to paul with that exaggerated respect which his functions as secretary had grafted upon his affection for his old associate and said  i hope nothings wrong sir  not another of those scurrilous attacks on you for putting that bill through to relieve colonel pendleton  yet it was a risky thing for you sir  paul started recovered himself as if from some remote abstraction and with a smile said nonothing  quite the reverse  write to mr slate thank him and say that it will do very wellwith the exception of the lines i have marked out  then bring me the letter and i will add this inclosure  did you call on colonel pendleton  yes sir  he was at santa clara and had not yet returnedat least thats what that dandy nigger of his told me  the airs and graces that that creature puts on since the colonels affairs have been straightened out is a little too much for a white man to stand  why sir dd if he didnt want to patronize you and allowed to me that de kernel had a fah ideah of you and thought you a promisin young man  the fact is sir the party is making a big mistake trying to give votes to that kind of cattleit would only be giving two votes to the other side for slave or free theyre the chattels of their old masters  and as to the masters gratitude for what youve done affecting a single vote of their partyyoure mistaken  colonel pendleton belongs to no party said paul curtly but if his old constituents ever try to get into power again theyve lost their only independent martyr  he presently became abstracted again and shear produced from his overcoat pocket a series of officiallooking documents  ive brought the reports sir  eh said paul absently  the secretary stared  the reports of the san francisco chief of police that you asked me to get  his employer was certainly very forgetful today  oh yes thank you  you can lay them on my desk  ill look them over in committee  you can go now and if any one calls to see me say im busy  the secretary disappeared in the adjoining room and paul leaned back in his chair thinking  he had at last effected the work he had resolved upon when he left rosario two months ago the article he had just read and which would appear as an editorial in the san francisco paper the day after tomorrow was the culmination of quietly persistent labor inquiry and deduction and would be accepted hereafter as authentic history which if not thoroughly established at least could not be gainsaid  immediately on arriving at san francisco he had hastened to pendletons bedside and laid the facts and his plan before him  to his mingled astonishment and chagrin the colonel had objected vehemently to this saddling of anybodys offspring on a gentleman who couldnt defend himself and even pauls explanation that the putative father was a myth scarcely appeased him  but pauls timely demonstration by relating the scene he had witnessed of judge bakers infelicitous memory that the secret was likely to be revealed at any moment and that if the girl continued to cling to her theory as he feared she would even to the parting with her fortune they would be forced to accept it or be placed in the hideous position of publishing her disgrace at last convinced him on the other hand there was less danger of her positive imposition being discovered than of the vague and impositive truth  the real danger lay in the present uncertainty and mystery which courted surmise and invited discovery  paul himself was willing to take all the responsibility and at last extracted from the colonel a promise of passive assent  the only revelation he feared was from the interference of the mother but pendleton was strong in the belief that she had not only utterly abandoned the girl to the care of her guardians but that she would never rescind her resolution to disclaim her relationship that she had gone into selfexile for that purpose and that if she had changed her mind he would be the first to know of it  on this day they had parted  meantime paul had not forgotten another resolution he had formed on his first visit to the colonel and had actually succeeded in getting legislative relief for the golden gate bank and restoring to the colonel some of his private property that had been in the hands of a receiver  this had been the background of pauls meditation which only threw into stronger relief the face and figure that moved before him as persistently as it had once before in the twilight of his room at rosario  there were times when her moonlit face with its faint strange smile stood out before him as it had stood out of the shadows of the halfdarkened drawingroom that night as he had seen ithe believed for the last timeframed for an instant in the parted curtains of the doorway when she bade him goodnight for he had never visited her since and on the attainment of her majority had delegated his passing functions to pendleton whom he had induced to accompany the mayor to santa clara for the final and formal ceremony for the present she need not know how much she had been indebted to him for the accomplishment of her wishes  with a sigh he at last recalled himself to his duty and drawing the pile of reports which shear had handed him he began to examine them these again bore reference to his silent unobtrusive inquiries  in his function as chairman of committee he had taken advantage of a kind of advanced moral legislation then in vogue and particularly in reference to a certain social reform to examine statistics authorities and witnesses and in this indirect but exhaustive manner had satisfied himself that the woman kate howard alias beverly alias durfree had long passed beyond the ken of local police supervision and that in the record there was no trace or indication of her child  he was going over those infelix records of early transgressions with the eye of trained experience making notes from time to time for his official use and yet always watchful of his secret quest when suddenly he stopped with a quickened pulse  in the record of an affray at a gamblinghouse one of the parties had sought refuge in the rooms of kate howard who was represented before the magistrate by her protector juan de arguello  the date given was contemporary with the beginning of the trust but that proved nothing but the namehad it any significance or was it a grim coincidence that spoke even more terribly and hopelessly of the womans promiscuous frailty  he again attacked the entire report but there was no other record of her name  even that would have passed any eye less eager and watchful than his own  he laid the reports aside and took up the proofslip again  was there any man living but himself and pendleton who would connect these two statements  that her relations with this arguello were brief and not generally known was evident from pendletons ignorance of the fact but he must see him again and at once perhaps he might have acquired some information from yerba the young girl might have given to his age that confidence she had withheld from the younger man indeed he remembered with a flush it was partly in that hope he had induced the colonel to go to santa clara  he put the proofslip in his pocket and stepped to the door of the next room  you need not write that letter to slate tony  i will see him myself i am going to san francisco tonight  and do you want anything copied from the reports sir  paul quickly swept them from the table into his drawer and locked it not now thank you  ill finish my notes later  the next morning paul was in san francisco and had again crossed the portals of the golden gate hotel  he had been already told that the doom of that palatial edifice was sealed by the laying of the cornerstone of a new erection in the next square that should utterly eclipse it he even fancied that it had already lost its freshness and its meretricious glitter had been tarnished  but when he had ordered his breakfast he made his way to the public parlor happily deserted at that early hour  it was here that he had first seen her  she was standing there by that mirror when their eyes first met in a sudden instinctive sympathy  she herself had remembered and confessed it  he recalled the pleased yet conscious girlish superiority with which she had received the adulation of her friends his memory of her was broad enough now even to identify milly as it repeopled the vacant and silent room  an hour later he was making his way to colonel pendletons lodgings and half expecting to find the st charles hotel itself transformed by the eager spirit of improvement  but it was still there in all its barbaric and provincial incongruity  public opinion had evidently recognized that nothing save the absolute razing of its warped and flimsy walls could effect a change and waited for it to collapse suddenly like the house of cards it resembled  paul wondered for a moment if it were not ominous of its lodgers hopeless inability to accept changed conditions and it was with a feeling of doubt that he even now ascended the creaking staircase  but it was instantly dissipated on the threshold of the colonels sittingroom by the appearance of george and his reception of his masters guest  the grizzled negro was arrayed in a surprisingly new suit of blue cloth with a portentous white waistcoat and an enormous crumpled white cravat that gave him the appearance of suffering from a glandular swelling  his manner had it seemed to paul advanced in exaggeration with his clothes  dusting a chair and offering it to the visitor he remained gracefully posed with his hand on the back of another  yo finds us heah yet marse hathaway he began elegantly toying with an enormous silver watchchain fo de kernel he don bin find contagious apartments dat at all approximate and he don build for his minds not dat settled dat he aint goin to trabbel  de place is low down sah and de foks is low down and dahs a heap o white trash dat has congested under de roof ob de hotel since we came  but we uses it temperly sah fo de present and in a dissolutory fashion  it struck paul that the contiguity of a certain barbers shop and its dangerous reminiscences had something to do with georges lofty depreciation of his surroundings and he could not help saying  then you dont find it necessary to have it convenient to the barbers shop any more  i am glad of that george  the shot told  the unfortunate george after an endeavor to collect himself by altering his pose two or three times in rapid succession finally collapsed and with an air of mingled pain and dignity but without losing his ceremonious politeness or unique vocabulary said  yo got me dah sah  yo got me dah  de infirmities o human natcheh sah is de common poperty ob man and a gemplum like yoself sah a legislato and a powful speakah is de lass one to hol it agin de individal pusson  i confess sah de circumstances was propiskuous de fees fahly good and de risks inferior  de gemplum who kept de shop was an artess hisself and had been niggah to kernel henderson of tennessee and do gemplum i relieved was a mr johnson  but de kernel he wouldnt see it in dat light sah and if yo don mind sah  i havent the slightest idea of telling the colonel or anybody george said paul smiling and i am glad to find on your own account that you are able to put aside any work beyond your duty here  thank yo sah  if yo ll let me introduce yo to de refreshment yo ll find it all right now  de glencoe is dah  de kernel will be here soon but he would be powful motified sah if yo didnt hab something afo he come  he opened a wellfilled sideboard as he spoke  it was the first evidence paul had seen of the colonels restored fortunes  he would willingly have contented himself with this mere outward manifestation but in his desire to soothe the ruffled dignity of the old man he consented to partake of a small glass of spirits  george at once became radiant and communicative  de kernel bin gone to santa clara to see de young lady dats finished her edercation dahde kernels only ward sah shes one o dose millionheiresses and highly connected sah wid de old mexican gobbermen i understand  and i reckon deys bin big goins on doun dar foh de mayer kem hisself fo de kernel  looks like des might bin a proceshon sah  yo don know of a young lady bin hab a title sah i wont be shuah his honah de mayer or de kernel didnt say someting about a donna  very likely said paul turning away with a faint smile  so it was already in the air  setting aside the old negros characteristic exaggeration there had already been some conversation between the colonel and the mayor which george had vaguely overheard  he might be too late the alternative might be no longer in his hands  but his discomposure was heightened a moment later by the actual apparition of the returning pendleton  he was dressed in a tightly buttoned blue frockcoat which fairly accented his tall thin military figure although the top lappel was thrown far enough back to show a fine ruffled cambric shirt and checked gingham necktie and was itself adorned with a white rosebud in the buttonhole  fawncolored trousers strapped over narrow patentleather boots and a tall white hat whose broad mourningband was a perpetual memory of his mother who had died in his boyhood completed his festal transformation  yet his erect carriage high aquiline nose and long gray drooping moustache lent a distinguishing grace to this survival of a bygone fashion and overrode any irreverent comment  even his slight limp seemed to give a peculiar character to his massive goldheaded stick and made it a part of his formal elegance  handing george his stick and a military cape he carried easily over his left arm he greeted paul warmly yet with a return of his old dominant manner  glad to see you hathaway and glad to see the boy has served you better than the last time  if i had known you were coming i would have tried to get back in time to have breakfast with you  but your friends at rosarioi think they call it in my time it was owned by colonel briones and he called it the devils little canyondetained me with some dd civilities  lets seehis name is woods isnt it used to sell rum to runaway sailors on long wharf and take stores in exchange  or was it bakerjudge baker  i forget which  well sir they wished to be remembered  it struck paul perhaps unreasonably that the colonels indifference and digression were both a little assumed and he asked abruptly  and you fulfilled your mission  i made the formal transfer with the mayor of the property to miss arguello  to miss arguello  to the dona maria concepcion de arguello de la yerba buenato speak precisely said the colonel slowly  george you can take that hat to that blank hatterwhats his blanked name  i read it only yesterday in a list of the prominent citizens hereand tell him with my compliments that i want a gentlemans mourning band around my hat and not a childs shoelace  it may be his idea of the value of his own parentsif he ever had anybut i dont care for him to appraise mine go  as the door closed upon george paul turned to the colonel  then am i to understand that you have agreed to her story  the colonel rose picked up the decanter poured out a glass of whiskey and holding it in his hand said  my dear hathaway let us understand each other  as a gentleman i have made a point through life never to question the age name or family of any lady of my acquaintance  miss yerba buena came of age yesterday and as she is no longer my ward she is certainly entitled to the consideration i have just mentioned  if she therefore chooses to tack to her name the whole spanish directory i dont see why i shouldnt accept it  characteristic as this speech appeared to be of the colonels ordinary manner it struck paul as being only an imitation of his usual frank independence and made him uneasily conscious of some vague desertion on pendletons part  he fixed his bright eyes on his host who was ostentatiously sipping his liquor and said  am i to understand that you have heard nothing more from miss yerba either for or against her story  that you still do not know whether she has deceived herself has been deceived by others or is deceiving us  after what i have just told you mr hathaway said the colonel with an increased exaggeration of manner which paul thought must be apparent even to himself i should have but one way of dealing with questions of that kind from anybody but yourself  this culminating extravagancetaken in connection with pendletons passing doubtsactually forced a laugh from paul in spite of his bitterness  colonel pendletons face flushed quickly  like most positive oneidead men he was restricted from any possible humorous combination and only felt a mysterious sense of being detected in some weakness  he put down his glass  mr hathaway he began with a slight vibration in his usual dominant accents you have lately put me under a sense of personal obligation for a favor which i felt i could accept without derogation from a younger man because it seemed to be one not only of youthful generosity but of justice and was not unworthy the exalted ambition of a young man like yourself or the simple deserts of an old man such as i am  i accepted it sir the more readily because it was entirely unsolicited by me and seemed to be the spontaneous offering of your own heart  if i have presumed upon it to express myself freely on other matters in a way that only excites your ridicule i can but offer you an apology sir  if i have accepted a favor i can neither renounce nor return i must take the consequences to myself and even beg you sir to put up with them  remorseful as paul felt there was a singular resemblance between the previous reproachful pose of george and this present attitude of his master as if the mere propinquity of personal sacrifice had made them alike that struck him with a mingled pathos and ludicrousness  but he said warmly it is i who must apologize my dear colonel  i am not laughing at your conclusions but at this singular coincidence with a discovery i have made  as how sir  i find in the report of the chief of the police for the year 1850 that kate howard was under the protection of a man named arguello  the colonels exaggeration instantly left him  he stared blankly at paul  and you call this a laughing matter sir he said sternly but in his more natural manner  perhaps not but i dont think if you will allow me to say so my dear colonel that you have been treating the whole affair very seriously  i left you two months ago utterly opposed to views which you are now treating as of no importance  and yet you wish me to believe that nothing has happened and that you have no further information than you had then  that this is so and that you are really no nearer the facts i am willing to believe from your ignorance of what i have just told you and your concern at it  but that you have not been influenced in your judgment of what you do know i cannot believe  he drew nearer pendleton and laid his hand upon his arm i beg you to be frank with me for the sake of the person whose interests i see you have at heart  in what way will the discovery i have just made affect them  you are not so far prejudiced as to be blind to the fact that it may be dangerous because it seems corroborative  pendleton coughed rose took his stick and limped up and down the room finally dropping into an armchair by the window with his cane between his knees and the drooping gray silken threads of his long moustache curled nervously between his fingers  mr hathaway i will be frank with you  i know nothing of this blank affairblank it allbut what ive told you  your discovery may be a coincidence nothing more  but i have been influenced sirinfluenced by one of the most perfect goddesslikeyes sir one of the most simple girlish creatures that god ever sent upon earth  a woman that i should be proud to claim as my daughter a woman that would always be the superior of any man who dare aspire to be her husband  a young lady as peerless in her beauty as she is in her accomplishments and whose equal dont walk this planet  i know sir you dont follow me i know mr hathaway your puritan prejudices your church proclivities your worldly sense of propriety and above all sir the blanked hypocritical pharisaic doctrines of your partyi mean no offense to you sir personallyblind you to that girls perfections she poor child herself has seen it and felt it but never in her blameless innocence and purity suspecting the cause there is she said to me last night confidentially something strangely antagonistic and repellent in our natures some undefined and nameless barrier between our ever understanding each other  you comprehend mr hathaway she does full justice to your intentions and your unquestioned abilities  i am not blind she said to mr hathaways gifts and it is very possible the fault lies with me  her very words sir  then you believe she is perfectly ignorant of her real mother asked paul with a steady voice but a whitening face  as an unborn child said the colonel emphatically  the snow on the sierras is not more spotlessly pure of any trace or contamination of the mud of the mining ditches than she of her mother and her past the knowledge of it the mere breath of suspicion of it in her presence would be a profanation sir  look at her eyeopen as the sky and as clear look at her face and figureas clean sir as a bluegrass thoroughbred  look at the way she carries herself whether in those white frillings of her simple schoolgown or that black evening dress that makes her look like a princess  and blank me if she isnt one  theres no poor stock thereno white trashno mixed blood sir  blank it all sir if it comes to thatthe arguellosif theres a hound of them livingmight go down on their knees to have their name borne by such a creature  by the eternal sir if one of them dared to cross her path with a word that wasnt abjectyes sir abject id wipe his dust off the earth and send it back to his ancestors before he knew where he was or my name isnt harry pendleton  hopeless and inconsistent as all this was it was a wonderful sight to see the colonel his dark stern face illuminated with a zealots enthusiasm his eyes on fire the ends of his gray moustache curling around his set jaw his head thrown back his legs astride and his goldheaded stick held in the hollow of his elbow like a lance at rest  paul saw it and knew that this quixotic transformation was part of her triumph and yet had a miserable consciousness that the charms of this dulcinea del toboso had scarcely been exaggerated  he turned his eyes away and said quietly  then you dont think this coincidence will ever awaken any suspicion in regard to her real mother  not in the least sirnot in the least said the colonel yet perhaps with more doggedness than conviction of accent  nobody but yourself would ever notice that police report and the connection of that womans name with his was not notorious or i should have known it  and you believe continued paul hopelessly that miss yerbas selection of the name was purely accidental  purelya schoolgirls fancy  fancy did i say  no sir by jove an inspiration  and continued paul almost mechanically you do not think it may be some insidious suggestion of an enemy who knew of this transient relation that no one suspected  to his final amazement pendletons brow cleared  an enemy  gad you may be right  ill look into it and if that is the case which i scarcely dare hope for mr hathaway you can safely leave him to me  he looked so supremely confident in his fatuous heroism that paul could say no more  he rose and with a faint smile upon his pale face held out his hand  i think that is all i have to say  when you see miss yerba againas you will no doubtyou may tell her that i am conscious of no misunderstanding on my part except perhaps as to the best way i could serve her and that but for what she has told you i should certainly have carried away no remembrance of any misunderstanding of hers  certainly said the colonel with cheerful philosophy i will carry your message with pleasure  you understand how it is mr hathaway there is no accounting for these instinctswe can only accept them as they are  but i believe that your intentions sir were strictly according to what you conceived to be your duty  you wont take something before you go  well thengoodby  two weeks later paul found among his morning letters an envelope addressed in colonel pendletons boyish scrawling hand  he opened it with an eagerness that no studied selfcontrol nor rigid preoccupation of his duties had yet been able to subdue and glanced hurriedly at its contents   dear siras i am on the point of sailing to europe tomorrow to escort miss arguello and miss woods on an extended visit to england and the continent i am desirous of informing you that i have thus far been unable to find any foundation for the suggestions thrown out by you in our last interview  miss arguellos spanish acquaintances have been very select and limited to a few school friends and don caesar and dona anna briones tried friends who are also fellowpassengers with us to europe  miss arguello suggests that some political difference between you and don caesar which occurred during your visit to rosario three months ago may have perhaps given rise to your supposition she joins me in best wishes for your public career which even in the distraction of foreign travel and the obligations of her position she will follow from time to time with the greatest interest  very respectfully yours  harry pendleton    chapter v  it was on the 3d of august 1863 that paul hathaway resigned himself and his luggage to the care of the goldlaced ostensible porter of the strudle bad hof not without some uncertainty in a land of uniforms whether he would be eventually conducted to the barracks the police office or the conservatoire  he was relieved when the omnibus drove into the courtyard of the bad hof and the goldchained chamberlain flanked by two green tubs of oleanders received him with a gravity calculated to check any preconceived idea he might have that traveling was a trifling affair or that an arrival at the bad hof was not of serious moment  his letters had not yet arrived for he had in a fit of restlessness shortened his route and he strolled listlessly into the readingroom  two or three english guests were evidently occupied in eminently respectable reading and writing two were sitting by the window engaged in subdued but profitable conversation and two americans from boston were contentedly imitating them on the other side of the room  a decent restraint as of people who were not for a moment to be led into any foreign idea of social gayety at a wateringplace was visible everywhere  a spectacled prussian officer in full uniform passed along the hall halted for a moment at the doorway as if contemplating an armed invasion thought better of it and took his uniform away into the sunlight of the open square where it was joined by other uniforms and became by contrast a miracle of unbraced levity  paul stood the polar silence for a few moments until one of the readers arose and taking his booka murrayin his hand walked slowly across the room to a companion mutely pointed to a passage in the book remained silent until the other had dumbly perused it and then walked back again to his seat having achieved the incident without a word  at which paul convinced of his own incongruity softly withdrew with his hat in his hand and his eyes fixed devotionally upon it  it was good after that to get into the slanting sunlight and checkered linden shadows of the allee to see even a tightly jacketed cavalryman naturally walking with clarchen and her two roundfaced and drabhaired young charges to watch the returning invalid procession very real and very human each individual intensely involved in the atmosphere of his own symptoms and very good after that to turn into the thiergarten where the animals were however chiefly of his own species and shamelessly and openly amusing themselves  it was pleasant to contrast it with his first visit to the place three months before and correct his crude impressions  and it was still more pleasant suddenly to recognize under the round flat cap of a general officer a former traveler who was fond of talking with him about america with an intelligence and understanding of it that paul had often missed among his own traveled countrymen  it was pleasant to hear his unaffected and simple greeting to renew their old acquaintance and to saunter back to the hotel together through the long twilight  they were only a few squares from the hotel when pauls attention was attracted by the curiosity and delight of two or three children before him who appeared to be following a quaintlooking figure that was evidently not unfamiliar to them  it appeared to be a servant in a striking livery of green with yellow facings and crested silver buttons but still more remarkable for the indescribable mingling of jaunty ease and conscious dignity with which he carried off his finery there was something so singular and yet so vaguely reminiscent in his peculiar walk and the exaggerated swing of his light bamboo cane that paul could not only understand the childish wonder of the passersby who turned to look after him but was stirred with a deeper curiosity he quickened his pace but was unable to distinguish anything of the face or features of the stranger except that his hair under his cocked hat appeared to be tightly curled and powdered  pauls companion who was amused at what seemed to be the americans national curiosity had seen the figure before  a servant in the suite of some eastern altesse visiting the baths  you will see stranger things my friend in the strudle bad  par example your own countrymen too the one who has enriched himself by that pork of chicago or that soap or this candle in a carriage with the crest of the title he has bought in italy with his dollars and his beautiful daughters who are seeking more titles with possible matrimonial contingencies  after an early dinner paul found his way to the little theatre he had already been struck by a highly colored poster near the bahnhof purporting that a distinguished german company would give a representation of uncle toms cabin and certain peculiarities in the pictorial advertisement of the tableaux gave promise of some entertainment  he found the theatre fairly full there was the usual contingent of abonnirte officers a fair sprinkling of english and german travelers but apparently none of his own countrymen  he had no time to examine the house more closely for the play commencing with simple punctuality not only far exceeded the promise of the posters but of any previous performance of the play he had witnessed transported at once to a gorgeous tropical regionthe slave states of americaresplendent with the fruits and palms of mauritius and peopled exclusively with paul and virginias companions in striped cotton hathaway managed to keep a composed face until the arrival of the good southern planter st clair as one of the earlier portraits of goethe in top boots light kerseymere breeches redingote and loose byron collar compelled him to shrink into the upper corner of the box with his handkerchief to his face  luckily the action passed as the natural effect upon a highly sympathetic nature of religious interviews between a roundfaced flaxenhaired kleine eva and onkeel tome occasionally assisted by a dissenting clergyman in geneva bands of excessive brutality with a cattle whip by a zamiellike legree of the sufferings of a runaway negro zimmermadchen with a child three shades lighter than herself and of a painted canvas manhunt where apparently four well known german composers on horseback with flowing hair top boots and a cor de chasse were pursuing with the aid of a pack of fox hounds the much too deeply abused and yet spiritually elevated onkeel tome  paul did not wait for the final apotheosis of der kleine eva but in the silence of a hushed audience made his way into the corridor and down the staircase  he was passing an open door marked direction when his attention was sharply attracted by a small gathering around it and the sounds of indignant declamation it was the voice of a countrymanmore than that it was a familiar voice that he had not heard for three yearsthe voice of colonel harry pendleton  tell him said pendleton in scathing tones to some invisible interpretertell him sir that a more infamous caricature of the blankest caricature that ever maligned a free people sir i never before had the honor of witnessing  tell him that i siri harry pendleton of kentucky a southerner siran old slaveholder sir declare it to be a tissue of falsehoods unworthy the credence of a christian civilization like thisunworthy the attention of the distinguished ladies and gentlemen that are gathered here tonight tell him sir he has been imposed upon tell him i am responsiblegive him my card and addresspersonally responsible for what i say  if he wants proofsblank it alltell him you yourself have been a slavemy slave sir  take off your hat sir  ask him to look at youask him if he thinks you ever looked or could look like that lopeared psalmsinging whiteheaded hypocrite on the stage ask him sir if he thinks that blank ringmaster they call st clair looks like me  at this astounding exordium paul eagerly pressed forward and entered the bureau  there certainly was colonel pendleton in spotless evening dress erect flashing and indignant his aquiline nose lifted like a hawks beak over his quarry his irongray moustache now white and waxed parted like a swallows tail over his handsome mouth and between him and the astounded direction stood the apparition of the alleegeorge  there was no mistaking him now  what paul had thought was a curled wig or powder was the old negros own white knotted wool and the astounding livery he wore was carried off as no one but george could carry it  but he was still more amazed when the old servant in a german as exaggerated as incoherent but still as fluent and persuasive as his own native speech began an extravagant but perfectly dignified and diplomatic translation of his masters protests  where and when by what instinct he had assimilated and made his own the grotesque inversions and ponderous sentimentalities of teutonic phrasing paul could not guess but it was with breathless wonder that he presently became aware that so perfect and convincing was the old mans style and deportment not only the simple officials but even the bystanders were profoundly impressed by this farrago of absurdity  a happy word here and there the full title and rank given even with a slight exaggeration to each individual brought a deep and guttural so from lips that would have found it difficult to repeat a line of his ceremonious idiocy  in their preoccupation neither the colonel nor george had perceived pauls entrance but as the old servant turned with magnificent courtesy towards the bystanders his eyes fell upon paul  a flash of surprise triumph and satisfaction lit up his rolling eyes paul instantly knew that he not only recognized him but that he had already heard of and thoroughly appreciated a certain distinguished position that paul had lately held and was quick to apply it  intensifying for a moment the grandiloquence of his manner he called upon his masters most distinguished and happily arrived old friend the lord lieutenant governor of the golden californias to corroborate his statement colonel pendleton started and grasped pauls hand warmly  paul turned to the already halfmollified director with the diplomatic suggestion that the vivid and realistic acting of the admirable company which he himself had witnessed had perhaps unduly excited his old friend even as it had undoubtedly thrown into greater relief the usual exaggerations of dramatic representation and the incident terminated with a profusion of apologies and the most cordial expressions of international good feeling on both sides  yet as they turned away from the theatre together paul could not help noticing that although the colonels first greeting had been spontaneous and unaffected it was succeeded by an uneasy reserve paul made no attempt to break it and confined himself to a few general inquiries ending by inviting the colonel to sup with him at the hotel pendleton hesitated  at any other time mr hathaway i should have insisted upon you as the stranger supping with me but since the absence ofofthe rest of my partyi have given up my suite of rooms at the bad hof and have taken smaller lodgings for myself and the boy at the schwartze adler  miss woods and miss arguello have accepted an invitation to spend a few days at the villa of the baron and baroness von schilprechtan hour or two from here  he lingered over the title with an odd mingling of impressiveness and inquiry and glanced at paul  but hathaway exhibiting neither emotion nor surprise at the mention of yerbas name or the title of her host he continued miss arguello i suppose you know is immensely admired she has been sir the acknowledged belle of strudle bad  i can readily believe it said paul simply  and has taken the positionthe position sir to which she is entitled  without appearing to notice the slight challenge in pendletons tone paul returned i am glad to hear it  the more particularly as i believe the germans are great sticklers for position and pedigree  you are right sirquite right they are said the colonel proudlyalthoughwith a certain premeditated deliberationi have been credibly informed that the king can in certain cases if he chooses supplyyes sirsupply a favored person with ancestorsyes sir with ancestors  paul cast a quick glance at his companion  yes sirthat is we will say in the case of a lady of inferior rankor even birth the king of these parts can on her marriage with a noblemanblank it allennoble her father and mother and their fathers and mothers though theyve been dead or as good as dead for years  i am afraid thats a slight exaggeration of the rare custom of granting noble lands or estates that carry hereditary titles with them said paul more emphatically perhaps than the occasion demanded  fact sirgeorge there knows it all said pendleton  he gets it from the other servants  i dont speak the language sir but he does picked it up in a year  i must compliment him on his fluency certainly said paul looking at george  the old servant smiled and not without a certain condescension yes sah i don say to a scholar like yoself sah dat ise got de grandmatical presichion but as fah sahas fah as de idiotisms ob de language goes  sahits genlly allowed im dar  as to what marse harry says ob de ignobling ob predecessors ive had it sah from de best autority sahde furst i may say sahde real prima facie mende gemplum ob his serene highness in de korse eb ordinary conversashun sah  thatll do george said pendleton with paternal brusqueness run on ahead and tell that blank chamberlain that mr hathaway is one of my friendsand have supper accordingly  as the negro hastened away he turned to paul what he says is true hes the most popular man or boy in all strudle bada devilish sight more than his masterand goes anywhere where i cant go  princes and princesses stop and talk to him in the street the grand duke asked permission to have him up in his carriage at the races the other day and by the eternal sir he gives the style to all the flunkeys in town  and i see he dresses the character observed paul  his own ideaentirely  and by jove he proves to be right  you cant do anything here without a uniform  and they tell me hes got everything correct down to the crest on the buttons  they walked on in silence for a few moments pendleton retaining a certain rigidity of step and bearing which paul had come to recognize as indicating some uneasiness or mental disturbance on his part hathaway had no intention of precipitating the confidence of his companion  perhaps experience had told him it would come soon enough so he spoke carelessly of himself  how the need of a years relaxation and change had brought him abroad his journeyings and finally how he had been advised by his german physician to spend a few weeks at strudle bad preparatory to the voyage home  yet he was perfectly aware that the colonel from time to time cast a furtive glance at his face and you he said in conclusionwhen do you intend to return to california  the colonel hesitated slightly  i shall remain in europe until miss arguello is settledi mean he added hurriedly until she hasahemcompleted her education in foreign ways and customs you see hathaway i have constituted myself after a certain fashion i may saystill her guardian  i am an old man with neither kith nor kin myself sirim a little too oldfashioned for the boys over therewith a vague gesture towards the west which however told paul how near it still was to him  but then among the old fogys hereblank it allit isnt noticed  so i look after her you see or rather make myself responsible for her generallyalthough of course she has other friends and associates you understand more of her own age and tastes  and ive no doubt shes perfectly satisfied said paul in a tone of conviction  well yes sir i presume so said the colonel slowly but ive sometimes thought mr hathaway that it would have been better if shed have had a womans carethe protection you understand of an elderly woman of society  that seems to be the style here you knowa chaperon they call it  now milly woods you see is about the same age and the dona anna of course is older butblank itshes as big a flirt as the resti mean he added correcting himself sharply she lacks balance sir andwhat shall i call itselfabnegation  then dona anna is still of your party asked paul  she is sir and her brother don caesar  i have thought it advisable on yerbas account to keep up as much as possible the suggestion of her spanish relationshipalthough by reason of their absurd ignorance of geography and political divisions out here there is a prevailing impression that she is a south american  a fact sir i have myself been mistaken for the dictator of one of these infernal republics and i have been pointed out as ruling over a million or two of niggers like george  there was no trace of any conception of humor in the colonels face although he uttered a short laugh as if in polite acceptance of the possibility that paul might have one  far from that his companion looking at the striking profile and erect figure at his sideat the long white moustache which drooped from his dark cheeks and remembering his own sensations at first seeing georgethought the popular belief not so wonderful  he was even forced to admit that the perfect unconsciousness on the part of master and man of any incongruity or peculiarity in themselves assisted the public misconception  and it was i fear with a feeling of wicked delight that on entering the hotel he hailed the evident consternation of those correct fellowcountrymen from whom he had lately fled at what they apparently regarded as a national scandal  he overheard their hurried assurance to their english friends that his companions were not from boston and enjoyed their mortification that this explanation did not seem to detract from the interest and relief with which the britons surveyed them or the open admiration of the germans  although pendleton somewhat unbent during supper he did not allude to the secret of yerbas parentage nor of any tardy confidence of hers to all appearance the situation remained as it was three years ago  he spoke of her great popularity as an heiress and a beautiful woman and the marked attentions she received  he doubted not that she had rejected very distinguished offers but she kept that to herself  she was perfectly competent to do so she was no giddy girl to be flattered or deceived on the contrary he had never known a cooler or more sensible woman  she knew her own worth  when she met the man who satisfied her ambition and understanding she would marry and not before  he did not know what that ambition was it was something exalted of course  he could only say of his own knowledge that last year when they were on the italian lakes there was a certain princemr hathaway would understand why he did not mention nameswho was not only attentive to her but attentive to him sir by jove and most significant in his inquiries  it was the only occasion when he the colonel had ever spoken to her on such subjects and knowing that she was not indifferent to the fellow who was not bad of his kind he had asked her why she had not encouraged his suit she had said with a laugh that he couldnt marry her unless he gave up his claim of succession to a certain reigning house and she wouldnt accept him without it  those were her words sir and he could only say that the prince left a few days afterwards and they had never seen him since as to the princelings and counts and barons she knew to a day the date of their patents of nobility and what privileges they were entitled to she could tell to a dot the value of their estates the amount of their debts and by jove sir the amount of mortgages she was expected to pay off before she married them  she knew the amount of income she had to bring to the prussian army from the general to the lieutenant she understood her own value and her rights  there was a young english lordling she met on the rhine whose boyish ways and simplicity seemed to please her  they were great friends but he wanted himthe colonelto induce her to accept an invitation for both to visit his mothers home in england that his people might see her but she declined sir  she declined to pass in review before his mother  she said it was for him to pass in review before her mother  did she say that interrupted paul fixing his bright eyes upon the colonel  if she had one if she had one corrected the colonel hastily of course it was only an illustration  that she is an orphan is generally known sir  there was a dead silence for a few moments  the colonel leaned back in his chair and pulled his moustache  paul turned away his eyes and seemed absorbed in reflection  after a moment the colonel coughed pushed aside his glass and leaning across the table said i have a favor to ask of you mr hathaway  there was such a singular change in the tone of his voice an unexpected relaxation of some artificial tensiona relaxation which struck paul so pathetically as being as much physical as mental as if he had suddenly been overtaken in some exertion by the weakness of agethat he looked up quickly  certainly although still erect and lightly grasping his moustache the colonel looked older  by all means my dear colonel said paul warmly  during the time you remain here you can hardly help meeting miss arguello perhaps frequently  it would be strange if you did not it would appear to everybody still stranger  give me your word as a gentleman that you will not make the least allusion to her of the pastnor reopen the subject  paul looked fixedly at the colonel  i certainly had no intention of doing so he said after a pause for i thought it was already settled by you beyond disturbance or discussion  but do i understand you that she has shown any uneasiness regarding it from what you have just told me of her plans and ambition i can scarcely imagine that she has any suspicion of the real facts  certainly not said the colonel hurriedly  but i have your promise  i promise you said paul after a pause that i shall neither introduce nor refer to the subject myself and that if she should question me again regarding it which is hardly possible i will reveal nothing without your consent  thank you said pendleton without however exhibiting much relief in his face  she will return here tomorrow  i thought you said she was absent for some days said paul  yes but she is coming back to say goodby to dona anna who arrives here with her brother the same day on their way to paris  it flashed through pauls mind that the last time he had seen her was in the company of the briones  it was not a pleasant coincidence  yet he was not aware that it had affected him until he saw the colonel watching him  i believe you dont fancy the brother said pendleton  for an instant paul was strongly tempted to avow his old vague suspicions of don caesar but the utter hopelessness of reopening the whole subject again and his recollection of the passage in pendletons letter that purported to be yerbas own theory of his dislike checked him in time  he only said i dont remember whether i had any cause for disliking don caesar i can tell better when i see him again and changed the subject  a few moments later the colonel summoned george from some lower region of the hotel and rose to take his leave  miss arguello with her maid and courier will occupy her old suite of rooms here he remarked with a return of his old imperiousness  george has given the orders for her  i shall not change my present lodgings but of course will call every day  goodnight    chapter vi  the next morning paul could not help noticing an increased and even exaggerated respect paid him by the hotel attendants  he was asked if his excellency would be served with breakfast in a private room and his condescension in selecting the public coffeeroom struck the obsequious chamberlain but did not prevent him from preceding paul backwards to the table and summoning a waiter to attend specially upon milor  surmising that george and the colonel might be in some way connected with this extravagance he postponed an investigation till he should have seen them again  and although he hardly dared to confess it to himself the unexpected prospect of meeting yerba again fully preoccupied his thoughts  he had believed that he would eventually see her in europe in some vague and indefinite way and hour it had been in his mind when he started from california  that it would be so soon and in such a simple and natural manner he had never conceived  he had returned from his morning walk to the brunnen and was sitting idly in his room when there was a knock at the door  it opened to a servant bearing a salver with a card  paul lifted it with a slight tremor not at the engraved name of maria concepcion de arguellos de la yerba buena but at the remembered schoolgirl hand that had penciled underneath the words wishes the favor of an audience with his excellency the lord lieutenantgovernor of the californias  paul looked inquiringly at the servant  the gnadige fraulein was in her own salon  would excellency walk that way  it was but a step in effect the next apartment  paul followed him into the hall with wondering steps  the door of the next room was open and disclosed a handsomely furnished salon a tall graceful figure rose quickly from behind a writingtable and advanced with outstretched hands and a frank yet mischievous smile  it was yerba  standing there in a grayish hat mantle and traveling dress all of one subdued yet alluring tone she looked as beautiful as when he had last seen herand yetunlike  for a brief bitter moment his instincts revolted at this familiar yielding up in his fair countrywomen of all that was distinctively original in them to alien tastes and habits and he resented the plastic yet characterless mobility which made yerbas parisian dress and european manner fit her so charmingly and yet express so little for a brief critical moment he remembered the placid unchanging simplicity of german and the inflexible and ingrained reserve of english girlhood in opposition to this indistinctive cosmopolitan grace  but only for a moment  as soon as she spoke a certain flavor of individuality seemed to return to her speech  confess she said it was a courageous thing for me to do  you might have been somebody elsea real excellencyor heaven knows what or what is worse in your new magnificence you might have forgotten one of your oldest most humble but faithful subjects she drew back and made him a mock ceremonious curtsy that even in its charming exaggeration suggested to paul however that she had already made it somewhere seriously  but what does it all mean he asked smiling feeling not only his doubts and uneasiness vanish but even the years of separation melt away in her presence  i know i went to bed last night a very humble individual and yet i seem to awaken this morning a very exalted personage  am i really commander of the faithful or am i dreaming might i trouble you as my predecessor abou hassan did sweetlips to bite my little finger  do you mean to say you have not seen the auzeiger she returned taking a small german printed sheet from the table and pointing to a paragraph  paul took the paper  certainly there was the plain announcement among the arrivals of his excellency paul hathaway lord lieutenantgovernor of the californias  a light flashed upon him  this is georges work  he and colonel pendleton were here with me last night  then you have seen the colonel already she said with a scarcely perceptible alteration of expression which however struck paul  yes  i met him at the theatre last evening  he was about to plunge into an animated description of the colonels indignation but checked himself he knew not why  but he was thankful the next moment that he had  that accounts for everything she said lifting her pretty shoulders with a slight shrug of weariness  i had to put a step to georges talking about me three months agohis extravagance is something too awful  and the colonel who is completely in his handstrusting him for everything even the languagedoesnt see it  but he is extravagant in the praise of his friends only and you certainly justify all he can say  she was taking off her hat and stopped for a moment to look at him thoughtfully with the soft tendrils of her hair clinging to her forehead  did the colonel talk much about me  a great deal  in fact i think we talked of nothing else  he has told me of your triumphs and your victims of your various campaigns and your conquests  and yet i dare say he has not told me alland i am dying to hear more  she had laid down her hat and unloosed a large bow of her mantle but stopped suddenly in the midst of it and sat down again  i wish youd do something for me  you have only to name it  well drop all this kind of talk  try to think of me as if i had just come from californiaor better as if you had never known anything of me at alland we met for the first time  you could i dare say make yourself very agreeable to such a young lady who was willing to be pleasedwhy not to me  i venture to say you have not ever troubled yourself about me since we last met  nohear me throughwhy then should you wish to talk over what didnt concern you at the time promise me you will stop this reminiscent gossip and i promise you i will not only not bore you with it but take care that it is not intruded upon you by others  make yourself pleasant to me by talking about yourself and your prospectsanything but meand i will throw over those princes and barons that the colonel has raved about and devote myself to you while you are here  does that suit your excellency  she had crossed her knees and with her hands clasped over them and the toe of her small boot advanced beyond her skirt leaned forward in the attitude he remembered to have seen her take in the summerhouse at rosario  perfectly he said  how long will you be here  about three weeks that i believe is the time allotted for my cure  are you really ill she said quietly or imagine yourself so  it amounts to about the same thing  but my cure may not take so long he added fixing his bright eyes upon her  she returned his gaze thoughtfully and they remained looking at each other silently  then you are stronger than you give yourself credit for  that is very often the case she said quietly  there she added in another tone it is settled  you will come and go as you like using this salon as your own  stay we can do something today what do you say to a ride in the forest this afternoon  milly isnt here yet but it will be quite proper for you to accompany me on horseback though of course we couldnt walk a hundred yards down the allee together unless we were verlobt  but said paul you are expecting company this afternoon  don caesari mean miss briones and her brother are coming here to say goodby  she regarded him curiously but without emotion  colonel pendleton should have added that they were to remain here overnight as my guests she said composedly  and of course we shall be back in time for dinner  but that is nothing to you  you have only to be ready at three oclock  i will see that the horses are ordered i often ride here and the people know my tastes and habits  we will have a pleasant ride and a good long talk together and ill show you a ruin and a distant view of the villa where i have been staying  she held out her hand with a frank girlish smile and even a girlish anticipation of pleasure in her brown eyes  he bent over her slim fingers for a moment and withdrew  when he was in his own room again he was conscious only of a strong desire to avoid the colonel until after his ride with yerba he would keep his word so far as to abstain from allusion to her family or her past indeed he had his own opinion of its futility but it would be strange if with his past experience he could not find some other way to determine her convictions or win her confidence during those two hours of companionship  he would accept her terms fairly if she had any ulterior design in her advances he would detect it if she had the least concern for him she could not continue long an artificial friendship  but he must not think of that  by absenting himself from the hotel he managed to keep clear of pendleton until the hour arrived  he was gratified to find yerba in the simplest and most sensible of habits as if she had already divined his tastes and had wished to avoid attracting undue attention nevertheless it very prettily accented her tall graceful figure and paul albeit like most artistic admirers of the sex not recognizing a woman on a horse as a particularly harmonious spectacle was forced to admire her  both rode well and naturallyhaving been brought up in the same western schoolthe horses recognized it and instinctively obeyed them and their conversation had the easy deliberation and inflection of a teteatete paul in view of her previous hint talked to her of himself and his fortunes of which she appeared however to have some knowledge  his health had obliged him lately to abandon politics and office he had been successful in some ventures and had become a junior partner in a bank with foreign correspondence  she listened to him for some time with interest and attention but at last her face became abstracted and thoughtful  i wish i were a man she said suddenly  paul looked at her quickly  for the first time he detected in the ring of her voice something of the passionate quality he fancied he had always seen in her face  except that it might give you better control of your horse i dont see why said paul  and i dont entirely believe you  why  because no woman really wishes to be a man unless she is conscious of her failure as a woman  and how do you know im not she said checking her horse and looking in his face  a quick conviction that she was on the point of some confession sprang into his mind but unfortunately showed in his face she beat back his eager look with a short laugh there dont speak and dont look like that  that remark was worthy the usual artless maidens invitation to a compliment wasnt it  let us keep to the subject of yourself  why with your political influence dont you get yourself appointed to some diplomatic position over here  there are none in our service  you wouldnt want me to sink myself in some absurd social functions which are called by that name merely to become the envy and hatred of a few rich republicans like your friends who haunt foreign courts  thats not a pretty speechbut i suppose i invited that too dont apologize  id rather see you flare out like that than pay compliments  yet i fancy youre a diplomatist for all that  you did me the honor to believe i was one once when i was simply the most palpable ass and bungler living said paul bitterly  she was still sweetly silent apparently preoccupied in smoothing out the mane of her walking horse  did i she said softly  he drew close beside her  how different the vegetation is here from what it is with us she said with nervous quickness directing his attention to the grass road beneath them without lifting her eyes  i dont mean what is cultivatedfor i suppose it takes centuries to make the lawns they have in englandbut even here the blades of grass seem to press closer together as if they were crowded or overpopulated like the country and this forest which has been always wild and was a hunting park has a blase look as if it was already tired of the unchanging traditions and monotony around it  i think over there nature affects and influences us here i fancy it is itself affected by the people  i think a good deal of nature comes over from america for that purpose he said dryly  and i think you are breaking your promisebesides being a goose she retorted smartly  nevertheless for some occult reason they both seemed relieved by this exquisite witticism and trotted on amicably together  when paul lifted his eyes to hers he could see that they were suffused with a tender mischief as of a reproving yet secretly admiring sister and her strangely delicate complexion had taken on itself that faint alpine glow that was more of an illumination than a color  there she said gayly pointing with her whip as the wood opened upon a glade through which the parted trees showed a long blue curvature of distant hills you see that white thing lying like a snowdrift on the hills  or the family washing on a hedge  as you please  well that is the villa  and you were very happy there said paul watching her girlishly animated face  yes and as you dont ask questions ill tell you why  there is one of the sweetest old ladies there that i ever metthe perfection of oldtime courtliness with all the motherishness of a german woman  she was very kind to me and as she had no daughter of her own i think she treated me as if i was one  at least i can imagine how one would feel to her and what a woman like that could make of any girl  you laugh mr hathaway you dont understandbut you dont know what an advantage it would be to a girl to have a mother like that and know that she could fall back on her and hold her own against anybody shes equipped from the start instead of being handicapped  its all very well to talk about the value of money  it can give you everything but one thingthe power to do without it  i think its purchasing value would include even the gnadige frau said paul who had laughed only to hide the uneasiness that yerbas approach to the tabooed subject had revived in him  she shook her head then recovering her tone of gentle banter said thereive made a confession  if the colonel talks to you again about my conquests you will know that at present my affections are centred on the barons mother  i admit its a strong point in hisin anybodysfavor who can show an unblemished maternal pedigree what a pity it is you are an orphan like myself mr hathaway for i fancy your mother must have been a very perfect woman  a great deal of her tact and propriety has descended to you  only it would have been nicer if she had given it to you like pocket money as occasion requiredwhich you might have shared with methan leaving it to you in one thumping legacy  it was impossible to tell how far the playfulness of her brown eyes suggested any ulterior meaning for as paul again eagerly drew towards her she sent her horse into a rapid canter before him when he was at her side again she said there is still the ruin to see on our way home  it is just off here to the right  but if you wish to go over it we will have to dismount at the foot of the slope and walk up  it hasnt any story or legend that i know of i looked over the guidebook to cram for it before you came but there was nothing  so you can invent what you like  they dismounted at the beginning of a gentle acclivity where an ancient wagonroad now grassgrown rose smooth as a glacis tying their horses to two moplike bushes they climbed the slope hand in hand like children  there were a few winding broken steps part of a fallen archway a few feet of vaulted corridor a sudden breachthe sky beyondand that was all  not all for before them overlooked at first lay a chasm covering half an acre in which the whole of the original edificetower turrets walls and battlementshad been apparently cast inextricably mixed and mingled at different depths and angles with here and there like mushrooms from a dustheap a score of trees upspringing  this is not timebut gunpowder said paul leaning over a parapet of the wall and gazing at the abyss with a slight grimace  it dont look very romantic certainly said yerba  i only saw it from the road before  im dreadfully sorry she added with mock penitence  i suppose however something must have happened here  there may have been nobody in the house at the time said paul gravely  the family may have been at the baths  they stood close together their elbows resting upon the broken wall and almost touching  beyond the abyss and darker forest they could see the more vivid green and regular lines of the planetrees of strudle bad the glitter of a spire or the flash of a dome from the abyss itself arose a cool odor of moist green leaves the scent of some unseen blossoms and around the baking vines on the hot wall the hum of apparently taskless and disappointed bees there was nobody in sight in the forest road no one working in the bordering fields and no suggestion of the present  there might have been three or four centuries between them and strudle bad  the legend of this place said paul glancing at the long brown lashes and oval outline of the cheek so near his own is simple yet affecting  a cruel remorseless but fascinating hexie was once loved by a simple shepherd  he had never dared to syllable his hopeless affection or claim from her a syllabledperhaps i should say a onesyllabledreply  he had followed her from remote lands dumbly worshiping her building in his foolish brain an aircastle of happiness which by reason of her magic power she could always see plainly in his eyes  and one day beguiling him in the depths of the forest she led him to a fairseeming castle and bidding him enter its portals offered to show him a realization of his dream  but lo even as he entered the stately corridor it seemed to crumble away before him and disclosed a hideous abyss beyond in which the whole of that goodly palace lay in heaped and tangled ruinsthe fitting symbol of his wrecked and shattered hopes  she drew back a little way from him but still holding on to the top of the broken wall with one slim gauntleted hand and swung herself to one side while she surveyed him with smiling parted lips and conscious eyelids  he promptly covered her hand with his own but she did not seem to notice it  that is not the story she said in a faint voice that even her struggling sauciness could not make steadier  the true story is called the legend of the goosegirl of strudle bad and the enterprising gosling  there was once a goosegirl of the plain who tried honestly to drive her geese to market but one eccentric and willful gosling  mr hathaway  stoppleasei beg you let me go  he had caught her in his armsthe one encircling her waist the other hand still grasping hers  she struggled half laughing yielded for a breathless moment as his lips brushed her cheek andthrew him off there she said that will do the story was not illustrated  but yerba he said with passionate eagerness hear meit is all gods truthi love you  she drew back farther shaking the dust of the wall from the folds of her habit  then with a lower voice and a paler cheek as if his lips had sent her blood and utterance back to her heart she said come let us go  but not until youve heard me yerba  well theni believe youthere she said looking at him  you believe me he repeated eagerly attempting to take her hand again  she drew back still farther  yes she said or i shouldnt be here now  there that must suffice you  and if you wish me still to believe you you will not speak of this again while we are out together  come let us go back to the horses  he looked at her with all his soul  she was pale but composed andhe could seedetermined  he followed her without a word she accepted his hand to support her again down the slope without embarrassment or reminiscent emotion  the whole scene through which she had just passed might have been buried in the abyss and ruins behind her  as she placed her foot in his hand to remount and for a moment rested her weight on his shoulder her brown eyes met his frankly and without a tremor  nor was she content with this  as paul at first rode on silently his heart filled with unsatisfied yearning she rallied him mischievously was it kind in him on this their first day together to sulk in this fashion  was it a promise for their future excursions  did he intend to carry this lugubrious visage through the allee and up to the courtyard of the hotel to proclaim his sentimental condition to the world  at least she trusted he would not show it to milly who might remember that this was only the second time they had met each other there was something so sweetly reasonable in this and withal not without a certain hopefulness for the future to say nothing of the halfmischievous halfreproachful smile that accompanied it that paul exerted himself and eventually recovered his lost gayety  when they at last drew up in the courtyard with the flush of youth and exercise in their faces paul felt he was the object of envy to the loungers and of fresh gossip to strudle bad  it struck him less pleasantly that two dark faces which had been previously regarding him in the gloom of the corridor and vanished as he approached reappeared some moments later in yerbas salon as don caesar and dona anna with a benignly different expression  dona anna especially greeted him with so much of the ostentatious archness of a confident and forgiving woman to a momentarily recreant lover that he felt absurdly embarrassed in yerbas presence  he was thinking how he could excuse himself when he noticed a beautiful basket of flowers on the table and a tiny note bearing a barons crest  yerba had put it aside withas it seemed to him at the momentan almost too pronounced indifferenceand an indifference that was strongly contrasted to dona annas eagerly expressed enthusiasm over the offering and her ultimate supplications to paul and her brother to admire its beauties and the wonderful taste of the donor  all this seemed so incongruous with pauls feelings and above all with the recollection of his scene with yerba that he excused himself from dining with the party alleging an engagement with his old fellowtraveler the german officer whose acquaintance he had renewed yerba did not press him he even fancied she looked relieved  colonel pendleton was coming paul was not loath in his present frame of mind to dispense with his company  a conviction that the colonels counsel was not the best guide for yerba and that in some vague way their interests were antagonistic had begun to force itself upon him  he had no intention of being disloyal to her old guardian but he felt that pendleton had not been frank with him since his return from rosario  had he ever been so with her  he sometimes doubted his disclaimer  he was lucky in finding the general disengaged and together they dined at a restaurant and spent the evening at the kursaal  later at the residenz club the general leaned over his beerglass and smilingly addressed his companion  so i hear you too are a conquest of the beautiful south american  for an instant paul recognizing only dona anna under that epithet looked puzzled  come my friend said the general regarding him with some amusement i am an older man than you yet i hardly think i could have ridden out with such a goddess without becoming her slave  paul felt his face flush in spite of himself  ah you mean miss arguello he said hurriedly his color increasing at his own mention of that name as if he were imposing it upon his honest companion  she is an old acquaintance of minefrom my own statecalifornia  ah so said the general lifting his eyebrows in profound apology a thousand pardons  surely said paul with a desperate attempt to recover his equanimity you ought to know our geography better  so i am wrong  but still the namearguellosurely that is not american  still they say she has no accent and does not look like a mexican  for an instant paul was superstitiously struck with the fatal infelicity of yerbas selection of a foreign name that now seemed only to invite that comment and criticism which she should have avoided nor could he explain it at length to the general without assisting and accenting the deception which he was always hoping in some vague way to bring to an end  he was sorry he had corrected the general he was furious that he had allowed himself to be confused  happily his companion had misinterpreted his annoyance and with impulsive german friendship threw himself into what he believed to be pauls feelings  donnerwetter  your beautiful countrywoman is made the subject of curiosity just because that stupid baron is persistent in his serious attentions  that is quite enough my good friend to make klatschen here among those animals who do not understand the freedom of an american girl or that an heiress may have something else to do with her money than to expend it on the barons mortgages buthe stopped and his simple honest face assumed an air of profound and sagacious cunningi am glad to talk about it with you who of course are perfectly familiar with the affair  i shall now be able to know what to say  my word my friend has some weight here and i shall use it  and now you shall tell me who is our lovely friend and who were her parents and her kindred in her own home  her associates here you possibly know are an impossible colonel and his neverbeforeapproached valet with some south american indian planters and i believe a porkbutchers daughter  but of themit makes nothing  tell me of her people  with his kindly serious face within a few inches of pauls and sympathizing curiosity beaming from his pincenez he obliged the wretched and consciencestricken hathaway to respond with a detailed account of yerbas parentage as projected by herself and indorsed by colonel pendleton  he dwelt somewhat particularly on the romantic character of the trust hoping to draw the generals attention away from the question of relationship but he was chagrined to find that the honest warrior evidently confounded the trust with some eleemosynary institution and sympathetically glossed it over  of course he said the mexican minister at berlin would know all about the arguello family so there would be no question there  paul was not sorry when the time came to take leave of his friend but once again in the clear moonlight and fresh balmy air of the allee he forgot the unpleasantness of the interview  he found himself thinking only of his ride with yerba  well he had told her that he loved her she knew it now and although she had forbidden him to speak further she had not wholly rejected it  it must be her morbid consciousness of the mystery of her birth that withheld a return of her affectionssome halfknowledge perhaps that she would not divulge yet that kept her unduly sensitive of accepting his love  he was satisfied there was no entanglement her heart was virgin  he even dared to hope that she had always cared for him  it was for him to remove all obstaclesto prevail upon her to leave this place and return to america with him as her husband the guardian of her good name and the custodian of her secret  at times the strains of a dreamy german waltz played in the distance brought back to him the brief moment that his arm had encircled her waist by the crumbling wall and his pulses grew languid only to leap firmer the next moment with more desperate resolve  he would win her come what may  he could never have been in earnest before he loathed and hated himself for his previous passive acquiescence to her fate  he had been a weak tool of the colonels from the first he was even now handicapped by a preposterous promise he had given him  yes she was right to hesitateto question his ability to make her happy  he had found her here surrounded by stupidity and cupidityto give it no other nameso patent that she was the common gossip and had offered nothing but a boyish declaration  as he strode into the hotel that night it was well that he did not meet the unfortunate colonel on the staircase  it was very late although there was still visible a light in yerbas salon shining on her balcony which extended before and included his own window  from time to time he could hear the murmur of voices  it was too late to avail himself of the invitation to join them even if his frame of mind had permitted it  he was too nervous and excited to go to bed and without lighting his candle he opened the french window that gave upon the balcony drew a chair in the recess behind the curtain and gazed upon the night  it was very quiet the moon was high the square was sleeping in a trance of checkered shadows like a gigantic chessboard with black foreshortened trees for pawns  the click of a cavalry sabre the sound of a footfall on the pavement of the distant konigsstrasse were distinctly audible a faroff railway whistle was startling in its abruptness  in the midst of this calm the opening of the door of the salon with the sudden uplifting of voices in the hall told paul that yerbas guests were leaving  he heard dona annas arch accentsarch even to colonel pendletons monotonous baritonemillys high rapid utterances the suave falsetto of don caesar and her voice he thought a trifle weariedthe sound of retiring footsteps and all was still again  so still that the rhythmic beat of the distant waltz returned to him with a distinctiveness that he could idly follow  he thought of rosario and the rosebreath of the open windows with a strange longing and remembered the halfstifled sweetness of her happy voice rising with it from the veranda  why had he ever let it pass from him then and waft its fragrance elsewhere  why  what was that  the slight turning of a latch  the creaking of the french window of the salon and somebody had slipped softly half out on the balcony his heart stopped beating  from his position in the recess of his own window with his back to the partition of the salon he could see nothing  yet he did not dare to move  for with the quickened senses of a lover he felt the diffused and perfumed aura of her presence of her garments of her flesh flow in upon him through the open window and possess his whole breathless being  it was she  like him perhaps longing to enjoy the perfect nightlike him perhaps thinking of  so you arrange to get rid of meha lik thees  to turrn me off from your heels like a dog who have follow youbut without a wordwithout aathankswithout a ope  ahwe have serrved youme and my sister we are the orrange drynow we can go  like the old shoe we are to be flung away  good  but i am here againyou see  i shall speak and you shall hearr  don caesars voicealone with her  paul gripped his chair and sat upright  stop  stay where you are  how dared you return here  it was yerbas voice on the balcony low and distinct  shut the window  i shall speak with you what you will not the world to hear  i prefer to keep where i am since you have crept into this room like a thief  a thief  good  he broke out in spanish and as if no longer fearful of being overheard had evidently drawn nearer to the window a thief  ha muy buenobut it is not i you understandi caesar briones who am the thief  no  it is that swaggering espadachinthat fanfarron of a colonel pendletonthat pattern of an official mr hathawaythat most beautiful heiress of the californias miss arguellothat are thieves  yesof a namemiss arguelloof a name the name of arguello  paul rose to his feet  ah so  you startyou turn paleyou flash your eyes senora but you think you have deceived me all these years  you think i did not see your game at rosarioyes even when that foolish castro muchacha first put that idea in your head  who furnished you the facts you wanted  imother of god such factsi who knew the arguello pedigreei who know it was as impossible for you to be a daughter of them aswhat let me thinkasas it is impossible for you to be the wife of that baron whom you would deceive with the rest  ah yes it was a high flight for you meesmeesdona fulanaa noble game for you to bring down  why did she not speak  what was she doing  if she had but uttered a single word of protest of angry dismissal paul would have flown to her side  it could not be the paralysis of personal fear the balcony was wide she could easily pass to the end she could even see his open window  why did i do this  because i loved you senoraand you knew it ah you can turn your face away now you can pretend to misunderstand me as you did a moment ago you can part from me now like a mere acquaintancebut it was not always so  no it was you who brought me here your eyes that smiled into mineand drove home the colonels request that i and my sister should accompany you  god i was weak then  you smile senora you think you have succeededyou and your pompous colonel and your clever governor you think you have compromised me and perjured me because of this  you are wrong  you think i dare not speak to this puppet of a baron and that i have no proofs  you are wrong  and even if you can produce them what care i said yerba unexpectedly yet in a voice so free from excitement and passion that the weariness which paul had at first noticed seemed to be the only dominant tone  suppose you prove that i am not an arguello good you have yet to show that a connection with any of your race would be anything but a disgrace  ah you defy me little one  caramba  listen then  you do not know all  when you thought i was only helping you to fabricate your claim to the arguellos name i was finding out who you really were  ah  it was not so difficult as you fondly hope senora  we were not all brutes and fools in the early days though we stood aside to let your people run their vulgar course  it was your hired bullyyour respected guardianthis dog of an espadachin who let out a hint of the secretwith a prick of his bladeand a scandal  one of my peon women was a servant at the convent when you were a child and recognized the woman who put you there and came to see you as a friend she overheard the mother superior say it was your mother and saw a necklace that was left for you to wear  ah you begin to believe when i had put this and that together i found that pepita could not identify you with the child that she had seen  but you senora you yourself supplied the missing proof  yes you supplied it with the necklace that you wore that evening at rosario when you wished to do honor to this young hathawaythe guardian who had always thrown you off ahyou now suspect why perhaps  it was your mothers necklace that you wore and you said so  that night i sent the good pepita to identify it to watch through the window from the garden when you were wearing it to make it sure as the creed  i sent her to your room late that night when you had changed your dress that she might examine it among your jewels  and she did and will swearlook youswear that it is the one given you as a child by the woman at the convent who was your mother  and who was that womaneh  who was the mother of the arguello de la yerba buenawho this noble ancestress  excuse mebut perhaps you are not aware that you are raising your voice in a ladys drawingroom and that although you are speaking a language no one here understands you are disturbing the hotel  it was paul quiet pale in the moonlight erect on the balcony before the window  as yerba with a start retreated quickly into the room don caesar stepped forward angrily and suspiciously towards the window he had his hand reached forward towards the handle as if to close the swinging sash against the intruder when in an instant he was seized by paul tightly locked in a desperate grip and whirled out on the balcony  before he could gain breath to utter a cry hathaway had passed his right arm around the mexicans throat effectively stopping his utterance and with a supreme effort of strength dragged him along the wall falling with him into the open window of his own room as he did so to his inexpressible relief he heard the sash closed and the bolt drawn of the salon window and regained his feet collected quiet and triumphant  i am sorry he said coolly dusting his clothes to have been obliged to change the scene of this discussion so roughly but you will observe that you can speak more freely here and that any altercation we may have in this room will be less likely to attract comment  assassin said don caesar chokingly as he struggled to his feet  thank you  relieve your feelings as much as you like here in fact if you would speak a little louder you would oblige me  the guests are beginning to be awake continued paul with a wicked smile indicating the noise of an opening door and footsteps in the passage and are now able to locate without difficulty the scene of the disturbance  briones apparently understood his meaning and the success of his stratagem  you think you have saved her from disgrace he said with a livid smile in a lower tone and a desperate attempt to imitate pauls coolness  for the presentahyees perhaps in this hotel and this evening  but you have not stop my mouth foratomorrowand the whole world mr hathaway  well said paul looking at him critically i dont know about that of course theres the equal chance that you may kill mebut thats a question for tomorrow too  the mexican cast a quick glance at the door and window  paul as if carelessly changed the key of the former from one pocket to the other and stepped before the window  so this is a plot to murder me  have a care  you are not in your own brigand california  if you think so alarm the house  they will find us quarreling and you will only precipitate matters by receiving the insult that will make you fightbefore them  i am rready sir when and where you will said briones with a swaggering air but a shifting furtive eye  openathe door  pardon me  we will leave this room together in an hour for the station  we will board the night express that will take us in three hours beyond the frontier where we can each find a friend  but my affairs heremy sisteri must see her  you shall write a note to her at that table saying that important businessa dispatchhas called you away and we will leave it with the porter to be delivered in the morning  ori do not restrict youyou can say what you like provided she dont get it until we have left  and you make of me a prisoner sir  no a visitor don caesara visitor whose conversation is so interesting that i am forced to detain him to hear more  you can pass the time pleasantly by finishing the story i was obliged to interrupt a moment ago  do you know this mother of miss yerba of whom you spoke  thats mmy affair  that means you dont know her  if you did youd have had her within call  and as she is the only person who is able to say that miss yerba is not an arguello you have been very remiss  ah bah i am not one of youralawyers  no or you would know that with no better evidence than you have you might be sued for slander  ah  why does not miss yerba sue then  because she probably expects that somebody will shoot you  as you for instance  perhaps  and if you do notehyou have not stop my mouth but your own and if you do you help her to marry the baron your rival  you are not wise friend hathaway  may i remind you that you have not yet written to your sister and you may prefer to do it carefully and deliberately  don caesar arose with a vindictive glance at paul and pulled a chair before the table as the latter placed pen ink and paper before him take your time he added folding his arms and walking towards the window  say what you like and dont let my presence restrain you  the mexican began to write furiously then spasmodically then slowly and reluctantly  i warrn you i shall expose all he said suddenly  as you please  and shall say that if i disappear you are my murdereryou understandmy murderer  dont consult me on a question of epithets but go on  don caesar recommenced his writing with a malign smile  there was a sudden sharp rap at the door  don caesar leaped to his feet grasped his papers and rushed to the door but paul was before him  who is there he demanded  pendleton  at the sound of the colonels voice don caesar fell back  paul opened the door admitted the tall figure of the colonel and was about to turn the key again  but pendleton lifted his hand in grim deprecation  that will do mr hathaway  i know all  but i wish to speak with briones elsewhere alone  excuse me colonel pendleton said paul firmly but i have the prior claim  words have passed between this gentleman and myself which we are now on our way to the station and the frontier to settle  if you are willing to accompany us i shall give you every opportunity to converse with him alone and arrange whatever business you may have with him provided it does not interfere with mine  my business said pendleton is of a personal nature that will not interfere with any claim of yours that mr briones may choose to admit but is of a private quality that must be transacted between us now his face was pale and his voice although steady and selfcontrolled had that same strange suggestion of sudden age in it which paul had before noticed  whether don caesar detected it or whether he had some other instinctive appreciation of greater security paul could not tell  he seemed to recover his swagger again as he said  i shall hear what colonel pendleton has to say first  but i shall hold myself in readiness to meet you afterwardsyou shall not fear sir  paul remained looking from the one to the other without speaking it was don caesar who returned his glance boldly and defiantly colonel pendleton who with thin white fingers pulling his moustache evaded it  then paul unlocked the door and said slowly in five minutes i leave this house for the station  i shall wait there until the train arrives  if this gentleman does not join me i shall be better able to understand all this and take measures accordingly  and i tell to you meester hathaway sir said don caesar striking an attitude in the doorway you shall do as i pleasecarambaand shall beg  hold your tongue siror by the eternalburst out pendleton suddenly bringing down his thin hand on the mexicans shoulder he stopped as suddenly  gentlemen this is childish  go sir to don caesar pointing with a gaunt white finger into the darkened hall  i will follow you  mr hathaway as an older man and one who has seen a good deal of foolish altercation i regret sir deeply regret to be a witness to this belligerent quality in a lawmaker and a public man and i must deprecate sirdeprecate your demand on that gentleman for what in the folly of youth you are pleased to call personal satisfaction  as he moved with dignity out of the room paul remained blankly staring after him  was it all a dreamor was this colonel pendleton the duelist  had the old man gone crazy or was he merely acting to veil some wild purpose  his sudden arrival showed that yerba must have sent for him and told him of don caesars threats would he be wild enough to attempt to strangle the man in some remote room or in the darkness of the passage  he stepped softly into the hall he could still hear the double tread of the two men they had reached the staircasethey were descending  he heard the drowsy accents of the night porter and the swinging of the doorthey were in the street  wherever they were going or for what purpose he must be at the station as he had warned them he would be  he hastily threw a few things into his valise and prepared to follow them  when he went downstairs he informed the porter that owing to an urgent call of business he should try to catch the through express at three oclock but they must retain his room and luggage until they heard from him he remembered don caesars letter  had either of the gentlemen his friends who had just gone out left a letter or message  no excellency the gentlemen were talking earnestlyhe believed in the south american languageand had not spoken to him  perhaps it was this that reminded paul as he crossed the square again that he had made no preparation for any possible fatal issue to himself in this adventure  she would know it however and why he had undertaken it  he tried to think that perhaps some interest in himself had prompted her to send the colonel to him  yet mingled with this was an odd sense of a certain ridiculousness in his position there was the absurdity of his prospective antagonist being even now in confidential consultation with his own friend and ally whose functions he had usurped and in whose interests he was about to risk his life and as he walked away through the silent streets the conviction more than once was forced upon him that he was going to an appointment that would not be kept  he reached the station some ten minutes before the train was due two or three halfdrowsy wrappedup passengers were already on the platform but neither don caesar nor colonel pendleton was among them he explored the waitingrooms and even the halflit buffet but with no better success  telling the bahnhof inspector that his passage was only contingent upon the arrival of one or two companions and describing them minutely to prevent mistakes he began gloomily to pace before the ticketoffice  five minutes passedthe number of passengers did not increase ten minutes a distant shriekthe hoarse inquiry of the inspectorhad the herrs companions yet gekommt the sudden glare of a cyclopean eye in the darkness the ongliding of the longjointed and gleaming spotted serpent the traina hurried glance around the platform one or two guttural orders the slamming of doors the remounting of black uniformed figures like caryatides along the marchepieds a puff of vapor and the train had come and gone without them  yet he would give his adversary fifteen minutes more to allow for accident or delay or the possible arrival of the colonel with an explanation and recommenced his gloomy pacing as the bahnhof sank back into halflit repose  at the end of five minutes there was another shriek  paul turned quickly to the inspector  ah then there was another train  no it was only the up express for basle going the other way and stopping at the nord station half a mile away  it would not stop here but the herr would see it pass in a few moments at full speed  it came presently with a prolonged despairing shriek out of the darkness a flash a rush and roar at his side a plunge into the darkness again with the same despairing cry a flutter of something white from one of the windows like a loosened curtain that at last seemed to detach itself and after a wild attempt to follow suddenly soared aloft whirled over and over dropped and drifted slowly slantwise to the ground  the inspector had seen it ran down the line and picked it up then he returned with it to paul with a look of sympathizing concern  it was a ladys handkerchief evidently some signal waved to the wellborn herr who was the only passenger on the platform so possibly it might be from his friends who by some stupid mischance had gone to the wrong station andgott im himmelit was hideously stupid yet possible got on the wrong train  the herr a little pale but composed thought it was possible no he would not telegraph to the next stationnot yethe would inquire  he walked quickly away reaching the hotel breathlessly yet in a space that seemed all too brief for his disconnected thought there were signs of animation in the hall and an empty carriage was just reentering the courtyard  the hallporter met him with demonstrative concern and apology  ah if he had only understood his excellency better he could have saved him all this trouble evidently his excellency was going with the arguello party who had ordered a carriage doubtless for the same important journey an hour before yet had left only a few moments after his excellency and his excellency it would appear had gone to the wrong station  paul pushed hurriedly past the man and ascended to his room  both windows were open and in the faint moonlight he could see that something white was pinned to his pillow  with nervous fingers he relit his candles and found it was a note in yerbas handwriting as he opened it a tiny spray of the vine that had grown on the crumbling wall fell at his feet  he picked it up pressed it to his lips and read with dim eyes as follows   you know now why i spoke to you as i did today and why the other half of this precious spray is the only memory i care to carry with me out of this crumbling ruin of all my hopes  you were right paul my taking you there was an omennot to you who can never be anything but proud beloved and truebut to me of all the shame and misery  thank you for all you have donefor all you would do my friend and dont think me ungrateful only because i am unworthy of it  try to forgive me but dont forget me even if you must hate me  perhaps if you knew allyou might still love a little the poor girl to whom you have already given the only name she can ever take from youyerba buena    chapter vii  it was already autumn and in the city of new york an early sunday morning breeze was sweeping up the leaves that had fallen from the regularly planted ailantus trees before the brownstone frontage of a row of monotonously alike fivestoried houses on one of the principal avenues  the pastor of the third presbyterian church that uplifted its double towers on the corner stopped before one of these dwellings ran up the dozen broad steps and rang the bell  he was presently admittted to the sombre richness of a hall and drawingroom with highbacked furniture of dark carved woods like cathedral stalls and hat in hand somewhat impatiently awaited the arrival of his hostess and parishioner  the door opened to a tall whitehaired woman in lustreless black silk  she was regular and resolute in features of fine but unbending presence and though somewhat past middle age showed no signs of either the weakness or mellowness of years  i am sorry to disturb your sabbath morning meditations sister argalls nor would i if it were not in the line of christian duty but sister robbins is unable today to make her usual sabbath hospital visit and i thought if you were excused from the foreign missionary class and bible instruction at three you might undertake her functions i know my dear old friend he continued with bland deprecation of her hardset eyes how distasteful this promiscuous mingling with the rough and ungodly has always been to you and how reluctant you are to be placed in the position of being liable to hear coarse vulgar or irreverent speech  i think too in our long and pleasant pastoral relations you have always found me mindful of it  i admit i have sometimes regretted that your late husband had not more generally familiarized you with the ways of the world  but so it iswe all have our weaknesses if not one thing another  and as envy and uncharitableness sometimes find their way in even christian hearts i should like you to undertake this office for the sake of example there are some dear sister argalls who think that the rich widow who is most liberal in the endowment of the goods that providence has intrusted to her hands claims therefore to be exempt from labor in the christian vineyard  let us teach them how unjust they are  i am willing said the lady with a dry determined air  i suppose these patients are not professedly bad characters  by no means  a few perhaps but the majority are unfortunatesdependent either upon public charity or some small provision made by their friends  very well  and you understand that though they have the privilege of rejecting your christian ministrations dear sister argalls you are free to judge when you may be patient or importunate with them  i understand  the pastor was not an unkindly man and as he glanced at the uncompromising look in mrs argallss eyes felt for a moment some inconsistency between his humane instincts and his christian duty some of them may require and be benefited by a stern monitress and sister robbins i fear was weak he said consolingly to himself as he descended the steps again  at three oclock mrs argalls with a reticule and a few tracts was at the door of st johns hospital  as she displayed her testimonials and announced that she had taken mrs robbinss place the officials received her respectfully and gave some instructions to the attendants which however did not stop some individual comments  i say jim it doesnt seem the square thing to let that grim old girl loose among them poor convalescents  well i dont know they say shes rich and gives a lot o money away but if she tackles that swearing old kentuckian in no 3 shell have her hands full  however the criticism was scarcely fair for mrs argalls although moving rigidly along from bed to bed of the ward equipped with a certain formula of phrases nevertheless dropped from time to time some practical commonsense questions that showed an almost masculine intuition of the patients needs and requirements  nor did she betray any of that oversensitive shrinking from coarseness which the good pastor had feared albeit she was quick to correct its exhibition  the languid men listened to her with halfaggressive halfamused interest and some of the satisfaction of taking a bitter but wholesome tonic it was not until she reached the bed at the farther end of the ward that she seemed to meet with any check  it was occupied by a haggard man with a long white moustache and features that seemed wasted by inward struggle and fever  at the first sound of her voice he turned quickly towards her lifted himself on his elbow and gazed fixedly in her face  kate howardby the eternal he said in a low voice  despite her rigid selfpossession the woman started glanced hurriedly around and drew nearer to him  pendleton she said in an equally suppressed voice what in gods name are you doing here  dying i reckonsooner or later he said grimly thats what they do here  butwhat she went on hurriedly still glancing over her shoulder as if she suspected some trickwhat has brought you to this  you said the colonel dropping back exhaustedly on his pillow you and your daughter  i dont understand you she said quickly yet regarding him with stern rigidity  you know perfectly well i have no daughter  you know perfectly well that ive kept the word i gave you ten years ago and that i have been dead to her as she has been to me  i know said the colonel that within the last three months i have paid away my last cent to keep the mouth of an infernal scoundrel shut who knows that you are her mother and threatens to expose her to her friends  i know that im dying here of an old wound that i got when i shut the mouth of another hound who was ready to bark at her two years after you disappeared  i know that between you and her ive let my old nigger die of a broken heart because i couldnt keep him to suffer with me and i know that im here a pauper on the state  i know that kate and when i say it i dont regret it  ive kept my word to you and by the eternal your daughters worth it  for if there ever was a fair and peerless creatureits your child  and shea rich womanunless she squandered the fortune i gave herlets you lie here said the woman grimly  she dont know it  she should know it  have you quarreled  she was looking at him keenly  she distrusts me because she half suspects the secret and i hadnt the heart to tell her all  all  what does she know  what does this man know  what has been told her she said rapidly  she only knows that the name she has taken she has no right to  right to  why it was written on the trustyerba buena  no not that  she thought it was a mistake  she took the name of arguello  what said mrs argalls suddenly grasping the invalids wrist with both hands  what name her eyes were startled from their rigid coldness her lips were colorless  arguello  it was some foolish schoolgirl fancy which that hound helped to foster in her  whywhats the matter kate  the woman dropped the helpless mans wrist then with an effort recovered herself sufficiently to rise and with an air of increased decorum as if the spiritual character of their interview excluded worldly intrusion adjusted the screen around his bed so as partly to hide her own face and pendletons  then dropping into the chair beside him she said in her old voice from which the burden of ten long years seemed to have been lifted  harry whats that youre playing on me  i dont understand you said pendleton amazedly  do you mean to say you dont know it and didnt tell her yourself she said curtly  what  tell her what he repeated impatiently  that arguello was her father  her father  he tried to struggle to his elbow again but she laid her hand masterfully upon his shoulder and forced him back her father he repeated hurriedly  jose arguello  great godare you sure  quietly and yet mechanically gathering the scattered tracts from the coverlet and putting them back one by one in her reticule she closed it and her lips with a snap as she utteredyes  pendleton remained staring at her silently yes he muttered it may have been some instinct of the childs or some diabolical fancy of briones  but he said bitterly true or not she has no right to his name  and i say she has  she had risen to her feet with her arms folded across her breast in an attitude of such puritan composure that the distant spectators might have thought she was delivering an exordium to the prostrate man  i met jose arguello for the second time in new orleans she said slowly eight years ago  he was still rich but ruined in health by dissipation  i was tired of my way of life  he proposed that i should marry him to take care of him and legitimatize our child  i was forced to tell him what i had done with her and that the trust could not be disturbed until she was of age and her own mistress  he assented  we married but he died within a year  he died leaving with me his acknowledgment of her as his child and the right to claim her if i chose  andinterrupted the colonel with sparkling eyes  i dont choose  hear me she continued firmly  with his name and my own mistress and the girl as i believed properly provided for and ignorant of my existence i saw no necessity for reopening the past  i resolved to lead a new life as his widow  i came north in the little new england town where i first stopped the country people contracted my name to mrs argalls  i let it stand so  i came to new york and entered the service of the lord and the bonds of the church henry pendleton as mrs argalls and have remained so ever since  but you would not object to yerba knowing that you lived and rightly bore her fathers name said pendleton eagerly  the woman looked at him with compressed lips  i should  i have buried all my past and all its consequences  let me not seek to reopen it or recall them  but if you knew that she was as proud as yourself and that this very uncertainty as to her name and parentage although she has never known the whole truth kept her from taking the name and becoming the wife of a man whom she loves  whom she loves  yes one of her guardianshathawayto whom you intrusted her when she was a child  paul hathawaybut he knew it  yes  but she does not know he does  he has kept the secret faithfully even when she refused him  she was silent for a moment and then said  so be it  i consent  and youll write to her said the colonel eagerly  no  but you may and if you want them i will furnish you with such proofs as you may require  thank you  he held out his hand with such a happy yet childish gratitude upon his worn face that her own trembled slightly as she took it  goodby  i shall see you soon she said  i shall be here he said grimly  i think not she returned with the first relaxation of her smileless face and moved away  as she passed out she asked to see the house surgeon  how soon did he think the patient she had been conversing with could be removed from the hospital with safety  did mrs argalls mean far  mrs argalls meant as far as thattendering her card and eminently respectable address  ahperhaps in a week  not before  perhaps before unless complications ensued the patient had been much run down physically though as mrs argalls had probably noticed he was singularly strong in nervous will force  mrs argalls had noticed it and considered it an extraordinary case of convictionworthy of the closest watching and care  when he was able to be moved she would send her own carriage and her own physician to superintend his transfer  in the mean time he was to want for nothing  certainly he had given very little trouble and in fact wanted very little  just now he had only asked for paper pens and ink    chapter viii  as mrs argallss carriage rolled into fifth avenue it for a moment narrowly grazed another carriage loaded with luggage driving up to a hotel  the abstracted traveler within it was paul hathaway who had returned from europe that morning  paul entered the hotel and going to the register mechanically turned its leaves for the previous arrivals with the same hopeless patience that had for the last six weeks accompanied this habitual preliminary performance on his arrival at the principal european hotels  for he had lost all trace of yerba pendleton milly and the briones from the day of their departure  the entire party seemed to have separated at basle and in that eighthours start they had of him to have disappeared to the four cardinal points he had lingered a few days in london to transact some business he would linger a few days longer in new york before returning to san francisco  the daily papers already contained his name in the list of the steamer passengers who arrived that morning  it might meet her eye although he had been haunted during the voyage by a terrible fancy that she was still in europe and had either hidden herself in some obscure provincial town with the halfcrazy pendleton or had entered a convent or even in reckless despair had accepted the name and title of some penniless nobleman  it was this miserable doubt that had made his homeward journey at times seem like a cruel desertion of her while at other moments the conviction that millys californian relatives might give him some clew to her whereabouts made him feverishly fearful of delaying an hour on his way to san francisco  he did not believe that she had tolerated the company of briones a single moment after the scene at the bad hof and yet he had no confidence in the colonels attitude towards the mexican  hopeless of the future as her letter seemed still its naive and tacit confession of her feelings at the moment was all that sustained him  two days passed and he still lingered aimlessly in new york  in two days more the panama steamer would sailyet in his hesitation he had put off securing his passage  he visited the offices of the different european steamer lines and examined the recent passenger lists but there was no record of any of the party  what made his quest seem the more hopeless was his belief that after briones revelation she had cast off the name of arguello and taken some other  she might even be in new york under that new name now  on the morning of the third day among his letters was one that bore the postmark of a noted suburban settlement of wealthy villaowners on the hudson river  it was from milly woods stating that her father had read of his arrival in the papers and begged he would dine and stay the next night with them at under cliff if he still had any interest in the fortunes of old friends  of course added the perennially incoherent milly if it bores you we shant expect you the quick color came to pauls careworn cheek  he telegraphed assent and at sunset that afternoon stepped off the train at a little private woodland stationso abnormally rustic and picturesque in its brownbark walls covered with scarlet virginia creepers that it looked like a theatrical erection  mr woodss station wagon was in waiting but paul handing the driver his valise and ascertaining the general direction of the house and that it was not far distant told him to go on and he would follow afoot  the tremor of vague anticipation had already come upon him something that he knew not whether he feared or longed for only that it was inevitable had begun to possess him he would soon recover himself in the flaring glory of this woodland and the invigoration of this hale october air  it was a beautiful and brilliant sunset yet not so beautiful and brilliant but that the whole opulent forest around him seemed to challenge and repeat its richest as well as its most delicate dyes the reddening west seen through an opening of scarlet maples was no longer red the golden glory of the sun sinking over a promontory of gleaming yellow sumach that jutted out into the noble river was shorn of its intense radiance at times in the thickest woods he seemed surrounded by a yellow nimbus at times so luminous was the glow of these translucent leaves that the position of the sun itself seemed changed or the shadows cast in defiance of its glory  as he walked on long reaches of the lordly placid stream at his side were visible as far as the terraces of the opposite shore lifted on basaltic columns themselves streaked and veined with gold and fire  paul had seen nothing like this since his boyhood for an instant the great heroics of the sierran landscape were forgotten in this magnificent harlequinade  a dim footpath crossed the road in the direction of the house which for the last few moments had been slowly etching itself as a soft vignette in a tinted aureole of walnut and maple upon the steel blue of the river  he was hesitating whether to take this short cut or continue on by the road when he heard the rustling of quick footsteps among the fallen leaves of the variegated thicket through which it stole  he stopped short the leafy screen shivered and parted and a tall graceful figure like a draped and hidden columbine burst through its painted foliage  it was yerba  she ran quickly towards him with parted lips shining eyes and a few scarlet leaves clinging to the stuff of her worsted dress in a way that recalled the pink petals of rosario  when i saw you were not in the wagon and knew you were walking i slipped out to intercept you as i had something to tell you before you saw the others  i thought you wouldnt mind  she stopped and suddenly hesitated  what was this new strange shyness that seemed to droop her eyelids her proud head and even the slim hand that had been so impulsively and frankly outstretched towards him  and hepaulwhat was he doing where was this passionate outburst that had filled his heart for nights and days  where this eager tumultuous questioning that his feverish lips had rehearsed hour by hour  where this desperate courage that would sweep the whole world away if it stood between them  where indeed  he was standing only a few feet from hercold silent and tremulous  she drew back a step lifted her head with a quick toss that seemed to condense the moisture in her shining eyes and sent what might have been a glittering dewdrop flying into the loosed tendrils of her hair calm and erect again she put her little hand to her jacket pocket  i only wanted you to read a letter i got yesterday she said taking out an envelope  the spell was broken  paul caught eagerly at the hand that held the letter and would have drawn her to him but she put him aside gravely but sweetly  read that letter  tell me of yourself first he broke out passionately  why you fled from me and why i now find you here by the merest chance without a word of summons from yourself yerba  tell me who is with you  are you free and your own mistressfree to act for yourself and me speak darlingdont be cruel  since that night i have longed for you sought for you and suffered for you every day and hour  tell me if i find you the same yerba who wrote  read that letter  i care for none but the one you left me  i have read and reread it yerbacarried it always with me  see  i have it here  he was in the act of withdrawing it from his breastpocket when she put up her hand piteously  please paul pleaseread this letter first  there was something in her new supplicating grace still retaining the faintest suggestion of her old girlish archness that struck him  he took the letter and opened it  it was from colonel pendleton  plainly concisely and formally without giving the name of his authority or suggesting his interview with mrs argalls he had informed yerba that he had documentary testimony that she was the daughter of the late jose de arguello and legally entitled to bear his name  a copy of the instructions given to his wife recognizing yerba buena the ward of the san francisco trust as his child and hers and leaving to the mother the choice of making it known to her and others was inclosed  paul turned an unchanged face upon yerba who was watching him eagerly uneasily almost breathlessly  and you think this concerns me he said bitterly  you think only of this when i speak of the precious letter that bade me hope and brought me to you  paul said the girl with wondering eyes and hesitating lips do you mean to say thatthatthis isnothing to you  yesbut forgive me darling he broke out again with a sudden vague remorsefulness as he once more sought her elusive hand  i am a brutean egotist  i forgot that it might be something to you  paul continued the girl her voice quivering with a strange joy do you say that youyou yourself care nothing for this  nothing he answered gazing at her transfigured face with admiring wonder  andmore timidly as a faint aurora kindled in her checksthat you dont carethatthati am coming to you with a name to give you inexchange  he started  yerba you are not mocking me  you will be my wife  she smiled yet moving softly backwards with the grave stateliness of a vanishing yet beckoning goddess until she reached the sumachbush from which she had emerged  he followed  another backward step and it yielded to let her through but even as it did so she caught him in her arms and for a single moment it closed upon them both and hid them in its glory  a still lingering songbird possibly convinced that he had mistaken the season and that spring had really come flew out with a little cry to carry the message south but even then paul and yerba emerged with such innocent childlike gravity and side by side walked so composedly towards the house that he thought better of it    chapter ix  it was only the third time they had ever metdid paul consider that when he thought her cold  did he know now why she had not understood him at rosario  did he understand now how calculating and selfish he had seemed to her that night  could he look her in the face nowno he must be quietthey were so near the house and everybody could see themand say that he had ever believed her capable of making up that story of the arguellos  could he not have guessed that she had some memory of that name in her childish recollections how or where she knew not  was it strange that a daughter should have an instinct of her father  was it kind to her to know all this himself and yet reveal nothing  because her mother and father had quarreled and her mother had run away with somebody and left her a ward to strangerswas that to be concealed from her and she left without a name  this and much more tenderly reproachful bewildering and sweetly illogical yet inexpressibly dear to paul as they walked on in the gloaming  more to the purpose however the fact that briones as far as she knew did not know her mother and never before the night at strudle bad had ever spoken of her  still more to the purpose that he had disappeared after an interview with the colonel that night and that she believed always that the colonel had bought him off  it was not with her money  she had sometimes thought that the colonel and he were in confidence and that was why she had lately distrusted pendleton but she had refused to take the name of arguello again after that scene and had called herself only by the name he had given herwould he forgive her for ever speaking of it as she hadyerba buena  but on shipboard at millys suggestion and to keep away from briones her name had appeared on the passenger list as miss good and they had come not to new york but boston  it was possible that the colonel had extracted the information he sent her from briones  they had parted from pendleton in london as he was grumpy and queer and as milly thought becoming very miserly and avaricious as he grew older for he was always quarreling over the hotel bills  but he had mrs woodss new york address at under cliff and of course guessed where she was there was no address on his letter he had said he would write again  thus much until they reached the steps of the veranda and milly flying down was ostentatiously overwhelmed with the unexpected appearance of mr paul hathaway and yerba whom she had been watching from the window for the last ten minutes  then the appearance of mr woods californian and reminiscent and mrs woods metropolitan languid and forgetful and the sudden and formal retirement of the girls  an arch and indefinable mystery in the air whenever paul and yerba appeared togetherof which even the servants were discreetly conscious  at dinner mr woods again became retrospective and californian and dwelt upon the changes he had noticed  it appeared the old pioneers had in few cases attained a comfortable fortune for their old age  i know he added that your friend colonel pendleton has dropped a good deal of money over in europe  somebody told me that he actually was reduced to take a steerage passage home  it looks as if he might gambleits an old californian complaint as paul who had become suddenly grave again did not speak mrs woods reminded them that she had always doubted the colonels moral principles  old as he was he had never got over that freedom of life and social opinion which he had imbibed in early days  for her part she was very glad he had not returned from europe with the girls though of course the presence of don caesar and his sister during their european sojourn was a corrective  as pauls face grew darker during this languid criticism yerba who had been watching it with a new and absorbing sympathy seized the first moment when they left the table to interrogate him with heartbreaking eyes  you dont think paul that the colonel is really poor  god only knows said paul  i tremble to think how that scoundrel may have bled him  and all for me  paul dear you know you were saying in the woods that you would never never touch my money  whatexultinglyif we gave it to him  what answer paul made did not transpire for it seemed to have been indicated by an interval of profound silence  but the next morning as he and mr woods were closeted in the library yerba broke in upon them with a pathetic face and a telegram in her hand  oh paulmr hathawayits true  paul seized the telegram quickly it had no signature only the line colonel pendleton is dangerously ill at st johns hospital  i must go at once said paul rising  oh paulimploringlylet me go with you  i should never forgive myself ifand its addressed to me and what would he think if i didnt come  paul hesitated  mrs woods will let milly go with us and she can stay at the hotel  say yes she continued seeking his eyes eagerly  he consented and in half an hour they were in the train for new york leaving milly at the hotel ostensibly in deference to the woodss prejudices but really to save the presence of a third party at this meeting paul drove with yerba rapidly to the hospital  they were admitted to an anteroom  the house surgeon received them respectfully but doubtingly  the patient was a little better this morning but very weak  there was a lady now with hima member of a religious and charitable guild who had taken the greatest interest in himindeed she had wished to take him to her own homebut he had declined at first and now he was too weak to be removed  but i received this telegram it must have been sent at his request protested yerba  the house surgeon looked at the beautiful face  he was mortal  he would see if the patient was able to stand another interview possibly the regular visitor might withdraw  when he had gone an attendant volunteered the information that the old gentleman was perhaps a little excited at times  he was a wonderful man he had seen a great deal he talked much of california and the early days he was very interesting  ah it would be all right now if the doctor found him well enough for the lady was already goingthat was she coming through the hall  she came slowly towards themerect gray grima still handsome apparition  paul started  to his horror yerba ran impulsively forward and said eagerly is he better  can he see us now  the woman halted an instant seemed to gather the prayerbook and reticule she was carrying closer to her breast but was otherwise unchanged  replying to paul rather than the young girl she said rigidly the patient is able to see mr hathaway and miss yerba buena and passed slowly on  but as she reached the door she unloosed her black mourning veil from her bonnet and seemed to drop it across her face with the gesture that paul remembered she had used twelve years ago  she frightens me said yerba turning a suddenly startled face on paul  oh paul i hope it isnt an omen but she looked like some one from the grave  hush said paul turning away a face that was whiter than her own they are coming now  the house surgeon had returned a trifle graver  they might see him now but they must be warned that he wandered at times a little and if he might suggest if it was anything of family importance they had better make the most of their time and his lucid intervals  perhaps if they were old friendsvery old friendshe would recognize them  he was wandering much in the pastalways in the past  they found him in the end of the ward but so carefully protected and partitioned off by screens that the space around his cot had all the privacy and security of an apartment  he was very much changed they would scarcely have known him but for the delicately curved aquiline profile and the long white moustachenow so faint and etherealized as to seem a mere spirit wing that rested on his pillow  to their surprise he opened his eyes with a smile of perfect recognition and with thin fingers beyond the coverlid beckoned to them to approach yet there was still a shadow of his old reserve in his reception of paul and although one hand interlocked the fingers of yerbawho had at first rushed impulsively forward and fallen on her knees beside the bedand the other softly placed itself upon her head his eyes were fixed upon the young mans with the ceremoniousness due to a stranger  i am glad to see sir he began in a slow broken but perfectly audible voice that now you aresatisfied with the rightof this young ladyto bear the name ofarguelloand her relationshipsirto one of the oldest  but my dear old friend broke out paul earnestly i never cared for thati beg you to believe  he nevernevercared for itdear dear colonel sobbed yerba passionately it was all my faulthe thought only of meyou wrong him  i think otherwise said the colonel with grim and relentless deliberation  i have a vividimpressionsirof aninterview i had with youat the st charleswhere you said  he was silent for a moment and then in a quite different voice called faintly  george  paul and yerba glanced quickly at each other  george set out some refreshment for the honorable paul hathaway the best siryou understand  a good nigger sira good boy and he never leaves me sir  only by gad sir he will starve himself and his family to be with me  i brought him with me to california away back in the fall of fortynine  those were the early days sirthe early days  his head had fallen back quite easily on the pillow now but a slight film seemed to be closing over his dark eyes like the inner lid of an eagle when it gazes upon the sun  they were the old days sirthe days of menwhen a mans word was enough for anything and his triggerfinger settled any doubt when the trust that he took from man woman or child was never broken  when the tide sir that swept through the golden gate came up as far as montgomery street  he did not speak again  but they who stood beside him knew that the tide had once more come up to montgomery street and was carrying harry pendleton away with it
