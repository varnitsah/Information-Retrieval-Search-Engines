                                   225  then aunt dorcas and her family were ready for the ride              241  mcgowans restaurant aint in it alongside of what      we struck up at the princesss house                            245  tailpiece                                                              249     the princess and joe potter     chapter i  a ruined merchant   hello joe potter what you doin up in this part of the town  the boy thus addressed halted suddenly looked around with what was very like an expression of fear on his face and then recognising the speaker replied in a tone of relief  oh its you is it plums  of course its me who else did you think it was say what you doin round here whos tendin for you now  nobody  it dont seem as though this was the time of day when you could afford to shut up shop  but thats what i have done  got some portant business up here at the depot eh  joe shook his head mournfully stepped back a few paces that he might lean against the building and looked about him with a languid air much as if there was no longer anything pleasing for him in life  plums or to give him his full name george h plummer gazed at his friend in mild surprise  any other boy of joe potters acquaintance would have been astonished at the great change which had come over him but plums was not given to excesses of any kind save in the way of eating that which would have excited an ordinary lad only served to arouse plums in a mild degree and perhaps it was this natural apathy which served to give master plummer such an accumulation of flesh he was what might be called a very fat boy and was never known to move with sufficient energy to reduce his weight  sim jepson stated that plums sold newspapers in the vicinity of the grand central station because he lived only a couple of blocks away and therefore had sufficient time to walk to his place of business during the forenoon  how he ever earns enough to pay for fillin hisself up is moren i can make out master jepson had said with an air of perplexity by the time hes sold ten papers hes ate the profits off of twenty an acts like he was hungrier than when he begun  as plums waited for rather than solicited customers he gazed in an indolent fashion at the dejectedlooking friend who might have served as he stood leaning against the building on this particular june day as a statue of misery  joe potter was as thin as his friend was stout and ordinarily as active as plums was indolent his listless bearing now served to arouse master plummers curiosity as nothing else could have done  business been good down your way he finally asked  its mighty bad i got stuck on a bunch of bananas and lost thirtytwo cents last week then oranges went down till you couldnt hardly see em an i bought a box when they was worth two dollars it seems like as if every italian in the city what aint blackin boots has started a fruitstand an its jest knocked the eye out of business  i shouldnt think you could afford to lay round up here if it is as bad as all that  it dont make any difference where i am now cause ive busted plums ive busted failed up yesterday an have got jest sixteen cents to my name  busted master plummer exclaimed why you told me you had moren seven dollars when you started that fruitstand down on west street  seven dollars an eightythree cents was the figger plums an heres whats left of it  joe took from his pocket a handful of pennies counting them slowly to assure himself he had made no mistake in the sum total  master plummer was so overwhelmed by the sad tidings that two intending purchasers passed him by after waiting several seconds to be served and joe reminded him of his inattention to business by saying sharply  look here plums you mustnt shut down on business jest cause ive busted why dont you sell papers when you get the chance  i didnt see anybody what wanted one im jest knocked silly joe about your hard luck how did it happen  thats what i cant seem to make out i kept on sellin stuff an of course had to buy more but every night the money was smaller an smaller till i didnt have much of any left  i felt kind of fraid you was swellin too big joe when a feller agrees to give five dollars a month rent an hires a clerk for a dollar a week sames you did hes takin a pretty good contract on his shoulders did you pay sim jepson his wages all right  yes i kept square with him and i guess thats where most of my money went sim owns the stand now  he owns it why he was your clerk  dont you spose i know that but he was gettin a dollar a week clean money an it counted up in time if things had been the other way most likely id own the place today  master plummer was silent for an instant and then a smile as of satisfaction overspread his fat face  ill tell you how to do it joe hire out to sim an after a spell youll get the stand back agin  that wont work i tried it you see when it come yesterday i owed him a dollar for wages an thirty cents id borrowed there wasnt moren ninety cents worth of stuff in the stand an sim said hed got to be paid right sharp of course i couldnt raise money when id jest the sames failed an told him so he offered to square things if id give him the business an what else could i do i left there without a cent to my name but earned a quarter last night an heres whats left of it  the ruined merchant mournfully jingled the coins in his hand while he gazed dreamily at the railway structure overhead and master plummer regarded him sympathetically  what you goin to do now the fat boy asked after a long pause  thats jest what i dont know plums if i had the money i reckon id take up shinin for a spell even if the italians are knockin the life out of business  why dont you sell papers sames you used to  well you see when i went into the fruitstand i sold out my rights round the city hall to dan fernald an it wouldnt be the square thing for me to jump in down there agin  theres plenty of chances uptown  i dont know about that sposen i started right here then id be rubbin against you an its pretty much the same everywhere i tell you plums theres too many folks in this city i aint so certain but i shall go for a sailor they say theres money in that business  sposen there was barrels in it how could you get any out and in his astonishment that joe should have considered such a plan even for a moment master plummer very nearly grew excited you aint big enough to shin up the masts an take in sails an all that sort of work sames sailors have to do  id grow to it of course i dont expect i could go down to the docks an get a chance right off as a firstclass hand on masts an sails but i shouldnt go on a vessel you know plums im countin on a steamboat where there aint any shinnin round to be done them fellers that run on the sound steamers have snaps thats what they have you know my stand was on west street where i saw them all and the money they spend it dont seem like as if half a dollar was any account to em  but what could you do on a steamboat  i dont know yet but ill snoop round before the summers over an find out where you livin now  well say joe you can talk bout steamboat snaps but this house of mine lays over em all i spose ive got about the swellest layout in this city an dont have to give up a cent for it either first off mcdaniels counted on chargin me rent an after id been there a couple of days he said it didnt seem right to take money cause the place wasnt fit for a dog ill tell you what it is if mcdaniels keeps his dogs in any better shanty than that they must be livin on the fat of the land  whos mcdaniels  hes the blacksmith what owns the shanty where i live you see it was like this i allers sold him a paper every afternoon an when it rained or business was dull i loafed round there an thats how i found the place  do you live in the blacksmiths shop  well i should say i didnt right behind it is a shed he built to keep a wagon in but i guess he aint got any now leastways he dont flash one up there was a lot of old iron an the like of that thrown in at one end an when i saw it i says to myself says i thats a mighty good shanty for some feller what dont want to give up all the money he makes for a place to sleep in and i began to figger how it could be fixed it took me as much as two days before i could see into it an then i had it all in my mind so i tackled mcdaniels about hirin it he was willin so longs i greed to be careful about fire anwell if youre out of business now theres nothin to keep you from comin down tonight an seein it  im not only out of business but im out of a home plums you see when i sold the fruitstand of course i hadnt any right to count on sleepin there an  didnt sim jepson offer you the chance  he seemed to think it wasnt big enough for two  he didnt have any sich swell notions when you first started there an he wanted a place to sleep  yes i remember all about that but its no use twittin a feller he was willin enough to bunk in with me but if he dont want to turn about an give me the same show it aint any of my business  of course you can come to my place an stay jest as long as you want to joe an ill be glad to have you but if youre countin on workin downtown it wont be very handy  i aint certain but ill try my luck hangin round the depot here waitin for a chance to carry baggage ive done them kind of jobs before an they didnt turn out so terrible bad you see with only sixteen cents a feller cant spread hisself very much on goin into business  you might buy papers an sell em here it aint a very great show for trade but you wont have to work very hard an theres a good deal in that  yes plums there is for a feller like you what dont want to stir round much but im ready to hustle an it wouldnt suit me nohow you dont earn moren fifteen or twenty cents a day  not a great deal more master plummer replied in a tone of content and a probable customer approaching just at that moment he succeeded in making sufficient exertion to offer his wares for sale  thats jest about the way of it he exclaimed as the gentleman passed into the building without giving heed to the paper held invitingly towards him theres no use to hustle round here cause it dont pay if they want to buy papers they buy em an if they dont you cant give em away theres one good thing about doin business here though an that is the other fellers wont try to drive you out its mighty tough on you droppin all that money if id had most eight dollars you can bet i wouldnt take the chances of losin it id sooner spend the whole pile buyin swell dinners down on the avenue  yes its tough joe replied musingly but id a good deal rather get rid of the money tryin to make more than spend it fillin myself up with hash when do you knock off work  oh somewhere bout dark less ive sold out before say i know of a place where you can get the biggest bowl of stew in this city for five centsmost all meat of course therell be a bone now an thenyou expect that but its rich well go there tonight eh  i aint so certain whether a feller with only sixteen cents oughter spend five of it fer stuff to eat joe replied reflectively but if i make a few nickels tween now an night perhaps well take a whirl at it  a fellers bound to eat whether he makes anything or not so longs youve got that much money you might as well enjoy yourself now i say its best not to go hungry else you cant do so much work an then  ill see you later joe interrupted not caring just at the moment to listen to his friends ideas on the subject of food for it was well known among master plummers acquaintances that his highest idea of happiness consisted in ministering to his stomach  the fat boy gazed after the ruined merchant until the latter was lost to view amid the throng of pedestrians and then in a dreamy indolent fashion he turned his attention once more to the business of selling newspapers to such of the passersby as requested him to do so murmuring mournfully from time to time  seven dollars an eightythree cents an a feller can buy custard pies two inches thick for a dime apiece  having assured himself of a lodgingplace and decided as to what business he should pursue joe potter wasted no more time but set about earning his livelihood in as cheery a fashion as if the depression in the fruit market had brought him great gains instead of dire failure  before the night had come he was richer by forty cents through having carried to their several destinations a satchel for a gentleman a basket containing a kitten for a lady and a message for one of the employees at the station  business is boomin right along at this rate i guess i can afford to stand one of plumss bowls of stew he said to himself in a tone of satisfaction and was about to seek other employment when his name was called from a shop on the opposite side of the street  turning quickly he saw a boy with whom he had had slight acquaintance while in the fruit business who stood in the door of the shop and said as joe crossed the street  im workin here now its a good deal more tony than down on west street you oughter move your stand up this way somewhere  i havent got any to move joe replied and then explained why he was no longer connected with the business  the young clerk did not appear particularly surprised by the information  i thought thats bout the way it would turn out when i heard you hired sim to help you hes got the business an youve got the shake  sim was square with me joe replied stoutly  well im glad you think so for youre the only one he ever acted square with an it wouldnt astonish me a bit to know hed done you up  joe was a boy who would not willingly listen to evil words against one he called a friend and was about to begin a wordy war in sims behalf when his friends employer put an end to the conversation by demanding that the clerk get in and attend to business  i wont believe sim ever did a thing crooked to me joe said recrossing the street and taking up his station where he could have a full view of those who came from the building he saved his money while i was losin mine an thats all there is to it it seems like as if everybody wanted to jump on him cause he had sense enough to do jest what he has done  this was not the first time master potter had heard such an accusation against his late clerk and while he would not believe sim had been dishonest the suggestion so troubled him that he had some difficulty in banishing the matter from his mind  as the passengers from the incoming train appeared he had other affairs than sims possible dishonesty to think about as he did his best to attract the attention of those whom he thought might prove to be patrons  in this manner but yet without earning any more money the remainder of the afternoon was passed and when one by one the electric lights began to appear telling that the day had come to a close he decided it was time to seek out master plummer  now the thought of that bowl of stew for five cents was particularly pleasing and he had made up his mind to indulge in such a hearty meal when a little tot of a girl who could not have been more than three years old came out from among the throng of pedestrians and stood looking up into joes face  well say but you are a dandy master potter exclaimed in genuine admiration as he surveyed the tiny figure allowing his eyes to dwell almost lovingly upon the sweet baby face you are a dandy an no mistake but them as owns you must be crazy to let sich a mite of a thing snoop round here alone  the child came nearer and joe stooped down to look at her more closely for she was the most dainty little maid he had ever seen  id ask you to speak to me if i was any ways fit he said holding out a not overcleanly hand  the little maid must have judged the boy by his face rather than his apparel for hardly had he spoken when she came boldly towards him and laid her tiny hand on his cheek with a caressing movement that captivated joe immediately  talk about daisies why youre a corker you look jest like a pink an blue image ive seen in the shop windows whats your name  essie the little lady replied and added what may have been words but might equally well be greek so far as joe was concerned  whats that you say i didnt jest catch on  miss essie cooed at him once more and joe winked and blinked trying most earnestly to understand what she said but all to no purpose  then he stood erect fearing lest the little maids parents should appear and reprove him for having dared to speak to her but the moments passed and no one came to claim the child  it was evident essie had not been accustomed to neglect for when joe ceased speaking she put a tiny little hand in his and told him in her childish dialect what may have been a very interesting story  joe looked at the pink hand and then at his own soiled palm  id give a nickel if i was a little bit cleaner it seems like it was wicked to hold her hand while mine is so dirty she takes the shine off of anything i ever saw before say essie wheres your mamma  mamma dorn and the little lady clutched joes finger yet more tightly  well say do you spose this kids lost and now joe began to look alarmed anybody what would lose their grip of a dandy little thing like her ought to be horsewhipped an id like to do it  again he tried to get some information from the little maid and again she replied readily but joe was no wiser than before  the night had come those who passed this way or that on the sidewalk moved rapidly as if in haste to get home but no one gave any heed to the ruined fruit merchant or the charming little child by his side  look here baby joe said after what seemed to him like a long time of waiting and no one came to claim the child will you let me take you up in my arms if i try not to muss your clothes im fraid folks cant see sich a bit of a thing down there an ill hold you high sos your mother can find you easier  miss essie certainly understood something of what the fruit merchant said for she held out her hands towards him as if to be taken and he lifted her carefully saying as he did so  its pretty rough for a feller like me to handle a kid like her it seems like i was holdin some of that swell candy you see in the shop windows itll be a wonder if i dont daub her all up with my great dirty hands i never knew how big they was till she took hold of em  the little maid must have thought he was speaking for her especial benefit for she made reply in language which apparently gave her the most intense satisfaction but failed to enlighten master potter and during perhaps five minutes the two stood on the sidewalk near the curbstone jostled rudely now and then by the homewardbound throng but seeing no one who laid claim to the baby  this wont do at all joe said it aint right for you to stay out in the night and i dont know whats to be done unless you could stand it for a spell in plumss shanty say i wonder if that wouldnt go down will you be willin to hang round with us till mornin if i buy a slat of good things when it comes daylight i can find your folks without much trouble cause of course theyll be right here huntin dont you see is it a go  from what the little maid said joe concluded it was a go and since she made no protest when he walked swiftly down towards where he knew his fat and hungry friend would be waiting for him believed he had chosen such a course as met with her approval     chapter ii  the princess   it was no easy task for joe potter to carry his burden light though it was amid the throng of pedestrians without being pushed rudely here or there by those who were so intent upon their own business or pleasure as to give but little heed to the boy and the child  had he been alone he could readily have forced a passage but fearing lest the little maid might be injured by rough contact with one or the other he proceeded so cautiously as to make but slight headway until forsaking the sidewalk he betook himself to the street  there was a fear in his mind lest master plummer grown weary with long waiting had gone home and this would have been a serious matter because joe had no idea as to the whereabouts of his friends lodgings  once out of the throng he pressed on at a swift pace until he was nearly overturned by a boy coming from the opposite direction whom he had failed to see in the shadows  whats the matter with you chump cant you see where youre goin he cried angrily and the tightening of the little maids arm around his neck told that she was frightened  how much of this street do you own why dont you mind yourhello joe potter is that you and the ruined merchant recognised the voice as that of his friend with whom he had spoken a short time before in front of the fruit store  course its me you oughter look out how you run round here when folks has got babies in their arms  i didnt see you joe an thats a fact whered you get the kid  shes lost i reckon an im takin her home for tonight joe replied and without waiting to make further explanation hastened on leaving his friend the clerk staring after him in openmouthed astonishment  dont you be afraid little one joe said as essie clung yet more tightly to him they shant hurt you an if theres any more funny business of runnin into us tried ill break the fellers jaw what does it  the child seemed reassured by the sound of his voice and at once began to tell him something which was evidently interesting to herself  if i could understand what you say things would be all right joe said with a laugh and then as he emerged from the shadows cast by the overhead railway structure he came face to face with master plummer  well id begun to think you never was comin that young gentleman began but ceased speaking very suddenly as he observed the burden in joes arms what you got there  cant you see for yourself and joe lowered the little maid gently to the sidewalk that master plummer might have a full view of his treasure  well ill be blowed whered you get it  shes lost cordin to my way of thinkin an ive been tryin to find her folks but its no use huntin round in the night an ill tell you what it is plums weve got to take care of her till mornin  take care of her whats creepin on you joe potter how do you think were goin to look after a kid like that  i dont know why we cant joe replied sharply itll be pretty tough if a couple of fellers aint able to tend out on a mite of a thing such as her say plums dont she look like somethin you see in the store windows  shes fine as silk theres no gettin over that and master plummer would have touched one pinkandwhite cheek but that his friend prevented him  now dont go to hurtin her shes in hard luck enough as it is without your mussin her all up  whos ahurtin of her i was jest goin to put one finger on her cheek  theres no need of doin so much as that it might frighten the little thing and besides shes too fine to be handled by you and me plums shes a reglar little princess thats what she is and joe raised the child quickly as if to remove the temptation from master plummers path  whats her name the fat boy asked as he gazed admiringly at the child  i cant seem to make out she talks so queer and as if to illustrate his meaning joes princess began to chatter while she clasped both tiny arms around her selfelected guardians neck  well say id give up what i made this afternoon jest for the sake of havin her hug me like that aint she a daisy  it would be mighty hard to find anything finer in this town  thats a fact but say joe its no kind of use your talkin bout our takin care of her cause it cant be done  id like to know why  jest run your eye over her an then look at us why shes been kept rolled up in silk all the time an you talk bout takin her down to the blacksmiths shop  there was little need for master plummer to make further explanation joe had so thoroughly lost himself in admiration of the treasure he had found that until this moment he had not realised how poor was the home to which he proposed to carry her  now he looked about him in perplexity and the princess impatient because of the delay and her guardians silence began to protest most vehemently  see here plums weve got to take her down to your place an thats all there is to it there aint any chance of findin her folks tonight so what else can we do  its goin to be mighty tough on her master plummer replied with a shake of the head and joe put an end to further discussion by starting off at a rapid pace down the street regardless of the fact that he was in ignorance of the whereabouts of his friends lodgingplace  the princess satisfied now that they were moving cooed and chattered in joes ear much to his delight and master plummer was forced to follow or allow himself to be left behind  theres no use in rushin as if we hadnt another minute to live he cried when by dint of rapid running he overtook his friend i dont like to race round when we can jest as well go slow  it would be a good deal better if you walked fast once in awhile cause then you wouldnt be so fat  spose id rather be fat than as lean as some fellers i know  then it would be all right to creep along the street sames were doin now say how far off is your shanty  down here a bit but you dont count on goin right there do you  why not where else should we go  seems to me it would be better to get that stew first an then we shant have to come out again tonight  look here plums and joe spoke sharply do you think im goin to take the princess into a place where they sell fivecent stews  shes got to go somewhere if she wants anything to eat  well bring her supper to your shanty i wont carry this little thing into a saloon for a crowd of toughs to look at  master plummer sighed he had been anticipating a feast of stew from the moment joe left him to engage in his new vocation and it was a grievous disappointment that the pleasure should be so long delayed  well go down to your place an try an fix things up then you can leave us there  but you want somethin to eat as well as i do  i guess i can get along without anything for a spell its the princess im thinkin about shes got to have somethin fine you know stewd never do for her  hows custard pie i know where theyve got some thats greattwo inches thick with the crust standin up round the edge so the inside wont fall out while youre eatin it  perhaps the princess might like the custard but i aint so sure about the crust it seems to me shes been fed mostly on candy an sich stuff as that anyhow you take my money an buy whatever you think shed like got any candles down to your place  i did have one last week but the rats ate most of it an i dont spose it would burn very well now  take this nickel an buy some in that grocery store  why dont you come too  i dont believe the princess would like to go into sich a place an besides folks might want to take hold of her i aint goin to have any dutch groceryman slobberin over her  master plummer took the nickel and crossed the street in his ordinarily slow fashion while joe and the princess held a long and animated conversation to the evident satisfaction of the little maid and the mystification of the boy  owing to his being thus engaged joe did not grow impatient because of master plummers long absence as he might have done under other circumstances and said to his princess when the newsdealer rejoined them  now little one were goin to plumss home an you must try not to feel bad cause it aint very swell its bound to be bettern stayin out in the street all night for ive tried that game a good many times an theres nothin funny bout it  the little maid perched on joes arm something after the fashion of a bird chirped and twittered a reply and plums who had fallen in the rear that he might secretly touch the arm which was around joes neck said reflectively  i spose well have a high old time between now and mornin cause that kid sweet as shes lookin jest now aint goin to be quiet in a place like mine its fellers like you an me joe whove knocked round the city a good many times when we didnt have the price of a lodgin in our pockets what can preciate a home where the wind an rain cant get in  youre talkin straight enough plums an i gree to all you say but this ere princess aint like the general run of kidsthat you could see if you was blind shes a reglar swell an you can bet there wont be any kick cause we aint stoppin at the walledoff couldnt you get a little more of a move on at this rate we shant have supper much before mornin  master plummer was willing to comply with this request and did indeed appear to be making strenuous efforts to walk at a more rapid pace but having patterned after a snail so many years it seemed impossible for him to overcome what had become a habit  not once during the short journey did the princess make any protest against the plan her temporary guardian had suggested  she was very comfortable and although joes arms ached from long holding the light burden she knew it notperhaps it would have made no difference had she been aware of the fact  finally and after what had seemed a very long journey to the princesss guardian the little party arrived in front of the blacksmiths shop and master plummer conducted his guests through a narrow alley to the rear of the building where was a small shedlike structure the end of which was open save for a pile of boxes and boards directly in front of it  this is the place master plummer said with an air of proprietorship an seeins youve got the kid in your arms id better light a candle sos you can see the way cause theres a lot of stuff out here at this end ive been countin on clearin it up some day but cant seem to find the time besides it wouldnt make any difference to usits only cause weve got the princess to lodge with us that id like to see it a little cleaner say joe what is a princess anyhow  why its ayou see itsits awell look at her cant you see thats what it is shes a princess now dont be all night lightin one candle  it did really appear as if plums was even slower than usual and so awkward that two matches were consumed before the wick was ignited  you see i dont often swell out in so much style as to have candles an it takes me quite a spell to get one goin he said in an apologetic tone shes all right now though jest come round the end of that box an look out for this pile of iron cause you might trip there would be a mess if your princess was dumped down on this stuff  you get on with the candle an ill see to the rest of the business joe said impatiently for by this time his arms ached severely  master plummer obeyed and a moment later joe and the princess were surveying the home which occupied six square feet or more in one corner of the shed was walled in by barrels and boxes and furnished with a pile of straw and a disreputablelooking gray blanket  ive slept here some mighty cold nights an i know jest how good the place is the proprietor said proudly shes tight as a brick an there cant so much as a sniff of wind get in then look here  he raised the lid of a small box thereby displaying two tin tomato cans in which were fragments of biscuits a broken cup half full of sugar two wooden plates a knife a fork and a spoon  when trade is dull i buy stuff at the grocery store an bring it in here why joe things will keep jest as well in that box as they would in one of your tony frigerators an i aint sure but its better i have had ice in there two or three days though i dont know as it mounted to anything cept to wet everything  joe gave little heed to his friends cupboard he was looking around for some spot where the princess could sit down without danger of soiling her garments but failed to find that for which he sought  see here plums youll have to spread some papers over that blanket itll never do to put this little thing down where everything is so dirty  i dont see what there is round here thats dirty it seems like she couldnt come to much harm on the straw its only been here two weeks  put the papers down an well talk bout it afterwards it seems as though my arms would break  master plummer obeyed but with an ill grace for this faultfinding without reason was not agreeable  there was no lack of newspapers in the house and in as short a time as plums could compass it the straw was covered  it was with a long breath of relief that joe sat his charming burden down and then were the boys treated to an exhibition of the princesss temper  cleanly though the couch was she had no idea of sitting bolt upright when there were two subjects at hand to obey her wishes  she positively refused to be seated but held out her hands as if for joe to take her in his arms once more and when the boy attempted to explain that it was necessary she remain there a few moments the little maiden made protest at the full strength of her lungs  i guess ill have to take her up again joe said with a longdrawn sigh an i dont know as shes to be blamed for not wantin to stay there  well id never believed anything so pretty could screech so loud master plummer exclaimed in a tone of wonderment she yells jest bout the sames old mis carters kids do an theres nothin swell about them  joe made no reply he was too deeply engaged in trying to hush the princess to give any heed to his friends remark and fully five minutes passed before the imperious little maid was reduced to silence  then she nestled down in his arms with such apparent content and looked so charming that he was her willing slave without one disagreeable thought concerning her temper  if my face was washed id kiss her this minute he said half to himself and immediately master plummer looked jealous  if you can do that i reckon i can  well there wont either of us try it yet awhile so sposin you go after your supper an bring something for the princess when you come back dont be gone any longern you can help will you plums cause she must be gettin hungry by this time  ill take the cans an get the stew in them else id be gone quite a spell if i waited to eat my share will i buy custard pie for her  yes an anything else you think shed like dont get cheap stuff cause she aint used to it  then joe emptied the contents of his pocket in master plummers hands and the latter asked in surprise  are you goin to spend the whole of this  it dont seem as though youd have to an besides we ought to leave a little something for breakfast do the best you can plums  with an air of responsibility the proprietor of the establishment walked slowly out and joe was left alone with his baby  swaying his body to and fro to delude her with the idea of being rocked master potter did his best to please the princess and evidently succeeded for in a very short time after plums had departed the sleepelves soothed her eyelids with their poppy wands until she crossed over into dreamland  now joe would have laid the tiny maid on the straw to give relief to his arms but each time he attempted anything of the kind she moved uneasily as if on the point of awakening and he was forced to abandon the effort  i must be a chump if i cant hold a bit of a thing like her till shes through sleepin he said to himself an i oughter be mighty glad to have such a chance  it was monotonous work this playing the nurse while seated on the ground with no support to his back but never for a moment not even when his arms ached the hardest did joe potter regret having taken upon himself such a charge  he had given little heed as to how the princesss parents might be found because he believed that would prove an exceedingly simple task he had only to go to the railroad station in the morning and there deliver the child to her mother who as a matter of course would be in waiting  there was never a thought in his mind that by bringing her to this home of master plummers he had in fact secreted her from those who must at that moment be making eager search  he had done what seemed to him fitting under all the circumstances and felt well satisfied that no one could have cared for the child in a better fashion save in the matter of lodgings which last left much to be desired  after a time joe succeeded in so far changing his position that it was possible to gain the use of one hand and immediately this had been done he set about carefully covering the princesss garments with a newspaper lest he himself should soil the fabrics  then there was nothing to do save wait the leisurely movements of plums and it seemed as if fully an hour passed before that young gentleman finally made his appearance  if i havent got all you fellers can eat then im mistaken master plummer announced in an exceedingly loud tone as he entered the building and joe whispered hoarsely  what are you makin sich a row for if you aint careful youll wake the princess  well ill be blowed if she aint gone to sleep jest like any of mis carters kids would do plums said in a tone of surprise when he was where a view could be had of the sleeping child  of course she has you dont spose swells sleep different from other folks do you  i dont know cause i never had a chance to see one close to before say heres the stuff  plums was literally laden with small packages and in addition had the two tomato cans nearly filled with what he declared was great stew  i tell you theres no flies on that stuff an heres the pie he added as he took a parcel wrapped in brown paper from under his arm im fraid its got mashed a little but i couldnt carry it any other way takin the stew an that with what other things ive got itll be funny if your princess cant fill herself up in great shape  then from one pocket and another master plummer drew out two small cakes frosted with white and sprinkled with red sugar three inches or more of bologna sausage a cruller a small bag of peanuts an apple and two sticks of candy which looked much the worse for wear because of having been placed in his pocket without a covering  now if that aint rich enough for any fellers blood id like to know what youd call it three or four princesses like yourn oughter get through with a layout sames this an thank their lucky stars for havin the chance     chapter iii  an advertisement   having placed the packages on the straw near about his friend in what he believed to be a most tempting display master plummer seemed to consider that his duties as host had been performed properly and gave himself wholly up to the pleasures of eating  with one of the tomato cans between his knees he gave undivided attention to the savoury stew until the first pangs of hunger having been appeased he noted as if in surprise that joe was not joining in the feast  why aint you eatin somethin he asked speaking indistinctly because of the fullness of his mouth  i dont see how it can be done while the princess is asleep  put her down on the blanket where she belongs you dont count on holdin her all night i hope  it looks like id have to jest the minute i stir she begins to fuss round an  well let her fuss old mis carter says kids wouldnt be healthy if they didnt kick up a row every once in awhile  i guess she wont be sick any to speak of if we keep her quiet till mornin the trouble is plums theres bound to be an awful row jest as soon as she wakes up an finds out where she is i spose shes been tended like she was a piece of glass an the shanty must look pretty hard to her you can tell by the way she acts that the princess has always had a reglar snap an i wouldnt be sprised if this was the meanest place she was ever in  shell be lucky never to get in a worse one master plummer replied emphatically and added after having filled his mouth once more theres no reason why you cant eat your share of the stew an hold her at the same time  im fraid i might spill some of it on her dress  look here joe potter and now plums spoke sharply youll be all wore up before mornin carryin on at this rate it wouldnt hurt that kid a bit if she had every drop of stew weve got on her clothes an shes playin in big luck to be with us instead of walkin round the streets take your share of the stuff while its goin for of course you havent had anything to eat since noon  i had a pretty fair breakfast  an nothin since then master plummer cried in astonishment  well i wasnt hungrythat is not very you see when a feller closes up business the sames ive done he dont think much bout eatin  well think about it now an do it too  having thus spoken and in his sternest tones plums placed the second can of stew where his friend could reach it conveniently and waited until joe had so changed his position that it was possible for him to partake of the food  no better proof of master plummers interest in his friend could have been given than when he thus voluntarily ceased eating to serve him  the boys had not attempted to remove either the princesss hat or cloak and she appeared anything rather than comfortable as she lay wrapped in newspapers with her head pillowed on joes arm but yet her slumbers were not disturbed when master potter his appetite aroused by the odour of the stew proceeded to make a hearty meal  i spose we oughter wake her up sos shell get somethin to eat joe said thoughtfully and plums replied very decidedly  dont you do anything of the kind so longs a kids quiet youd better leave em alone cause it aint safe to stir em up less you want a reglar row  of course that wouldnt do but say plums if she keeps on sleepin like this it wont have been a terrible hard job to take care of her  not less you count on holdin her all night  joe was already cramped from sitting so long in one position and as if his friends remark had reminded him of the fact he made another effort to relieve himself of the burden this time being successful  the princess moved uneasily when she was first laid upon the bed of straw and the boys literally held their breath in suspense fearing she would awaken but after a few moments the child lay quietly and plums said in a tone of satisfaction  i know a good bit about kids i do cause old mis carter had sich a raft of em an i lived with her most a year the right way is to chuck em round jest as you want to an theyll stand it but once you begin to fuss with em theres no end of a row  the princess aint anything like mis carters youngsters  no i dont know as she is but i guess the same kind of handlin will fetch her round all right in the long run cant you eat some peanuts  ive had enough an besides we must leave somethin to give the princess cause shell be hungry in the mornin  yes i spose we must it always makes me feel bad to stop when theres good things in the house and master plummer told his friend of the great time he had had on a certain rainy day when it would have been useless to attend to business and the larder was well filled  i kept right on eatin from mornin till it was time to go to bed didnt rush you know but stuck at it  didnt it make you sick  well i did have a pretty bad ache before mornin but jest as likely as not that would have come whether id eat anything or not mis carter says if i dont stop bein so hungry all the time ill fill up a gluttons grave but how can a feller keep from wantin something to eat  i dont spose its anybodys business plums what you do so long as you pay the bills but it does seem to me that it would be better if youd get on more of a hustle when youre at work an stop thinkin so much about vittles i cant see how you earn money enough to keep this thing up  seems like ive got some push to me if i do it dont it master plummer replied complacently and there the conversation came to an end  plums having ministered to his appetite stretched himself at full length on the ground and it seemed to joe as if he had but just assumed that position when his heavy breathing told that he had fallen asleep  now and then from the street beyond could be heard the rumbling of a carriage sounding unusually loud owing to the stillness of the night at intervals the hum of voices told that belated seekers after pleasure were returning home and in fact everything reminded the ruined fruit merchant that the time for rest was at hand  joes eyelids were heavy with sleep yet he resisted the impulse to close them because it seemed necessary he should watch over the princess  the candle having burned down to the neck of the bottle in which it had been placed spluttered and fretted because its life was so nearly at an end and joe replaced it with a fresh one  with his back against the box which served as cupboard he sat watching the little maid with a strong determination not to indulge in sleep and even as he repeated for the twentieth time that it was necessary he remain awake his eyes closed in slumber  it was yet dark and the second candle nearly consumed when the princess suddenly opened her big brown eyes and during a single instant looked about her in silent astonishment  then as the only way by which she could express her displeasure with her surroundings the child opened her tiny mouth to its fullest extent and from the little pink throat came as shrill a scream as was ever uttered by one of old mis carters kids  joe potter was on his feet instantly and during the first few seconds after being thus rudely awakened was at a loss to understand exactly where he was or what had aroused him  the princess introduced herself to his attention very quickly however for she was a maid who had ever received and was ever ready to demand attention  joe had her in his arms as soon as might be but just at this moment it was her mother she wanted and the friendship previously displayed for her new guardian was forgotten  in other words the princess screamed passionately joe walked to and fro with her in his arms whispering soothing words which did not soothe and through all the uproar master plummer slumbered as sweetly as an infant  i know what you want you poor little thing but how am i goin to get it for you tonight why wont you try to make the best of it till mornin an then well be sure to find your folks here eat some of these peanuts they must be awful good cordin to the way plums pitched into em last night  the princess had no appetite for peanuts just then and as the readiest way of giving her guardian such information she struck the outstretched hand with her tiny fist sending the nuts flying in every direction  joe was considerably surprised that such a daintylooking little maiden could display so much temper but did not relax his efforts to please  one of the sugared cakes had escaped master plummers cyclonic appetite and with this the amateur nurse tried to tempt the screaming child into silence  the cake shared the fate of the peanuts and the princess gave every evidence in her power of a positive refusal to be soothed  joe had tossed her in the air fondled her in his arms paced to and fro as if walking for a wager but all without avail and now it seemed necessary he should have assistance  master plummers rest had not been disturbed by the noise but he rose to a sitting posture very suddenly when joe kicked him almost roughly  whawhawhats the matter he asked blinking in the light of the candle which was directly in front of his eyes  i should think you might know by this time cant you hear the princess  i thought thered be a row if she waked up master plummer replied in a matteroffact tone and then he laid himself down again evidently intending to continue the interrupted nap  see here plums you cant do that joe cried sharply i mustnt be left alone with this poor little thing it aint certain but shell die shes so frightened  dont fret yourself shell come out of it after a spell all mis carters kids used to  but she isnt like them i tell you they could stand most anything an shes been raised different  she cries jest the sames they did  look here george plummer get up on your feet an help me this thing is growin dangerous  plums had no fear the princess would injure herself by crying but his friend spoke so sternly that he decided it was wisest to obey the command and a very sleepylooking boy he was as he stood yawning and rubbing his eyes with an expression of discontent amounting almost to peevishness upon his face  there aint anything either you or i can do youngsters have to yell jest about so muchit makes em healthyan shell quiet down after a spell why dont you give her somethin to eat  i tried that but she wouldnt take a single crumb the trouble is we havent got what she wants now if there was some milk in the house  but there aint so whats the use thinkin of that  it must be near mornin an if there is a bakeshop anywhere round you could get some  do you want a feller to turn out in the night an travel round the streets lookin for milk plums asked indignantly  it is better to do that than have a dear little baby like this die  but theres no danger anything of that kind will happen ive seen lots of worse scrapes than this but they always ended up all right  look here plums will you go out an get some milk  whats the use  will you go an get the milk  just for an instant master plummer stood irresolute as if questioning the necessity for such severe exertion and then a single glance at his friends face decided the matter  in silence but with a decided show of temper the fat boy picked up one of the tomatocans jammed his battered hat down over his head and stalked out of the shanty  during this brief conversation the princesss outcries had neither ceased nor diminished in volume and when plums had thus unwillingly departed it was as if she redoubled her efforts  unfortunately joe had had no experience with old mis carters kids and when the childs face took on a purplish hue he was thoroughly alarmed believing her to be dying  dont baby dear dont youll kill yourself if you act this way im doin the best i know how but the trouble is i cant tell what you want  entreaties were as useless as any of his other efforts to soothe yet he alternately begged her to be silent and paced to and fro with her in his arms until when it seemed to him that at least one whole night must have passed since she awakened the princess tired of her exertions  then it was a tearstained griefswollen face that he looked into and the childish sobs which escaped her lips gave him deeper pain than had her most energetic outcries  believing her to be suffering severely the big tears of sympathy rolled down joes face as he told her again and again of all he would do towards finding her mother when the day had come  the princess was lying quietly in joes arms when master plummer finally returned bringing the can of milk and yawning as if he had been asleep during the entire journey and had but just awakened  now you can see that it was jest as i said he exclaimed when youngsters start in yellin theyve got to do about so much of it an theres no use tryin to stop em here ive walked all over this city huntin for milk when i might jest as well have been sleepin  it wont do you any harm plums an i honestly think the princess is hungry  she cant be very bad off with bologna an cakes an peanuts round ill bet she wont touch this  joe broke into the milk such fragments of cracker as remained in the cupboardbox after which and first wiping the spoon carefully on his coat sleeve he began to feed the little maid  illustration he began to feed the little maid  to master plummers disappointment she ate almost greedily and joe said in a tone of triumph  you may know a good deal bout mis carters babies but youre way off when it comes to one of this kind  i dont know whether i am or not and plums laid himself down once more falling asleep or pretending to almost immediately thereafter  having eaten with evident relish the food which had cost plums so much labour the princesss illtemper vanished entirely and she twittered and chirped to joe until he forgot his former fears and anxieties in the love which sprang up in his heart for the tiny maid who was dependent upon him for a shelter  the day was close at hand when the amateur nurse and his charge journeyed into dreamland for the second time and although joe had gained but little rest during the night his slumbers were not so profound but that a hum of shrill voices near the building awakened him very shortly afterward  the one fear in his mind was that the princess would be disturbed and he stepped quickly outside the shanty to learn the cause of the noise  here he is here he is now we was in big luck to come round this way one of a party of boys said excitedly and joe recognised in these early visitors three friends and business acquaintances all of whom were looking very serious and evidently labouring under great excitement  whats brought you fellers up to this part of the town so early joe asked in surprise and dan fernald who had under his arm a bundle of morning papers said in a mournful tone  weve come after you  what for im goin to hang round here a spell till i can get enough money ahead to go into business agin did you fellers think id be so mean as to sell papers round city hall after id sold out to dan  it aint anything like that joe potter master fernald replied so gravely that the princesss guardian could not fail of being alarmed  whats floatin over you fellers he asked sharply aint been gettin into trouble have you  were all right but theres somethin mighty wrong bout you joe say did you do anything crooked when you sold that stand to sim jepson  crooked why how could i hed been workin for me at a dollar a week an when i hadnt any more money he took the stand for what i owed him if you call it crooked to sell out a business for a dollar an twenty cents when it cost pretty nigh eight times as much youre off your base  then what have you been doin tim morgan asked  by this time joe began to understand that something serious had caused this early visit and he began to grow alarmed without knowing why it should disturb him  i dont want you to make any noise round here cause plums an me have got a kid what we picked up in the street last night an shes asleep it wont do to wake her less you want to hear the tallest kind of screechin but ive got to know whats givin you fellers the chills so out with it but be as quiet as you can  dan fernald looked at his comrades as if hoping one of them would act as spokesman but since both remained silent he began by saying  see here joe you know were your friends an are willin to do all we can to help you out of a scrape  yes master potter replied growing yet more alarmed because of dans solemn manner  if youd come right to us in the first place wed helped you no matter how much money was wanted  look here dan dont give me a stiff like this joe cried imploringly if anythings wrong out with it stead of mumblin bout helpin me ive allers managed to help myself and you fellers too a good many times so i dont know why you should stand round lookin like as if somethin was chewin you  if we wasnt your friends joe you might give us a bluff like that an even if we didnt take it wed make out as though we did see here and unfolding a newspaper dan pointed to an advertisement as he added i saw this almost fore i got out of the herald office an didnt stop for anything but jest to pick up tim an jerry before i come to find you  joe looked at each of his friends in turn before taking the proffered paper and then after considerable difficulty because of the necessity of spelling out each word in turn he read the following       joseph potter information wanted of a newsboy or fruit      vendor answering to the name of joseph potter he was last      seen in front of the grand central station at about seven      oclock on the evening of yesterday tuesday holding in      his arms a child three years old a liberal reward will be      paid for information as to the present whereabouts of the      boy address cushman  morton attorneys at law 4712 pine      street new york  immediately below this was an advertisement signed with the same names requesting information concerning a little girl who had strayed from the grand central station and was last seen in the company of a newsboy but this joe did not read  the fact that he was advertised for as if he had been a fugitive from justice terrified him  he could not so much as speak but looked alternately at the printed sheet and his companions until dan said sternly  now joe you can tell us bout this thing or not jest as you have a mind what weve come for is to help you get clear an were bound to do it  get clear of what joe repeated in bewilderment  you know bettern we do an i aint askin questions if you think it oughter be kept secret from us  but i havent been doin anything that wasnt square joe replied with a trembling voice  then whats a couple of lawyers advertisin you for tim morgan asked shrilly do you spose sich folks wanter catch a feller what sells papers jest to look at him  illustration dan pointed to an advertisement  see here tim you know me an you know i never did a mean thing to anybody in my life  then what they advertisin yer for  say fellers i wouldnt try to make out  now joe this aint any time for you to stuff us dan fernald said impatiently if you hadnt done anything crooked your name wouldnt be right there in them big letters youve allers been willin to do us a good turn an were goin to pay you back youve got to skip an youve got to skip bloomin quick     chapter iv  joes flight   it was literally impossible for joe potter to make any reply to dan fernalds positive statement that he must run away in order to escape punishment  as a matter of course he knew he had done nothing of a criminal nature and yet the advertisement which seemed to stand out more conspicuously than any other item in the paper could not be construed either by himself or his companions to mean anything else  the fact that it was signed by attorneys seemed to joe and his friends positive proof that a crime had been committed otherwise why would representatives of the law have appeared in the matter  dan fernald as joes oldest and nearest friend took it upon himself to act as master of ceremonies in the affair and understanding that his comrade was so overwhelmed by the impending danger as to be absolutely incapable of intelligent movement led him towards the shanty as he said gravely  never mind what it is youve done joe us fellers are goin to see you through an it wont do to hang round here very long if you plan on givin the perlice the slip i reckon theyll be hot after you before nine oclock an by that time im countin on havin you hid got anything here you want to take with you  joe shook his head but master fernald seemed to consider it necessary they should enter the building and his two comrades followed close in the rear  once inside the shanty the visitors as a matter of course saw the princess sleeping on the straw and despite the fact that her garments were not as cleanly as on the day previous making a most charming picture  well ill be blowed whered you get that  joe had been so bewildered by the terrible knowledge that the officers of the law were probably on his trail as to have forgotten for the moment that the princess was in his charge and he stood for an instant staring at her vacantly before making any reply which odd behaviour served to strengthen the belief in the minds of his friends that he was guilty of some serious crime  oh thats the princess she lost her folks somewhere near the depot last night an i was countin on findin em for her this mornin plums an me had to take her in else shed been layin round the streets  dan looked at him sharply while tim and jerry raised themselves on tiptoe to gaze at the sleeping child  well what you goin to do with her now dan asked after waiting in vain for his friend to speak  i dont know joe replied sadly and added in a more hopeful tone if you fellers would look after the little thing she might  well have all we can do keepin you out of jail without bein bothered by a kid taggin everywhere we go you dont seem to understand joe that its goin to take mighty sharp work an most likely every feller that ever knew you will be watched by the perlice from this time out  but i cant leave her here alone master potter wailed  why not take her down where plums used to live mis carters got a reglar raft of kids an oughter know how to take care of another  it would jest bout break the little things heart to put her in with that carter gang an i cant do it id sooner the perlice nabbed me  now youre talkin through your hat of course you dont want to go up to sing sing for two or three years an thats whats bound to happen if them lawyers get hold of you whats plums snorin away for when things are all mixed up so bad dan asked impatiently and without further delay he proceeded to arouse master plummer to a knowledge of the terrible danger that threatened joe by shaking him furiously  what do you want nowmore milk the fat boy asked without opening his eyes and dan pulled him suddenly to his feet  wake up an see what we want heres the perlice after joe redhot an weve got to get him outer town  after joe master plummer repeated stupidly whats he been doin  we dont know an he wont tell us  i havent been doin a thing plums as true as i live but there it all is in the paper master potter replied in a tearful voice of course theres no gettin away from that  not until plums had spelled out for himself the ominous advertisement was it possible for those who would rescue joe potter from the impending doom to do anything towards his escape and once having mastered the printed lines the fat boy gazed at his griefstricken friend in mingled astonishment and reproach  of course the perlice are goin to know you slept here last night an jest as likely as not ill be pulled for takin you in  course you will jerry hayes cried shrilly youre in a pretty tight box plums  joe protested vehemently that he was innocent of any intentional wrongdoing but with that unexplainable advertisement before him plums received the statement with much the same incredulity as had the others  where you goin to take him he asked of dan and the latter replied  i dont know but weve got to get him out of town by the shortest cut an i reckon thatll be thirtyfourth street ferry how much money you fellers got  master plummer took from his pocket that which remained of the amount given him by joe the night previous and after counting it twice replied  heres sixteen cents what belongs to joe an ive got twenty of my own  us fellers have anteed up a dollar an a quarter towards seein you through an here it is master fernald said as he gave plums a handful of small coins  joe did not so much as glance at the money and dan said impatiently  now dont hang round here any longer you two cause its mighty near sunrise  but what about the kid plums asked as if until that moment he had entirely forgotten the sleeping child  i reckon shell have to take her chances dan replied carelessly some one will look out for her of courseturn her over to mcdaniels the blacksmith  this suggestion aroused joe very suddenly and he glanced at each of his companions in turn as if to read the thoughts of all after which he said sharply  you fellers can believe me or not but i havent done anything to set the perlice after me i cant say as i blame you for thinkin it aint so cause theres that advertisement but its a fact all the same an im goin to let the cops take me  what tim morgan screamed youre goin to jail  what else can i do  run away of course the sames were fixin it  in the first place we havent got money enough to go very far an then agin i wont leave the princess knockin round the streets  youd have to if you went to jail  i could take her with me for a spell anyhow  joe appeared so thoroughly determined to give himself up to the officers of the law that his comrades were seriously alarmed  although there was but little question in their minds that he was guilty of some crime not one of them was willing he should yield to the order of arrest which they believed had already been issued  plums looked at dan imploringly and the latter said as he laid hold of joes arm  now see here old man we aint goin to stand by with our hands in our pockets while you go to jail cause theres no need of it the perlice wont be round for two or three hours an its pretty hard lines if we cant get you out of town before they come  i wont leave the princess joe replied doggedly  then take her with you of course theres a good deal of risk in it seeins how the advertisement said you had her but its a blamed sight bettern givin right up sames any chump would do  i counted on findin her folks this mornin  the way things have turned out you cant an whats the odds if you wait two or three days ill see that you have money enough to keep you goin for a spell anyhow cause all the fellers what know you an plums will chip in to help  am i goin too master plummer asked in surprise  i cant see any other way out of it when the perlice find where joe slept last night theyre bound to pull you in it dont look to me as if it was goin to be sich a terrible hard thing to go off in the country for a spell now the weathers warm an if it wasnt for the kid here id say youd have a great time  at this moment the princess awakened and fortunately in an amiable mood  she raised her hands towards joe as if asking to be taken in his arms and instantly the mute request was complied with the ruined merchants courage failed him  burying his face in her dress regardless of the possible injury to be done the delicate fabric the poor boy gave way to tears and the little maid must have understood that he was suffering for she patted him on the ear or ruffled his hair gently with her hands all of which served but to make his grief more intense  nows the time to get him right away dan said in a low tone to master plummer weve fooled round here too long already and if he kicks agin goin why weve got to lug him thats all i wont see joe potter put in jail if it can be helped  what do you spose hes been doin plums asked in a terrified whisper  blamed if i know but it must be somethin pretty tough else they wouldnt spend money advertisin for him  i dont blieve hed kill anybody  neither do i but it must be somethin bout as bad as that while hes takin on so we can get him off without much trouble wed better walk to the ferry cause there might be somebody on the horsecar what would know him  if ive got to leave the town i dont want to hang round long island cause there aint so much chance of gettin further away plums objected and dan began to show signs of ill temper at being thus thwarted in his efforts to do a favour  youll be blamed lucky if you get anywhere except to jail  but whats the difference if we go over to jersey it aint much further to the weehawken ferry than it is thirtyfourth street way  all right go there thenanywhere sos you get a move on  master plummer took the precaution to gather up such provisions as remained in the cupboard and after one long look around at the home he might be leaving for ever shook joe gently  come on old man this things got to be done an the sooner we start the better theres no show for you to give yourself up less im with you cordin to what dan says an you can bet i aint countin on goin to jail so long as it can be helped  joe rose to his feet obediently still holding the princess tightly in his arms and dan ordered jerry to precede them into the street in order to make certain the officers of the law were not in the vicinity  if you whistle once well know nobodys there an twice means that were surrounded  jerry looking as important as the occasion demanded set about doing the scouting for the party and an instant later a shrill call rang out on the morning air telling that the coast was clear  dan and plums ranged themselves either side of joe tim marched in advance wary as an indian hunter and in this order the little party gained the street the princess in high glee because of the numbers who were escorting her  joe neither spoke nor looked back his heart was as heavy as though the shadow of a real crime hung over him and had he been going directly to prison could not have appeared more despondent  on the other hand dan fernald was enjoying himself hugely  aiding a desperate criminal to escape from the clutches of the law was to him a most exciting adventure he had always believed he possessed remarkable detective ability and this was the first time an opportunity of establishing such fact had presented itself  if i dont get you two fellers out of this scrape then im willin to lay right down he said as tim and jerry led the way towards the west side of the city at a rapid pace ive kept myself posted on the detective business pretty sharp cause ive made up my mind to go into it before long an by the time we finish this job i guess the perlice will find out what im made of i aint so sure but i shall join the force after youre straightened out  they wouldnt take on a feller of your size master plummer said with something very like a sneer which was not seemly in view of the fact that dan was at this moment giving him the full benefit of his wonderful ability simply through friendship  it dont make any difference about a fellers size its the head what counts before long youll find out whether ive got one or not  joe gave no heed to his friends words his grief was so great that probably he knew nothing whatever regarding that morning journey save that the princess when not laughing and chattering at him was eating with evident relish the sugarbesprinkled cake which plums had slipped into her chubby hand  the boy did not realise that he might be doing a grievous wrong against the parents of the princess by thus taking her from the city he knew she would be cared for to the best of his ability and it seemed as if those who loved her must realise the same of course he understood that she was to be restored to her father and mother as soon as it should be possible but he failed to take into consideration the suffering which might be theirs because of her disappearance  therefore it was that in all this wretched business at the end of which he could see nothing but the open door of a prison the only bright thing to him amid the clouds of despair was the companionship of the princess  after the first slight sorrow at being forced to leave his home plums began to enjoy this flight and discussed with dan the possible enjoyment of a detectives life until the party arrived within a block of the ferryslip  it was yet so early in the morning that but few were on the street but dan had no intention of allowing the boy whom he was saving to enter the slip like an ordinary citizen  ordering a halt near the entrance of an alleyway which led between two stables he said with the air of a general  tim you scout along down towards the ferryslip an see if anybodys there on the watch well stay here sos we can sneak up through this alley if you should whistle twice jerry youre to walk back about half a block sos to make certain the perlice dont creep up on us from behind  but there aint a dozen people in sight an we can see that theres no cop round master plummer exclaimed whats to hinder our goin right on board the boat  look here plums if you know more bout this kind of business than i do take hold an run the thing well see how far youll get before the whole crowd is nabbed  i dont know anything about it of course but i can see theres nobody between us an the ferryslip that would likely make trouble  if we depended on you we wouldnt have got so far as we have master fernald replied disdainfully jest likely as not theres a dozen cops hid close round here an i aint goin to be fool enough to walk right into their arms  plums was silenced by this exhibition of superior wisdom and joe indifferent to whatever steps might be taken for his own safety therefore dan was not interfered with in his management of the affair  the scouts set about their work and not until fully ten minutes had passed did the amateur detective give the word for the fugitives to advance  i reckon its all straight enough now an well go on board the boat but theres no tellin what might have happened if i hadnt tended to the work in the right way  then master fernald walked a few paces in advance of his friends moving stealthily as if knowing danger menaced them on every hand and casting furtive glances up and down the street until had any one observed his movements suspicions must have been aroused as to the innocence of his purpose  jerry paid for the ferry tickets out of his own funds for it was the purpose of these rescuers to remain in the company of the fugitives until they should have escaped from the state  once on the boat joe wanted to remain in the ladies cabin because of the princess but dan would not countenance any such rash proceeding  he insisted that they must take up their stations in what was for the time being the bow of the boat where they could prevent possible pursuers from sneakin up on em  the princess made no objection to this breezy position otherwise the boy who was being rescued by master fernald would have flatly refused to obey orders and thus the fugitives and their friends remained where every passenger on board must of necessity have seen them  dan gave his friends what he considered good advice during the passage and when the boat was nearing the slip on the jersey side summed up his instructions with a statement which electrified them all  you fellers are to hang round weehawken till long towards dark when plums must come down to the ferryslip im goin back to new york to fix up my business sos i can stay with you till the worst of the trouble is over  are you countin on runnin away with us master plummer asked in surprise  thats jest the size of it you fellers dont seem to know scarcely anything at all about takin care of yourselves an if i dont tend to business youll both be in jail before tomorrow mornin im goin to size up things round perlice headquarters today an then come over to look after you jest as soons the boat touches the slip you two take a sneak find some place where you can hide till night an then watch out for me  five minutes later the fugitives stepped on jersey soil and master fernalds scouts were deployed to guard against an attack from the enemy until the two boys were lost to view in the distance then the amateur detective said in a tone of grim determination now fellers well go back an size up the cops in new york     chapter v  in the city   when dan fernald and his two assistants returned to their usual place of business in the city they found joe potters mercantile friends in a state of high excitement  it seemed as if the eyes of each boy who was acquainted with joe had been attracted to that particular advertisement and business among a certain portion of the youthful merchants in the vicinity of city hall square was almost entirely suspended because of the startling information that the lawyers were after joe potter  it was only natural for each fellow to speculate as to the reason why the unfortunate fruit merchant should be wanted and many and wild were the theories advanced  some of the boys even went so far as to suggest that joe had robbed a bank and in order to make such a proposition plausible insinuated that he had failed in the fruit business simply for the purpose of deceiving the public as to the true state of his finances  little billy dooner ventured the opinion that perhaps joe had killed a italian but no one gave weight to the possible explanation for master potter enjoyed the reputation of being as peaceable a boy as could be found in the city  when each one of those more particularly interested had in turn given his theory regarding the mystery without throwing any positive light on the subject the conversation was always brought to a close with something like the following words  at any rate hes gone a mighty long ways crooked else the lawyers wouldnt spend money advertisin for him  the arrival of dan fernald and his assistants only served to heighten the mystery for these young gentlemen positively refused to make any statement either for or against the missing boy and the natural result was that they were credited with knowing very much more regarding the affair than really was the case  dan immediately assumed such an air as he believed befitted detectives and hinted more than once that joes friends would be sprised before the day was ended  not until noon was there any change in the situation of affairs and then a bootblack who worked in the vicinity of the grand central station came down to city hall square with information that plums was no longer attending to business  if he wasnt so bloomin slow id say hed run away with joe potter the informant added but as it is he couldnt get out of the town in much less than a week even if he humped hisself the best he knew how  under ordinary circumstances plums might have disappeared without causing a ripple of excitement among his business acquaintances but since joe potter was missing also it began to look as if the two might be together  at three oclock in the afternoon sim jepson startled the community of newsboys by announcing that he had been closely questioned by a man in citizens clothing who looked for all the world like a cop got up in disguise concerning joes habits and master jepson added on his own responsibility  theyre after him hot an no mistake hell be mighty smart if he can keep out of sight when theyve gone reglarly to work huntin him up  this information disturbed dan fernald not a little  although quite positive he was a match for any detective or policeman in the city dan would have preferred to work on a case where there appeared to be less danger this affair of joes was growing more serious each moment and he who meddled with it might come to grief but yet never for a moment did master fernald think of abandoning his friend  ill do jest as i told him i would no matter what kind of a scrape i get into he said confidentially to tim and jerry you fellers must hang round here sos to find out all thats goin on an be sure to let me know if any more men come here searchin for joe  but you aint goin to stay in weehawken  well i guess not  then how shall we know where to find you  look here jerry hayes if you aint smart enough to find us three when you know were somewhere in jersey it aint any kind of use for you to try to be a detective cause youll never make one you must come over to weehawken an get on our trail then the rest of it will be easy enough  id like to know how were goin to do that  if ive got to explain every little thing i might jest as well run this case all by myself findin a man when you dont know where he is is the first thing a detective has to learn an youd better put in a good part of your time studyin it up now im goin to see how much money i can raise an long bout five oclock you can count on my sneakin out of town  while his friends were thus speculating and working in what they believed to be his behalf joe was spending a most wretched day  immediately after landing from the ferryboat he carrying the princess and followed by plums walked directly away from the river believing that by such a course he would the sooner arrive at the open country  now that he was really running away his fears increased momentarily  while in the city it had seemed to him as if he could summon up sufficient courage to surrender himself to those people who most likely wanted to commit him to prison but having once begun the flight all his courage vanishedhe no longer even so much as dreamed of facing the trouble  the princess well content with this morning stroll and the cake joe had given her appeared willing to continue such form of amusement indefinitely  she laughed and crowed until the young guardian trembled lest she should attract undue attention to him and when ceasing this the little maid poured some wondrous tale in his ear his heart smote him for he believed she was urging to be taken home  ill find your mother baby darling the very first thing after i get out of this scrape but there couldnt any one blame me for runnin away when the perlice are after me  plums was more discontented than alarmed during this journey there was altogether too much walking in it to please him and joe pushed ahead so rapidly that he nearly lost his breath trying to keep pace with him  if you go on this way much longer ill have to give the thing up he said in despair when they were a mile or more from the ferryslip  but you surely ought to walk as fast as i can when i am carrying the princess  perhaps i oughter but i cant im pretty near knocked out of time already why not slack up a little now were so far from the city  i dont dare to plums we havent gone any distance yet an jest as likely as not the perlice here have had orders to stop us do the best you can a spell longer an perhaps we can find a place to hide in till you get rested  master plummer made no reply but his companion could readily see that he was suffering severely from such unusual exertions his fat face was of a deep crimson hue tiny streams of perspiration ran down his cheeks and he breathed like one affected with the asthma  there was little need for master plummer to explain that a halt would soon be necessary for this joe understood after but one glance at the unhappylooking boy  the princesss guardian had hoped they might gain the forest where it would be possible to hide or at the least find a small thicket of trees or bushes but as yet there were dwellings on every hand and each instant the sun was sending down more fervent rays  at the expiration of an additional ten minutes plums gave up the struggle by saying despondently  its no use joe i couldnt keep on my feet half an hour longer to save the lives of all hands sposin you leave me here an go on by yourself that will be better than for both of us to be arrested  im not sich a chump as to do anything of that kind old man you got into this trouble through tryin to help me an ill stay right side of you till its over  but it aint safe to hang round here  i know it yet what else can we do were bound to take the chances an im goin to stop at one of these houses  master plummer appeared thoroughly alarmed yet he made no protest against the proposed plan  at that moment imprisonment had less horrors for him than such severe exertions  joes greatest fear was that while asking for shelter he would be forced to explain why he was taking the princess with him for a long tramp when the day was so warm and dangerous though such a course might be he was resolved to tell only the truth  if i cant get through without lyin ill go to jail an take my medicine like a man he said to himself and once this resolve had been made he stopped in front of the nearest dwelling  his timid knock at the door was answered by a motherlylooking german woman who appeared surprised at seeing the visitors  if well pay whatever you think is right may we come in an stay a little while joe asked falteringly its awful hot an the princess must be tired  kannst du kein deutch sprechen  joe looked at her in bewilderment and plums said in a whisper  she talks a good deal the way the princess does i guess the kid must know what she says  we want to come in for a little while an are willin to pay you for it joe repeated and the old lady shook her head doubtfully as she leaned over and kissed the princess squarely on the mouth  ich kann nicht englisch sprechen  as she spoke the good woman gave joe a smile which went far towards reassuring him and he in turn shook his head  i guess well have to give it up plums said mournfully its too bad for she must be a real good kind of an old woman or she wouldnt have kissed the princess  joe hesitated an instant and had half turned to go when the old lady stretched out her hands towards the child who immediately displayed a very decided desire to forsake the boy who had ministered to her wants so devotedly during the past twelve or fifteen hours  komme herein aus der hitze  this was said with a gesture which could not be misunderstood as the old lady took the princess in her arms and joe followed without hesitation master plummer saying meanwhile  if she cant talk united states an that seems to be about the size of it there aint any chance she can tell where we are its mighty lucky we struck her cordin to my way of thinkin  joe was of the same opinion when the old lady ushered them into a cleanly but scantily furnished room so darkened as to make it seem cool by comparison with the scorching rays of the sun on the pavements and then gave her undivided attention to the baby  she took off the childs hat and cloak and carrying her into an adjoining room bathed her face and hands much to the delight of the princess  id a washed her up this mornin if i hadnt been fraid shed get mad about it joe said regretting most sincerely that he had not attended to the little maidens toilet in a proper manner  whats the good old mis carter says dirt makes children healthy an if thats straight i should say your princess needs a couple of quarts to put her in trim  illustration may we come in an stay a little while  she aint like mis carters kids so whats the use to keep throwin them up all the time say plums look at the old woman now why didnt i think of cuddlin the princess in that style  their hostess having made the little maid more presentable gathered the child to her breast as she rocked to and fro in a capacious armchair singing a lullaby which speedily closed the two brown eyes in slumber  i shouldnt feel very bad if the old woman served me in the same way master plummer said with a longdrawn sigh as he straightened himself up in the wooden chair id rather lay right down on the floor an go to sleep than do anything else i know of  but you mustnt plums you mustnt joe whispered nervously if you should do anything like that shed think we was moren half fools both of us  seid ihr kinder hungrich  the old lady spoke so abruptly that the boys started as if in alarm both looking at her with such a puzzled expression on their faces that she must have known they failed to understand the question  perhaps she thinks we cant pay our way plums whispered you might let her know weve got money even if you cant do anything better  joe acted upon the suggestion at once by taking several coins from his pocket holding them towards the old lady  she shook her head and smiled cheerily then laying the princess on a chintzcovered couch without disturbing the childs slumbers she left the room  again was master potter surprised by the apparently careless yet deft manner in which she handled the child and he said in a tone of admiration to his friend  dont it jest knock your eye out to see the way she fools with the princess an yet the little thing seems to like it if id done half as much as that shed be screechin blue murder by this time  women know how to take care of kids bettern boys do though i aint any slouch at it cause ive tried it so many times down to mis carters  i notice you couldnt stop her from cryin last night  i didnt try did i perhaps if you hadnt sent me racin all over the city for milk i mighter done somethin  this conversation was interrupted by the german lady who returned bringing two plates one of which was heaped high with seedcakes and the other filled with generous slices of boiled ham  if a boys mouth ever did water plums was in that peculiar condition just at that moment  alarmed by the news which dan fernald brought he had for perhaps the first time in his life forgotten to eat breakfast and nothing could have been more welcome in his eyes than this plentiful supply of food  better pay her for it he whispered to joe an then shell be likely to bring on more i could eat all shes got there an not half try  joe did as his companion wished but the old lady positively refused to take the money until the boy urged her in dumb show when with the air of one who complies with a request against her will she took from master potters outstretched hand a dime  plums had not waited for this business to be finished before he began the attack and when joe turned he saw that his comrade had assumed a position of supreme content with three seedcakes in one hand and a large slice of ham in the other  youre awfully good to us an i wish youd taken more money joe said as he helped himself to a small portion of the food knowing even as he spoke that his words would not be understood  the old lady smiled and went out of the room again returning almost immediately with a glass of water and more ham much to master plummers satisfaction  i guess were fixed jest about as well as we could be an itll pay us to hang on here till dan comes over this beats walkin round the streets  perhaps she wouldnt like it if we stayed a great while joe suggested  well sposin she shouldnt so longs she cant talk united states theres no chance of her turnin us out or tellin where we are  would you stay here when you thought she didnt want us  id stay in most any place where we was strikin it as rich as we are jest now and then master plummer ceased speaking in order that he might give more attention to this unexpected meal     chapter vi  dan the detective   it was sunset and master plummer stood at the ferryslip in weehawken awaiting the coming of dan the detective  much against his will had the fat boy left the home of the german lady to set out on this long tramp he understood that it would not be safe for joe to come out of hiding and because of the arrangements made by dan in the morning it was absolutely necessary some one should meet the amateur detective at the ferryslip  hence it was that master plummer was loitering around just outside the gate keeping a close watch upon all who came from the boat and on the alert for anything bearing the resemblance of a blue coat with brass buttons  dan fernald believing that a detective who knew his business would not make a single movement without a certain attendant mystery had decided it was not safe for him to leave new york in the daytime and therefore plumss time of waiting was exceedingly long  not until eight oclock did dan appear and then instead of answering his friends hail he marched gravely out through the gate crossed the street and during several seconds stood peering first to the right and then the left while from the opposite side plums looked at him in bewilderment  master plummer had spoken to his friend but received no reply had followed a certain distance without being apparently recognised and stopped in bewilderment when dan indulged in these curious antics  finally the fat boy grew impatient and crossing the street asked sharply  whats the matter with you anyhow dan  master fernald glanced at his friend only sufficiently long to wink in a most mysterious fashion and then turning quickly around marched gravely up the street without speaking  plums watched in anxiety until seeing his friend dart into a doorway it suddenly dawned upon him that dan was desirous of avoiding a too public interview  then plums hastened after him muttering to himself  that feller thinks hes awful smart scrimpin an scrapin round here as if there was a dozen perlicemen right on his track if hed go on about his business nobodyd notice him but when hes kitin round in this fashion folks are bound to wonder whats the matter  on arriving at the doorway he looked in but without seeing any one because of the gloom  thinking he had made a mistake plums would have hurried on but for a hoarse whisper which came from out the darkness  come in here quick dont stand there where everybodyll tumble to who you are  plums obeyed immediately as was his custom when any one spoke harshly and dan seized him by the arm  keep quiet now whatever you do cause i wouldnt be sprised if moren a dozen cops followed me over on the boat  i didnt see any plums replied in astonishment  thats cause you didnt keep your eye peeled of course they wouldnt try to get on my track while they was dressed in uniform i saw one i felt certain about he was disguised like a truckman an drivin a team but he couldnt fool me  do they know where joe an i are  i dont think so but jest as soon as i left the town they was bound to have their eyes open mighty wide cause i guess it must be known up to perlice headquarters that im in on this case wheres joe  master plummer told the amateur detective of the very pleasant refuge they had found and concluded by saying  first off we couldnt talk with the old woman at all but at dinnertime a kid about half as big as me what calls her grandmarm come home an he knew how to talk united states little as he was he could chin in the old womans lingo as fast as she that fixed things for us joe said he was out lookin for work which is the dead truth when you come to that an made a trade for us to stay there a couple of days i was fraid theyd ask about the princess but it seems like they didnt they thought she belonged to us straight enough so its been all plain sailin  i didnt get over here any too soon if you fellers have gone to stoppin at a house  but why shouldnt we when we found one like that where theyll take us in mighty cheap an say that old woman is the boss cook  an shell get in jail too if you keep on this way heres you an joe advertised for by the lawyers an yet are sich chumps as to settle right down where the detectives will get on to you the very first thing  i aint been advertised for  well thats where you make a mistake master smartie perhaps you havent seen the evenin papers  whats in them plums cried in a tone of alarm  pretty much the same as what you saw in the herald this mornin only that theyre offerin to pay for any news of joe potter an a feller whats called plums  do you mean that dan are they really advertisin for me master plummer asked in a tone of terror  thats what theyre doin an the way the cops are chasin round town huntin up bootblacks an newsboys is a caution three different ones asked jerry hayes if he knew you or joe but you can bet they didnt find out very much jerrys sharp enough to keep his mouth shut  but what do they want me for what have i done  i reckon its cause joe slept at your house now the only safe thing is for us to strike off into the country as quick as we know how weve got to walk all night before we so much as think of stoppin  but what about the princess we cant make that little thing travel from post to pillar  if joe potter hadnt been a fool hed left her in town it jest makes my blood boil when i think of his havin a kid taggin round after him an every detective in new york on his track  i dont believe hed be willin to leave the princess not even if he knew he was goin to be rested the next minute  hes got to or ill throw up the job of tryin to save him now well go up to this dutch womans house that youve been talkin bout an snake him out all i hope is well get away in time  master plummer turned to walk out of the hallway in obedience to this command when dan clutching him by the arm brought the boy to a sudden standstill  what kind of a way is that to go out when the streets are full of detectives huntin after you  how else can i go plums asked in surprise  ill show you watch out on what i do an act the very same way ill go on one side of the street an you on the other sos folks shant know were together  master plummer was puzzled to understand why it might work them mischief if the public knew they were acquainted with each other but dan was so peremptory in his commands that the boy did not venture to ask a question  then master fernald went out from the hallway in what he evidently believed was the most approved detective fashion of walking and as plums confidentially told joe later he acted like he was a jumpinjack with some one pullin the string mighty hard  the two went slowly up the street one on either side and such of the citizens of weehawken who saw them were mystified by their singular method of proceeding  dan quieted down somewhat after half an hour had passed for no slight amount of labour was required to continue the supposed detective manner of walking and before arriving at the house where joe had taken refuge he behaved very nearly like other and more sensible boys  no i wont go in he said decidedly when plums proposed that he call upon the old lady you dont catch me showin myself round this place any moren i can help cause theres no tellin when the perlice will be here askin questions an im goin to steer clear of trouble  shall i tell joe to come out plums asked timidly for dans superior wisdom awed him  of course else how can i see him dont let that kid tag on behind for its mighty dangerous to be on the street with her that advertisement about you had in it that you was last seen with a little girl  master plummer entered the dwelling and dan paced to and fro on the sidewalk with a consequential air until joe appeared  why dont you come in the latter asked mrs weberthats the name of the lady who owns the houseis mighty nice even if you cant talk to her  i aint so foolish as to show myself in such places an you oughter let your head be cut off before takin all these chances  but we couldnt keep the princess outofdoors from mornin till night an  thats whats makin all the trouble joe potter if you hadnt brought the kid along wed get through this scrape in good style  but i couldnt have left her in plumss shanty alone  it was a fool business pickin her up in the first place cause if you neverd done it them lawyers couldnt say you had a kid with you thats the very best way they have to let folks know who you are anyhow youve got to give her the dead shake now if you want me to keep hold of this case  then ill have to get along the best i can without you for i wont run away from a poor little baby who counts on my findin her folks  joe spoke so decidedly that the amateur detective understood he could not easily be turned from his purpose and master fernald was astonished he had supposed that his threat to drop the case would have reduced the unfortunate merchant to submission and it seemed little less than madness for joe and plums to continue the flight without the guiding hand of one so wise as himself  of course if you dont want me that settles it he said sulkily i aint throwin my time away when folks had rather i wasnt round but youll get into a heap of trouble without somebody what knows the ropes to steer you  i would like to have you with us dan but i wont leave that poor little princess when she needs me so much  but how you goin to fix it nights weve got to sleep outdoors mostly all the time an shed soon get wore up with that kind of knockin round  why must we sleep outdoors  dan explained that the search for the supposed criminal was to be prosecuted with such vigour that even master plummer was included in the advertisements which piece of news both alarmed and mystified joe  what are they after him for does anybody claim hes been goin crooked  i spose its cause he let you sleep in his shanty you see joe the lawyers are bound to nab you if the thing can be done an youve got to give up sleepin in houses it might work once or twice but youd be sure to run across somebody what had read the papers an then youd find yourself an the princess in jail mighty quick the evenin papers said a large reward would be paid an perhaps by mornin theyll raise the price to as much as ten dollars  it can well be understood how disturbed in mind joe was at learning that his enemies were so eager to capture him but yet he had no intention of abandoning the princess until plums made a suggestion which seemed like an exceedingly happy one  why not pay old mis weber somethin to take care of her for two or three days he asked the little thing would get along a good deal better with a woman an we can sneak back here once in awhile to make certain shes all right i dont believe them lawyers will spend very much more money huntin for us cause we aint worth it no matter what weve done  thats the very best snap you could fix up dan cried approvingly id been thinkin of somethin like that myself but didnt have time to tell you about it ive got moren two dollars that i borrowed to help you fellers through with this scrape an that oughter be a good deal moren enough to keep her till we can earn more  joe understood that it would be to the princesss advantage if he left her with the kind old german lady and at once decided in favour of the plan  never for a moment did he fancy they might be as safe in this house as anywhere else but firmly believed a continuation of the flight was absolutely necessary as dan had announced  ill see what mis weber says about it an if shes willin well go right away  dont stay in there all night chinnin cause its mighty dangerous for us to be hangin round here dan called after him as he entered the dwelling and joe hastened the matter as much as possible  the princess was in bed sleeping quietly and looking as plums expressed it fit to eat mrs webers grandson was ready to act as interpreter and in a few moments joe had made the proposition  the good woman asked no questions concerning the parents of the child it was proposed she should keep and her silence on this point may have been due to the fact that even with her grandsons aid it was difficult to understand all the boys said  she was willing to take the princess for a week but not longer and decided that one dollar would repay her for the labour  tell your grandmother well make the trade joe said quickly delighted because the sum named was so much less than he expected ill be back here in two days at the longest an shes to take the very best care of the little thing  granny would be kind even to a mouse master weber replied with an air of pride and joe added promptly  i oughter know as much by this time an if i didnt the princess wouldnt be left with her that poor little swell hasnt got anybody to look out for her but me till we find her folks an i aint takin chances of her comin to harm heres the dollar an you tell your granny ill be back by the day after tomorrer if all the cops in new york are close after me  the little german boy looked up in perplexity for he failed to understand the greater portion of what joe had said and the latter was in too great a hurry to heed the fact  a shrill whistle from the outside told that detective dan was growing impatient and joe started towards the door after seeing the old lady take the money but halted an instant later  is there something more you want granny to do the german boy asked and joe was at a loss for a reply  i was thinkin perhapsif course it wouldnt make any difference to your grannysay im goin to sneak in an kiss the princess  the boy nodded carelessly but joe made no effort to carry his threat into execution  again the amateur detective whistled and master potter stepped towards the bedroom door but halted before gaining it  perhaps her folks wouldnt want a duffer like me doin anything of that kind he muttered and straightway walked out of the house as rapidly as his legs would carry him much as if he feared to remain longer lest the temptation should be too great to resist  it begun to look as if you was goin to stay all night dan said petulantly when joe appeared theres moren a hundred people walked past here an ill bet some of em was huntin for us weve got to get out of this place mighty lively if you dont want to be chucked into jail  plums looked so thoroughly terrified that joe at once understood the amateur detective had been frightening him by picturing improbable dangers and said almost sharply  theres no use makin this thing any worse than it really is  that cant be done joe potter youre in an awful scrape an dont seem to know it  i wish id stood right up like a man till id found the princesss folks an then gone to jail if the lawyers are so set on puttin me there  whats comin over you now  im thinkin of that poor little swell weve brought out here  shes a good deal better off than if you let her tag along behind  that may be but i oughter found her folks instead of runnin away  now see here joe potter youre makin a fool of yourself an all about a kid whats goin to have a soft snap while she stays here of course if you want to be put into jail for two or three years i wont say another word an you can rush right straight back to the city  dont stand here talkin plums cried in an agony of apprehension weve got to leave else nobody knows what may happen  dan seized joe by the arm literally forcing him onward and the two who were ignorant of having committed any crime continued the flight from the officers of the law     chapter vii  aunt dorcas   when the three had set out from mrs webers home the amateur detective announced that no halt would be made until sunrise  joe whose thoughts were with the princess gave little heed to this statement if indeed he understood it and master plummer had been so terrified by dans positive assertion regarding the possibility of an immediate arrest that he had failed to realise the labour which would be required in thus prolonging the flight  before an hour passed however even the detective himself began to think he might have made a rash statement and plums unaccustomed to such violent exercise was wellnigh exhausted  by this time joe had come to understand what might be the result if dans advice was followed implicitly and this together with the knowledge that each moment he was increasing the distance between himself and the princess served to make him reckless  look here dan fernald he said coming to a second halt lets talk over this thing before we go any further  perhaps you think we can afford to loaf round here the amateur detective said sternly if you fellers want to keep your noses out of jail youd best hump yourselves till daylight an even then we wont be far enough away  were jest as far now as im goin and there was that in joes voice which told his companion that he would not be persuaded into changing his mind  what dan screamed  thats all there is to it ill stop here an you fellers can keep on if you like  but joe if there was woods somewhere near i wouldnt say a word how can you hide where theres so many houses close round  i dont count on hidin cause i cant afford it even if them lawyers get hold of me tomorrer mornin im goin to stop here  right here in the road plums asked with less anxiety than he would have shown an hour before when he was not so tired  well i dont mean to say ill camp down in the road but you fellers listen to me if the detectives are out after us an i spose of course they are we shant be any safer twenty miles away than in this very spot weve got to stop sometime an it may as well be now i promised to go back to see the princess in two days an ill keep my word  but wherell you stay all that time dan asked as if believing this was a question which could not be satisfactorily answered  i dont know yet but im thinkin of goin up to that house and joe pointed to a tiny cottage which in the gloom could be but dimly seen amid a clump of trees theres a light in the window so of course the folks are awake ill ask em if they havent got work enough about the place sich as i could do to pay my board over one day an if they say no ill try at the next house  you might as well go right into jail as do a thing like that dan said angrily  i aint so sure but it would have been a good deal better if i had for by this time the princess would be with her folks where she belongs  it seems to me youre terribly stuck on that kid  well what if i am and joe spoke so sharply that master fernald did not think it wise to make any reply  during fully a moment the three stood silently in the road looking at each other and then joe asked of master plummer  will you come with me  the possibility of resting his tired limbs in a regular bed appealed strongly to the fat boy and understanding that he was about to agree to joes proposition dan said gloomily  this is what a feller gets for tryin to help you two out of a scrape ive kept the detectives away so far an now youre goin to give me the dead shake  theres no reason why you couldnt stay with us  you wont catch me in a house for another month anyhow  illustration joe pointed to a tiny cottage  the argument which followed this announcement was not long but spirited  joe explained that it was his intention to remain in that vicinity and within fortyeight hours to return to weehawken according to the promise he had made mrs weber  dan continued to insist that it was in the highest degree dangerous to loiter there and professed to believe himself deeply injured because after having taken up the case in such an energetic fashion he was probably in danger of arrest through having aided these two supposed criminals  master plummer had but little to say the thought of walking all night was nearly as painful as that of being imprisoned and he was willing to throw all the responsibility of a decision upon his friend  before ten minutes had passed the matter was settlednot satisfactorily to all concerned but as nearly so as could have been expected  joe and plums were to call at the cottage with the hope of finding temporary employment and the amateur detective was to conceal himself in the vicinity as best he might until he should be able to learn something definite regarding the purpose of the lawyers who had advertised  when joe followed by master plummer turned from the highway into the lane which led to the cottage the amateur detective scrambled over the fence on the opposite side of the road and scurried through the field as if believing he was hotly pursued  not until they had arrived nearly at the house did master plummer make any remark and then he said with a longdrawn sigh  dan fernald makes too much work out of his detective business to suit me i couldnt walk all night if it was to save me life  i dont believe theres any reason why we should plums because dan thinks the cops have followed us over to weehawken doesnt make it so an if we cant hide here we cant anywhere cordin to my way of thinkin besides it wouldnt be fair to go off so far that we cant get back to the princess  then joe advanced to the side door and knocked gently plums whispering hoarsely meanwhile  be ready to skip if you hear a dog ive been told that folks out this way keep reglar bloodhounds to scare away tramps  i aint fraid of dogs as much as i am that the man who lives here will run us off the place the first minute he sees our faces joe replied and at that instant the door was opened  holding a lamp high above her head and peering out into the gloom as if suffering from some defect of vision stood a little woman not very much taller than joe whose wrinkled face told she had passed what is termed the middle age of life  joes surprise at seeing this tiny lady when he had expected to be confronted by a man prevented him from speaking at once and the small woman asked with mild curiosity  whose children are you  this was a question joe was not prepared to answer and he stammered and stuttered before being able to say  i dont know as were anybodys maam you see we aint got any place to stop in for a day or two an thought perhaps a farmer lived here what would have work we could do to pay for our board  are you hungry child the small woman asked quickly and as it seemed to joe anxiously  not very much now cause weve had a good supper but we will be in the mornin you know  and master plummer interrupted as he pinched his companions arm to reduce him to silence  weve been walkin a good while since then an it seems like i was most starved  you poor child come right into the house an itll be strange if i cant find something to eat though to tell the truth i didnt have real good luck with this weeks batch of bread but if custard pie  if custard pie master plummer cried ecstatically why id be fixed great if i could have some  he was following the small woman as he spoke and after closing and barring the outer door the hostess ushered them into such a kitchen as they had never seen before  a spacious room in which it seemed as if a hundred persons might have found ample elbowroom with a yellow painted floor on which not a grain of dirt could be seen and with numerous odd stifflooking chairs ranged around the sides at regular intervals at one end an enormous fireplace in front of which was a cookstove actually glittering with polish and on the mantel behind it an array of shining tins  as seen from the road in the gloom the cottage had not appeared even as large as this kitchen and because of such fact the boys were more surprised than they otherwise would have been  once in the room where everything was so cleanly that as master plummer afterwards expressed it it come near givin him a pain the boys stood awkwardly near the door uncertain as to what might be expected of them  you can sit right here while i get you something to eat and the hostess placed two chairs in front of a small table in one corner of the room  master plummer advanced eagerly thinking only of the pleasure which was about to be his when the small lady exclaimed as if in alarm  mercy on us child youre tracking dust all over the floor go right back into the entry and wipe your feet  plums failed to see that he had soiled the floor to any extent but both he and joe obeyed the command instantly and while they were engaged in what seemed to them useless labour the small woman wiped carefully with a damp cloth the dusty imprints of their shoes from the floor  i never had any experience in my own family with boys the oddlooking little woman said half to herself and perhaps thats why i dont understand em any better but i never could make out why they should be so reckless with dirt  i didnt think my shoes were so dusty when i come in else id taken them off joe said apologetically you see maam we never saw a floor as clean as this one  this compliment was evidently pleasing for the small woman looked up kindly at her guests and said in a friendly tone  dont call me maam child ive been aunt dorcas to all the children in this neighbourhood ever since i can remember and anything else doesnt sound natural  do you want us to call you aunt dorcas joe asked in surprise and plums winked gravely at his companion  of course i do now if your feet are clean sit down and ill get the pie  the boys tiptoed their way to the table as if by such method they would be less liable to soil the floor and aunt dorcas taking the lamp with her disappeared through a door which evidently led to the cellar leaving them in the darkness  say aint this the greatest snap you ever struck plums whispered ill bet aunt dorcas is a dandy an if dan fernald knew what hes missin hed jest about kick hisself black an blue  master plummer was still better satisfied with the situation when their hostess returned with a large custard pie which she placed on the table and immediately afterwards disappeared within the cellarway again  shes gone for more stuff plums said in a tone of delight if there aint too much work to be done round this place id like to stay here a year  illustration she had a plate heaped high with cookies  when aunt dorcas entered the kitchen again she had a plate heaped high with cookies on the top of which were three generous slices of cheese  this collection was placed by the side of the pie the odd little woman brought plates knives and forks and two napkins from the pantry and having arranged everything in proper order said as she stood facing the boys with her head slightly inclined to one side until to joe she presented much the appearance of a sparrow  if you can eat all there is here ill bring more an willingly afterwards we will talk about what is to be done for the night  i can eat an talk too jest as well as not plums said as he drew the pie towards him  perhaps aunt dorcas thought he intended to appropriate the whole to himself for she hurriedly cut it into four pieces one of which she placed on his plate  from plumss manner of beginning the feast there was good reason to believe he had told the truth when he said he was starving and as she watched him an expression of deepest sympathy came over aunt dorcass face  its too bad i havent some meat to give you child for you must be famishing  id rather have this plums replied speaking with difficulty because of the fullness of his mouth and it appeared to his hostess as if he had no sooner begun on a quarter of the pie than it disappeared  she gave the fat boy another section of the yellow dainty watching him like one fascinated as he devoured it then plums began an onslaught on the cookies after casting a wistful glance at the remaining quarter of the pie  joe was ashamed because his companion ate so greedily and kicked him under the table as a warning that he restrain his appetite but master plummer failed to understand the signal and ate all the more greedily because he believed joe thought it time to bring the feast to a close  you mustnt think anything of his stuffin hisself like this maami mean aunt dorcas joe said apologetically plums always was the biggest eater in new york an i guess he always will be  what did you call him aunt dorcas asked  plums was what i said that aint exactly his name but it comes mighty near to it george h plummer is what he calls hisself when he wants to be swell  i think george sounds much better than plums aunt dorcas said thoughtfully  perhaps it does but it dont fit him half so well  meanwhile the subject of this conversation was industriously engaged devouring the cookies and one would have said that he had no interest in anything else  aunt dorcas stood looking questioningly at joe and thinking he understood that which was in her mind he said  my name is joe potter i used to keep a fruitstand down on west street in new york till i busted up an then i found the princess but  joe checked himself in time to preserve his secret an instant later he wished he had explained to aunt dorcas why he was there because of the sympathy he read in her face  the little woman waited a few seconds for him to continue but since he remained silent she asked with mild curiosity  who is the princess  shes a swell little girl whats lost her folks an im takin care of her for a spell say maami mean aunt dorcasis there any work plums an i can do to pay for a chance of stoppin here over tomorrow  i suppose i might find enough joseph for theres always plenty to be done around a place no matter how small it is but im not certain youd be strong enough to spade up the garden and clear the drain even if you knew how they say city boys are dreadful unhandy when it comes to outdoor work  jest you try us an see joe cried with animation we aint sich chumps but that we know how to do most anything after weve studied over it a spell will you let us stay if we do work enough  i surely ought to be willing to do that much for my fellow creatures joseph even though i get nothing in return but i cant say it wont be a trial for me to have two boys around the house after ive lived alone so long martha mary and i took care of this place with the help of a man in summer a good many years after our parents died and i suppose we got fussy and oldmaidishlike in our ways aunt dorcas said growing reminiscent martha went home to heaven seven years ago in september and mary followed her the next january since then ive been alone and it stands to reason im more oldmaidish than ever but i hope i could keep two homeless boys twentyfour hours without fretting  then aunt dorcas crossed the room to the mantel in order to light another lamp and plums whispered hoarsely  say joe what do you spose she put this clean towel here for ive got custard on it an im afraid thatll make her mad  joe unfolded his napkin inquisitively and looked at it an instant before he understood for what purpose it must have been intended  then his cheeks reddening he replied in a low tone  she must have counted on our bein willin to wash our faces but didnt want to say so right out so put the towels here to remind us an im as ashamed as i can be cause i didnt think of it before  the meal had come to an end for the very good reason that there was nothing more on the table to be eaten  while aunt dorcas was talking with joe plums had slyly taken the last remaining section of pie having previously devoured the cookies and cheese and with a longdrawn sigh of content he replied to his friends remark by saying  i guess i couldnt eat any more if id washed my face a dozen times so it dont make much difference  joe arose from the table and seated himself in one of the chairs which were ranged precisely against the wall master plummer following his example  aunt dorcas having lighted the second lamp said  ill leave you boys here alone while i attend to making up a bed you could sleep in the spareroom i suppose but my best sheets are there and i dont just like towhy you didnt use the napkins  joes face was of a deep crimson hue as he replied  if id seen any soap an water id known what they meant but its been so long since i was in a reglar house that ive kinder forgot how to behave  aunt dorcas turned away quickly and when she had left the room plums said as he unbent from the awkward position he had at first assumed in the straight chair  dan fernald aint in this he may be a mighty big detective but he slips up when it comes to hustlin for these kind of snaps  aunt dorcas is nice aint she  shes a corker  if the princess was only here wed be jest about as snug as any two fellers that could be found in this world  im going to give you the chamber over the kitchen it is clean and comfortable but of course not as nice as the spareroom aunt dorcas said as she entered suddenly causing master plummer to instantly assume a less negligent attitude  plums an me aint slept in a reglar bed for so long that a blanket spread out on the floor would seem mighty good to us joe replied and the little woman held up both hands in astonishment  havent slept in a bed well ive heard of the heathen in our midst but never believed id be brought in contact with them how did youbut there i wont ask questions tonight when i know you must be tired well read a chapter and then you can go to bed i will wash the dishes afterwards  reverentially the little woman took a wellworn bible from the small table beneath one of the windows and while the two boys who were fleeing from the officers of the law as they believed gazed at her in wonderment and surprise but not understanding that which they heard she read one of the psalms  then kneeling she prayed in simple language which reached their hearts for the homeless ones within her gates  joes eyes were moist when she rose to her feet and plums whispered in a voice choked with emotion  shes a daisy thats whats the matter with her     chapter viii  a hungry detective   when aunt dorcas had ushered the boys into the room over the kitchen and left them with a kindly good night they gazed around in such astonishment as can best be depicted by master plummers emphatic remark shortly after the little woman went downstairs  ive always thought swells had a pretty soft snap when they went to bed but i never counted on its bein anything like this do you spose she means for us to get right into that bed an muss it all up  joe did not reply for several seconds and then said doubtfully  it seems as if thats what she must have meant else why did she tell about her best sheets bein in the other room i thought the old german womans house was mighty nice but it wasnt a marker longside of this if the princess was only here  you can bet i dont bother my head bout no princesses when ive got a chance to crawl into that nest i almost wish now id had sense enough to use one of them towels we had on the table cause my hands look pretty dirty when you get em side of that sheet  well see this plums if youll believe it heres a pitcher full of water an soap an everything lets wash up now will you  ordinarily master plummer would have met this suggestion with a decided refusal but being surrounded as he was by so much luxury it seemed necessary he should do something in the way of celebrating  it was not a very careful toilet which plums made on this night for he was in too great a hurry to get between the lavenderscented sheets to admit of spending much time on such needless work as washing his hands and face but he was more cleanly and perhaps felt in a better condition to enjoy the unusual luxury  say joe its a mighty big pity weve got to go to sleep  why  cause we oughter keep awake jest to know how much swellin were doin i stopped at a chatham street lodginhouse one night when i was feelin kind of rich an thought the bed there was great but it wasnt a marker longside of this one i shouldnt wonder if there were feathers in it  joe was quite as well pleased with the surroundings as was his companion but he said less on the subject because his mind was fully occupied with thoughts of the princesssad thoughts they were for he was beginning to believe he had been wickedly selfish in taking her away from the place where her parents might have been found simply to save himself from arrest  he fell asleep however quite as soon as did the boy on whose conscience there was no burden and neither of the fugitives were conscious of anything more until aroused by a gentle tapping on the chamber door to hear aunt dorcas say  its five oclock children and time all honest people were out of bed  were gettin up now joe cried and he was on his feet in an instant but master plummer lazily turned himself in the restinviting bed as he muttered  i dont see how it makes a feller honest to get up in the night when hes out in the country where he hasnt got to go for the mornin papers an i guess ill stay here a spell longer  you wont do anything of the kind and joe pulled the fat boy out of bed so quickly that he had no time for resistance  it was seldom plums lost his temper but now he was on the verge of doing so because of having been thus forcibly taken from the most comfortable restingplace he had ever known  now dont get on your ear joe said soothingly aunt dorcas has told us to get up an that settles it were bound to do jest as she says cause all these things are hers it wont pay to turn rusty plums else we may find ourselves fired out before breakfast an i would like to stay till tomorrow  dont you want to stop any longer than that and master plummer began hurriedly to dress himself  course id like to but you see ive got to go back to the old german ladys in the mornin  what good will that do it aint likely you can bring the princess here  i know that as well as you do but i promised to be there in two days an im goin so we wont have any talk about it  five minutes later aunt dorcass guests were in the kitchen where the little woman was preparing a most appetising breakfast and he would have been a dull boy who did not understand that she must have been up at least two hours before arousing her visitors  it aint right for you to wait on us jest like we was reglar folks an we aint used to it joe said in a tone of mild reproof anything would have been good enough for us to eat without your gettin up so early an workin hard to cook it  bless your heart joseph im doing no more than if i was alone except perhaps there may be more victuals on the table my appetite isnt as hearty as it used to be but ive got a pretty good idea how it is with growing boys  youre mighty good to us aunt dorcas an ill feel a heap better if youll give me some work to do before breakfast  i might have let you bring in the wood if id thought but im so accustomed to doing such things for myself that it never came into my mind i wonder if you could split up a few kindlings that is the most trying part of keeping house alone for whenever i strike a piece of wood with an axe i never know whether its going to break or fly up and hit me in the face  of course we can do it wheres the axe  aunt dorcas led the way to the shed where was her summers store of wood and before she returned to the kitchen joe was causing the chips to fly in a way which made the little womans heart glad  it does me good to see you work joseph i have always lived in mortal terror of an axe but you seem to know how to use one  joe earned his breakfast that morning fairly and plums appeared to think he had done his full share by sitting on the sawhorse watching his comrade  then came the summons to breakfast and master plummer was eyeing greedily a particularly large roasted potato which he intended to take from the plate if an opportunity presented itself when aunt dorcas suddenly bent her head and invoked a blessing on the food  plums kicked joe under the table to express his surprise at this to him singular proceeding but otherwise behaved in a proper manner  the meal was prolonged because of the fat boys hearty appetite and when it was finally brought to a close joe said as he rose from the table  now aunt dorcas if youll show us something more to do ill be glad cause weve got to pay for what weve had else it wont be a fair shake  you boys may go out and look around the place until i do the dishes and then we will see what i am to set you about  this was so nearly a request for them to leave the kitchen that they lost no time in obeying and when they were in the open air master plummer said with an air of perplexity  shes a mighty fine woman an all that kind of thing but id like to know what shes hintin at by leavin them towels on the table they was both there jest the sames last night even though she must have known that we was washed up in great shape  i noticed em but dont believe theres anything out of the way about it shes kind of funny an perhaps thats one of her queer spots  aunt dorcass property was not extensive as the boys learned after walking over it  there was an orchard either side of the lane which led from the highway and in the rear of the house an acre of ground which had been cultivated at some time in the past  the buildings consisted of the cottage itself the woodshed a second shed which might once have been used as a carriagehouse and a small barn or stable  by the time they had concluded their investigations aunt dorcas joined them and said with an odd smile on her withered face  it isnt much of a farm as farms go nowadays boys but its my home and very dear to me mr mcarthur one of the neighbours cuts the grass in the orchards and pays me a little something for it i usually have a garden out here but this year it was neglected until now it seems too late for early vegetables  it wouldnt take us long to chuck in a pile of seeds if thats all you want and one to have seen master plummer at that moment would have believed him the most energetic of boys  after aunt dorcas explained that it would be necessary to spade up the ground plumss enthusiasm for gardening diminished but joe begged for the privilege of showing what he could do and the little woman supplied them with such tools as she thought necessary  if you want to know about anything come right up to the house it is bakingday with me and i shall be busy in the kitchen until dinnertime  then she left them and plums seated himself within the shadow of the barn explaining as he did so that perhaps it would be better if he kinder got the hang of the thing by seein joe work  eager to repay aunt dorcas for her kindness joe potter laboured industriously despite the blisters which soon appeared on his hands for half an hour or more and then the two boys were startled by a warning hiss which apparently came from one end of the barn  there must be snakes round here and plums sprang to his feet in alarm jim flannigan says they always hiss like that before they bite  take hold of this spade for a little while an they wont bite you it seems to me im doin all the work an i know you ate moren your share of the supper an breakfast  the hissing noise was heard again and as the two gazed in the direction from which it came the head of dan the detective appeared from behind the barn  what are you doin there tryin to frighten us plums asked indignantly why didnt you come right up like a man theres nobody round here but aunt dorcas an she wouldnt hurt a fly  the amateur detective rose slowly to his feet looking displeased  you two are the most careless fellers i ever saw heres all the cops in new york city out on your trail an you hollerin fit to scare a horse  sposin we are and master plummer spoke boldly sposin the road was full of perlicemen how could they see us while were behind this barn  it dont make any difference whether they could or not youve got to mind your eye if you want to keep out of jail an yellin to me aint the way to do it if the folks round here should know i was on this case jest as likely as not some of em would send word to the city an then your game would be up  plums had lost faith in dans detective ability because of the fact that the latter had failed to take advantage of the opportunity to spend the night in aunt dorcass home therefore he replied boldly to his friends reproof  were jest as safe here as we could be anywhere an i tell you what it is dan you oughter seen the layout we had last night an this mornin why we slept in a bed that would make the tears come into your eyes it was so soft an talk bout spreads you couldnt get a breakfast down to mcginniss restaurant no matter how much you paid that would come up to what we had  yes you fellers are takin all the chances an im pretty nigh starved to death i havent had so much as a smell of anything since yesterday noon  you oughter seen the custard pie aunt dorcas put out before us last night thick as that and plums measured on his finger the length of three inches or more an a crust that went to pieces in your mouth like icecream  if i had a cold boiled potato id be mighty glad  we had a slat of hot roasted ones with nice butter on em this mornin plums continued as if it were his purpose to increase the detectives hunger  id give a dime for a sandwich dan wailed and master plummer described the fresh bread and sweet boiled ham with which aunt dorcas had regaled them  say whats the use of tellin bout what youve had when ive been fillin up on wind it only makes a feller feel worse why cant you sneak in an get something for me  plums hesitated as if willing to act upon his friends suggestion when joe said sharply  look here dan im awful sorry if youre hungry but plums cant sneak into aunt dorcass house an get anything without her knowin it not while im round it seems kinder tough to ask her to put out more stuff after all weve had but since youre starvin well do it an offer to pay for what you eat  you mean to tell her im here  of course i wouldnt lie to her not for any money  then ill have to starve dan replied angrily for i wouldnt let anybody know i was here while im tryin to keep you fellers out of jail but  here comes aunt dorcas now plums exclaimed as he turned towards the house and in a twinkling the amateur detective was screened from view by the barn  i thought you boys might be hungry working so hard and i brought out this plate of fresh doughnuts the little woman said as she placed on the grass a dish covered with a napkin mr mcarthur always likes a bite of something when he is here and it will do you good how well you have gotten along i wouldnt have thought you could have spaded up so much in such a short time  joe feeling guilty because he was keeping from aunt dorcas the fact that detective dan was on the premises was at a loss for a reply but plums said promptly  well be glad of em aunt dorcas cause were kinder tired jest now and he would have begun to devour the doughnuts but for a warning look from his comrade  you must eat them while they are hot aunt dorcas said gravely and joe promised to do so as soon as he had finished a certain amount of work  then the little woman went back to her cooking and she had hardly entered the dwelling before the amateur detective with a hungry look in his eyes came out hurriedly from his hidingplace  now youve got somethin to eat without our lyin about it so pitch in before aunt dorcas comes back  dan did not need a second invitation and an expression of deepest regret came over plumss face as he watched the cakes disappear with amazing rapidity  i guess i can stand it now till night the detective said in a tone of relief as the meal was brought to a close because all the food had been eaten  are you countin on stayin round here joe asked  of course i am how else would you fellers get out of the scrape if i didnt  now look here dan theres no sense in anything like that you aint doin any good sneakin round this house cause if the cops should come how could you prevent their luggin us off  theres a good many ways that i might pull you through master fernald replied with an air of mystery if you knew as much about this business as i do youd be mighty glad to have me stay specially when it aint costin you a cent  but i dont like to think of your bein hungry when it wont do the least little bit of good take my advice an go right back to the city  if i should do that it wouldnt be two hours before youd be in jail  we shant go there any sooner if you leave us an it aint jest square to aunt dorcas  you cant give me points on detective business joe potter an ive told the fellers in town that ill look out for you thats what ill do whether you like it or not and after assuring himself by stalking to and fro and gazing in every direction that there were no enemies in the immediate vicinity the amateur detective disappeared around the corner of the barn  its too bad for dan to act the way hes doin joe said with a longdrawn sigh im fraid if aunt dorcas gets a sight of him well have to clear out  i dont spose it would do any good to ask her to let him bunk in with us would it plums said hesitatingly  it would need big nerve an even if she was willin hed scare the hair off her head talkin bout lawyers an detectives hoverin round  then joe continued his interrupted work and plums assisted him by looking on until the task was completed after which it became necessary to ask for further instructions  although aunt dorcas could not perform the labour herself she knew how gardening should be done and under her directions given during such moments as she could safely leave the kitchen the ground was prepared in a proper manner by the time dinner had been made ready     chapter ix  a fugitive   plums enjoyed his dinner quite as much as if he had performed his full share of the gardening and when the meal was concluded there came into his mind the thought that aunt dorcas milfords home was a most pleasant abidingplace  even though he was so to speak in temporary exile he was exceedingly well content save for the disagreeable fact that joe had stated positively he should go back to weehawken on the following day  it seemed as if the thoughts of both the guests were running in the same channel for joe after gazing a moment at aunt dorcass placid face gave vent to a sigh of regret and then looked out of the window abstractedly  i spose wed better get that garden planted this afternoon if youve got the seeds aunt dorcas an even then we shant be payin for what weve had joe said after a long pause while the three yet remained at the table  perhaps it will be as well to wait until tomorrow and give the newly turned earth a chance to get warm the little woman said  it seems as though we ought to do it today if it would be jest as well for the garden cause we dont count on your keepin us for ever an after we leave here tomorrow it wouldnt be right to come back  i did think boys would be a dreadful nuisance around the house aunt dorcas began as if speaking to herself but somehow ive felt real contentedlike while youve been here and its a deal more cheerful with three at the table than to sit down alone  its the first time i was ever in a house like this joe added in a low tone its awful nice an fellers what have a reglar home must be mighty happy  where did you live in the city aunt dorcas asked after a pause  i knocked round mostly twice ive bunked with some other feller in a room what we hiredof course it wasnt anything like the one upstairs but payin so high for a bed was a little too rich for my blood  but you had to sleep somewhere aunt dorcas suggested her eyes opening wider as she gained an insight into a phase of life which was novel to her  the interest she displayed invited joes confidence and he told her of the life led by himself and his particular friends in a manner which interested the little woman deeply  it was not a story related for the purpose of exciting sympathy but a plain recital of facts around which was woven no romance to soften the hardships and there were tears in aunt dorcass faded eyes when the boy concluded  it seems wicked for me to be living alone in this house when there are human beings close at hand who havent a roof to shelter them the little woman said softly why dont boys like you go out to the country to work instead of staying in the city where you can hardly keep soul and body together  we couldnt do even that if we turned farmers master plummer replied quickly nobodyd hire us  why not  i know of a feller what tried to get a job on a farm an he hung round the markets askin every man he met but all of em told him city boys was no goodthat it would take too long to break em in  but whats to prevent your getting a chance to work in a store where you could earn enough to pay your board  i had a notion last year that id try that kind of work plums said slowly an looked about a good bit for a job but the fellers what have got homes an good clothes pick up them snaps as i soon found out it seems like when you get into the business of sellin papers or shinin you cant do anything else  selling papers or what aunt dorcas asked with a perplexed expression on her face  shinin thats blackin boots you know heres joe he scraped together seven dollars an eightythree cents an said to hisself that hed be a howlin swell so what does he do but start a fruitstand down on west street hire a clerk an go into the business in style it didnt take him moren two months to bust up an now he aint got enough even to start in on sellin papers cause he spent it all on the princess  who is the princess aunt dorcas asked with animation  shes a kid what he picked up on the street  oh and the little woman looked relieved i thought last night when he spoke of the princess that it was a child he meant  why didnt i tell you it was  you said she was a kid  so she is an aint that a child or the next thing to ita girl  joseph what does he mean who is the princess  shes a little girl aunt dorcas whos lost her folks an i found her in the street she hadnt anywhere to go so i had to take care of her cause a bit of a thing like her couldnt stay outdoors all night sames a boy  and even though having just failed in business you took upon yourself the care of a child  i couldnt do anything else aunt dorcas there she was an somebody had to do it  youre a dear good boy and leaning across the table aunt dorcas patted one of joes hands almost affectionately where is the little creature now  we hired an old german woman down in weehawken to take care of her for a week an paid a dollar you see the fellers lent us some cash when we came away  but what made you leave joseph if you were convinced it would be impossible to earn any money in the country  you see we had to when  joe ceased speaking very suddenly he could not bring himself to explain to aunt dorcas exactly why they had left new york fearing lest she would not believe him when he declared he was innocent of having committed any crime and it seemed to him it would be worse than any ordinary lie to tell this kindly little woman that which was not strictly true  he hesitated made several vain attempts at an explanation and finally said his cheeks reddening with shame  id rather not tell you about that part of it aunt dorcas but i didnt do anything that wasnt jest straight though all of em believe i did  the little woman thought she understood something of the situation and once more caressing joes hand said kindly  i dont believe a boy who would try to help a child when he was in want himself could do anything very wicked joseph sit right here while i do the dishes for that will give me a chance to think  then aunt dorcas set about her household duties while the boys remained at the table plums sitting in such a position that he could gaze through the window which overlooked the lane  after five minutes or more had passed during which time the silence had been broken only by the rattling of dishes aunt dorcas asked abruptly  if you paid the childs board for a week why do you feel that you must go there tomorrow  because i promised mis weber id come an besides i want to make certain the princess is all right  aunt dorcas gave her undivided attention to the dishes once more and joe was looking straight before him but without seeing anything for his thoughts were of the advertisements which had made him a wanderer when he became aware of the singular gestures in which master plummer was indulging  it was some time before joe understood that his comrade wanted him to look out of the window and when he did realise this fact sufficiently to do as plums wished he saw that which disturbed him not a little  dan was making his way up the lane from the road in the same ridiculous fashion which he appeared to think necessary a detective should employ and joe was positive aunt dorcas would be seriously alarmed if she saw master fernald indulging in such antics  go out plums an make that bloomin idjut keep away he whispered to his comrade i wont have him dancin round here in that style an if he does very much more of it ill tell aunt dorcas the whole story id rather be arrested ten times over than have her scared most to death  it was evident this was not a mission which pleased master plummer for he feared to incur the anger of one who professed to be so powerful and he asked tremulously  sposin he says the same thing he did this forenoon  tell him to go back to the city or ill make it my business to send a reglar detective here to fix things up  if he gets mad joe theres no knowin what he might do  he shant stay round here an that settles it tell him i said so an i mean it  plums stole softly out of the kitchen but aunt dorcas was so intent on her thoughts that he might have made very much noise without attracting her attention  looking through the window joe could see plums as he performed his mission and judging from the gestures in which the amateur detective indulged it was quite evident he was displeased at receiving such a command  after conversing together a short time the two climbed over the fence and disappeared in the orchard going as joe believed towards the barn  the threat had failed of immediate effect and there came into joes mind the thought that it was necessary he go out to make it more emphatic when aunt dorcas having finished the work in hand seated herself by the boys side as if for a chat  where is george she asked and joe looked about him in astonishment not recognising the name for an instant then finally understanding to whom she referred he explained that plums had gone out for a few moments and proposed to summon him  there is no need of that for it is with you i want to talk ive been thinking about that little child joseph and wondering what you could do with her you said the german woman had promised to keep her only a week  yes aunt dorcas and i was in hopes by that time i could go back to new york  what will you do tomorrow after you have seen her  jest hang round i spose ive got to go cause i promised an then agin it aint right to leave the princess alone so long i dont know but what shes frettin  how old is she joseph  not moren six or seven years but she cant talk  then she must be much younger than you think  well perhaps she aint moren a year old i dont know much about kids anyhow  it seems as if my duty was plain in this case aunt dorcas said solemnly the little property ive got is enough to take care of me with economy but surely a child wouldnt be very much expense an if youd do what you could towards helpin i believe id say that she might be brought here its a great responsibility but if a woman like me turns a deaf ear to such a story as you have told it is almost a crime theres that poor child without father or mother or home and i have no right to fold my hands in idleness  joe was about to explain that he hoped soon to find the princesss parents for aunt dorcass words sounded much as if she believed the child to be an orphan but before he could speak the little woman said emphatically  you shall bring her here joseph and i rely upon you to help me take care of her  of course ill promise that aunt dorcas an ill do my best to find a job somewhere near here so i can come over evenings  but im depending on your staying here joseph  do you mean for me to live in this house till i can go back to new york and joe looked bewildered  certainly i shouldnt think of trying to take care of a child and do my housework at the same time even though there isnt a great deal to be done you see im not accustomed to children an wouldnt be as handy as some other people  but aunt dorcas you cant afford to have two big chumps like plums an me livin on you  well do all that lies in our power if you and george are industrious you can do considerable gardening and the vegetables you raise will go a long ways towards our living  youre awful good aunt dorcasyoure the best woman i ever saw an i wouldnt think of hangin round here if i couldnt do somethin moren run that little bit of a garden things will get straightened out after a spell an then i can go back to town where im certain of earnin money  again joe was on the point of explaining that it was his duty to make search for the princesss parents at the earliest possible moment but aunt dorcas fancying she understood the entire matter thoroughly checked him by saying  we wont talk any more about it now joseph wait until the experiment has been tried and then we shall know better how to make our arrangements youre going to weehawken in the morning  thats what i counted on  but how can you get the child out here it is three or four miles joseph  id walk twice that far an carry the princess all the way for the sake of havin her where i am  aunt dorcas was not satisfied with this arrangement but she could think of nothing better just then and appeared determined there should be no further discussion on the subject  well go into the garden and finish the task there i dont suppose it is anything more than one of mr mcarthurs whims to let the upturned ground remain twentyfour hours before putting the seed in and even if it is necessary we cant afford to wait because there wont be much chance for such work after the baby is here  while she was speaking the little woman had been putting on her sunbonnet and joe was seriously alarmed  unquestionably detective dan was in the vicinity of the garden and not expecting aunt dorcas to come out neither he nor plums would be on the alert  joe knew that if dan was brought face to face with the little woman without an opportunity of escape he would boldly declare himself a detective and this would be sufficient to cause her anxiety if not alarm for she could hardly be expected to know that he was a detective only in his own mind  let me go out and find plums first he said hurriedly he oughter know what were talkin about so if we dont get through with the work tonight he can finish it while im gone  without waiting for her to reply lest she should insist on going with him joe ran outofdoors and as he had expected found dan fernald and plums behind the barn  what did you come up here for in the daytime when anybody might have seen you i thought it wasnt safe to be hangin round here  well it aint but you dont spose im goin to starve to death do you  starve didnt you have somethin to eat this forenoon  how long do you think i can stand it on four doughnuts here are you fellers livin high an im goin round jest about ready to die  well that aint our fault i dont want to have a row with you dan cause i spose you think youre helpin us out but i tell you you aint an carryin on in this way only makes matters worse why cant you go back to town an leave us alone  why cant i cause i promised the fellers id see you through an im goin to do it besides by this time folks know im on the case an would arrest me bout as quick as they would you  do you count on three of us livin on one poor little old woman like aunt dorcas aint you ashamed to hang round here when theres no need of it tryin to make us steal something for you to eat  theres no reason for your stealin ive been thinkin over what plums said bout that bed an the custard pie an i dont see why i shouldnt get my share you could tell her i am your pardner an in hard luck  now joe was positively alarmed if master fernald had made up his mind that he desired to become an inmate of aunt dorcass family he would most likely do everything in his power to bring about such a result and the happiness which had been joes because the little woman had decided to give the princess a temporary home suddenly vanished  rather than ask aunt dorcas to support three boys as well as a child he would go his way alone after telling her exactly the truth of the matter  ill loaf round here till long towards night an then ill start up to the house through the lane dan said believing joe did not dare oppose him thatll give you a chance to tell her what hard luck im in an lay it on as thick as you know how sos shell be willin to take me plum says this is about the softest snap he ever struck an i want my share of it  joe remained silent while one might have counted ten trying to restrain his anger and then he said quietly but firmly  aunt dorcas is too good a woman for us to beat in such a way as that an i promise dan fernald that if you show your head on the lane tonight or try to come into the house ill first tell her the whole thing an then go straight to the city i aint givin you any fairy story i mean every word theres no need of your starvin round here cause you can go back to town the folks there dont think youre sich an awful big detective that theyre goin to keep their eyes on you all the time ill bet there aint a single soul except some of our crowd that know youve ever talked with us bout this  dan looked at his friend in mute astonishment it seemed to him the height of ingratitude that joe potter should thus threaten when he had made so many sacrifices to aid him in escaping from the officers of the law  more than all this was he hurt by the insinuation that his detective ability was not of a high order and in a very short time his astonishment gave way to anger  you can put on as many airs as you want to joe potter an well see whether im a detective or not i went round among the fellers borrowin money didnt make any account of my own time an walked way out here jest to help you now im goin to do as much the other way an well see whatll happen between now an tomorrow night youll be in jail thats where youll be an plums with you  here comes aunt dorcas master plummer whispered hoarsely and instead of stalking away in a dignified fashion as he had intended the amateur detective ran hurriedly around the corner of the barn to screen himself from view of the little woman  were in an awful mess now plums whispered to joe its a good deal worse than it was before cause dan will do everything hes threatened an we can count on seein as many as a dozen perlicemen here before tomorrer night  joe did not dare reply for by this time aunt dorcas was so near that his words would have been overheard but he appeared quite as disturbed as did master plummer     chapter x  the journey   aunt dorcas was so intent on the plans for the future which had just been formed that she failed to observe the constraint which had been put upon the boys by her coming  there was in the little womans mind only speculations concerning the proposed addition to her family which she believed owing to the fact that joe had not had an opportunity of making the proper explanation would be permanent and in connection with this was the making of the garden  therefore it was she set about directing the young workmen in her customary manner determined that no more time should be spent on the task than was absolutely necessary  aunt dorcas had brought with her a small basket containing many tiny packages each neatly tied and labelled and she had her own opinion as to where the different kinds of seeds should be sown  george you make the hills for the potatoes while joseph and i plant the sweet corn  it was necessary for her to speak twice before master plummer realised she was addressing him so unfamiliar did the name sound and when he finally became aware of the fact he asked in a careless tone as if planting potatoes were work with which he was thoroughly conversant  how many hills do you want aunt dorcas an how big do they generally run out this way  put in four rows and there is no need of making them very large until after the plants are up  then aunt dorcas went with joe to the opposite side of the garden and intent on having the corn planted after a certain peculiar fashion of her own gave no heed to what plums was doing for ten minutes or more but when she did observe that young gentlemans method of working a cry of surprise and disapproval burst from her lips  whatever are you doing george  makin these hills of course plums replied quietly without ceasing his work of shovelling the soft earth up into huge mounds each of which was twelve or fifteen times as large as it should have been  well bless the boy he dont even know how to plant potatoes and the little woman regarded the results of master plummers labour in dismay werent you ever on a farm george  i never was so far in the country as this before in my life and plums wiped the perspiration from his flushed face for strange as it may seem he had during these few moments been working quite industriously  illustration well bless the boy he dont even know how to plant potatoes  you need a hoe instead of a shovel and the hills should be made something like these aunt dorcas said as she pointed to where joe thanks to her minute instructions was performing his part of the task in almost a workmanlike manner  plums would have grumbled when the little woman insisted on his demolishing the grotesque mounds which had cost him so much labour but that he remembered how dependent he was upon aunt dorcas for food and shelter and held his peace  the remainder of the work done on this afternoon was performed under aunt dorcass personal supervision for she soon came to understand that her assistants were absolutely ignorant of such tasks and if left to their own devices even for a few moments at a time would succeed only in making blunders  thanks to her patience and joes willingness however the garden was planted before sunset and master plummer did but a small share of the labour after his exploit in building miniature mountains for potatohills he became discouraged and aunt dorcas soon realised that the task would progress more rapidly if he acted the part of spectator instead of farmer  there is considerably more work to be done but we must put it off until morning for it is time to get supper now can you boys build a fire better than you can plant a garden  joe ran on ahead to show what he could do in that line and plums walked painfully by the side of aunt dorcas towards the house  whatever makes you limp so george the little woman asked solicitously and master plummer replied with a longdrawn sigh  i dont know less it is im all tired out you see i never did much farmin before an it kind er strains me  do you think youve been doing any now and aunt dorcas looked up at the fat boy with an odd twinkle in her eye  aint that what weve been doin  its what joseph and i have been about but you were lying down most of the time george can it be possible you are lazy  some of the fellers say i am but thats cause they dont know it tires me all out to move round very much  you look as if you never had any very active exercise but theres one thing we have to be thankful for there isnt an indolent bone in josephs body if i had seen any symptoms of it i dont believe i should have had the courage to make such a change in my way of living as we have decided upon  plums quickened his pace he understood both from her words and her manner of speaking that the little woman had no sympathy for tired people and the thought came into his mind that it was possible he might not long remain an inmate of the cottage unless he proved he could be of some service  when they entered the kitchen joe was building a fire in such a manner as met with aunt dorcass warmest approval and the glance she bestowed upon him told master plummer even more strongly than her words had done that he must exert himself if he wished to enjoy what he had believed was a soft snap  after supper on this evening aunt dorcas took up her knitting the boys seated themselves near the window where they could see dan the detective if he should be so bold as to come again after joes warning and the three discussed the journey which the princess was to make on the following day  aunt dorcas thought it would be only right for mrs weber to return fivesevenths of the money which had been paid her to take care of the child for one week but the boys were doubtful whether the old lady would take the same view of the case  ill be willin enough to let her keep it so longs i can have the princess with me joe said finally and aunt dorcas reproved him gently  remember joseph a penny saved is better than a penny earned and you should never be careless about money matters if the german woman has boarded the child only two days there is no reason why she should be paid for seven  except that we gave her the money at the start and she may say theres no need to take princess away till the week is ended plums suggested sagely and aunt dorcas brought the argument to a close by saying severely  if she insists on keeping the whole dollar i shall never look upon her as an honest woman  on this evening aunt dorcas read two chapters instead of one and her prayer was nearly twice as long as on the night previous  then as before she accompanied the boys upstairs to make certain everything in the chamber was in proper order although it was already scrupulously clean and when after having bidden them good night they heard her light footsteps as she descended the stairs joe said with an air of perplexity  im dead certain we dont do the right thing when shes prayin  i didnt make any noise plums replied indignantly  course you didnt else id thumped your head id like to see the feller that would kick up a row or even so much as laugh while aunt dorcas was prayin what i mean is that we oughter do somethin instead of settin up there like a couple of chumps an she on her knees do you spose it would be right for us to kneel down when she does  i dont know it couldnt do much harm i spose an if you think it would please her any better why im willin to stay on my knees half a day  well try it tomorrer night and see how she takes it say ive found out what them towels are for aunt dorcas had one side of her plate an she wiped her mouth on it  perhaps she didnt have a handkerchief  now look here plums you dont spose that a woman whats so slick an clean as aunt dorcas is would go round without a handkerchief do you  it seems as though she must if she used the towel but that aint botherin me half so much jest now as dan fernald is i reckon hes pretty near wild by this time an it would be a terrible thing if the perlice should come an drag us out of this place wouldnt it  i aint afraid hell kick up a row that detective business is all in his eye he dont mount to any moren sim jepson does when it comes to law matters  but he might do something for all that  if he does it cant be helped well know whatever happens to us that princess has got a good home  of course theres somethin in that but all the same id rather know i was goin to stay in a good one and master plummer crept between the lavenderscented sheets with an expression of most intense satisfaction upon his face  day had but just dawned when joe potter awakened after a long and restful sleep  come turn out plums he said as he shook his friend roughly im goin downstairs to build a fire for aunt dorcas before she gets up an youd better come along if were goin to eat her food an sleep in her bed it stands us in hand to try to pay our way  master plummer promised to get up in two minutes but the fire had been built and breakfast was nearly ready when he made his appearance  aunt dorcas had made no remark when she came downstairs and found joe performing such of the household duties as he was familiar with but he knew by the expression on her face that she was pleased and this was sufficient reward for having left the restinviting bed at such an early hour  according to the arrangements made on the previous evening joe was to set out on his threemile journey immediately after breakfast and as soon as the meal was brought to a close aunt dorcas made up a reasonably large parcel of seedcakes and doughnuts intended as she explained to serve as lunch for the travellers  but i wont be hungry aunt dorcas cause im about as full as i can be now an the princess couldnt eat all youve got there if she tried for a week  i dare say you wont be sorry for taking it and joe made no further protest  aunt dorcas actually kissed him much to his embarrassment as he left the house and called after him while he was yet in the lane  dont try to make the child walk too far joseph and be careful not to carry her very long at a time youve got plenty of food even if you shouldnt get back until nightfall and its better to go slowly than overtax yourself  perhaps never before in his life had joe potter been cautioned against undue exertion and he fully appreciated the little womans solicitousness  if i was any kind of a feller id turn to an tell her the whole story but i dont dare to for fear shed believe id done somethin awful wicked an turn me out of the house of course its got to come some day but itll be toughmighty tough  there was but little room for bitter thoughts in joes mind on this june morning when it seemed good to be alive and before he had traversed half a mile he put far from him all forebodings thinking only of what he would do to add to the comfort of aunt dorcas and the happiness of the princess  there was in his mind a welldefined idea that it was his duty to search for the childs parents but he wholly failed to realise the mental anguish which must be theirs while in ignorance of the babys whereabouts and believed there was no especial reason why he should inconvenience himself to find them  if she wasnt all right it would be different he said arguing with himself after we get her into aunt dorcass home she couldnt be fixed any better if she was living with the president so of course her folks wont fuss so awfully much about her  he enjoyed this journey because every step was bringing him nearer to the princess whose devoted slave he was and the tramp of three miles came to an end before he was conscious of having walked onethird of the distance  he had arrived within sight of mrs webers home and was hoping to catch a glimpse of the princesss curly head in the window when some one stepped deliberately in front of him barring his passage  hello dan aint you gone back to the city yet he cried in surprise as he recognised the amateur detective  i started last night an if id got there you an plums would be in jail by this time but i wasnt such a chump as to run right over without findin out if things had been goin wrong you think i dont mount to anything as a detective eh well jest look at this an see what would have happened if id gone there sames youd done  as he ceased speaking dan handed his friend a copy of an evening paper folded in such a manner that a certain advertisement stood out prominently  joes face paled as he read the following lines       one hundred dollars will be paid for information concerning      the whereabouts of a fruit vendor known as joseph potter      and two newsboys one of whom answers to the nickname of      plums and the other known as dan fernald the above      reward will be paid to any one who will secure for the      undersigned an interview with either of the boys named       address cushman  morton attorneys at law 4712 pine      street new york  as before he failed to see immediately below this an advertisement requesting information concerning a little girl who had strayed from the grand central depot and offering one thousand dollars reward for the same  you see i got myself into a scrape tryin to help you through and hows it turned out you wouldnt so much as give me a bite to eat when i was starvin even when you had plenty of it without costin a cent now if im caught ive got to go to jail jest the sames if id done whatever you did  but i havent done anything crooked dan i cant so much as guess what these lawyers want me for  oh you tell that to the marines fellers what get so swell they cant sell papers for a living but splurge out into a fruit store with a clerk an all them things have to get money somehow i dont say as youve robbed a bank cause i dont see how you could get into one but it must be something pretty nigh as bad else whod offer a hundred dollars jest to get hold of you i aint so certain but i shall snoop in that cash an take the chances of goin to jail  i dont spose its any use for me to keep on tellin you ive been straight ever since i started out sellin papers joe said sadly its true all the same though an you cant find a feller whatll say i ever did him out of one cent  thats all in my eye cause heres the advertisement what proves different all i want to know is how am i goin to get out of the scrape  i wish i could tell you  if you did i spose youd say get over to the city an let them do what they want to with you but dont hang round me sames you did yesterday  dan i never believed the lawyers would know you had come away with us cause it didnt seem reasonable an its terrible to have you countin on livin with aunt dorcas when she is feedin two of us already  whats the reason you couldnt step out an let me have the snap for a spell i aint been stealin money i wasnt advertised for till i took up your case no that dont suit you but i must be the one to starve an sneak round anywhere i can while youre bein filled up with custard pie an sleepin on a bed so soft that plums thought it was feathers you make me tired you do  see here dan im willing to do anything you say now that youre really in the scrape with us go to aunt dorcas an tell her i couldnt come back perhaps shell take you in my place  perhaps she will an perhaps she wont i spose youve been coddlin the old woman up so she thinks theres nobody in the world but joe potter an i wouldnt want to bet a great deal of money that you havent been tellin her im a chump an all that kind of stuff so she wouldnt look at me if i should go there  i never told her so much as your name  where are you goin dan interrupted suspiciously  to get the princess aunt dorcas said i might bring her there  so you felt awful bad about lettin your aunt dorcas feed three when i was round starvin yet you can make it three by luggin in your bloomin princess  havin a little baby in the house is different from a big boy like you dan theres no use for us to stand here chinnin about it im ready to say im sorry for the way i talked to you yesterday an ill gree never to go back to aunt dorcass now what more can i do  but i want you to go back dan replied angrily  what for  im no chump joe potter an i know what kind of a stew would be served up to me if i went there alone i want you to go an introduce me to the family  its a dead sure thing dan we cant all live there you know plums wont work any moren he has to an were jest spongin right off of a poor woman what aint got enough for herself  it aint any worse for me than it is for you  joe was in a pitiable frame of mind  believing that dan was being searched for by the attorneys simply because of what he had done in the affair joe considered the amateur detective had such a claim upon him as could not be resisted yet at the same time he was determined not to add a fourth member to aunt dorcass family  dan you go an tell her all i saidtell her the whole truth if you want toan most likely shell let you stay but i cant ask her to open up a reglar sylum for us fellers course im bound to do anything you say seeins you got into this trouble through me but i wont gree to sponge a livin off the best woman that ever lived when theres three others doin the same thing  look here youve got to go back with me  joe was in deepest distress and after a pause of several seconds he said slowly  if you lay right down on my goin to her house with you ill do it but i wont stay there a single minute the princess can be left where she is till i get back  now was the time when dan fernald could exert his authority with effect and he said sharply  if you go back without the kid the old womanll lay it to me now this is what youve got to do take your bloomin princess an act jest the same as if you hadnt met me ill wait till your aunt dorcas gets through fussin over the kid an then ill flash up tell her im one of your friends an well see how she takes it  but i dont want to do that dan joe cried in distress  you must or ill have to go to jail an when it comes to anything like that the whole boilin of us are in it go ahead an get the kid  joe was no longer able because of his sorrow and perplexity to contend against the amateur detective and without making any further reply he walked slowly towards mrs webers home his heart heavier even than on that morning when he first read the advertisement which seemingly branded him as a criminal     chapter xi  a bribe   it appeared very much as if dan suspected joe of treachery even in this matter of reclaiming the princess for he followed him to mrs webers home and there stood within a few paces of the door where he might overhear all that was said  now that the amateur detective was thoroughly alarmed concerning his own safety he had ceased his grotesquely mysterious movements and behaved very much like an ordinary boy  not until joe had knocked twice at the door was his summons answered and then the old german lady stood before him with the princess in her arms  he had hoped the child would recognise him but was not prepared for such a hearty greeting as he received  the princess looking less dainty than when he first saw her because of a coarse calico frock which the careful mrs weber had put on in the place of her more expensive garments leaned forward in the old ladys arms stretching out both tiny hands to joe as she twittered and chirped after her own peculiar manner what was evidently a greeting to the boy who had acted a guardians part to the best of his ability  she really knows me joe cried in an ecstasy of joy forgetting for a moment his own sorrow and as the child nestled her face against his neck he kissed the curly brown hair again and again  mrs weber welcomed the princesss guardian in her own language which was as unintelligible to master potter as the babys cooing and only served to arouse the amateur detectives suspicions  whats that old woman sayin dan asked sharply you dont want to try any funny games with me cause i wont stand it  joe did not hear the unkind words his heart had been made so glad by the princesss joy at seeing him that he would hardly have been conscious of the fact had the officers of the law come forward at that moment to make him a prisoner  mrs weber observing dan for the first time addressed him in a kindly tone which only served to deepen the frown on the amateur detectives face  i dunno what youre drivin at missis but you wont pull wool over my eyes by jabberin away in that lingo  it so chanced that joe heard this remark and turning quickly towards the boy who he believed held him in his power he said sharply  now dont make a bigger fool of yourself than you can help dan fernald mrs weber cant talk our way an is only tryin to treat you decent  im keepin my eyes open all the same cause i dont count on gettin left the same as i was yesterday  accepting the invitation given by gestures joe entered the house with the princess in his arms and followed by the boy who considered himself his master  now a serious difficulty presented itself  mrs webers grandson was not at home and it would be necessary to dispense with the services of an interpreter  i dont know how im going to fix it joe said speaking half to himself and master fernald believed he was addressed  what is it you cant fix  i want to get back some of the money i paid mrs weber but how am i goin to tell her ill carry the princess away for good  she must know what you say of course who ever heard of a woman what didnt understand how to talk  but shes a german you know  i cant help that if you tell her right up an down what you mean shes bound to know it less shes a dummy  there was little in the way of advice to be gained from the alleged detective and joe began a pantomime which he intended should convey the idea  he pointed to the princesss clothes then out of the window put on his hat and with the child in his arms walked towards the door  then he opened the parcel aunt dorcas had given him displaying the food and pointed up the street in the direction from which he had just come  after a time mrs weber appeared to understand something of what he was trying to convey and with a volley of words which sounded very much like a protest took the princess from him  the child screamed violently clinging to joe with all her little strength and the boy was seriously disturbed but the smile on mrs webers face told that she did not consider the outburst as anything very serious  whats she goin to do with the kid dan asked as the german woman disappeared in an adjoining room  i spose shes gone to put on the princesss other clothes cause it seemed like as if she understood what id been tellin her  it would be a precious good job if she didnt come back that kid has got you into a heap of trouble joe potter an itll grow worse instead of better so long as you stick to her  joe made no reply it is doubtful if he heard the words for the princess was crying so loudly he feared she might do herself an injury  five minutes later mrs weber reëntered the room bringing the princess clad in her own garments and the little maid ran with outstretched arms to joe pressing her tearstained face against his cheek in such a manner as went straight to his heart  after a prolonged caress joe said to dan as if answering the remark which the amateur detective had made a few moments previous  no matter how much trouble she might get me into id stick to this little thing as long as i lived if she needed me  course youve got the right to be jest as big a fool as you like it aint any of my business so longs i dont have to starve to death on her account what about the money you was goin to try to get from the old woman  ill have to let that go cause i cant make her understand what i mean will you carry the cakes  master fernald seized the parcel with avidity and straightway began devouring its contents  with the princess in his arms joe arose put on his hat and held out his hand in token of adieu  mrs weber looked at him in surprise an instant and then after saying something in german hastened out of the room returning a moment later with several silver coins in her hand  joe hesitated and then took from the outstretched palm fifty cents motioning that she keep the remainder  the old lady shook her head energetically and literally forced him to take all the coins which amounted in value to ninety cents  youve only kept a dime he said in protest an it isnt enough to pay for takin care of the princess two days  mrs weber smiled kindly patted joe on the head kissed the princess affectionately and by opening the door signified that she would not accept further payment for her services  ill come back some day an square up for what youve done joe cried as he stepped down on to the sidewalk and then he remembered that if matters were arranged as seemed necessary he would soon be in prison anyway ill come back as soon as i can he added to himself and kissing the tiny hand which the princess had wilfully placed over his mouth he set forward resolutely on the journey followed by the boy who claimed the right to dictate as to his future movements  during half an hour joe walked steadily on towards aunt dorcass peaceful home listening to the princesss childish prattle and banishing all forebodings from his mind with the thought that the baby trusted and loved him  then dan who had been walking a few paces in the rear came to his side appearing a trifle more friendly than when they first met  at this rate youll get back in time for dinner  it seems as though i ought to but its kind of hard work carryin the princess aunt dorcas gave me the cakes sos we wouldnt need to hurry on the road anwhere are they  do you mean that little bunch of cakes you gave me  little bunch why there was a stack of em  it dont make any difference how many there was cause i ate the whole lot  joe looked at the amateur detective as if about to make an angry reply but checked himself and dan said defiantly  the times gone by when you can put on airs with me joe potter i aint goin to starve to death when theres anything round i can eat  no youd rather let a little baby like this one go hungry i wouldnt have touched the cakes any soonern id cut my finger off cause they was for her  you make me tired with your bloomin princess shes stuffed jest about as full as she can hold an im the same as starved  joe did not so much as look at the selfish boy but walked more rapidly than before until fully onehalf the distance from mrs webers to aunt dorcass had been traversed  light though the burden was his arms ached from long carrying the child and it seemed absolutely necessary to come to a halt  the princess was more than willing to take advantage of the opportunity to search for flowers or wintergreen plums by the roadside and joe stretched himself out at full length on the cool grass keeping jealous watch all the while over the happy little girl  dan seated himself near by having once more assumed an air of injured innocence and master potter could not longer delay having an understanding with this boy who was bent on claiming even more than his right  so youre bound on goin straight to aunt dorcass with me he said after a brief pause  its got to be that or jail  i dont see why there are other places round here besides hers  yes but i aint sure of gettin into em for nothin when you strike a house where plums is so contented it must be a pretty soft snap  it aint certain you can get in there an its dead sure youre drivin the princess an me away  i aint doin anything of the kind youre gettin on your ear cause i want to be treated decent thats the size of it  you know very well we cant ask that poor little woman to take care of four an somebody must go if youre comin now of course i must take the princess with me an i dont want to leave the very minute i get there will you hang off a couple of days an give me a chance to find out how i can fix things  id starve to death in two days an you know it  thats all foolishness youve got plenty of money in your pocket that was borrowed from the fellers to help plums an me through  i havent so much that i can go sportin round the country like a swell have i  youve got enough to keep you from starvin for a week  all the same im goin to live with you an plums dan replied doggedly and joe remained silent while one might have counted twenty after which he said with the air of a boy who has suddenly decided upon a course of action  mis weber gave me back ninety cents now ill turn over seventyfive of it if you agree not to show up at aunt dorcass until three oclock tomorrow afternoon  what kind of a game are you tryin to play on me now master fernald asked suspiciously  it aint any game im hirin you to stay away so i can stop there till that time an then ill leave  yes an youre goin to tell her a whole lot of stuff bout me sos she wont let me stop there  ill promise never to speak your name except to tell her you come as fars this with us an was up behind the barn twice now with seventyfive cents you can live a good deal more swell somewhere else than at aunt dorcass an at three oclock tomorrow afternoon you may do what you please  how do i know youll keep your promise  cause neither you nor anybody else can say i ever went back on my word an fix it any way youre a mind to its the best trade you can make im certain she wouldnt take in four of us an the only show youve got is for me to leave  but wherell i find a chance to buy something to eat  there are plenty of stores round here an you can get a lodging most anywhere for twentyfive cents  hand over your money  do you gree not to show your nose round there till three oclock tomorrow  of course i do  joe counted out the amount agreed upon and said warningly as he gave it to master fernald  im reckonin on your keepin your word sames i will mine but dont make the mistake of goin back on me dan fernald for if you come to aunt dorcass before the time weve greed on ill make it hot you know i can do it so be square or youll get into worse trouble than if the detectives found you  thats right threaten a feller when you think youve got him in a hole  i aint doin half so much threatenin as you did an besides im payin for the privilege when i give you pretty nigh all the money ive got an you with a pocket full  the amateur detective did not think it advisable to reply to this remark and the two remained silent until joe believed the time had come when the journey should be resumed  the princess was weary with running to and fro and willingly allowed the boy to take her in his arms again  the next time we stop itll be at aunt dorcass joe said as he set out and then he halted suddenly for master fernald was following close in the rear  where you goin  with you of course  didnt i buy you off till three oclock tomorrow afternoon  does that mean i cant so much as walk up the road when youre on it  it means you mustnt follow me to aunt dorcass house an after all thats been said and done i shouldnt think youd want to do anything of the kind  ill keep my promise an ill do whatever else i please you better not be too smart cause i might back out of the trade  it would be a sorry job for you joe said threateningly and turning once more he continued the journey without heed to master fernalds movements  illustration the princess suffered aunt dorcas to kiss her  it was not yet eleven oclock when joe and the princess arrived at aunt dorcass home and the little woman cried in delight as master potter led the child towards her  what a sweet little darling what a beautiful baby why joseph i had no idea she was such a lovely child as this and the princess suffered aunt dorcas to kiss her rapturously  theres no flies on her anyhow joe said with an air of pride  it is doubtful if aunt dorcas heard this last remark she was as pleased with the princess as a child would have been with a doll and behaved much after the same fashion  joe and plums listened with greatest satisfaction to her words of praise  the little maid and the little woman had apparently conceived a most violent admiration each for the other and straightway it seemed as if the boys were entirely forgotten for the two went into the house without so much as a backward glance  cordin to the looks of things i guess theyll get along pretty well together plums said in a tone of satisfaction im mighty glad youve come back cause aunt dorcas kept me humpin myself ever since you left why ive finished up the whole garden an it seems to me as if id done the work of four men did you get the money from the german woman  yes but it didnt do me any good and then joe told in detail of the meeting with the amateur detective and the bribe he had been forced to give  it seems as though dan must be pretty smart if theyre advertisin for him too plums said reflectively i cant make out what them lawyers are up to offerin a whole hundred dollars for either one of us an when it comes right down to dots i dont spose were actually worth twentyfive cents  i cant understand it either and i expect aunt dorcas will think im a terrible bad feller when i tell her the story  but you aint goin to do anything like that plums cried in alarm  yes i am i wont go away from here without tellin her the truth an ive got to leave before three oclock tomorrow afternoon  now look here joe this aint right to let dan fernald drive you off wherell we find another place like this  i dont reckon we ever can but its got to be done id be shamed enough to die if dan should settle hisself down here after weve brought the princess that would make four of us for aunt dorcas to feed an we know she has bout all she can do to pay her own bills it seemed pretty tough when you an i come but i said to myself it was only for two or three weeks an we could patch it up somehow after we got back to town  but dans a fool master plummer cried excitedly its no dead sure thing aunt dorcas will take him in sames she has us even if you do go away  but he thinks she will so it mounts to the same thing  where are you goin  i dont know joe replied mournfully perhaps itll be better to go straight to town an let em arrest me aunt dorcas will tell me whats best an i shall do as she says  you aint goin to talk to her tonight  no plums im countin on holdin out till tomorrow mornin an enjoyin myself all i can cause it aint no ways likely ill ever have the chance of stoppin again in sich a place as this  master plummer was silent for a moment and then a different aspect of the case presented itself to him  why whats goin to become of me he cried i dont believe aunt dorcasll keep me after you leave an whatll i do  if i let the lawyers get hold of me thatll ease up on you cause im the only one theyd want to arrest an you can go back to town  yes perhaps i can but ill hate to mightily that shanty of mine wont seem half so nice after weve lived here an ill have to go to work sellin papers  master plummer was now so absorbed in the contemplation of his own unfortunate position as to be wholly unable to sympathise with his friend and the two sat on the greensward just outside aunt dorcass door in painful silence     chapter xii  a struggle in the night   during the remainder of this day it appeared to joe and plums as if they were abandoned by the little woman who had hitherto treated them with so much attention  immediately after joe arrived with his charge aunt dorcas and the princess disappeared inside the house and neither of them seemed to desire the companionship of the boys until at an unusually late hour they were summoned to dinner  to plumss great disappointment the noonday meal was a lunch rather than a dinner and aunt dorcas apologised by saying  i was so interested in making the acquaintance of your princess joseph that for perhaps the first time in my life i forgot my household duties and it was half past eleven before i remembered we hadnt had dinner  cordin to the slat of stuff youve got here on the table i should think youd been at work all the forenoon joe said approvingly but there was the faintest suspicion of jealousy in his heart because the princess no longer demanded his attention  aunt dorcas had arrayed her in some plain garments which might once have belonged to herself or her sisters and the little maid was so well content with this new friend that she had but curt greetings for the boy who considered himself her guardian  perhaps aunt dorcas understood from the expression on joes face something of that which was in his mind when the princess chattered and cooed to the little woman paying no attention to the others at the table for she said in a kindly tone  its to be expected joseph that a baby like this one would take more readily to a woman than a boy  oh i know that aunt dorcas joe replied with a poor assumption of carelessness an im awful glad you like her  indeed i do joseph even in the short time she has been here i have realised what a comfort it is to have a child around the house and i believe god has been very good in sending you and her to me  aunt dorcas made no mention of being grateful because plums was a member of the family but that young gentleman gave no apparent heed to the omission so intent was he upon the pleasure of eating  joe had expected aunt dorcas would question him closely concerning the journey and want to know if the princess had eaten the cookies she sent he feared he might not be able to answer her questions without revealing some of the disagreeable events of the morning but to his surprise she never so much as referred to the subject all her thoughts were centred upon the child how she should amuse her how provide her with new garments and the little woman even went so far as to speculate upon the time when it would be necessary to send her to school  joe did not enjoy the food as he would have done but for having met with dan the detective  a big lump came into his throat with the thought that this might be the last dinner for him in the cottage the last time he would see aunt dorcas and it was only with difficulty he could swallow  he had said he would give himself wholly up to the pleasure of being there during the remainder of this day and not until morning came should aunt dorcas hear his story but before the dinner was eaten he began to question whether it might not be wiser to make the explanations at once and have done with them so painful was the suspense  while the little woman washed the dishes joe was permitted to amuse the princess but as soon as aunt dorcas was at leisure she took the child in her arms and said preparatory to seating herself in the comfortable rockingchair near the west window  the princess and i are going to have our nooning now and you boys had better go outofdoors where you cant disturb us with your noise  the lump in joes throat seemed to increase in size but he forced it back bravely as he asked  isnt there any work we can do aunt dorcas theres no reason why we should hang round here with our hands in our pockets  ill venture to say george isnt eager to be doing anything for i kept him busy this morning it appears to me he isnt a great lover of hard work and i am certain you need rest a walk of six milesand i dare say you carried the child a good deal more than half the distanceis as much as ought to be expected of a boy in one day  but im not so awful tired an i guess plums can hold out a spell longer so if theres anything youll be wantin done for the next week or two i wish youd let me know it now  i dont think of a thing joseph go into the orchard and amuse yourself in almost any way except by throwing rocks at the birds until the princess and i have had our nap  joe could do no less than obey and once they were out of the house he said to plums  of course im a big fool to think any such things but i cant help feelin sorry because the princess had rather be with aunt dorcas than me  id say it was a mighty lucky thing if we were goin to stay here but in case you stick to what you said about goin away tomorrow it will be kinder tough on both of em  i wouldnt wonder if aunt dorcas wanted us to go after i tell her why i left the city shes too good a woman to keep a feller round if she thinks hes been doin something wicked  but you say you havent  an its the truth plums but i cant make other folks believe it not even you on account of that advertisement everybody says i must have been up to something crooked else the lawyers wouldnt try so hard to get hold of me  plums could give no consolation although he had never known joe to do anything which was not absolutely just and honest he was convinced that some wrong had been committed otherwise the advertisement would never have appeared  joe lay down on the grass under one of the appletrees and despite the sorrow in his heart the chirping of the birds the soft murmur of the leaves as they were moved to and fro by the breeze and the hum of insects soon lulled him to sleep  the sun was far down in the west when he awakened and leaping to his feet surprised that he had spent nearly the entire afternoon in slumber he looked around for master plummer  that young gentleman was sitting with his back against the trunk of a tree looking idly up at the fleecy clouds while an expression of discontent overspread his face  i guess i must have had a pretty long nap joe said as if to make an apology for his indolence i dont believe i ever did a thing like that before hasnt aunt dorcas called us yet  not as i know master plummer replied curtly  then she an the princess must be sleepin as sound as i was of course youd heard if shed called  i havent been here all the time  where have you been  master plummer hesitated an instant and then replied speaking rapidly as if to prevent joe from interrupting him  i saw dan fernald sneakin round down by the road an went to see him weve been talkin this thing over joe an it dont seem to me as though there was any need for you to go off with the princess you might walk round the country for a week without findin so good a place as this im sure aunt dorcas had rather keep half a dozen boys than let that youngster go now shes begun to like her  i wish id known dan fernald had come here it was in the agreement he should keep away an id a pounded him if id caught him sneakin round  but say why cant you keep quiet an let him do as hes a mind to perhaps aunt dorcas wont take him in after all  i aint goin to say a word against him but i shall tell her the whole story tomorrow morning an then clear out  even if she wants you to stay  yes cause id be ashamed to own i was alive if id let her take care of such a crowd as ours  plums showed plainly that he was displeased by the stand his friend had taken and walked in silence down the lane to the road  any decent fellerd do the sames im countin on joe said to himself as he went slowly towards the cottage he wants to stay cause he gets plenty to eat an no work to speak of so he wont look at the thing the way he oughter  arriving near the rear door of the cottage he saw aunt dorcas and the princess playing on the grass with two dolls made of aprons and the little woman appeared to be enjoying herself as hugely as did the little maid  i declare im almost ashamed of myself joseph to be seen at such games but i couldnt resist your princesss coaxing and i believe ive really had a good time we must find some more christianlike name for her than princess i think she calls herself essie  i thought so too but i couldnt make out what kind of a name that was did you call us after you got through with your nap aunt dorcas  certainly i did joseph but i suppose you were too far away to hear me  joe explained how he had spent the afternoon whereat the little woman laughed merrily and invited him to play with them at keeping house  not until fully half an hour after her usual time for preparing the evening meal did aunt dorcas cease her share in the childish sport and then joe had his princess all to himself until they were summoned to supper  meanwhile master plummer had returned from his walk but without having concluded his fit of the sulks and he apparently gave no heed to anything around him until he was called to partake of supper  on this night aunt dorcass prayer was one of thanksgiving rather than supplication there was a cheery ring in her voice which the boys had never heard before and joe wondered at it without once guessing that the coming of the princess had made the little woman more womanly and younger  when the boys were in their room joe who had almost forgotten since the moment he joined in the game of keeping house that on the morrow he was to leave this pleasant abidingplace realised even more keenly than before how hard it would be to carry out the purpose he had formed but yet he did not falter for a single moment  ill do it in the mornin sure an i wish id told her tonight then the hardest part would be over he said to himself as he crept into bed by the side of the yet indignantly silent master plummer  owing to his long sleep during the afternoon and also the unpleasant thoughts in his mind joes eyes refused to close in slumber he tossed to and fro on the restinviting bed while plums slept audibly until it seemed to him as if the night must have passed and the morning was near at hand  this belief was strengthened when he heard a noise as if the kitchen window was being raised and he leaped out of bed vexed with himself because he had not gone down sooner to build the fire  it was yet dark in the room and he turned to pull aside the curtain when he found that it was already raised at full height  it aint mornin thats certain he said to himself i wonder what aunt dorcas is doin perhaps the princess is sick  he went to the door and listened a certain faint rustling as if some one was moving around in the room below came to his ears but it was so indistinct he questioned whether it might not be fancy  one two three minutes he stood silent and motionless and then not satisfied that everything was as it should be crept softly down the stairs  on nearing the kitchen he became positive some one was moving around the room but since no ray of light appeared from beneath the door when he stood at the foot of the stairs the startling thought came into his mind that an evildisposed person had effected an entrance  it seemed preposterous burglars should come to the cottage in the hope of finding anything of very great value and yet joe felt convinced there was an intruder in the house  then it was that he believed he knew the person who was moving so stealthily in the adjoining room  dan has broken in here to steal something to eat he said to himself he thinks neither plums nor i would dare do anything to him for fear hed tell the detectives where we are and knows aunt dorcas couldnt make much of a row if she wanted to  determined to punish the amateur detective soundly for his misdemeanour joe crept softly to the door until his hand was on the latch and at that instant it was suddenly opened from the inside  not anticipating any such movement as this the boy who had been partially leaning against the door was precipitated into the room  only with difficulty did he prevent himself from falling and had but just recovered his balance when he was seized from behind by some one who had evidently intended to clutch him by the throat but failing grasped his shirtcollar  even now joe believed it was with dan he had to deal and wrenching himself free which was not difficult since the cloth tore in the hand of the intruder he struck out right and left with the hope of dealing an effective blow  before many seconds had passed however he understood that he was battling with a man and not a boy  once he received a blow on the cheek which sent him staggering back several paces and when he would have renewed the battle was met by a thrust in the face which almost dazed him  the intruder made no outcry probably hoping the other inmates of the house might not be aroused and joe remained silent lest aunt dorcas should learn of the burglars presence  after receiving a third blow and not having been able to deliver one in return joe understood that the battle would speedily be brought to an end by his discomfiture unless there was a change of tactics and he closed with the man at once seizing him around the waist in such a manner that the fellow could not do him much injury  the boy had but little hope he would come off victor in this unequal battle but yet he clung to his adversary striving to overthrow him until in their struggles the two were at the open door through which joe had entered  leading from the kitchen by this way was a short hall ending in three steps which led to the shed beyond and joe believed the time had come when he might gain an advantage  at that instant the burglar was standing with his back towards the passageway and putting all his strength into the effort joe flung his whole weight upon the enemy  the man taken for the instant at a disadvantage yielded a single step and this was sufficient for his discomfiture  joe forced him back until the fellow toppled down the stairs striking his head against the threshold of the shed door with sufficient force to render him unconscious  the crash which followed the burglars fall literally shook the little cottage and before joe fully realised he had vanquished the foe aunt dorcas was calling him loudly by name  its all right dont you come down but send plums here if you can he shouted in reply and then stood irresolutely wondering what could be done  he had an illdefined idea that the burglar should be made a prisoner but how that might be accomplished was more than he could say at that moment  aunt dorcas had ceased to call for him when he understood that it would be more prudent on his part to secure a light before taking any steps to fetter the burglar and he stepped back into the kitchen for this purpose but he had not yet found a match when the little woman entered holding high above her head a lamp as she had done on the night when joe first saw her  goodness gracious joseph what is the matter youre covered with blood have you met with an accident  now dont get frightened aunt dorcas i aint hurt  why do you tell me that joseph when i can see for myself you must be bleeding to death  but i am not i tell you i jest got a clip on the nose an another one behind the ear neither of em will do any harm now dont you get frightened but i spose ive got to tell you what happened  of course you have joseph you dont fancy i can remain silent with such goings on in my house and not attempt to understand them what have you been doing to yourself why dont you answer cant you see you are making me very nervous  i didnt want to tell you aunt dorcas cause i was fraid youd get scared but theres a burglar out here in the shed i knocked him silly by pitching him downstairs an now im tryin to think how we can keep him from gettin away  a burglar keep him from getting away why joseph potter we dont want any burglars round this house for mercys sake if the poor misguided creature will go dont you try to stop him did you hurt him very much  joe was relieved in mind because aunt dorcas instead of being terrified at the information that a burglar was in the house was only solicitous lest he might have been injured and he replied grimly  i reckon im the one what got the worst of that little fuss you neednt feel so very bad bout him cause hes only bumped his head but say we mustnt let him go after what hes tried to do ill tie him an you call plums to go for a perliceman  joseph i never would consent to have a poor fellow arrested but he shall be talked to severely for injuring you as he has done the idea of a grownup man striking a child so hard as to bring blood  however serious the situation joe could not have restrained his mirth  aunt dorcass pity for the burglar and fear lest he had been injured was to him very comical and he laughed heartily until the little woman said in a tone of reproof  joseph that poor man may be dying and by your hand while you are making merry where is he  joe stifled his mirth as best he could and taking the lamp and the tenderhearted little womans hand led the way towards the shed door as he replied  ill show him to you aunt dorcas an then if you want to tie a rag round his throat or put a plaster on his head you can  but joe did not make as thorough an exhibition of his burglar as he had anticipated  the man had regained consciousness and all aunt dorcas saw of the intruder was a dark form which ran past her into the kitchen and from there leaped through the open window  joe could not have stopped the burglar if he wished so sudden and unexpected had been the fellows movements but he was deeply chagrined that his enemy should thus have escaped so readily  hes gone an i oughter be kicked for standin here chinnin with you as if hed wait till i got ready to tie him up  we should be thankful to him for going without making any more of a disturbance im relieved to know he wasnt seriously hurt andhow wicked i am to stand here talking about anything when your wounds should be attended to its a mercy you havent bled to death long before this  theres no danger of anything of that kind aunt dorcas and if youll go right back to bed ill tend to myself in great shape theres no need of your fussin round  you must believe me a perfect wretch if you think i could leave you in such a condition but joseph i would like to go back and dress myself properly  theres no reason why you shouldnt leave me till mornin jest as well as not so go ahead aunt dorcas an do whatever you please  illustration a dark form leaped through the open window  sit down here by the table where you will have something on which to rest your head if you grow faint and ill be back in a moment  aunt dorcas closed the kitchen door lest a draft of air should come upon the boy she believed so grievously wounded and went to her own room joe saying to himself meanwhile  id been willin for him to have pounded me into shoestrings if it would save me from havin to tell a woman as good as she is that i ran away from new york to keep out of jail     chapter xiii  a confession   it seemed to joe as if aunt dorcas had but just left the room when she returned ready for the work of binding up his wounds  do you feel any worse joseph she asked laying her hand gently on his shoulder  not a bit of it master potter replied stoutly  do you think you can bear up until i have built a fire and heated some water  now look here aunt dorcas i aint hurt any to speak of even though there is a good deal of blood on my face an as for bearin up why it wouldnt do me a bit of harm if there wasnt anything done to my face ill build a fire if its warm water youre after and before the little woman could prevent him he had set about the task  while waiting for the fire to burn aunt dorcas collected such articles as she believed would be needed and joe found it difficult to prevent a smile from appearing on his bruised face as he watched the preparations  several rolls of clean white cloth in sufficient quantity to have bandaged the heads of twenty boys arnica antiseptic washes adhesive plaster a sponge cooling lotions and as joe afterwards told plums a whole apothecarys shop full of stuff was placed on the table in a methodical fashion  i guess while this waters bein heated ill wash some of the blood off my face an then youll see that there aint any need of worryin much bout me joe said with a laugh as he turned towards the sink and aunt dorcas cried excitedly  dont do it joseph dont you dare to do it it might be as much as your life is worth to put cold water on that bruised flesh it wont be many minutes before we shall have plenty of the proper temperature  of course ill do jest as you say aunt dorcas but ive been hurt worsen this a good many times an never had any one to touch me up the sames you seem bound on doin  if you have been foolhardy in the past it is no reason why you should run unnecessary risks now the little woman said severely and joe made no further attempt to dissuade her from her purpose  when the water was sufficiently warm aunt dorcas set about her selfappointed task passing the moist sponge over joes face with an exceedingly light touch as if afraid of causing him pain and he said with a stifled laugh  you neednt be afraid of hurtin me aunt dorcas i can stand a good deal moren that without yippin id been willin to got it twice as bad if we could have held on to that duffer  you shouldnt harbour revengeful thoughts joseph i am truly glad he made his escape  if you treat burglars in that way this place will be overrun with them before next winter  of course i dont like the idea of having strange men prowling around the house in the night but there is nothing here for them to steal and i am certain they couldnt be wicked enough to hurt a poor old woman like me instead of harbouring revengeful thoughts we should endeavour to do good to those who would injure us remembering the words spoken on the mount that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also  if a feller went round doin anything like that i reckon hed soon be in worse shape than i am do you mean aunt dorcas that i ought to have stood still an let that burglar have fun with me  i cant think it was intended we should take the words literally but they certainly were meant that we should be forgivingthat we should love our enemies so heartily as to lead them from their evil ways the man who beat you so cruelly will never be brought into a better life by harsh words now i am going to put some arnica on these bruises it will hurt but you must try to bear the pain manfully  dont be afraid of me aunt dorcas you couldnt do anything that would make me yip  the little woman treated joes wounds with such simple remedies as she had near at hand and then proceeded to bandage his head until but little more than his eyes and mouth could be seen striving meanwhile to show him how much better the world would be for his having lived in it if he would govern himself strictly by the golden rule  during all the while she was putting the many bandages in place joe was saying to himself that now was come the time when he should make that confession he had decided upon and although aunt dorcas had said so much concerning the blessedness of forgiving those who have done us an injury he did not believe she would so far carry her precepts into practice as to be willing to shelter one who appeared to be as great a criminal as himself  i believe joseph i have done all that is possible tonight the little woman finally said as she fastened in place the last bandage you are not to get up in the morning until after i have made certain you are in no danger of a fever now go to your room and if you think george may disturb you ill put him in the spare chamber  wait a minute aunt dorcas i want to tell you something and joe laid his hand on the little womans arm to prevent her from rising you never knew why plums an i left new york to come out here where there isnt a chance to earn a living  i understood from something you said joseph that there was a reason for your leaving home suddenly but i cant believe my boy you have done anything wrong  an i havent aunt dorcas as true as i live i havent though everybody even plums thinks ive been cuttin a terrible swath of course when that advertisement come out i had to run away else theyd carried me to jail  to jail aunt dorcas repeated in horror what advertisement do you mean joseph  the one that was in the paper bout payin anybody whod tell where i was  but who wanted to know where you were  the lawyers of coursethe fellers that advertised  why did they want to find you aunt dorcas asked in perplexity  thats what knocks me silly cause i dont know a thing about it any moren you do  did you say the advertisement knocked you silly joseph and the little woman now looked thoroughly bewildered  course it did an it would have paralysed most anybody that didnt know what theyd been about  joseph im afraid i dont understand you it is a printed advertisement you are telling me about isnt it  of course i saw the first one in the herald an  i thought you said some one had dealt you a blow tell me what there was in the advertisement  joe repeated the words almost verbatim and then told aunt dorcas all the details of the flight up to the moment they arrived at her home  regarding the threats made by the amateur detective he remained silent because of the promise to dan  there must be some terrible mistake about it all joseph if you havent committed a crime and i feel certain you couldnt have done such a thing then it is some other boy these lawyers are hunting for  theres no such good luck as that aunt dorcas i dont believe theres another feller in town named joseph potter whos been sellin newspapers an then went into the fruit business you see thats me to a dot an now plums an dan are in the scrape because they helped me away just as likely as not dan will come here tomorrow to ask you to take him in too an ive made up my mind that the princess an i have got to leave were goin away about noon aunt dorcas an some time ill be back to pay you for bein so good to us  the little woman looked at joe for an instant as if not understanding what he had said and repeated  going away  yes aunt dorcas weve got to even if you was willin we should stay after what ive told you i wouldnt agree to hang round livin on you while there are two other fellers doin the same thing  aunt dorcas gazed at joe steadily during several seconds and then said in a decided tone  i dont understand what you have tried to tell me but it is certain joseph potter that you shant leave my house while you are wounded so seriously  i aint wounded aunt dorcas an im as well able to go this minute as i was when i came  it doesnt make any difference whether you are or not i shant allow you to step your foot off of these premises until i know more about this affair it is all a mistake from beginning to end there can be no question of that and ill get at the bottom of it before we are very much older now go straight to bed and mind what i told you about getting up in the morning  aunt dorcas pulled the bandages apart sufficiently to admit of her kissing joe on the lips and then putting the lamp in his hand she led him to the stairway  youre an awful good woman aunt dorcas an some day ill be able to do more than tell you so  good night my boy put this matter entirely out of your mind and go to sleep  when joe gained the chamber once more it was as if a great weight had been lifted from his heart  the confession which caused him so much anxiety had been made and instead of reproaching him for having come to her home aunt dorcas was the same kindly christianlike woman as when he first saw her  master plummer who had slept peacefully during all the adventures of the night was disturbed by the light of the lamp as it shone full in his face and opening his eyes he said petulantly  what are you doin he ceased speaking suddenly as he saw his friends bandaged face and cried in something very like alarm whawhawhats happened to you  there was a burglar in the house an i tackled him  this was sufficient to bring master plummer to a sitting posture at once and he demanded to be told all the particulars  joe began to comply with his friends request but was interrupted by the voice of aunt dorcas from the room below  george dont you allow joseph to say a single word tonight he must be kept perfectly quiet or no one can say what may be the result of his terrible wounds go to sleep immediately both of you and tomorrow morning ill do the talking if joseph isnt strong enough  go on an tell me all about it plums whispered she wont hear if we talk low  ill do jest exactly as aunt dorcas told me even if she said i was to stand on my head for half an hour a feller who wouldnt mind what she tells him aint fit to live and joe got into bed refusing to so much as speak when plums plied him with questions  although he had made light of his wounds when talking to aunt dorcas they gave him no slight amount of pain and this together with his anxiety of mind would seem to have been sufficient to keep his eyes open until morning yet within a very short time he was sleeping as peacefully as if attorneys and burglars had never been known in this world  not until aunt dorcas tapped gently on the door next morning did either of the boys awaken and then joe would have leaped out of bed immediately after answering her summons but for the words  youre not to get up joseph until i am positive you are out of danger  joe laughed aloud in the gladness of his heart such solicitude for his welfare was something he had never known before and it seemed very sweet to him  let me get up aunt dorcas an if i dont show you im all right ill come straight back to bed theres no need of my layin here cause im sound as a nut  the little woman hesitated but finally gave the desired permission and when joe was in the kitchen once more she insisted on removing the bandages to examine the wounds before even so much as allowing master plummer to partake of the breakfast already prepared  to joe and plums who were accustomed to such injuries there appeared to be no reason why the bandages should be replaced but aunt dorcas who could be as firm as she usually was gentle when occasion required insisted upon obedience and once more joes face was enveloped in white cloth until he presented a most comical appearance  then aunt dorcas brought the princess downstairs and the little maid not recognising her young guardian positively refused to speak to him but nestled close by the little womans side until joe by dint of much coaxing and bribing persuaded her to accept him as a new if not an old acquaintance  when the meal was brought to an end and before the breakfast dishes were cleared away aunt dorcas referred to the confession of the previous night by saying  ive been thinking over what you told me joseph and verily believe i should have awakened you before daylight this morning to ask a few questions if you had not been in such a serious condition you have no objection to my speaking about the matter before george  of course not aunt dorcas he knows the whole thing as well as i do except he believes i must have done something pretty tough  you should never think evil of any person george no matter how much appearances are against him  well if joe didnt do anything what are these lawyers offerin to give a whole hundred dollars to catch one of us for  that is what i hope to find out there is something in connection with the matter which you boys have failed to explain that will make it all very simple have either of you a copy of that advertisement  no aunt dorcas i wasnt achin to lug such a thing as that round with me  does it still appear in the papers  it did yesterday mornin cause dan showed it to me an his name and plumss were longside of mine  then george must go to weehawken and buy one of those papers  master plummer looked up in dismay a sixmile walk was to him such exercise as amounted almost to torture and he said petulantly  what good will it do for you to read it in the paper when we can tell you every word  indeed i dont know but there must be something which you have failed to remember  truly there isnt aunt dorcas i said over the words jest as they was printed cause id be sure to remember a thing like that joe replied  i am set when i make up my mind as all old maids are the little woman said grimly and it seems to me absolutely necessary i should see that advertisement now if george thinks he cannot walk to weehawken i must go myself  indeed you mustnt aunt dorcas and joe spoke in a tone of authority such as he had never before used theres nothin to prevent my walkin a dozen miles if anything is to be gained by it an ill start this very minute  to such a proposition as this aunt dorcas positively refused to listen she was certain joes wounds were of such serious nature that violent exercise might be fatal to him and master plummer began to fear he would be forced to take that long walk when there was no real necessity for so doing until a happy thought came to him and he cried animatedly  theres no need for anybody to go to weehawken cause dan fernald must have that paper he showed to joe in his pocket now  where is he aunt dorcas asked quickly  loafin round here somewhere plums replied he counted on comin here this afternoon to ask if youd let him stop a spell sos the lawyers couldnt catch him he would have come last night but joe hired him to keep away  aunt dorcas looked at master potter inquiringly and the latter said  i promised dan i wouldnt speak a word to you about what he was goin to do but youll know it all when he comes  i didnt promise so theres nothing to keep me from tellin master plummer cried and before his friend could prevent him he had added joe thought it was playin too steep on you for dan to come when you had him an me an the princess so he gave him seventyfive cents to keep away till three oclock this afternoon he counted on goin off with the kid before then  aunt dorcas did not appear to fully understand this explanation but her impatience to see the advertisement was so great that she evidently could not wait to ask further concerning the matter  can you find dan fernald now and she turned to plums  well i guess it wouldnt take very long cause hes somewhere close round  go out this minute george and hunt for him  hell count on stoppin once he gets in here plums said warningly  if the poor boy hasnt any home and is hidin here in the country for the same reason you are i will give him a shelter so long as may be necessary  but you see aunt dorcas you cant afford to jam this house full of boys what have got into a scrape joe cried im willin to go away sos to give dan the chance but i wont hang round here when theres a whole crowd  you will remain exactly where you are joseph potter until this matter is settled so dont let me hear anything more of that kind george go directly and find your friend  the boys did not dare oppose aunt dorcas when she spoke in such a tone and although plums was not inclined to do even so much as go in search of dan when he might be resting quietly in the house he obeyed     chapter xiv  a ray of light   the amateur detective was a boy who had but little faith in the honesty of his fellows perhaps because he himself could not be trusted implicitly and even though joe potter had solemnly promised he would say nothing in his disfavour dan entertained grave suspicions that the little woman was being prejudiced against him  therefore it was he had been loitering near the cottage since early morning in the hope of gaining speech with plums and when that young gentleman finally appeared master fernald came out from his hidingplace amid a clump of bushes  whats up now he cried suspiciously  youre to come right in an see aunt dorcas plums replied with no little show of excitement  whats wrong has joe been tellin her not to take me in  look here dan i may not like his threatenin to leave cause you was comin an perhaps i said a good many hard things against him when i talked with you yesterday but i wont let anybody accuse him of lyin when joe promised not to tell aunt dorcas anything bout you he meant to keep his word an hell do it i told her hed paid you seventyfive cents to stay away till this afternoon  what did you do that for are you turnin sneak plums cause if you are ill break your jaw  perhaps you could do it but i aint so certain anyway i told the story cause joe gave the advertisement business dead away last night when he got thumped  did he have a row  he tackled a burglar an got the best of him thats what joe potter did a feller has got nerve whatll jump on to a man in the dark an dont you make any mistake  was there a real burglar in the house dan asked incredulously  course there was an joe knocked him silly the feller come in through the kitchen window an  id made up my mind that most everybody knew i was out here on your case the amateur detective said as if speaking to himself and plums asked in surprise  whats that got to do with it  nothin only it shows that some folks dont know it else the burglar neverd dared to show his nose round here  cause hed be afraid of you  he wouldnt run the risk of my gettin on his trail master fernald replied with dignity and plums could not repress a smile for he had already begun to question his friends detective ability  dan pretended not to see this evidence of incredulity for it did not suit his purpose to have hard words with plums now when he was as he believed about to become his roommate  see here youve got to come right up to the house cause aunt dorcas wants to see that paper master plummer cried as if but just reminded of his mission  what for  she wants to read the advertisement  oh she does eh well if the old woman is willin to promise that i can come here to live ill let her take the paper thats the only way shell get it  plums looked at his friend as if believing he had not heard him aright  i mean what i say ive got the chance now to have things my way in spite of all joe potter may do go up an tell her so if she agrees whistle an ill be there before she can wink  come with me an tell her yourself i wont carry a message like that to aunt dorcas plums replied indignantly  all right then she can go without the paper it dont make any difference to me  she wont go without it cause one of us will walk over to weehawken an perhaps that would be cheaper for her than to feed you  the amateur detective began to understand that he was not exactly in a position to drive a very hard bargain although confident the possession of the paper would give him the home he desired therefore instead of attempting to force plums into acting the part of messenger he said in a tone of condescension  if youre so perky bout it i spose i can go with you though id rather have the thing settled before i flash up  without replying plums turned and began to retrace his steps regretting now that he had spoken harshly to joe concerning this fellow who was displaying such a mean spirit  master fernald followed with the air of one who is master of the situation rehearsing in his mind what he should say when the little woman asked for the paper  the matter was not arranged exactly as he intended it should be  when they arrived at the cottage plums opened the door for him to enter and dan stepped inside with a jaunty air unsuspicious of his companions purpose  aunt dorcas greeted the newcomer kindly but before joe could speak plums standing with his back against the door to prevent the alleged detective from making his escape cried in a loud tone  dans got the paper but says he wont give it up unless aunt dorcas agrees that he shall live here till we get out of the scrape  did you say that dan fernald joe asked mildly and the amateur detective replied with a great show of firmness  thats what i told plums but i didnt mean to spring it on the old woman quite so sudden  do you really mean it  course i do i aint such a fool as to let a chance like this go by me ive got her where she cant help herself now an well see wholl  dan did not conclude the threat for regardless of aunt dorcass presence joe leaped from the table and seized the pretended detective by the throat forcing him back against the wall  with a cry of fear aunt dorcas sprang to her feet and would have gone to dans relief but that plums moving more quickly than he had ever been known to move before stepped directly in front of her as he said imploringly  now dont mix into this row cause it wouldnt be fair i knew pretty well what joe would do after id told him how dan was countin on gettin pay for his paper an if he hadnt gone for the duffer id had to do it myself  but i cant have any quarrelling in this house why george id rather never see a paper in my life than to have a rightdown fight here  there wont be any fight aunt dorcas plums said with a smile cause joe will chew him all up before he can wink  brief as this conversation had been before it came to an end there was no longer any employment for a peacemaker  joe had shaken the amateur detective until he was glad to give up the worthless newspaper and before aunt dorcas could step past plums master fernald was literally thrown out of the kitchen door  ill have every perliceman in new york city here before youre an hour older he screamed shaking his fist in impotent wrath when he was at a safe distance  go ahead an do what you can an when its all over ill finish servin you out for talkin as you did to aunt dorcas joe replied after which he closed the door and resumed his seat at the table as if nothing unusual had occurred  now you can see the advertisement plums said as he handed the paper to the little woman but she hesitated about taking it  it seems as if we had robbed that poor boy she said in distress i do wish joseph that you hadnt been so hasty  now dont fret over the sneak aunt dorcas cause he aint worth it robbed him of nothin what was the paper good for to him yet he counted on makin you do as he said for the sake of gettin it  last night i wanted him to come here an thought joe was kind er hard when he wouldnt gree to it but ill take all that back now dan fernalds the meanest kind of a sneak and master plummer realising he was indulging in too much exercise by thus allowing himself to be angry sank into a chair as if exhausted  it is doubtful if aunt dorcas would have taken the paper procured by such a questionable method but for anxiety to read the advertisement which had made of joe an exile as a matter of fact she did not take it until after considerable urging from both the boys and even then only when joe held it so near that it would have been necessary to close her eyes in order to prevent herself from seeing the printed lines  illustration joe and dan disagree  the princess who had been frightened into silence by joes attack on dan crept into aunt dorcass lap and sitting directly opposite the two boys watched the little womans face intently as she read the fateful lines  it seemed to them as if she had kept her eyes fixed upon that particular portion of the paper fully fifteen minutes before a look of relief came over her face and she asked suddenly  did you tell me the princesss parents were dead  oh no i said shed lost em joe replied  i understood you found her in the street  an thats true i was up by the grand central depot lookin for a job to carry baggage when she came along an i waited there till pretty nigh dark without seem anybody that belonged to her we went to plumss shanty an stayed all night i was countin on findin her folks in the mornin when dan fernald come up an showed this advertisement then of course we had to skip an you know the rest except that im goin back as quick as ever i can to hunt em up  did any one near the station know you had found a little girl aunt dorcas asked now looking really cheerful  nobody that i knew except plums joe replied and added an instant later yes there was id forgot bout that feller who works in the fruit store pretty near the depot he saw me when i was luggin her down to plumss shanty an almost knocked us over  aunt dorcas looked straight up at the ceiling for as many as two minutes and then said abruptly as if having decided upon some course of action  george i want you to go right over to mr mcarthurs and tell him that i must be carried to the ferry at once be sure you say at once very emphatically because i want him to understand that my business admits of no delay otherwise he will be putting me off with all manner of excuses now go immediately dont sit there looking at me and aunt dorcas spoke so sharply that both the boys were amazed  the little woman putting the princess down from her lap began to clear away the breakfast dishes but stopped before the work was well begun as she said  why do i spend my time on such trifling matters when it is so necessary i get into the city at once havent you gone yet george  say aunt dorcas how do you spose i know where mr mcarthur lives  you should know he is our nextdoor neighbour the first house on the right just above here now dont loiter george for i am in a great hurry  master plummer looking thoroughly bewildered went out of the house almost rapidly and aunt dorcas said to joe  of course i am depending upon you to take care of the princess and when she goes to sleep this noon perhaps you can put these soiled dishes into the sink i havent the time now because i must change my clothes  are you goin into the city to try to help us out of the scrape  of course i am and it can be done i knew there was some mistake about it all when you told me the story but i havent time to talk with you now joseph you will find food enough in the pantry in case i am not back by dinnertime and see to it that the princess doesnt go hungry i am depending upon your keeping things in proper order while im away  before the astonished boy could ask any further questions aunt dorcas had actually run up the stairs and the princess immediately raised a wail of sorrow at being separated from her particular friend thereby forcing joe to devote all his attention to her for the time being  before aunt dorcas had completed her preparations for the journey joe succeeded in inducing the little maid to walk outofdoors with him and they were but a short distance from the house down the lane when plums returned with mr mcarthur  the worthy farmer alarmed by a peremptory message from a neighbour who had never before been known to give an order save in the form of the mildest request had harnessed his horse with all possible despatch and was looking seriously disturbed in mind when he drove up to where joe was standing  i reckon by your looks youre the boy what tackled the burglar last night well you showed clean grit an no mistake can you tell me what the matter is with aunt dorcas this ere friend of yours seems to be all mixed up dont appear to know much of anything  she wants to go to the city sir an to get there quick  there must be some powerful reason behind it all for dorcas milford to send any sich message as this boy brought i allow he mistook her meanin so to speak eh  i didnt mistook anything plums cried indignantly she said to tell you she must be carried to the ferry at once very emphatically an she didnt want you to be puttin her off with any excuses  is that so sonny the farmer asked of joe  i dont think she said it exactly that way an plums wasnt told you shouldnt make any excuses but aunt dorcas wants to go in a hurry i know that much  anybody dead eh  no sir  the burglar didnt get away with anything eh  no sir  before the farmer could ask any more questions aunt dorcas herself appeared on the scene  im glad you came quickly mr mcarthur because im in a great hurry she said nervously dont stop to drive up to the house but turn around right here  the farmer looked at her for a moment and then mildly urging the patient steed on he drove in a circle as wide as the lane would permit saying meanwhile  it seems to me dorcas milford id send some word by telegraph rather than get into sich a pucker i never knowed you to be so kinder flighty as youre appearin now  i shall be a good deal worse mr mcarthur if you dont start very soon aunt dorcas replied in a matteroffact tone which alarmed her neighbour more than a threat from some other person would have done  take good care of the princess dont get crumbs on the floor an be sure to eat all you need aunt dorcas cried as the vehicle was whirled almost rapidly around the corner of the lane into the highway and plums shouted  whenll you be back  i cant say be good boys an ill come as soon as ever its possible  then the little woman had disappeared from view and master plummer turning to his friend asked seriously  do you spose theres anything gone wrong with aunt dorcass head it seems to me she dont act as if she was jest straight  now dont be foolish plums if everybody in this world was as straight as she is us boys would have a snap  but she seems to think she can fix all this else why did she rush off so  if anybody can straighten things out shes the one though i dont see how its goin to be done lets go into the house an do the work i blieve i can wash the dishes without breakin any of em  whats the use to rush round like this im all tired out goin over to mcarthurs an theres no knowin whatll happen if i cant get a chance to rest  now dont be so foolish plums you havent done enough to hurt a kitten since we come here an all ill ask of you is to take care of the princess while im fixin up  with this understanding master plummer agreed to his friends proposal and during the next half hour joe laboured faithfully at the housework while plums amused the princess when it was possible for him to do so without too great an exertion  then it was that the child who had been looking out of the window for a moment clapped her tiny hands and screamed as she pointed towards the orchard thereby causing master plummer to ascertain the cause of the sudden outburst  there goes dan fernald he exclaimed  where  sneakin up through the orchard it looks like he was goin to the barn  hes on some of his detective sprees i spose that feller can make an awful fool of hisself without tryin very hard and joe would have gone back to his work but that plums prevented him by saying  he aint sneakin round there for any good it would be different if he thought we was in the garden i wouldnt be fraid to bet he was where he could see aunt dorcas when she went away an is countin on makin it hot for us  illustration come on quick plums dans set the barn afire  it would be a sore job for him if he did look out for the princess an ill snoop round to see what hes doin  joe went through the shed door which led out of the garden but could see no one if the amateur detective had not gone inside the barn he must be loitering at the further end where he was screened from view of any one on either side the building  if i go round there hell think its because im fraid hell make trouble for us an thats what would please him joe said to himself  then passing through the shed he looked out of the door on the opposite side  no one could be seen from this point and he returned to the garden just as dan came out from around the corner of the barn running at full speed towards a grove situated a mile or more from the main road  what have you been doin round here joe shouted angrily and the amateur detective halted long enough to say  you think youre mighty smart joe potter but youll find there are some folks that can give you points what ive done to you this time aint a marker longside of what itll be when i try my hand again  then master fernald resumed his flight much to joes surprise and halted not until he was within the friendly shelter of the trees  now i wonder what he meant by all that talk it seems like he was more of a fool this mornin than i ever knew him to be before  at that moment joe saw or fancied he saw a tiny curl of blue vapour rising from the corner of the barn and as he stood gazing in that direction uncertain whether his eyes might not have deceived him another puff of smoke and yet another arose slowly in the air telling unmistakably of what master fernald had done  joe darted into the house and seized the waterpail as he cried excitedly  come on quick plums dans set the barn afire get anything that you can carry water in and hump yourself lively  but whatll i do with the princess master plummer asked helplessly  shell have to take care of herself joe cried as he ran at full speed towards the smoke which was now rising in small clouds giving token of flames which might soon reduce aunt dorcass little home to ashes     chapter xv  an unexpected arrival   it was really the princess who saved aunt dorcass home from destruction had she not seen dan fernald as he made his way through the orchard the barn would most likely have been in a blaze before joe or plums were aware of the fact  thanks to her warning joe saw the smoke before the fire gathered headway and when he arrived on the scene the flames had but just fastened upon the side of the barn  plums aroused to something like activity by the knowledge of danger followed joe with remarkable promptness and the amount of water thus brought by both was sufficient to extinguish what a few moments later would have been a conflagration  not until he had pulled the charred sticks from beneath the end of the barn and assured himself every spark had been drowned out did joe speak and then it was to relieve his mind by making threats against the wouldbe incendiary  its all well enough for a woman like aunt dorcas to tell about doin good to them what tries to hurt you for she couldnt so much as put up her hands if you keep on forgivin duffers like dan fernald youre bound to be in such scrapes as this all the time what he needed was a sound thumpin when he begun talkin so rough to aunt dorcas then he wouldnt dared to try a game of this kind when i get hold of him again ill make up for lost time  ill bet hes somewhere round here watchin out an when he sees this game didnt work hell try somethin else  not much he wont i know pretty near where he is an im goin to make him  at this moment the voice of the princess could be heard in vehement protest against thus being left alone and joe was forced to defer his punishment of the amateur detective until a more convenient season  stay here plums an watch for dan while i go and get the princess he went among them trees over there sos to have a reserved seat while the house was burnin but hes got to come out some time  dont stay away too long for i aint certain as id dare to tackle him aloneyou see im too fat to be much of a fighter  a certain quaver in plumss voice told that he was afraid to be alone even while dan was a long distance away and joe thought it extremely comical that any one should fear the amateur detective  the princess did not object to taking a walk fortunately for master plummers peace of mind and in a short time the three were patrolling the grounds joe carrying the little maid whenever she insisted upon such service  at noonday a certain amount of food was brought out on the lawn in front of the house and even while the boys ate they continued their selfimposed duty of guarding the premises  then the princess wanted to sleep and joe sat by her side while plums kept watch from the windows or walked rapidly around the buildings  so far as dan was concerned they might as well have amused themselves according to their own fancies for he never showed himself after having sought refuge in the grove  when the excitement consequent upon the attempt to destroy aunt dorcass home had subsided in a measure the boys began to speculate upon the reasons for the little womans hurried departure but could arrive at no satisfactory conclusion as to what it might be she hoped to accomplish  of course she could do a pile of beggin off for a feller cause anybody would have to listen to her but when the lawyers are willin to pay a hundred dollars for either one of us three i dont believe she can do very much by talkin joe said reflectively as he summed up the situation according to his belief i expect shell be terribly disappointed when we see her again cause she counts on straightenin things out in a jiffy  do you spose dan fernald will hang round here till he gets a chance to do her some mischief  as soon as aunt dorcas gets back im goin to skirmish through them trees an if hes there it wont take moren three minutes to make him sick of this part of the country  the boys were yet discussing what should be done to dan to prevent him from attempting to work more mischief when a covered carriage drawn by two horses whose harness was resplendent with silver and driven by a coachman in livery turned from the highway into the lane leading to the cottage  hi joe plums cried excitedly see the swells what are comin to visit aunt dorcas  they want to ask the way somewhere an seeins we couldnt even tell em where the postoffice is i guess wed better keep kind er shady now the princess is awake well have to show ourselves cause shes bound to make a noise joe added as the little maid clambered upon his knee  im goinsay aunt dorcas herself is in that funny rig  what are you givin me and joe leaned forward eagerly in order to have a better view  its her dead sure there look at that what do you think now  it was indeed as master plummer had said  aunt dorcas was getting out of the carriage assisted by a gentleman who spoke to the driver in such a manner as one would expect from the owner of the equipage and immediately behind the little woman could be seen a younger lady  i wonder if aunt dorcas thinks them swells would help two chumps like us out of our scrape joe exclaimed if she does her head aint  papa papa the princess screamed in delight as she pounded on the window with her tiny fists and instantly the gentleman left aunt dorcas to alight from the vehicle as best she could while he ran at full speed up the sharp ascent to the house  ill be blowed if aunt dorcas hasnt found the princesss folks joe cried as an expression of bewilderment came over his face that dude is comin in an wed best leave  followed by plums joe ran out of the kitchen door just as the gentleman came through the main entrance of the cottage and the boys heard a wild scream of delight from the princess  master potter threw himself face downward on the grass near the garden and plums seated himself by his comrades side asking again and again how it was aunt dorcas had so readily found the princesss parents  when we first come here i didnt think she mounted to very much cause she was so little an kind er dried up then when she struck out so heavy prayin i begun to think there might be more to her than id counted on but nowwhy joe little as she is aunt dorcas has done moren all the cops in town put together when we told her the princess had lost her folks what does she do but go right out and hunt em up an dont look as though shed turned a hair doin it  joe made no reply  didnt she hump herself when we showed her that advertisement she was jest like a terrier after a rat an bossed me round till as trues you live i run moren half the way over to mr mcarthurs then how she jumped on him when he begun to ask questions if i only had somebody like aunt dorcas to look out for me i wouldnt have to work so hard  joe remained silent but plums was so intent on singing aunt dorcass praises that he failed to pay any especial attention to the fact that his comrade had not spoken since they knew the princesss parents had arrived  joseph george  here we are aunt dorcas plums replied  come into the house this very minute both of you  come on joe i spose weve got to go the dude wants to thank us for lookin after the princess  you can go i shant joe said with difficulty as if he were choking and plums gazed at him in surprise  joseph george where are you  out here by the garden aunt dorcas joe wont come in  go on by yourself an leave me alone master potter said angrily still keeping his face hidden from view  it cant do any hurt to have one look at the dudes an seeins how theres nothin else goin on i guess ill take the show in  then master plummer sauntered leisurely towards the cottage and joe believing himself alone began to sob as if his heart were breaking  he failed to hear aunt dorcas as she came swiftly out through the shed door and kneeled by his side not until she spoke did he think there was a witness to his grief  illustration joe believing himself alone began to sob as if his heart were breaking  josey my poor boy are you grieving because essies parents have found her at last  joe tried to speak but could not and the little woman continued  you should rejoice because the sufferings of that poor father and mother are at an end try to imagine their distress when the dear child was missing and they could not know whether she was alive or dead think of them as they pictured her alone in the streets wandering around until exhausted or falling into the hands of wicked people who would abuse her fancy what their sufferings must have been as compared with yours when you know that she will receive even better treatment than we could give her it is wicked josey my boy to grieve so sorely for a mothers heart has been lightened of all the terrible load which has been upon it for so many days  then aunt dorcas patted the small portion of cheek which was exposed to view between the bandages and in many a loving way soothed the sorrowing boy until he suddenly sat bolt upright wiping both eyes with the sleeve of his coat as he said stoutly  im a bloomin idjut aunt dorcas thats what i am an if youd turn to an kick me id be served nearer right than by havin you pity me  youre very far removed from an idiot joseph and i am glad to know your heart is still so tender that you can feel badly at the loss of a dear little child like essieesther is her name now josey dear dont you want to know why those lawyers tried to find you  have you been to see them too joe cried in surprise  yes indeed dear in the paper you took from dan fernald was another advertisement directly below the one referring to you and it was concerning a little child who had been lost in the vicinity of the grand central station the same names were signed to it and on seeing that i believed i understood why so much money would be paid for information concerning you  i spose its all straight enough aunt dorcas but i cant seem to make out what you mean  nothing can be plainer my child little essie was left in charge of a nurse at the station and when the foolish woman missed the baby instead of making immediate inquiries she spent her time fainting not until nearly eight oclock that evening did the poor mother learn of her terrible loss and then detectives were sent out at once the boy at the fruit store on being questioned as was every one else in that vicinity described the baby he saw in your arms and told the officers your name you had disappeared and the only thing left was to offer a reward for information as to your whereabouts  then they didnt think id done anything crooked  if by that you mean wrong they didnt it was the only clew they had to the child but on the following day it was learned you had been seen with george and then his name appeared in the advertisement after that some of the newsboys from around city hall square brought word that dan fernald was with you and a reward was also offered for knowledge of his whereabouts you see josey dear if mr raymondthat is the name of essies fathercould find either of you three boys he was reasonably certain of getting news regarding his baby  then i ran away from nothing did i  yes josey dear you did what many older persons than you have done and what gods book tells us the wicked dofled when no man was pursuing  well i have been a chump  do you mean that youve been foolish  i spose thats what youd call it im a reglar jay from jayville an yesterday mornin i let that bloomin imitation detective scare me  those wiser than you might have misconstrued that advertisement joseph but this shall teach you that there is nothing to fear when your conscience is clear meet trouble halfway and it dwindles into mere vexation now dear i want you to come into the house with me and meet mr and mrs raymond they know how kind you have been to essie and wish to thank you  well they cant thank me for takin care of the princess an i only wish shed never had a father and a mother for then i could have kept her all the time  wont you come to please me dear and aunt dorcas laid her hand on the boys arm affectionately  when you put it that way ill have to go and joe rose slowly to his feet  of course you want to see essie before she leaves  are they goin to take her right away  certainly joseph do you fancy that poor mother could go away without her  joe made no reply and linking her arm in his aunt dorcas led him in through the shed but before they had reached the cottage plums came towards them at an unusually rapid rate of speed crying excitedly  the dudes have gone aunt dorcas theyve gone and that very same swell carriage is comin here tomorrow mornin to take me an joe an you into the city to see the princess  gone aunt dorcas exclaimed in surprise  yes i told em joe was kind er grumpy cause princess was goin away an the boss said perhaps it would be better if they took a sneak he left a letter in the front room for youwrote it on a card he got out of his pocket  it was plain to be seen from the expression on aunt dorcass face that she was disappointed but she repressed her own feelings to say to joe  perhaps it is the best way dear for it would have caused you still more sorrow to say goodbye to essie now you will have time to grow accustomed to the loss before you see her again  plums was in such a state of delirious excitement owing to the fact that he was to reënter new york like a reglar swell that it seemed impossible for him to behave in a proper fashion  he danced to and fro as if active movement was his greatest delight and insisted on bringing to aunt dorcas the card which mr raymond had left even while she was making her way as rapidly as possible to the front room  the message to the little woman read as follows       my dear miss milford i understand that the lad who has been      so kind to essie does not wish to see her just at present      therefore perhaps it is better we go at once and without      ceremony will you yet further oblige me by coming to my      house tomorrow the carriage shall be here about ten      oclock very sincerely yours                                    edward raymond  there is no reason why we shouldnt go dear aunt dorcas asked joe after reading the message aloud  theres dan fernald cuttin across the orchard down towards the road nows our time to catch him plums shouted before joe could reply to aunt dorcass kindly words and in another instant the two boys were in hot pursuit  aunt dorcas believing they were trying to catch the amateur detective in order to punish him for what had been said during the morning cried shrilly for them to come back but her words were unheeded because unheard  master fernald was not in condition for a race owing to his having travelled to and fro a goodly portion of the day in search of revenge and the chase was soon ended  in attempting to climb over the orchard fence into the road he tripped fell and before it was possible to rise again joe was on his back  ill have the law on you if you dare to strike me dan cried in accents of terror and joe replied disdainfully  dont be afraid you bloomin duffer i aint goin to hurt you now cause i feel too good im only countin on showin what kind of a detective you are an tellin whatll happen if you hang round here an hour longer  im goin to new york an have the perlice on your trail before dark tonight dan cried speaking indistinctly because of joes grasp upon his throat  im willin you should do that jest as soons you get ready it wont bother me a little bit cause aunt dorcas told the story this mornin an the man what put the advertisement in the papers has been out here now you listen to me dan fernald and perhaps after this youll give over your funny detective business all them lawyers wanted of me was to find out where the princess was an if instead of runnin away id flashed myself up on pine street there wouldnt have been any trouble i oughter black both your eyes for tryin to set fire to aunt dorcass barn but somehow i cant do it cause she dont like to have fellers fight now you can get into new york an fetch your perlice  joe released his hold of master fernald but the latter was so astonished by the information given that he made no effort to rise  is all that true or are you foolin me he asked after a time  say the best thing you can do is to come up an talk with aunt dorcas it would do you a heap of good dan an come to think of it youve got to go  master fernald was not as eager to visit the cottage now as he had been for he understood that joe was speaking the truth and the prospect of meeting the little woman after all he had said and attempted to do was not pleasing  dont let up on him plums cried vindictively hes to blame for this whole racket an oughter be served out a good deal worsen aunt dorcas will serve him  dan struggled manfully but all to no purpose his late friends were determined he should visit the woman he had intended to wrong and half dragged half carried him up the lane until they were met by aunt dorcas herself who sternly asked why they were illtreating a boy smaller than themselves  its dan fernald aunt dorcas plums said as if in surprise that she should have interfered its the same feller what wasnt goin to show you the paper till youd greed to board him the balance of the summer an in less than a half an hour after you went away he set the barn afire we thought it would do him a heap of good to talk with you a spell  let him alone children if he doesnt wish to speak with me you must not try to force him suppose you two go into the garden a little while and leave us alone  this did not please plums for he had anticipated hearing the little woman read master fernald a lecture but he could do no less than act upon the suggestion and as the two went slowly towards the barn master plummer said regretfully  its too bad we couldnt hear what she had to say after i told her about his settin the barn afire  look here plums youd been disappointed if shed let you listen she aint the kind of a woman that would rave an scold an tear round but when she gets through with dan fernald hell feel a mighty sight worse than if shed knocked his two eyes into one     chapter xvi  the reward   the conversation did not lag during the two hours or more the boys remained near about the garden waiting for aunt dorcas to summon them after the interview with the amateur detective should have come to an end  now that there was no longer any mystery concerning the advertisement it seemed strange they had not understood why the attorneys wished to see joe  we must be awful chumps to let dan fernald frighten us as he did joe said thoughtfully after they had discussed the matter in all its different phases why we didnt see that it was the princess they was after beats me perhaps it might have come round to it if id been alone but that imitation detective seemed to have it down so fine that i didnt stop to think of anything but what he said  anyhow he did us a good turn cause if we hadnt skipped wed never found out there was a woman like aunt dorcas  thats a fact plums an come to look at it that way i aint so certain but we oughter let up on the duffer say itll be mighty tough to go back an live in that shanty of yourn after bein out here wont it  do you spose weve got to leave this place and master plummer looked alarmed  course we have you dont count on spongin a livin out of a poor little woman like aunt dorcas i hope  i wouldnt reglarly do her up for my board but i was thinkin perhaps shed have work enough sos we could pay our way you come pretty near squarin things when you tackled the burglar  i didnt do so much as a fleabite if aunt dorcas had been alone an heard the man sneakin round shed been prayin with him in lessn five minutes an hed gone away a good deal more sore than he did  i guess thats straight enough plums replied with a sigh for as it was thus proven that the little woman did not stand in need of their services his heart grew sad  she can take care of herself you bet an come up bright an smilin every time weve got to go back tomorrow plums an hustle for fivecent stews  i dont want any more of it after knowin how aunt dorcas can cook are you goin into the paper business agin  i guess ill have to after i pick up enough cash to start in with ill tackle the depot for that job was pannin out mighty well till i found the princess joe replied and then he relapsed into silence for the thought that the child was no longer dependent upon him brought more sorrow to his heart than had come to plums because of being forced to go to work again  then came the summons for which the boys had been waiting and when they entered the house expecting to find aunt dorcas alone a disagreeable surprise awaited them  the amateur detective was in the kitchen regaling himself with a quarter section of custard pie while the little woman fluttered to and fro between the table and the pantry as if bent on tempting his appetite to the utmost  dan will stay here till morning she said cheerily as the boys entered and then well take him to the ferry in mr raymonds carriage  are you goin to keep him after he set the barn afire joe asked in surprise as he shook his fist at the amateur detective while aunt dorcass back was turned  he didnt really intend to do me an injury and feels sorry because of harbouring such revengeful thoughts  at that instant aunt dorcas saw master plummer making threatening gestures which were replied to vigorously by dan and she added quickly  i want you boys to be firm friends from this day all three have made a mistake but there will be no evil result from it unless through your own wilfulness joe try for my sake to be good and treat dan as if there had been no hard feelings  master potter would have been better pleased if aunt dorcas had asked of him something which could only be performed after great suffering and painful endurance but with a slight show of hesitation he approached the amateur detective in what he intended should appear like a friendly manner and said stiffly  ill do what aunt dorcas says though it comes mighty hard after what you threatened yesterday dan were friends now but ill wipe the floor up with you if you dont walk pretty near straight  the little woman was not particularly well pleased at this evidence of friendliness but she professed to be satisfied and the three boys glared at each other like so many pugnacious cats until the evening devotions were begun  then aunt dorcas read with great fervour the first chapter of the sermon on the mount and afterwards prayed so earnestly for those within her gates that joe resolved then and there to treat dan as he had done before the princess was foundat least during such time as the amateur detective behaved himself in what he considered a proper manner  joseph and george are to sleep in the spareroom tonight and daniel will occupy the chamber over the kitchen aunt dorcas announced when the devotions were brought to a close  did you take off the best sheets master potter asked  of course not joseph  why dont you do it plums an me would be snug enough if there wasnt any clothes at all on the bed  we will leave it as it is dear perhaps i was wrong in not letting you occupy it before  how could that be joe asked in astonishment  i have allowed myself to be proud of the chamber and the book particularly warns us against pride it is better that i accustom myself to seeing it used  when joe and plums were in the spareroom that night neither daring to stretch out at full length lest he should soil the sheets more than was absolutely necessary master potter whispered confidentially to his friend  aunt dorcas is a mighty good woman plums but cordin to my way of thinkin shes makin a pile of trouble for herself  how  some day a reglar duffer like dan fernald will come along an then shell get taken in mighty bad  seems almost as if we oughter stay here an take care of her dont it  theres no sense thinkin anything like that plums this is our last night in a firstclass bed an from tomorrow mornin weve got to hustle jest the same as if wed never had it so rich  then joe fell asleep to dream of the princess and until aunt dorcas awakened him next morning it was as if nothing had occurred to depose him from the position of guardian  there was work enough for all three of the guests in the milford cottage after breakfast had been served  the little woman was preparing for her visit to the city as if she expected to be absent from home several days instead of only a few hours and the boys were called upon to assist in the household duties although it is quite probable they were more of a hindrance than a help  dan was doing his best at washing the kitchen floor joe was trimming the lamps and plums piling up wood in the shed when the raymond carriage rumbled up the lane causing the utmost confusion and dismay among aunt dorcass assistants  because of having been kept thus steadily employed the time had passed wonderfully quick and until each in turn had looked at the clock it was impossible to realise that the coachman had not arrived long in advance of the hour set  even the little woman herself was unprepared for so early a coming of the carriage and during the ensuing ten minutes the utmost confusion reigned  then aunt dorcas and her family were ready for the ride and plums said with an air of content as he leaned against the wonderful cushions of the front seat  were a set of sporty dudes now an i only hope that feller wont drive very fast cause we shouldnt have any too long to stay in this rig even if he walked the horses every step of the way say this is great aint it  dan made no remark during the ride but it was evident he enjoyed himself quite as well as did any other member of the party and when the carriage was on the new york side of the river master fernald looked with undisguised envy at his companions as he said to aunt dorcas  i spose ive got to get out now eh  yes daniel for we are going directly to mr raymonds home and could not take you there come to see me some time and remember what you have promised about being a good boy  ill keep as straight as i can master fernald replied and then he glanced at the boys as if doubtful whether he ought to bid them goodbye  perhaps joe would have said no word in parting but for the gentle pressure of aunt dorcass hand on his he understood from it what the little woman would have him do and leaning forward said in a kindly tone  well see you later dan plums an i wont be swellin much longer but will be at work by this time tomorrow  then master plummer did his part by adding  well let up on the detective business eh dan an settle down to reglar work as soon as this swellin is over  the coachman gave rein to the horses and dan fernald was soon left far in the rear                                       on the afternoon of this same day when the rush for evening papers had subsided and the merchants of newspaper row were resting from their labours as they listened to dan fernalds story of his adventures plums suddenly appeared looking remarkably well pleased with himself and the world in general  illustration then aunt dorcas and her family were ready for the ride  hello we thought you was settin round uptown with the rest of the dudes dan says you come down from the country in a swell turnout jerry hayes cried with something very like envy in his tones  dan couldnt laid it on any too thick for weve been humpin ourselves in great style master plummer replied with an air of satisfaction  did you really go into the dudes house  yes an whats more we eat dinner there say boys mcgowans restaurant aint in it alongside of what we struck up at the princesss house there was more stuff on the table than this crowd could have got away withan talk bout silver dishes i never had any such time before an i thought aunt dorcas run a pretty fine place  wheres joe potter  up there actin like he owned the town  do you mean that hes stoppin with the dude all this time jerry asked incredulously  yes an that aint the worst of it hes likely to hang round the place quite a spell say there was a thousand dollars reward to whoever found the princess an her father says joe was to have it  what a thousand dollars go off plums youre dreamin  youll find out whether i am or not when you see joe say i spose you think hell come round sellin papers again dont you well he wont hes goin to work down on wall street for the princesss father an him an me are to live with aunt dorcas from now out hell come into town every mornin an ill hang round the place livin high with nothin to do but tend to things  what kind of a stiff are you puttin up on us plums tim morgan asked sternly  its all straight as a string when we got up to the princesss house she jest went wild at seein joe an if youll believe it she set on his knee moren half the time i stayed there her father made us tell all wed done from the minute joe found the kid an then he said a thousand dollars was promised to the feller what would find her of course we didnt spose hed pay the money after givin us a ride in his team an settin up the dinner but he stuck to it like a little man aunt dorcas is to take care of the wealth an seeins how she told him where we fellers was hes to give her what the advertisement promised an thats a hundred dollars apiece for the three of us when all this was fixed the princesss father offered joe a job an hes to have six dollars a week with a raise every year if he minds his eye theyre out buyin clothes now an i slipped down to see you fellers cause were goin back to aunt dorcass house this evenin  master plummers friends were not disposed to believe what he told them until the story had been repeated several times and all the details had been given  then it appeared as if there could be no doubt and each boy vied with the other in his attentions to plums who was now a very desirable acquaintance since it might possibly be in his power to invite them to that cottage of aunt dorcass concerning which dan fernald had given such glowing accounts  illustration mcgowans restaurant aint in it alongside of what we struck up at the princesss house  plums had promised to meet the little woman and joe at the weehawken ferryslip at seven oclock and since at that hour there was no business to be done on newspaper row his friends decided to accompany him to the rendezvous  to the delight of all the boys aunt dorcas and joe arrived in mr raymonds carriage and instantly they appeared the assembled throng set up such a shout of welcome as caused the little woman to grip master potters hand nervously as she cried  mercy on us joseph what is the matter  joe had caught a glimpse of plumss following before the outcry was heard and replied with a laugh  its only a crowd of the fellers come to see us off most likely plums has been tellin em about the good luck that has come to me an they want to give us a sendoff  do try to stop them from making such a noise joseph what will the neighbours think of us  theyll believe youre a howlin swell aunt dorcas an everybody will be wantin to look at you  let us get out as quick as ever we can or the policeman will accuse us of making a disturbance  it was necessary aunt dorcas should remain where she was until the driver had opened the carriage door by that time plumss friends had gathered around the vehicle gazing with openmouthed astonishment at joe who was clad in a new suit of clothes and looked quite like a little gentleman  aunt dorcas was actually trembling as she descended from the carriage joe assisting her in the same manner he had seen mr raymond and the cheers which greeted her did not tend to make the little woman any more comfortable in mind  the princesss father would have sent his carriage the entire distance but for the fact that aunt dorcas preferred to arrive at her home in such a conveyance as could be hired in weehawken  it is more suitable she had said while i enjoyed every inch of the ride this morning i could not help feeling as if we were wearing altogether too fine feathers for working people  plumss friends insisted on crossing the ferry with him and during the passage aunt dorcas was presented to each in turn a proceeding which entirely allayed her fears lest they would create an unseemly disturbance  i know i should come to like every one of them she whispered to joe and before we go ashore you must invite them out to the cottage for a whole day  theyd scare the neighbours aunt dorcas joe said with a laugh and the little woman replied quite sharply  mr mcarthur is the only one who would hear the noise and if i have not complained because his dogs howled around the cottage night after night these twenty years i guess he can stand the strain one day  joe repeated aunt dorcass invitation while the boat was entering the slip and when the little woman went on shore the cheers which came from twenty pairs of stout lungs drowned all other sounds  walk quickly boys she said forced to speak very loud because of the tumult your friends mean well i have no doubt but they are making a perfect spectacle of us  it was not possible for the little woman to walk so rapidly but that she heard distinctly when at some distance from the ferryslip jerry hayess shrill voice as he cried  now fellers give her three more an a tiger for the princess an joe potter  illustration
