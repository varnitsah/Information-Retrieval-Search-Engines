24099118	the big otter by rm ballantyne    chapter one  sleeping in snow  cold comfort is naturally suggested by a bed of snow yet i have enjoyed great comfort and much warmth in such a bed  my friend lumley was particularly fond of warmth and of physical ease yet he often expressed the opinion with much emphasis that there was nothing he enjoyed so much as a night in a snowbed  jack lumley was my chuma fine manly fellow with a vigorous will a hardy frame and a kindly heart  we had a natural leaning towards each othera sort of undefinable sympathywhich inclined us to seek each others company in a quiet unobtrusive way  we were neither of us demonstrative we did not express regard for each other we made no protestations of undying friendship but we drew together somehow especially in our hunting expeditions which were numerous  on holidayswe had two in the week at the outpost in the american backwoods where we dweltwhen the other young fellows were cleaning gulls or arranging snowshoes for the days work lumley was wont to say to me  where dyou intend to shoot today max  max was an abbreviation my real name is george maxby  i think ill go up by the willows and round by beaver creek  ive half a mind to go that way too  come along then  and so we would go off together for the day  one morning lumley said to me im off to north river will you come  with pleasure but well have to camp out  well it wont be the first time  dyou know that the thermometer stood at forty below zero this morning before breakfast  i know it what then  mercurial fellows like you dont freeze easily  i did not condescend to reply but set about preparing for our expedition resolving to carry my largest blanket with me for camping out implied sleeping in the snow  of course i must guard my readersespecially my juvenile readersfrom supposing that it was our purpose that night to undress and calmly lie down in or on the pure white windingsheet in which the frozen world of the great norwest had been at that time wrapped for more than four months  our snowbed like other beds required making but i will postpone the making of it till bedtime  meanwhile let us follow the steps of lumley who being taller and stronger than i always led the way  this leading of the way through the trackless wilderness in snow averaging four feet deep is harder work than one might suppose  it could not be done at all without the aid of snowshoes which varying from three to five feet in length enable the traveller to walk on the surface of the snow into which he would otherwise sink more or less according to its condition  if it be newly fallen and very soft he sinks six eight or more inches  if it be somewhat compressed by time or wind he sinks only an inch or two  on the hard surface of exposed lakes and rivers where it is beaten to the appearance of marble he dispenses with snowshoes altogether slings them on his gun and carries them over his shoulder  our first mile lay through a clump of pinewood where snow had recently fallen  when i looked at my comrades broad back and observed the vigour of his action as he trod deep into the virgin snow at every stride scattering it aside like fine white powder as he lifted each foot i thought how admirably he was fitted for a pioneer in the wilderness or for the work of those dauntless persevering men who go forth to add to the worlds geographical knowledge and to lead the expeditions sent out in search of such lost heroes as franklin and livingstone  my own work was comparatively light  i had merely to tread in the beaten path  i was not however thereby secured from disaster as i found when having advanced about half a mile my right shoe caught a twig to which it held for a moment and then breaking loose allowed me to pitch head down with such violence that i almost reached mother earth four feet below the surface  this kind of plunge is always awkward owing to the difficulty of rising and usually disagreeable owing to the manner in which snow stuffs itself into neck ears nose eyes mouthif openand any convenient crevice of person or garments  the snowshoes too which are so serviceable when you are above them become exasperatingly obstructive when you are below them  after a struggle of two minutes i got my head clear winked the snow out of my eyes blew it from my mouth and nostrils and looked up  lumley was standing there with a bland smile on his amiable face he seldom laughed though he sometimes chuckled  what do you mean by grinning there like a cheshire cat  i exclaimed why dont you lend a hand  what do you mean by tumbling there like a christmas goose he retorted why dont you look out for stumps and twigs as i do  he made some amends for this reply by extending his hand and helping me to rise  in a few minutes we were clear of the pinewood and came out upon a piece of swampland where the stunted willow bushes just showed their tops above the surface of the snow  this led us to a bend of the broad river near to which further down stood our outpostfort dunregan  for four months there had been neither sight nor sound of water in that river  it was frozen to the bottom except in the middle where its dark unseen waters flowed silently under six feet or more of solid ice through many a riverchannel and lake to the distant sea  in fact save for the suggestive form of its banks the river might have been mistaken for an elongated plain or piece of open land  the surface of the snow here was from exposure to wind and sun as hard as pavement  we therefore took off our snowshoes and the necessity for maintaining the indianfile position being removed we walked abreast  the air is keen here remarked lumley pulling the thick shawl that was round his neck as far up over his mouth as his welldeveloped nose would permit  it is said i following his example with greater success my own nose being a snub  there was no wind not even a breezethere seldom is at such temperaturebut there was a very slight movement of the air caused by our own advance which was just sufficient to make one appreciate the intensity of the cold  it became necessary now to pay frequent attention to our noses and cheekbones and toes to prevent frostbite but the sun was brilliant and the air invigorating  so was the aspect of nature for although there was no grandeur in the character of the scenery there was extreme beauty in the snow lacework of the trees and leafless shrubs in the sky whose bright blue was intensified by the white drapery of earth and in the myriads of snowcrystals which reflected the dazzling sun with prismatic splendour  indeed the scene was too dazzling and as there was a tendency in it to produce snowblindness we soon returned to the friendly shelter of the woods  tracks exclaimed lumley in a low voice pointing to the ground where footmarks were clearly visible and fresh he added turning up the snow under the track with the butt of his gun  ptarmigan said i in a whisper pointing towards a little knoll not quite a gunshot ahead of us where some dozens of the beautiful snowwhite creatures stood gazing at us in motionless surprise  their plumage was so white that we had not observed them at first almost the only black specks about them being their sparkling eyes and the tips of their wings and tails  our guns were pointed instantly  i am ashamed to say that we were guilty of shooting them as they stood  in that land we shot for food as much as for amusement and some of us being poor shots we were glad to take our game sitting  nay more we tried to get as many of the birds in line as possible so as to make the most of our ammunition  we were not sportsmen in the civilised sense of that term  the extreme stillness of the woods was broken by the report of our guns in quick succession  a very cloud of pure white birds arose as if nature had taken to snowing upwards in rather large flakes and seven victims remained behind  a good supper remarked lumley as we bagged the game and reloaded  it is not my intention here to describe a days shooting  let it suffice to say that a little before nightfall we arrived at a place where was a snowy mound capped by a clump of spruce firs of small size but picturesque appearance  behold our camp said lumley  not inviting at present said i as we slowly toiled up the mound for we were weary having walked about twenty miles weighted with heavy flannellined deerskincoats blankets and cooking utensils besides a small quantity of pemmican sugar tea and ships biscuit axes and firebags  it is true the cooking utensils were few and simple consisting of only two tin kettles and two tin mugs  dreary indeedlonesome desolate and eerie was our mound when we got to the top of it  by that time the sun had set and a universal ghostly grey fast deepening into night banished every sensation of joy aroused by the previous lightness  although the scene and circumstances were nothing new to us we could not shake off the depressing influence but we did not allow that to interfere with our action  silently but vigorouslyfor the cold was increasingwe felled several small dead trees which we afterwards cut into lengths of about four feet  then we cleared a space in the snow of about ten or twelve feet in diameter until we reached the solid earth using our snowshoes as shovels  what we threw out of the hole formed an embankment round it and as the snow lay at that spot full four feet deep we thus raised the surrounding wall of our chamber to a height of six feet if not more  standing on the edge of it in the everdeepening twilight and looking down into the abyss which was further darkened by the overspreading pines this hole in the snow suggested a tomb rather than a bed  at one end of it we piled up the firewood  extending from that towards the other end we spread a carpet of pinebranches full six inches thick  to do all this took a considerable amount of time and labour and when lumley stood up at last to strike a light with flint steel and tinder we felt pretty well exhausted  the night had by that time become profoundly dark insomuch that we had to grope for the various articles we required  weve been rather late of beginning to make the camp said i as i watched the sparks  never mind max my boy we shall soon be all right replied my friend as one of the sparks at last caught on the tinder  in a few seconds the spark was blown into a blaze and placed in the midst of a handful of dry moss and thin chips  this was applied to some dry twigs under our piledup logs and a vivid tongue of flame shot upward  blessed fire  marvellous light  it is a glorious wonderworking influence well chosen by the almighty as one of his titles  there is no change in nature so intense as that from darkness to light as well in physical as in spiritual things  no sudden change from heat to cold or from calm to storm no transformation ever achieved in the most gorgeous of pantomimes could have the startling effect or produce the splendid contrast that resulted from the upward flash of that first tongue of fire  it was a vivid tongue for the materials had been well laid a few seconds later it was a roaring tongue with a host of lesser tongues around itall dancing leaping cheering flashing as if with ineffable joy at their sudden liberation and the resulting destruction of dismal darkness  our snowabyss was no longer black and tomblike  its walls sparkled as though encrusted with diamonds its carpet of pinebranches shone vividly green the treestems around rose up like redhot pillars more or less intense in colour according to distance the branching canopy overhead appeared to become solid with light and the distance around equally solid with ebony blackness while we who had caused the transformation stood in the midst of the ruddy blaze like jovial redhot men  theres nothing like a fire i remarked with some enthusiasm  except supper said lumley  gross creature  i responded as he went about the preparation of supper with a degree of zest which caused me to feel that my epithet was well deserved  gross creature he repeated some time afterwards with a pleasant smile of intense enjoyment as he sat in front of the blaze sipping a can of hot tea and devouring pemmican and biscuit with avidity  no max i am not a gross creature  your intellects are probably benumbed by the cold  if phrenologists are right in dividing the human brain into compartments wherein the different intellectual powers are said to be located i should think that some of those chambers lying nearest to the top of the skull are apt to freeze at a temperature of forty below zero in which case the perfect working of the halfparalysed machine can scarcely be looked for  hold your head to the fire and thaw it while i expound this to you  stay said i holding out my tin pannikin for more tea inward heat as well as outward is necessary to my thorough comprehension of your expositions  true max all the faculties of such mind as you possess in their most active condition are required to enable you to take in the simplest proposition  just give my bird a turn like a good fellow  he referred to a ptarmigan which plucked split open roughly cleaned and impaled on a stick was roasting in front of the fire  i turned his bird and my own while he continued  to gratify the appetite with thorough and hearty appreciation after working hard for your food or walking far to find it is not gross grossness consists in eating heavily when you have not toiled and stimulating with firewater pepper or mustard your sluggish appetite to call me a gross creature then  he stopped short and looking up performed that operation with the nose which is styled sniffing  what do i smell  my birdburnt  i shouted snatching at the stick on which it was impaled  in doing so i capsized our can of tea  lumley looked at it with a sigh while i regarded with a groan the breast of my bird burnt to a cinder  max you should remember that a fire strong enough to subdue forty degrees below zero is intensealso that our supply of tea is limited all this comes of your unwisely calling me a gross creature  no it comes of the intense application of my unthawed intellect to your absurd expositions  whatever it comes of returned lumley we must remedy the evil here fall upon my ptarmigan  im not quite ready for it being still engaged with the pemmican  meanwhile ill replenish the kettle  so saying he took up the kettle went to the margin of our hole and filled it with fresh snow well pressed down  this being put on the fire soon melted more snow was added till water enough was procured and then fresh tea was put in to boil  we were not particular you see as to the mode of infusion  while my friend was thus engaged i had plucked split cleansed and impaled another bird  in a marvellously short timefor our fire was truly intensethe tea and ptarmigan were ready and we proceeded with supper as comfortably as before  now i shall continue said lumley with a satisfied clearing of the throat the exposition of grossness  oh pray spare me that said i quickly but tell me if you can why it is that such a tremendous fire as that does not melt our snow walls  put your head nearer to it max for some of the phrenological chambers must still be frozen else it would be clear to you that the intensity of the cold is the reason  you see that only a small part of the snow quite close to the fire is a little softened  if the fire were hotter it would melt more of itmelt the whole hole and us too  but the cold is so great that it keeps the walls cool and us alsotoo cool indeed for while my face and knees are roasting my back is freezing so i shall rise and give it a turn  now he continued rising and turning his back to the blaze as he spoke i will resume my remarks on gross  youve no objection to my making our bed while you lecture said i also rising  lumley had not the least objection so while he held forth i spread a large green blanket over our carpet of pinebrush  a bundle of the same under the blanket formed a pretty good pillow  wrapping myself tightly round in another blanket for physical heat evaporates quickly in the frozen regions i lay down  my friend lay down beside me our feet being towards the fire  after a silent interval while lying thus gazing up through the overhanging branches at the stars that twinkled in the clear frosty sky our thoughts became more serious  the grandeur of creation led us to think and speak of the creatorfor we were likeminded friends and no subject was tabooed  we conversed freely about whatever chanced to enter our mindsof things past present and to come  we spoke of god the saviour of redemption and of sin  then with that discursive tendency to which most minds are prone we diverged to home and civilised lands contrasting these with life in the wildwoods of the great norwest  after that we became sleepy and our converse was more discursiveat times even incoherentin the midst of which lumley reverted to his unfinished exposition of grossness and in the enthusiasm of his nature was slowly working himself back into a wakeful condition when i put an abrupt end to the discourse by drawing a prolonged snore  it was a deceptive snore unworthy of success yet it succeeded  my friend turned round and with a contented sigh went to sleep  after a brief space the snore which had been a fiction became a reality and thus on our bed of snow in the depths of an arctic night in the heart of the frozen wilderness and while the mighty fire burned slowly down we unitedly took our departure for the land of nod    chapter two  the winter packet  on returning next morning towards the outpost from our encampment in the woods lumley and i made a discovery which excited us greatly  it was nothing more than a track in the snow but there was a revelation in the track which sent the blood tingling through our veins  it was not the track of a polar bear  we should have been somewhat surprised no doubt but not greatly excited by that  neither was it the track of a deer or an arctic fox  it was only the track of a sledge  is that all exclaims the reader  no that is not all  but in order that you may understand it better let me explain  fort dunregan in which we dwelt stood more than a thousand miles distant from the utmost verge of civilised life in canada  we were buried so to speak in the heart of the great northern wilderness  our nearest neighbour lived in an outpost between one and two hundred miles distant similar to our own in all respects but even more lonely being in charge of a certain scotsman named macnab whose army of occupation consisted of only six men and two indian women  the forests around us were not peopled  those vast solitudes were indeed here and there broken in upon as it were by a few families of wandering redindians who dwelt in movable tentswere here today and away tomorrowbut they could not be said to be peopled except by deer and bears and foxes and kindred spirits  of course therefore we were far beyond the every day influences of civilised life  we had no newspapers no mails no communication whatever in short with the outer world except twice in the year  the one occasion was in summer when a brigade of boats arrived with our outfit of goods for the years trade with the few scattered indians above referred to the other occasion was in the depth of our apparently interminable winter when a packet of letters was forwarded from outpost to outpost throughout the land by the agents of the hudsons bay company which we served  this halfyearly interval between mails had a double effect on our minds  in the first place it induced a strange feeling that the great world and all its affairs were things of the past with which we had little or nothing to doa sort of dreamand that the little world of our outpost with its eight or ten men and three or four indian women its hunting and trapping and firewoodcutting and fishing and trading and small domestic arrangements and dissensions was the one place of vital importance and interest before which empires and dynasties and the trifling matter of politics sank into mere insignificance  in the second place it created an intense longinga hungering and thirstingfor news of our kindred at home  our chief mr strang and our two selves with another fellowclerk who was named spooner as well as most of our men were from the old country where we had left fathers mothers brothers sistersin some cases sweetheartsbehind us  it may be conceived then with what anxiety and yearning we looked forward to the periodical break in the weary six months of total silence that had enveloped us  men in civilised or even semicivilised communities cannot understand this convicts on penal servitude for long periods may have some faint notion of it but even these have periods of literary intercourse more frequently than we had  the reader must just take the statement on trust therefore that our anxious yearnings were remarkably powerful what might not have occurred in these six months of dark silence  who might not have been married born laid low by sickness banished to the ends of the earth like ourselves or even removed by death  is it surprising then that we caught our breath and flushed and that our hearts leaped when we came unexpectedly upon the track of the two men who had dragged news from home for hundreds of miles over the snow we knew the tracks well  our intimate acquaintance with every species of track that was possible in that particular region rendered a mistake out of the question  there was the step of the leader who wore a snowshoe the shape of which although not unknown was somewhat unfamiliar to us  there was the print of the sled or toboggan which was different in pattern from those used at dunregan and there was the footprint of the man in rear whose snowshoe also made an unfamiliar impression  the packet exclaimed lumley opening his solemn grey eyes to their widest as he looked up from the track to me  at last  i returned unconsciously betraying the prolonged state of suspense with which my mind had been afflicted  come along said my companion starting off homeward at a pace that was almost too much for me  we soon reached the outpost and there stood the makers of the track which had roused in us so much excitement  two strong men chosen expressly for a duty which required mental endurance and perseverance as well as physical vigour  they stood at the door of the entrancehall talking with mr strang the one with his snowshoes slung over his shoulder on the butt of his gun the other using the same implements as a rest for his hands while spooner in a state of great excitement was hastily undoing the lashings of the sled to get at the precious box which contained the packet  well gentlemen here it is at last said our chief with a genial smile as we came up  yes we followed the track immediately we struck it said lumley stooping to assist spooner in his work  we soon had the box carried to our chiefs private room while the two strangers were had off by our men to their own house there to be feasted on venison ptarmigan saltpork fish and peasepudding to satiety and afterwards pumped to a state of exhaustion  i followed our chief who had a provokingly deliberate way of opening the packet and examining its contents while my feverish agitation and expectancy increased  there was a humorous twinkle in his eye i thought which told of mischievous purpose while he kept up a murmuring commentary  hm as i expectedno news from macnab  whats thisah  the governor  a voluminous epistle andhallo  lumleys friends must be fond of him  his packet is the biggest in the box  and spooner too not so bad for him  here take these to them  stayhere is a bundle of letters for the men  youd better deliver these yourself  i hesitated while a mist of great darkness began to descend on my soul  nothing for me sir  i asked faintly  there seems to benothingstay whats thiswhy i thought it was a big book but yes it is a packet for you mr maxbythere  my heart leaped into my mouthalmost out of itas i received a thick packet wrapped in newspaper  hastening to what was called the clerks winter house with these treasures i distributed them and handed the mens packet to one of themselves who was eagerly awaiting it  then i went to my room and barricaded the door to prevent interruption  in bachelors hall as we styled our apartments we had an inveterate habit of practical joking which however interesting and agreeable it might be at most times was in some circumstances rather inconvenient to guard against it at such times we were in the habit of retiring to our respective dens and barricading the doors the locks being sometimes incapable of standing the strain brought to bear on them  on this particular occasion i made my barricade stronger than usual sat down on my bed and opened the packet from home  but here i must let the curtain fall  i cannot suppose that the reader however amiable will sympathise with the joys and sorrows of an unknown family interesting though they were to me  i may state however that before i got through the budget it was so late that i turned into bed and read the remainder there  then as the fire in the hallstove sank low the cold obliged me to put on above my voluminous blankets we dared not sleep in sheets out there a thick buffalo robe which besides having on the outside the shaggy hair of the animal to which it had belonged was lined with flannel  thus nestled into a warm hole i read on until a shout arrested me and brought me suddenly back from the hills of bonny scotland to the frozen wilderness  i say shouted lumley at the back of the door which he saluted with a kick my sister is married  poor thing said i  who to  open the door  i cant  im in bed  you must  i wont  no then here goes  he retired as he spoke and making a rush launched himself against my door which however withstood the shock  here spooner i then heard him say lend a hand let us go at it together  they went at it together  the lock gave way the chest of drawers went spinning to the other side of the room and lumley tumbled over spooner as both fell headlong to the floor  as this was by no means an unfamiliar mode of entering each others rooms i took no notice of it but proceeded to inquire about the married sister and lumley sitting down on my bed with spooner for neither of them had yet undressed began to tell me of home and friends with as much eagerness as if i had been a member of both families young spooner interrupted lumley now and then when a touch of coincidence struck him with reference to his own family affairs and i could not resist the pleasure of occasionally making some such remark as how odd thats very like what happened to my little brother bob etcetera whereupon spooner would immediately become excited and draw a parallel more or less striking in regard to his own kindred and so we went on far into the night until we got our several families mixed up to such an extent that it became almost impossible to disentangle them for being three families you know we became inextricably confused as to which was which though each was perfectly clear in regard to his own  thus to me jane lumley became confused with janet spooner so that janet lumley and jane spooner were always tripping over each other in my brain while my dear cousin maggie maxby became a maggie spooner to lumley and a maggie lumley to spooner and to each sometimes a janet or a jane respectively  if the reader will multiply into this question two mothers and three fathers four brothers and six sisters besides numberless aunts uncles and cousins male and female he will easily perceive how between mental perplexity and a tendency to slumber we at last gave the matter up in a sort of jovial despair  we were startled suddenly from this condition by a crash and an exceedingly sharp and bitter cry  it must be remarked here that in order to subdue king frost in those northern strongholds of his we had besides double doors and double windows and porches an enormous castiron stove from the famous carron foundry  it stood in the centre of our hall so that its genial favours might be distributed with equal justice to the various sleepingrooms that opened out of the hall all round  from this stove an iron pipe arose and turning at a right angle when within a couple of feet of the ceiling proceeded to the chimney at the upper end of the hall  when the thermometer stood much below zero we were accustomed to raise the stove and part of its pipe to a dullred heat which had the effect of partially melting the contents of the waterjugs in our bedrooms and of partially roasting the knees of our trousers  to keep this stove up to its work was the duty of an indian youth whom we styled salamander because he seemed to be impervious to heat  he was equally so to cold when i first went to dunregan i used to pity salamander on hearing him every morning enter our hall with a gust of air that seemed cold enough to freeze a walrus and proceed to strike a light and kindle our fire my own nose and sometimes an eye was all that protruded from the buffalo robe at such times  but salamander never shivered and always grinned from which i came to understand that my pity was misplaced about nine oclock each night he left us to look after the great carron stove ourselves and we were all pretty good stokers  selfinterest kept us up to duty  sometimes we overdid it raising the dullred to brightness now and then  on this particular occasion in the exuberance of his feelings lumley before bursting into my room had heaped on as much dry wood as the stove could hold  it chanced to be exceedingly resinous wood  he also opened the blowhole to its utmost extent  being congregated in my bedroom as i have described deeply engaged in eager comments and family reminiscences we failed to observe that the great carron stove roared like a wrathful furnace that it changed from a dull to a bright red in its anger and eventually became white with passion  as evil communications have a tendency to corrupt the usually innocent pipe became inflamed  it communicated the evil to the chimney which straightway caught fire belched forth smoke and flames and cast a ruddy glare over the usually pallid snow  this chanced to meet the eye of salamander as he gazed from his bunk in the mens house caused him to bounce up and rush outfor having a taste for sleeping in his clothes he was always ready for actionburst open our door with a crash and rudely dispel our confusedly pleasant intercourse with the exceedingly sharp and bitter cry before mentioned  hallo shouted lumley and spooner simultaneously as they bounded rather than rose from my bed  before they had crossed the threshold i was out of bed and into my trousers  there is nothing like the cry of fire for producing prompt actionor paralysis  also for inducing imbecile stupidity  i could not find my moccasins  thought is quickquicker than words  amputation at the knee joints stared me in the face for a certainty if i went out with naked feet  in desperation i seized my capote and thrust both feet into the sleeves with some hazy intention of tying a knot on each wrist to protect the toes  happily i espied my moccasins at the moment pulled them onleft shoe on right foot of courseand put the coat to its proper use  by this time salamander contrary to all traditions of indian stoicism was yelling about the fort with his eyes a flame and his hair on end the men were out in a few seconds with a ladder and swarmed up to the roof of our house without any definite notion as to what they meant to do  mr strang was also out smothered in winter garments and with an enormous makinaw blanket over all  he was greatly excited though the most selfpossessed among usas most chiefs are or ought to be  water water shouted the men from the roof  a keen breeze was blowing from what seemed the very heart of king frosts dominion and snowdrift fine as dust and penetrating as needles was swirling about in the nightair  water where was water to come from  the river was frozen almost to the bottom  ice six feet thick covered the lakes and ponds  the sound of trickling water had not been heard for months  it had become an ancient memory  water why it cost our cooks assistant a full hour every day to cut through the result of one nights frost in the waterhole before he could reach the water required for daily use and what he did obtain had to be slowly dragged to the fort by that slowest of creatures an ox  nevertheless there was water  in the warmest corner of the kitchenat that hour about zerothere stood a waterbarrel  run cookfetch a bucketful cried our chief  cook who had lost his head obediently ran seized a big earthenware jug dipped it into the barrel and smashed it to atoms on a cake of thick ice  this had the effect of partially recovering his head for him  he seized an axe shattered the cake caught up a bucket dipped it full and rushed out spilling half its contents as he ran  the spillings became icicles before they reached the flaming chimney but the frost keen as it was could not quite solidify the liquid in so short a space of time  blondin the principal bearer of the winter packet who was a heroic man and chief actor in this scene received the halfempty bucket  bah he exclaimed tossing bucket as well as water contemptuously down the wide chimney  bring shuvill an blunkits  blondin was a frenchcanadian halfcaste and not a good linguist  a shovel was thrown up to him  he seized it and shovelled volumes of snow from the housetop into the chimney  a moment later and two blankets were thrown up  blondin spread one over the flames  it was shrivelled up instantly  he stuffed down the remains and spread the second blanket over them while he shouted for a third  the third came and another bucket of water arriving at the same moment with a large mass of snow detached from the roof the whole were thrust down the chimney en masse the flames were quenched and the house was saved  during this exciting scene i had begun to realise the great danger of fire in the chimney of a wooden house and with the aid of my comrades had been throwing the contents of bachelors hall out into the snow  we now ceased this process and began to carry them back again while the men crowded round the iron author of all the mischief to warm their halffrozen bodies  i now observed for the first time that blondin had a black patch on the end of his nose  it was a handsome feature usually but at that time it was red swelled and what may be termed blobby  whats the matter with it blondin  i asked  my noz was froz he replied curtly  youd better have it looked to or itll be worse than froz my man said lumley  blondin laughed and went off to attend to his nose in the mens house accompanied by the others while we set to work to clean ourselves and our abode  thereafter with moderated fire we again got under our buffalo robes where we spent the remainder of a disturbed night in thinking and dreaming about the thrilling contents of the winter packet    chapter three  deeper desolation  eight months of winter  those who have read and entered into the spirit of arctic voyagers may have some idea of what that means but none save he or she who has had experience of it can fully understand it  to us who dwelt at the little outpost in the great norwest snow and ice had become so familiarsuch matterofcourse conditions of existencethat green fields and flowers were a mere reminiscence of the remote past  the scent of a rose was a faded memoryindeed the scent of anything belonging to the vegetable kingdom had not once saluted our nostrils during those eight months  pure white became one of the chief and most impressive facts of our existence in regard to colour if we may so call itwhite varying in tone of course to pearly grey cold of varied intensity was the chief modifier of our sensations happily light was also a potent factor in our experiencesbright glowing sunshine and blue skies contrasted well with the white and grey and helped to counteract the cold while pure air invigorated our frames and cheered our spirits  i tell you what boys said lumley one afternoon as he entered the hall with gun and snowshoes on shoulder and flung down a bag full of ptarmigan winter is drawing to a close at last  i felt my deerskin coat quite oppressive today does any one know what the thermometer stood at this morning  yes it was twentytwo above zero answered spooner who was attempting to smoke a pipe beside the stove i went to register it just after breakfast  i thought soonly ten below freezing point why it feels quite summery and the snow has a softness that i have not noticed since last autumn  i hope dinner will soon be ready for im very sharp set  why spooner what are you making such faces for  am i making faces said spooner blushing and trying to look unconcerned  of course you are a marmozette monkey with the toothache could scarcely make worse  spooner attempted to laugh and i felt it difficult to refrain from joining him for i knew well the cause of his faces  he was the youngest of us three and exceedingly anxious to imitate lumley who was unfortunately a great smoker but spooner like myself had been born with a dislike to smokeespecially tobacco smokeand a liability to become sick when he indulged in the pipe  hence whilst foolish ambition induced him to smoke outraged nature protested and between the two the poor fellow had a bad time of it  he had a good deal of determination about him however and persevered  the dinnerbell rang at the moment and put an end to further badinage  lumley was right  spring was in truth at hand and a host of new anticipations began from that day to crowd upon our minds  about the same time there came another break in the monotony of outpost life which had if possible a more powerful and exciting influence on us than the arrival of the winter packet  now at this point i must beg the readers pardon for asking him to go with me to a still more desolate and remote outpost than our own between one and two hundred miles nearer to the pole the little post of muskrat house lay under a beetling cliff near the banks of an affluent of the great saskatchewan river  it was in charge of peter macnab before mentioned who in command of his army of six men and two women held the post against all comersthe chief comers there being the north wind and jack frost  poor macnab was a jovial and sociable scottish highlander who had been condemned to worse than siberian banishment because of being one of the most active enterprising and pushing fellows in the service of the furtraders  his ability to manage men and indians and to establish new tradingposts excelled that of his fellows  he regarded it as a complimentary though trying circumstance when mr strang sent him to establish the post which was named by him muskrat house but he faced the dutyas he faced everythinglike a man did his best for his employers and made the most of the situation  but it is not easy for even the strongest mind and lightest heart to be jovial when buried for eight months in snow more than twelve hundred miles beyond the influences of civilised life and it is hard to be sociable with six uneducated men and two indian women for ones companions  macnab tried it however and was in a measure successful he had his bible with himthe one given him long ago by his motherand a bound volume of chamberss edinburgh journal and three copies of the times newspaper nearly two years old and a few numbers of an american paper called the picayune  with these materials he set to workafter each days labour of waterdrawing firewoodcutting and trapping was doneto educate his army in religion politics political economy and the varied ramifications of social life  he had intelligent and grateful scholars if they had not been so macnab would at all events have made them obedient pupils for he was a physically large and powerful manand might was unavoidably right in those regions  still with all his energy and resources the genial highlander began towards the end of winter to feel an intense longing for a little intercourse with his equals  returning one night to the solitude of his little room as was his wont after a couple of hours intercourse with his men in their own house he sat down before his stove and addressed it thus  it wont last long i fear  my brain is gradually turning into something like mashed potatoes and my heart into a tinderbox ready enough to catch fire but with neither flint nor steel to light it  the indians wont be here for many weeks and when they do come what good can i get from or do to them  wow wow its terribly slow work  oh jessie jessie my dear what would i not give if i only had you here  lest the reader should suppose macnab to be a lovesick swain i may remark here that jessie was a sister whom he had left on the shores of loch ness and with whom he kept up a vigorous biennial correspondence  as the stove made no reply he continued his address  if i only had a few books now it wouldnt be so hard to bear  to be sure the bible is a great resourcea blessed resource but you see i want something light now and then  a laugh you know seems to be absolutely needful at times  why now i think of it we wouldnt have been given the power to laugh if it hadnt been necessary and the last hearty laugh i had was let me seethat time three months ago when my longnosed interpreter mistook a dead mouse in the soupha hafor a bit of pemmican and only found out his mistake when the tail got between his teeth  the solitary man burst into peals of laughter at the reminiscence and then becoming suddenly grave looked slowly round the room  if i could only have an echo of that he resumed from somebody else well well ill just go and have another chat with jessie  so saying macnab rose drew a small table near to the stove laid upon it a very large desk made by himself of pinewood and placing a sheet of paper thereon began to write  the sheet of paper merits notice  like the man who wrote it was extremely large being several sizes bigger than foolscap and very loosely ruled  as i have said communication with the outer world being possible only twice in the year our highlander resolved as usual to make the most of his opportunities  hence he not only used the largest paper which the company provided but filled up several such sheets with the smallest possible writing so that jessie might ultimately get something worth having  it is but justice to add that macnab wrote not only a very small but a remarkably clear and legible handa virtue which i earnestly commend to correspondents in general to those of them at least who wish their epistles to meet with thorough appreciation  it was late when our solitaire completed that evenings addition to his already voluminous letter and he was thinking about going to bed when a stamping in the porch outside announced that a visitor was clearing the snow from his moccasins  one o the men forgot something i fancy muttered macnab to himself  the latch was lifted for locks were not deemed necessary in those regions and the door opening slowly disclosed the copperhued visage and tall bony figure of a very powerful and handsome native of the soilperhaps i should rather sayof the snow  hallo hey come in shouted macnab giving way to a gush of his pentup social feelings why its good for sore eyes to see a new face even a red one  what cheer what cheer  where dye hail from  come in come in and welcome  the hearty highlander spoke the indian tongue fluently but in the excitement of his feelings mingled it with a good deal of english and an occasional growl of expressive gaelic  the indian whose horned cap and person were well powdered with snow stepped slowly over the threshold extending his hand to the highlanders grasp and looking cautiously round with rolling black eyes as if he half expected a dynamite explosion to follow his entrance  his garments bore evidence of rough usage  holes in his moccasins permitted portions of the duffle socks underneath to wander out  knots on his snowshoe lines and netting told of a long rough journey and the soiled greasy condition of his leathern capote spoke of its having been much used not only as a garment by day but as a shirt by night  placing his gun and snowshoes in a corner after solemnly responding watchee watchee to macnabs what cheer the redman seated himself on the floor beside the stove with silent disregard of the chair that his host politely offered  it is the custom of north american indianson arriving at an establishmentto withhold the most interesting portion of what they may have to communicate until after they have had a pipe or a feed and have answered the questions put on the less interesting objects of their visits  being well aware of this trait of character macnab forebore to question too closely this finelooking indian until he had well thawed and smoked himself  ultimately however he brought him to the point  to the northwestward of muskrat house many long days march he said of course in his native tongue there was a grand country full of fine furs and fine people who found it a very long journey indeed to come all the way to muskrat house to trade their furs  would his white father go and build a house there near lake wichikagan and shoot and fish and tradewaugh  to which macnab replied that he was glad to hear about the plenty of furs and the friendly natives and the fine country and that he would take the matter into his considerationwaugh  to this the redman responded ho and then hownot interrogatively but interjectionallywith much gravity  that night macnab took the matter into consideration with his wonted vigour and came to the conclusion that it was of sufficient importance to warrant a visit on his part to headquartersdunregan being headquarters to muskrat house  accordingly he went to the mens house and introduced the stranger whose name in the indian tongue signified big otter  the men received him with as much joy as if he had been an angel of light  get a sled and four of the best dogs ready to start by daybreak tomorrow said macnab to one of his men and have breakfast sharp he added turning to the cook  youll go with me to dunregan wont you big otter  big otter was ready for anything at a moments notice  when daylight glimmered faintly in the east the following morning macnab sat at his table devouring venison steaks pancakes and tea big otter sat opposite to him having condescended to use a chair in order to be on a level with the table  the chair gave him much anxiety however  he evidently feared to fall off or upset it for on rising to reach some food opposite he had tilted it back and received a tremendous though unacknowledged start from the crash that followed  half an hour later macnab having left his interpreter in charge of the establishment was beating the track on snowshoes through the forest his four wolfishlooking dogs following with a sledload of provisions and bedding and big otter bringing up the rear  the day turned out to be bright calm and frosty  it was in thorough unison with macnabs feelings for the near prospect of soon meeting with men somewhat like himself produced a calm and bright condition of mind which he had not experienced for many a day  it is true that the frost can scarcely be said to have represented the highlanders temperament but if there be truth in the saying that extremes meet it may be admissible to say that intense cold which had the effect of expanding water into ice so that it rent the very rocks might be appropriately compared with that intense warmth of macnabs feelings which had the effect of all but bursting his very bosom  there was not a breath of air stirring when the two men passed from the forest and struck out upon the marble surface of the great lake which lay at the distance of about two miles from their establishment  the sun was rising at the time on the horizon of the oceanlike lake gloriously bright and cheering though with no appreciable warmth in its beams diamonds innumerable glittered on the frosted willowboughs the snow under the travellers tread gave forth that peculiar squeak or chirping sound which is indicative of extreme arctic frost and the breath from their mouths came out like the white puffs of a locomotive settling on their breasts in thick hoarfrost and silvering such of their locks as straggled out beyond the margin of their caps  there was no life at first in the quiet scene but just as they passed through the last clump of bushes on the margin of the lake a battalion of ptarmigan seemingly a thousand strong burst with startling whirr from under their very feet and skimmed away like a snowcloud close to the ground while an arctic fox aroused from his lair by the noise slank quietly off under the false belief that he had not been seen  the rise of the ptarmigan had another effect on which the travellers had not counted  the four wolfish dogs were so startled by the whirr that their spirits were roused to the mischievous point  up to that moment they had been toiling and panting through the soft snow in the woods  they had now emerged upon the hard windbeaten snow of the open ground and the lake  the sudden freedom in the action of their limbs coupled with the impulse to their spirits caused the team to bound forward with one accord  the sled swung round against macnabs legs and overturned him and the tailline was jerked out of big otters grasp  in a vain effort to recover it that solemn savage trod with his right on his own left snowshoe and plunged into a willow bush thus freed altogether the dogs went away with railway speed over the hard snow ever urged to more and more frantic exertions by the wild boundings of the comparatively light sled behind them  after them lad shouted macnab as he cast off his snowshoes and gave chase  the indian followed suit in desperate haste for his receptive mind at once perceived the all but hopeless nature of a chase after four longlegged dogs little removed from genuine wolves over a hard level course that extended away to the very horizon  happily there was a small island not far from the shore of the lake on which grew a few willow bushes whose tops protruded above the overwhelming snow and whose buds formed the food of the ptarmigan before mentioned  towards this island the dogs headed in their blind race just as the white man and the red began to regret the comparative slowness of human legs  good luck exclaimed macnab  waugh responded his companion  there was ground for both remarks for a few minutes later the dogs plunged into the bushes and the sled stuck fast and held them  this was a trifling incident in itself but it shook out of the travellers any remains of lethargy that might have clung to them from the slumbers of the previous night and caused them to face the tramp that lay before them with energy  oh you rascals growled macnab as he went down on his knees beside the leading dog to disentangle the traces which had been twisted up in the abrupt stoppage  i know not whether those dogs being intellectually as well as physically powerful beyond their fellows understood the uncomplimentary term and lost their tempers but certain it is that the words were no sooner uttered than the hindmost dog made an unprovoked assault on the dog in front of it  of course the latter defended itself  the dog next to that being probably pugnacious could not resist the temptation to join in and the leader feeling no doubt that it was better to be out of the world than out of the fashion fell upon the rest with remarkable fury  thus the sled traces and dogs instantly became a tumultuous mass of yelling gasping heaving and twisting confusion  big otter carried a short heavy whip  without uttering a word he quietly proceeded to flog the mass into subjection  it was a difficult duty to perform but big otter was strong and persevering  he prevailed after some time  the mass was disentangled the subdued dogs went humbly forward and the journey having been thus auspiciously begun was continued until nightfall  they had left the lake and muskrat house some thirty miles behind them and had got into a thick and profoundly still part of the great wilderness when the waning light warned them to encamp    chapter four  the winter journey  it was not long before our travellers had a large space cleared of snow its floor spread with pinebranches a roaring fire kindled a couple of ptarmigan roasting and the teakettle bubbling while the dogs in the background solaced themselves with raw birds to their hearts content  then the redman and the white man smoked a friendly pipe  they would probably have smoked even if it had been an unfriendly pipe  i wonder said macnab who was apt to become speculative and philosophical over his pipe after supper i wonder if dogs ever envy us our pipes  you look so comfortable big otter as you sit there with halfshut eyes letting the smoke trickle from your mouth and nose that i cant help thinking they must feel envious  im sure that i should if i were not smoking  the indian who was neither a speculator nor a philosopherthough solemn enough for either or bothreplied waugh  very true returned the highlander i have no doubt your opinion is quite correct though not as clearly put as might be wished  have you ever been at fort dunregan  once when big otter was a little boy he stood beside the great river answered the indian gravely but the white man had no tent there at that time  the white man has got some pretty big tents there nowmade of wood most of em returned macnab  in a few days you shall judge for yourself if all goes well  the redman smoked over this remark in silence for a considerable time evidently engaged in profound thought  he was one of those children of nature whose brains admit ideas slowly and who when they are admitted turn them round and round and inside out without much apparent advantage  at last he looked earnestly at his companion and askedis there firewater at fort dunregan  well noi believe not  at least there is none for redmen  why do you ask  did you ever taste firewater  the indians dark eyes seem to gleam with unwonted light as he replied in tones more solemn than usual  yes  onceonly oncea white brother gave some firewater to big otter  humph ejaculated macnab and what did you think of it  waugh exclaimed the redman sending a cloud out of his mouth with such energy that it seemed like a little cannonshot while he glared at his friend like a superannuated owl  big otter thought that he was in the happy huntinggrounds with his fathers his heart was so light and his limbs were so strong but that was only a dreamhe was still in this world  then he took a little more firewater and the dream became a reality  he was away with his fathers on the shining plains he chased the deer with the lightness of a boy and the strength of a bear he fought and his foes fell before his strong arm like snowflakes on the river but he scalped them not  he could not find themthey were gone  big otter was so strong that he had knocked both their lives and bodies into the unknown  he saw his father and his motherandhis wife and the little one whodied  but he could not speak to them for the foes came back again and he fought and took some more firewater to make him fight better then the world went on fire the stars came down from the sky like snow when the wind is high  the big otter flew up into the air and thenforgot  forgot what asked macnab much interested in his red friends idea of intoxication  forgot everything replied the indian with a look of solemn perplexity  well i dont wonder you must have had a good swig apparently  how did ye feel next morning  if the indians looks were serious before they became indescribably solemn now  big otter felt he replied with bated breath like bags of shot heavy like the great stones  he could scarcely move all his joints were stiff  food was no longer pleasant to his tongue  when he tried to swallow it would not remain but came forth again  he felt a wish to drink up the river  his head had an evil spirit inside which squeezed the brain and tried to burst open the skull  his eyes also were swelled up so that he could hardly see and his nose was two times more big than the day before  that must have been an awful size big otter considering the size of it by nature  and what dye think was the cause of it all  as this question involved thought the indian smoked his pipe in silence for some time staring for inspiration into the fire  it must have been he at length replied hunting with his fathers before the right time had come  big otter was not dead and he chased the deer too much perhaps or fought too much  it may be that having only his earthbody he ate too much  dont ye think its just possible suggested macnab that having only your earthbody you drank too much  waugh replied the redman  then after a few minutes devotion to the pipe he added big otter would like very much to taste the firewater again  its well for you my boy returned the other that you cant get it in these regions for if you could youd soon be in the happy huntinggrounds or the other place without your earthbody  at this point the highlander became more earnest and treated his companion to what would have passed in civilised lands for a fair temperance lecture in which he sought to describe graphically the evils of strong drink  to this the indian listened with the most intense attention and an owlish expression making no audible comment whatever with the exception now and then of an emphatic waugh but indicating his interest by the working of his features and the glittering of his great eyes  whether the reasoning of macnab had much influence at that time could not be ascertained for he was yet in the middle of one of his most graphic anecdotes when the indians owlish eyes shut with a suddenness that was quite startling and he roused himself just in time to prevent his chin from dropping on his chest  waugh he exclaimed with a slightlyconfused look  just so replied macnab with a laugh and now boy well turn in for it strikes me were going to have warmish weather and if so we shall have to make the most of our time  soon the blankets were spread the fire was replenished with mighty logs the travellers lay down side by side and in a few minutes snored in concert the flames leaped upwards and the sparks entangling themselves on the snowencrusted branches of bush and tree gleamed there for an instant or escaping flew gaily away into the wintry sky  while the two men were sleeping a change came over the scenea slow gentle scarce perceptible change which however had a powerful influence on the prospects of the sleepers  the sky became overcast the temperature which had been down at arctic depth for many months suddenly rose to that of temperate climes and snow began to fallnot in the small sharp particles to which the furtraders of the great northern wilderness are accustomed but in the broad heavy flakes that one often sees in england  softly silently gently they fell like the descent of a sweet influencebut steadily persistently continuously until every object in nature became smothered in the soft white garment among other objects the two sleepers were buried  the snow began by powdering them over  had any one been there to observe the process he would have seen by the bright light of the campfire that the green blankets in which they were wrapt became piebald first then assumed a greyishgreen colour which speedily changed into a greenishgrey and finally into a pure white  the two sleepers might thus have represented those figures in chiselled marble on the tombs of crusaders had it not been that they lay doubled up for warmthperhaps also for comfortwith their knees at their chins instead of flat on their backs with their hands pressed together  by degrees the correct outline of their forms became an incorrect outline and gradually more and more rotundsuggesting the idea that the buried ones were fat  as the night wore on the snow accumulated on them until it lay several inches deep  still they moved not  strong tired and healthy men are not easily moved  the fire of course sank by degrees until it reached that point where it failed to melt the snow then it was quickly smothered out and covered over  the entire camp was also buried the tin kettle being capped with a knob peculiarly its own and the snowshoes and other implements having each their appropriate outline while some hundredweights if not tons of the white drapery gathered on the branches overhead  it was altogether an overwhelming state of things and the only evidence of life in all the scene was the little hole in front of each slumberers nose out of which issued intermittent pufflets of white vapour  so the night passed by and the morning dawned and the wintry sun arose like a redhot cannon ball  then macnab awoke with a start and sat up with an effort  hallo was his first exclamation as he tried to clear his eyes then he muttered something in gaelic which being incomprehensible i cannot translate although the worthy man has many a time since the day of which i write tried to explain it to me  it may have been his action or it may have been indignant northern fairies i know not but certain it is that the gaelic was instantly followed by an avalanche of snow from the branch over the highlanders head which knocked him down and reburied him  it also knocked big otter up and drew forth the inevitable waugh  humph said macnab on clearing himself a second time i was half afraid of this  weve got our work cut out for us  the indian replied not but proceeded to light the fire and prepare breakfast while his companion cleared the camp of some of its snow the wolfish dogs took a lively interest in these proceedings but lent no assistance beyond wagging their tails either in approval or in anticipation of breakfast  of course breakfast was a repetition of the previous supper and was soon disposed of both by men and dogs  then the latter were harnessed to their sledge the snowshoes were put on and the journey was resumedmacnab manfully leading the way  and let not the reader imagine that this leadership involved little or no manhood  northern snowshoes are about five feet long and twelve or fifteen inches broad  the netting with which the frames are filled up somewhat like the bottom of a cane chairallows fine wellfrozen snow to fall through it like dust and the traveller sinking it may be only a few inches in old wellsettleddown snow progresses with ease  but when a heavy fall such as i have described takes place especially in spring and the weather grows comparatively warm the travellers circumstances change greatly for the worse  the new snow being light permits him to sink deep into itperhaps eight or ten inchesat every step being also soft that which falls upon the shoes cannot pass through the netting but sticks there giving him many extra pounds weight to lift as he goes heavily along  add to this that his thick winter garb becomes oppressive in mild weather and you will perceive that macnabs duties as beater of the track were severe  at first their progress was very slow for it was through the thick woods where fallen trees and bushes obstructed them as well as deep snow but towards noon they came out on a more open countryin summer a swamp at that time a frozen plainand the travelling improved for a slight breeze had already begun to make an impression on the new snow in exposed places  now big otter said macnab coming to a halt well have some grub here and then you will take a turn in front  the indian was ready for anything  so were the dogsespecially for grub  indeed it was obvious that they understood the meaning of that word for when macnab uttered it they wagged their tails and cocked their ears  it was a cold dinner if i may describe the meal by that name  the work was too hard and the daylight in which to do it too brief to admit of needless delay  a frozen bird thrown to each of the dogs and a junk of equally frozen pemmican cut out of the bag with a hatchet for the travellers formed the repast  the latter ate it sitting on a snowwreath  they however had the advantage of their canine friends in the matter of hard biscuits of which they each consumed two as a sort of cold pudding  then they resumed the march and plodded heavily on till near sunset when they again selected a suitable spot in the woods cleared away the snow and encamped as before  its hard work exclaimed macnab with a celtic sigh as he sipped his tea that night in the mellow light of the log fire  waugh  big otter has seen harder work returned the indian  no doubt ye have an so have i returned macnab i mind once when away on a snowshoe trip on the st lawrence gulf bein caught by a regular thaw when the snow turned into slush an liftin the snowshoes was like to tear ones legs out o their sockets not to mention the skinning of your toes wi the snowshoe lines an the wet turning your moccasins into something like tripe  yes it might be worse as you say  now boy ill turn in  the next day travelling was no better and on the next again it became worse for although the temperature was still below the freezing point snow continued to fall all day as well as all night so that our travellers and their dogs became like animated snowballs and beating the track became an exhausting labour  but difficulties cannot finally stop though they may retard a norwester  on the sixth day however they met with a foe who had power to lay a temporary check on their advance  on the night of the fifth day out another change of temperature took place  a thermometer had they carried one would probably have registered from ten to twenty below zero of fahrenheit  this however was so familiar to them that they rather liked the change and heaped up fresh logs on the roaring fire to counteract the cold but when a breeze sprang up and began to blow hard they did not enjoy it so much and when the breeze increased to a gale it became serious for one cannot face intense cold during a gale without the risk of being frostbitten  in the shelter of the woods it was all right but when towards noon they came out on an extended plain where the wild winds were whirling the wilder snow in blinding drifts they halted and looked inquiringly at each other  shall we try it asked macnab  the indian shook his head and looked solemn  its a pity to give in without  a snowdrift caught the highlander full in the mouth and literally shut him up  the effect was not to subdue but to arouse  yes he said in a species of calm ferocity when the gale allowed him the power of utterance well go on  he went on followed by the obedient native and the unhappy dogs but he had not taken half a dozen steps when he tripped over a concealed rock and broke a snowshoe  to walk with a broken snowshoe is impossible to repair one is somewhat difficult and takes time  they were compelled therefore to reenter the sheltering woods and encamp  youre better at mending than i am said macnab to the indian  set to work on the shoe when the camp is dug out an ill go cut some firewood  cutting firewood is not only laborious but attended with danger and that day illfortune seemed to have beset the highlander for he had barely cut half a dozen logs when his axe glanced off a knot and struck deep into the calf of his left leg  a shout brought big otter to his side  the indian was well used to such accidents  he bound up the wound securely and carried his comrade into camp on his back  but now macnab was helpless  he not only could not walk but there was no hope of his being able to do so for weeks to come  lucky for us we brought the dogs he remarked when the operation was completed  waugh exclaimed the indian by way of assent while he busied himself in preparing food  it was indeed lucky for if they had dragged the provisionsled themselves as macnab had once thought of doing it would have fallen to big otters lot to haul his comrade during the remainder of the journey as it was the dogs did it and in the doing of it despite the redmans anxious and constant care many a severe shake and bump and capsize in the snow did the unfortunate man receive before that journey came to a close  he bore it all however with the quiet stoicism characteristic of the race from which he sprang    chapter five  the wounded man  it is needful now to return to fort dunregan  the long winter is not yet past but there are symptoms as i have said that it is coming to a close  snow and ice are still indeed the prevailing characteristic of the region but the air is no longer intensely cold  on the contrary a genial warmth prevails inducing the inhabitants to discard flannellined leathern capotes and fur caps for lighter garments  there is a honeycombed look about the snowdrifts which gives them an aged appearance and above all there is an occasional dropping of wateryes actual waterfrom the points of huge icicles  this is such an ancient memory that we can scarce believe our senses  we sniff too as we walk about for there are scents in the airold familiar smells of earth and vegetationwhich we had begun to fancy we had almost forgotten  the excitement caused by the arrival of the winter packet had also by that time passed almost out of memory and we had sunk back into that calm state of patient waiting which may probably be familiar to the convict who knows that some months of monotonous existence still lie before him for not until the snow and ice should completely clear away and the summer be pretty well advanced could we hope for the blessed sight of a new face and the cheering sound of a fresh human voice  of course we had the agreeable prospect of hearing ere long the voices of wildfowl in their noisy northern flight but such a prospect was not sufficient to satisfy poor secluded humanity  oh that i were a bird exclaimed spooner one morning as we were seated round the carron stove in our hall  no need to wish that said lumley for youre a goose already  well id even consent to be a real goose continued spooner if i could only thereby use my wings to fly away over the snowy wilderness and alight in my old home  what a surprise youd give them if you did said lumley especially if you came down with your ruffled feathers as clumsily as you tumbled into the sawpit the other day when  he stopped for at that moment i said hush and held up a finger  sleighbells exclaimed spooner with a catch of his breath  nothing new in that said lumley we hear them every day  nothing new i retorted to your unmusical ear but these bells are not our bellslisten  i started up as i spoke flung open the outer door and we all listened intently  clear and pleasant they rang like the music of a sweet new song  we all gave a shout clapped on our caps and ran out to the fort gate there an almost new sensation thrilled us for we beheld a team of dogs coming up weary and worn out of the wilderness preceded by a gaunt yet majestic indian whose whole aspecthaggard expression of countenance soiled and somewhat tattered garments and weary gaitbetokened severe exhaustion  on the sled drawn by four lanky dogs we could see the figure of a man wrapped in blankets and strapped to the conveyance  who can it be exclaimed lumley as he hastened out to meet the new arrivals  a sick man from somewhere suggested spooner  perhaps the governor said i on an unexpected tour of inspection  as we drew near we could see that the recumbent figure waved a hand and cheered  macnab said i as the familiar voice struck my ear  illdying gasped the anxious spooner  no dying man ever cheered like that cried lumley except a hero of romance in the hour of death and victory  a few seconds more and the matter was put at rest while we warmly shook the hearty and genial highlander by both hands  help me out boys he said im tired o this sled and think i can do the little remaining bit o the journey on foot with your help  we disentangled him from the sledge and set him on his feet  hold on lumley he said with a smile on his haggard and unshaven face i want to embrace you like the frenchmen  theremy arm round your neckso  now max i want to embrace you likewise wi the other arm  ive grown awful affectionate in my old age  you are rather short max for a good crutch but youre better than nothing  you see ive only got one good leg  but what has happened to the otherwhen how and where we exclaimed in chorus  macnab answered the questions to our chief who came forward at the moment with welcome in his visage and extended hands  its only a cut sir stupidly done with my own hatchet when we had been but a few days out  but rest will soon put me to rights  my poor man big otter is more to be pitied than i  but for him i should have perished in the snow  what cheer what cheer said our chief grasping the indians hand on hearing this  what cheer we all exclaimed following his example  watchee watchee echoed big otter returning the hearty salutation as well as his tongue could manage it and giving us each a powerful squeeze with his huge bony hand which temporary exhaustion had not appreciably reduced in strength  the native was obviously a sociable welldisposed man for his eyes glittered and his white teeth gleamed and his bronzed visage shone with pleasure when macnab explained the cause of our sudden burst of affection for him  thus chatting and limping we got the highlander slowly up to the hall set him down in our only armchaira wooden one without stuffingand fetched him a basin of hot soup that being a liquid which our cook had always more or less frequently on hand  ha boys cried macnab smacking his lips thats the thing to put life into a man  ive not had anything like it for many a day  you see we had a small misfortune soon after my accident which cost us our kettle and rendered soup or tea impossible  how was that inquired our chief sitting down while we gathered round the stove to listen  well you see sir not long after my accident there came a sharp frost which made the surface of the snow hard after the thaw so the dogs could run on the top of the crust without breaking it but big otter bein heavy broke throughby the way i hope hes bein looked after  you may be sure of that said spooner  i saw him safely placed in the mens house and salamander who it turns out is a sort of relation of his set to work to stuff him with the same sort of soup you think so much of  i only hope theyve enough to keep him going for before i left the house he had drunk off two bowls of it almost without taking breath though it was scalding hot  good  hell do it ample justice returned macnab taking another pull at his own bowl  i hope youre well provisioned for big otters an awful consumer of victuals  well as i was saying the surface of the snow got frozen thinly and the work o tramping after the sled and holding on to the tailline was uncommonly hard as i could see for i lay with my head to the front looping back on the poor man  but it was on the exposed places and going down the slopes that the greatest difficulty lay for there the dogs were keen to run away  once or twice they did fairly get off and gave me some rough as well as long runs before my man could catch them up  at last we came one afternoon to an open plain where the snow had felt the thaw and been frozen again pretty hard  the moment we got on it away went the dogs  big otter tried to run but one of his shoes went through the crust and the other didnt so down he came and had to let go the line  i felt easy enough at first for the plain was level but after a time it became lumpy and i got some ugly bumps  never mind thought i theyll be sure to come to some bushes and thatll pull them up  just as i thought so we came to a slope and the team went slap over a bank  the sled and i threw a complete somersault  fortunately we came down on the dogs which broke our fall though it half killed them  when big otter came and turned me right side up i found that i had sustained no damage whatever but woes me our tin kettle was almost knocked flat  the worst of it was that in trying to put it right we drove a big hole in the bottom of it so we had to bid farewell to hot food except what we roasted  we could also melt snow by plastering up the hole so as to get enough to drink but boiling water was quite out of the question  well macnab said our chief rising since you have got the soup over at last come along with me and lets hear about your indian friends proposals  we assisted our visitor into the messroom which was also our principal councilchamber and there left him to talk business with mr strang while we returned to bachelors hall to let off our effervescing spirits by indulging in a running commentary on the unexpected visit and a minute analysis of the characters of macnab and big otter which i must add was decidedly favourable  it seems to me a piece of good luck that he has got here at all said lumley after we had finished the analysis  why so asked spooner  because there are some unmistakable symptoms that winter is about over and that snowshoe and dogsleigh travelling will soon be impossible  that lumley was right the change of weather during the next few days clearly proved for a thaw set in with steady power  the sun became at last warm enough to melt ice and snow visibly  we no longer listened with interest to the sounds of dropping water from eaves and trees for these had become once more familiar and soon our ears were greeted with the gurgling of rills away in mysterious depths beneath the snow  the gurgling ere long gave place to gushing and it seemed as if all nature were dissolving into liquid  while this pleasant change was going on we awoke with song and laugh and story the echoes of bachelors hallat no time very restful echoes save perhaps in the dead hours of early morning and even then they were more or less disturbed by snoring  for our sociable highlander besides having roused our spirits by his mere presence to the effervescing point was himself much elated by the mighty change from prolonged solitude to joyous companionship  my spirit feels inclined he remarked one day to jump clean out of my body  youd better not let it then said lumley for you know it might catch cold or freeze  not in this weather surely retorted macnab and if i did feel coldish in the circumstances couldnt i borrow spooners blanketcapote it might fit me then for id probably be a few sizes smaller  come mac said i give us a song  you know im wildly fond of music and most unfortunately not one of us three can sing a note  our visitor was quite willing and began at once to sing a wild ditty in the wilder language of his native land  he had a sweet tuneful sympathetic voice which was at the same time powerful so that we listened to him sometimes with enthusiasm swelling our hearts at other times with tears dimming our eyes  no one save he who has been banished to a wilderness and long bereft of music can understand the nature of our feelingsof mine at least  one evening after our wounded man had charmed us with several songs and we all of us had done what we could despite our incapacity to pay him back in kind he pulled a sheet of crumpled paper out of his pocket  come said he unfolding it ive got a poet among the men of muskrat house who has produced a song which if not marked by sublimity is at least distinguished by much truth  he said he composed it at the rate of about one line a week during the winter and his comrades said that it was quite a picture to see him agonising over the rhymes  before they found out what was the matter with him they thought he was becoming subject to fits of some sort  now then lets have a good chorus its to the tune of the british grenadiers  the world of ice and snow    come listen all good people who dwell at home at ease   ill tell you of the sorrows of them that cross the seas   and penetrate the wilderness   where arctic tempests blow   where your toes are froze   an the pint o your nose   in the world of ice and snow    youve eight long months of winter an solitude profound   the snow at your feet is ten feet deep and frozen hard the ground   and all the lakes are solid cakes   and the rivers all cease to flow   where your toes are froze   an the pint o your nose   in the world of ice and snow    no comrade to enliven no friendly foe to fight   no female near to love or cheer with pure domestic light   no books to read no cause to plead   no music fun nor go   neer a shillin nor a stiver   nor nothin whatsomediver   in the world of ice and snow    your feelins take to freezin so likewise takes your brain   you go about grumpandwheezin like a wretched dog in pain   you long for wings or some such things   but theyre not to be hadoh no   for there you are   like a fixed star   in the world of ice and snow    if you wished you couldyou would not for the very wish   would die   if you thought you wouldyou could not for you wouldnt   have heart to try   confusion worse confounded   would aggravate you so   that youd tumble down   on the frozen ground   in the world of ice and snow    but nevergivein our part islet british pluck have sway   and neversaydie my heartiesits that what wins the day   to face our fate in every state   is what weve got to do   an laugh at our trouble   till were all bent double   in the world of ice and snow    now all ye sympathisers and all ye tender souls   ye kind philanthropisers who dwell between the poles   embrace in your affections   those merry merry men who go   where your toes are froze   an the pint o your nose   in the world of ice and snow  it almost seemed as though the world of ice and snow itself had taken umbrage at macnabs song for while we were yet in the act of enthusiastically prolonging the last snooow there sounded in our ears a loud report as if of heavy artillery close at hand  we all leaped up in excitement as if an enemy were at our doors  there it goes at last cried lumley rushing out of the house followed by spooner  i was about to follow when macnab stopped me  dont get excited max theres no hurry  its the river going to break up said i looking back impatiently  yes i know that but it wont break up tonight depend on it  i was too eager to wait for more but ran to the banks of the river which at that place was fully a mile wide  the moon was bright and we could see the familiar sheet of ice as still and cold as we had seen it every day for many months past  macnabs right said i there will be no breakup tonight  not so sure of that returned lumley the weather has been very warm of late melting snow has been gushing into it in thousands of streams and the strain on the icesix feet thick though it ismust be tremendous  he was checked by another crashing report but again silence ensued and we heard no more till next morning  of course we were all up and away to the river bank long before breakfast but it was not till after that meal that the final burstup occurred  it was preceded by many reportstowards the end by what seemed quite a smart artillery fire the whole sheet of ice on the great river seemed to be rising bodily upwards from the tremendous hydraulic pressure underneath  but though the thaws of spring had converted much snow into floods of water they had not greatly affected the surface of the ice which still lay hard and solid in all its wintry strength  a greater power however was present  if the ice had been made of castiron six feet in thickness it must have succumbed sooner or later  at last as macnab said she went but who shall describe how she went  it seemed as if the mighty cake had been suddenly struck from below and shattered  then the turmoil that ensued was grand and terrible beyond conception  it was but an insignificant portion of gods waters at which we gazed but how overwhelming it seemed to us mass rose upon mass of ice the cold grey water bursting through and over all hurling morsels as large as the side of a house violently on each other till a mighty pile was raised which next moment fell with a crash into the boiling foam  then in one direction there was a rush which seemed about to carry all before it but instead of being piled upwards some of the masses were driven below were thrust deep into the mud and a jam took place  in a few minutes the ice burst upwards again and the masses were swept on to join the battalions that were already on their way towards the distant lake amid noise and crash and devastation  it seemed as if ice and snow and water had combined to revive the picture if not the reality of ancient chaos  thus the drapery of winter was rudely swept away and next morning we had the joy of seeing our river sweeping grandly on in all the liquid beauty of early and welcome spring    chapter six  an express and its results  some weeks after the breaking up of the ice as we were standing at the front gate of fort dunregan we experienced a pleasant surprise at the sight of an indian canoe sweeping round the point above the fort  two men paddled the canoe one in the bow and one in the stern  it conveyed a message from headquarters directing that two of the clerks should be sent to establish an outpost in the regions of the far north the very region from which macnabs friend big otter had come  one of the two canoemen was a clerk sent to undertake at dunregan the work of those who should be selected for the expedition and he said that another clerk was to follow in the springbrigade of boats  thats marching orders for you lumley said macnab who was beside us when the canoe arrived  you cannot tell that returned lumley  it may be that our chief will select max or spooner  did you hear any mention of names he asked of the new clerk as we all walked up to the house  no our governor does not tell us much of his intentions  perhaps your chief may be the man  hes too useful where he is suggested macnab  but we shall know when the letters are opened  having delivered his despatches the new arrival returned to us in batchelors hall where we soon began to make the most of him and were engaged in a brisk fire of question and reply when a message came for mr lumley to go to the messroom  ive sent for you lumley said our chief to say that you have been appointed to fill an honourable and responsible post  it seems that the governor with his wonted sagacity has perceived that it would be advantageous to the service to have an outpost established in the lands lying to the westward of muskrat house on the borders of lake wichikagan  as you are aware the indian big otter has come from that very place with a request from his people that such a post should be established and you have been selected by the governor to conduct the expedition  as our chief paused lumley with a modest air expressed his sense of the honour that the appointment conferred on him and his willingness to do his best for the service  i know you will lumley returned mr strang and i must do you the justice to say that i think the governor has shown his usual wisdom in the selection  without wishing to flatter you i think you are steady and selfreliant  you are also strong and big qualities which are of some value among rough men and indians not because they enable you to rule with a strong hand but because they enable you to rule without the necessity of showing the strength of your hand  bullies if you should meet with any will recognise your ability to knock them down without requiring proof thereof  to say truth if you were one of those fellows who are fond of ruling by the mere strength of their arms i should not think you fit for the command of an expedition like this which will require much tact in its leader  at the same time a large and powerful frameespecially if united to a peaceable spiritis exceedingly useful in a wild country  without the peaceable spirit it only renders its possessor a bully and a nuisance  i am further directed to furnish you with the needful supplies and men  i will see to the former being prepared and the latter you may selectof course within certain limits  now go and make arrangements for a start  the lakes will soon be sufficiently free of ice and you are aware that you will need all your time to reach your ground and get well established before next winter sets in  excuse me sir said lumley turning back as he was about to depart am i permitted to select the clerk who is to go with me as well as the men  certainly  then i should like to have mr maxby  our chief smiled as he replied i thought so  i have observed your mutual friendship  well you may tell him of the prospect before him  need i say that i was overjoyed at this prospect  i have always felt something of that disposition which animates i suppose the breast of every explorer  to visit unknown lands has always been with me almost a passion and this desire has extended even to trivial localities insomuch that i was in the habit while at fort dunregan of traversing all the surrounding countryon snowshoes in winter and in my hunting canoe in summeruntil i became familiar with all the outoftheway and the seldomvisited nooks and corners of that neighbourhood  to be appointed therefore as second in command of an expedition to establish a new tradingpost in a littleknown region was of itself a matter of much selfgratulation but to have my friend and chum jack lumley as my chief was a piece of good fortune so great that on hearing of it i executed an extravagant pirouette knocked spooner off his chair by accidentthough he thought it was done on purposeand spent five or ten minutes thereafter in running round the stove to escape his wrath  as to my fitness for this appointment i must turn aside for a few moments to pay a tribute of respect to my dear father as well as to tell the youthful reader one or two things that have made a considerable impression on me  punch said my father to me one dayhe called me punch because in early life i had a squeaky voice and a jerky mannerpunch my boy get into a habit of looking up if you can as you trot along through this world  if you keep your head down and your eyes on the ground youll see nothing of whats going on around youconsequently youll know nothing moreover youll get a bad habit of turning your eyes inward and always thinking only about yourself and your own affairs which means being selfish  besides youll run a chance of growing absentminded and wont see danger approaching so that youll tumble over things and damage your shins and tumble into things and damage your clothes and tumble off things and damage your carcase and get run over by wheels and poked in the back by carriagepoles and killed by trains and spiflicated in various waysall of which evils are to be avoided by looking up and looking round and taking note of what you see as you go along the track of lifedye see  yes father  and this continued my father is the only mode that i know of getting near to that most blessed state of human felicity selfoblivion  you wont be able to manage that altogether punch but youll come nearest to it by looking up  of course there are times when it is good for a man to look inside and take stockselfexamination you knowbut looking out and up is more difficult to my mind  and there is a kind of looking up too for guidance and blessing which is the most important of all but im not talking to you on that subject just now  im trying to warn you against that habit which so many people have of staring at the ground and seeing and knowing nothing as they go along through life  ive suffered from it myself punch more than i care to tell and thats why i speak feelingly and wish to warn you in time my boy  now theres another thing continued my father  youre fond of rambling punch and of reading books of travel and adventure and i have no doubt you think it would be a grand thing to go some day and try to discover the north pole or the south pole or to explore the unknown interior of australia  yes father i replied in a tone which made him laugh  well then punch i wont discourage you  go and discover these places by all means if you can but mark me youll never discover them if you get into the habit of keeping your eyes on the ground and thinking about yourself and your own affairs  and i would further advise you to brush up your mathematics and study navigation and learn well how to take an observation for longitude and latitude for if you dont know how to find out exactly where you are in unknown regions youll never be a discoverer  also punch get into a habit of taking notes and learn to write a good hand for editors and publishers wont care to be bothered with you if you dont and maybe the time will come when you wont be able to make out your own writing  ive known men of that stamp whose penmanship suggested the idea that a drunk fly had dipped its legs in the inkpud an straggled across his paper  these weighty words of my dear father i laid to heart at the time and as a consequence i believe have been selected on more than one occasion to accompany exploring parties in various parts of the world  one very important accomplishment which my father did not think of but which nevertheless i have been so fortunate as to acquire is sketching from nature and marking the course of rivers and trend of coasts  i have thus been able not only to make accurate maps of the wild regions i have visited but have brought home many sketches of interesting scenes of adventure which words alone could not have sufficed to pourtray  but to return from this long digression  i set about my preparations without delay and was soon ready with a small but very select amount of baggage  you may be sure also that lumley was active in his preparations and the result was that on a fine afternoon in the early spring wethat is lumley macnab big otter and iset out on our expedition in a strong new boat which was manned by two indians two scotchmen and a number of canadian halfbreedsall picked men  i must not however drag my readers through the details of our arduous voyage not because those details are devoid of interest or romance far from it but because i have other matters more interesting and romantic to relate  i will therefore pass them over in silence and at once proceed to the remote region where our lot at that time was to be cast  one beautiful evening we encamped on the margin of one of those innumerable lakelets which gleam like diamonds on the breast of the great wilderness through which for many weeks we had been voyaging the vast solitudes into which we had penetrated although nearly destitute of human inhabitants were by no means devoid of life for aquatic birds of varied form and voice made sweet music in the air as they swept over their grand domains on whirring wing or chattered happily in their rich feedinggrounds  those pleasant sounds were augmented by the axes of our men as they busied themselves in cutting firewood and preparing our encampment  the spot chosen was a piece of level sward overhung by trees and surrounded by bushes except on the side next the little lake where an opening permitted us to see the sheet of water gleaming like fire as the sun sank behind the opposite trees  by that time we had traversed hundreds of miles of wilderness stemming many rivers and rivulets crossing or skirting hundreds of lakes which varied from two hundred miles to two hundred yards in length dragging our boat and carrying our baggage over innumerable portages and making our beds each night in fair weather and foul under the trees of the primeval forest until we had at last plunged into regions almost unknownwhere probably the foot of a white man had never before rested  on the way we had passed muskrat house  there with feelings of profound regret we parted from our genial highlander promising however to send him an unusually long account of all our doings by the packet which we purposed sending to headquarters sometime during the winter  the particular duty which lumley and i undertook on the evening in question was the lighting of the fire and putting on of the kettles for supper  we were aided by our guide big otter who cut down and cut up the nearest dead trees and by salamander who carried them to the camp  three days more and we shall reach the scene of our operations said lumley to me as we watched the slowlyrising flame which had just been kindled is it not so he asked of big otter who came up at the moment with a stupendous log on his shoulders and flung it down  waugh said the indian interrogatively  ask him said lumley to salamander who was interpreter to the expedition if we are far now from the lodges of his people  three times replied the redman pointing to the sun will the great light go down and then the smoke of big otters wigwam shall be seen rising above the trees  good i shall be glad when i see it returned lumley arranging a rustic tripod over the fire for i long to begin the building of our house and getting a supply of fish and meat for winter use  now then salamander fetch the big kettle  yis sar replied our little servant with gleeful activity he was only sixteen and an enthusiast as he ran down to the lake for water  cut the pemmican up small max  ive a notion it mixes better though some fellows laugh at the idea and say that hungry men are not particular  that is true said i attacking the pemmican with a small hatchet yet have i seen these same scoffers at careful cookery doing ample and appreciative justice to the mess when cooked  just so  i have observed the same thingbut i say what is big otter looking so earnestly at over there  perhaps he sees a bear said i or a moosedeer  no he never pays so much attention to the lower animals except when he wants to shoot them  he shakes his head too  lets go see  come salamander and interpret  big otter sees something said lumley through salamander as we approached  yes big otter sees signs was the reply  and what may the signs be  signs of wind and rain and thunder  well i suppose you know best but no such signs are visible to me  ask him salamander if we may expect the storm soon  to this the indian replied that he could not tell but advised that preparation should be made for the worst  it may be well here to remark that although lumley and i as well as some of our men had acquired a smattering of the indian tongue our chief deemed it expedient to give us a regular interpreter whose knowledge of both languages was sufficiently extensive  such an interpreter had been found in the youth whom we had styled salamander and whose real name i have now forgotten  this lads knowledge of indian was perfect  he also understood french well and spoke it badly while his comprehension of english was quite equal to any emergency though his power of speaking it was exceedingly limited  what he spoke could scarcely be styled a broken tongue it was rather what we may call thoroughly smashedup english  such as it was however it served our purpose well enough and as the lad was a willing cheery somewhat humorous fellow he was justly deemed an acquisition to our party while on this subject i may add that blondin who brought the winter packet to dunregan was one of our numberalso that both our scotsmen were highlanders one being named donald bane the other james dougall why the first called the second shames tougall and the second styled the first tonal pane is a circumstance which i cannot explain  among the frenchcanadian halfbreeds our blacksmith marcelle dumont and our carpenter henri coppet were the most noteworthy the first being a short but herculean man with a jovial temperament the latter a thin lanky lugubrious fellow with a grave disposition  both were firstrate workmen but indeed the same may be said of nearly all our men who had been chosen very much because of their readiness and ability to turn their hands to anything  soon the kettles boiled  in one we infused tea  in another we prepared that thick soup so familiar to the norwester composed of pemmican and flour which is known by the name of robbiboo  from a fryingpan the same substances much thicker sent up a savoury steam under the name of richeau  there was not much conversation among us at the commencement of the meal as we sat round the campfire but when appetite was appeased muttered remarks were interchanged and when tobaccopipes came out our tongues set free from food began to wag apace  dere is noting like a good souper remarked marcelle dumont the blacksmith extending his burly form on the grass the more thoroughly to enjoy his pipe  shames tougall said donald bane in an undertone and with the deliberate slowness of his race what does he mean by soopy  tonal replied dougall with equal deliberation yed petter ask his nainsel  it be de french for supper said salamander who overheard the question  humph ejaculated dougall and bane in unison but they vouchsafed no further indication of the state of their minds  youre a true prophet big otter said lumley as a low rumbling of distant thunder broke the silence of the night which would have been profound but for our voices the crackling of the fire and the tinkle of a neighbouring rill  soon afterwards we observed a faint flash of lightning which was followed by another and deeper rumble of heavens artillery  looking up through the branches we perceived that the sky had become overcast with heavy clouds  suddenly there came a blinding flash of lightning as if the sun in noonday strength had burst through the black sky  it was followed instantly by thick almost palpable darkness and by a crash so tremendous that i sprang up with a sort of idea that the end of the world had come  the crash was prolonged in a series of rolling bumping thunders as though giants were playing bowls with worlds on the floor of heaven  gradually the echoing peals subsided into sullen mutterings and finally died away    chapter seven  a tremendous storm and other experiences  it need hardly be said that we all sprang up when the thunderclap shook the earth and began hastily to make preparation for the coming storm the broad flat branches of a majestic pine formed a roof to our encampment  dragging our provisions and blankets as near as possible to the stem of the tree we covered them up with one of our oiledcloths which were somewhat similar in appearance and texture to the tarpaulings of seafaring men though light in colour  then we ran down to the lake carried all our goods hastily to the same spot covered them up in like manner and finally dragged our boat as far up on the beach as possible  several blinding flashes and deafening peals saluted us while we were thus employed but as yet not a drop of rain or sigh of wind disturbed us and we were congratulating ourselves on having managed the matter so promptly when several huge drops warned us to seek shelter  that will do boys cried lumley referring to the boat shes safe  voila vite shouted marcelle our volatile son of vulcan as the first big drops of rain descended on him  he sprang towards the sheltering tree with wild activity  so indeed did we all but the rain was too quick for us  down it came with the suddenness and fury of a showerbath and most of us were nearly drenched before we reached our pine  there was a good deal of shouting and laughter at first but the tremendous forces of nature that had been let loose were too overwhelming to permit of continued levity  in a few minutes the ground near our tree became seamed with little glancing rivulets while the rain continued to descend like straight heavy rods of crystal which beat on the earth with a dull persistent roar  ere long the saturated soil refused to drink in the superabundance and the crystal rods descending into innumerable pools changed the roar into the plash of many waters  we stood close together for some time gazing at this scene in silent solemnity when a few trickling streams began to fall upon us showing that our leafy canopy thick though it was could not protect us altogether from such a downpour  wed better rig up one of the oiledcloths and get under it i suggested  do so said our chief  scarcely had he spoken when a flash of lightning brighter than any that had gone before revealed to us the fact that the distant part of the hitherto placid lake was seething with foam  a squall  look out shouted lumley grasping the oiledcloth we were about to spread  every one shouted and seized hold of something under the strong conviction that action of some sort was necessary to avert danger  but all our voices were silenced in a dreadful roar of thunder which as donald bane afterwards remarked seemed to split the universe from stem to stern  this was instantly followed by a powerful whirlwind which caught our oiledcloth tore it out of our hands and whisked it up into the treetops where it stuck fast and flapped furiously while some of our party were thrown down and others seemed blown away altogether as they ran into the thick bush for shelter  for myself without any definite intentions and scarce knowing what i was about i seized and clung to the branches of a small tree with the tenacity of a drowning manunable to open my eyes while sticks and leaves huge limbs of trees and deluges of water flew madly past filling my mind with a vague impression that the besom of destruction had become a veritable reality and that we were all about to be swept off the face of the earth together  strange to say in this crisis i felt no fear  i suppose i had not time or power to think at all and i have since that day thought that god perhaps thus mercifully sends relief to his creatures in their direst extremityjust as he sends relief to poor human beings when suffering intolerable pain by causing stupor  the outburst was as shortlived as it was furious  suddenly the wind ceased the floods of rain changed to slight droppings and finally stopped altogether while the thunder growled itself into sullen repose in the far distance  but what a scene of wreck was left behind  we could not of course see the full extent of the mischief for the night still remained intensely dark but enough was revealed in the numerous uprooted trees which lay all round us within the light of our rekindled campfire  from most of these we had been protected by the great pine under which we had taken shelter though one or two had fallen perilously near to usin one case falling on and slightly damaging our baggage  our first anxiety of course was our boat towards which we ran as if by one impulse the instant the wind had subsided  to our horror it was gone  only those who know what it is to traverse hundreds of leagues of an almost tenantless wilderness and have tried to push a few miles through roadless forests that have grown and fallen age after age in undisturbed entanglement since the morning of creation can imagine the state of our minds at this discovery  search towards the woods men said lumley who whatever he might have felt was the only one amongst us who seemed unexcited  we could trace no sign of anxiety in the deep tones of his steady voice  it was this qualityi may remark in passingthis calm equable flow of selfpossession in all circumstances no matter how trying that rendered our young leader so fit for the work with which he had been entrusted and which caused us all to rely on him with unquestioning confidence  he never seemed uncertain how to act even in the most desperate circumstances and he never gave way to discontent or depression  a gentle goodhumoured expression usually played on his countenance yet he could look stern enough at times and even fierce as we all knew  while we were stumbling in the dark in the direction indicated we heard the voice of salamander shouting  here it am  de botbusted on de bank  and busted it certainly was as we could feel for it was too dark to see  fetch a blazing stick one of you cried lumley  a light revealed the fact that our boat in being rolled bodily up the bank by the gale had got several of her planks damaged and two of her ribs broken  lets be thankful i said on further examination that no damage has been done to keel or gunle  nor to stem or sternpost added lumley  come we shant be delayed more than a day after all  he was right  the whole of the day that followed the storm we spent in repairing the boat and drying such portions of the goods as had got wet as well as our own garments  the weather turned out to be bright and warm so that when we lay down to rest everything was ready for a start at the earliest gleam of dawn  lumley said i next day as we rested after a good spell at the oars what would have become of us if our boat had been smashed to pieces or bodily blown away  nothing very serious would have become of us i think he replied with an amused look  but consider i said we are now hundreds of miles away from muskrat houseour nearest neighbourwith a dense wilderness and no roads between  without a boat we could neither advance nor retreat  we might of course try to crawl along river banks and lake shores which would involve the wading or swimming of hundreds of rivulets and rivers with provisions and blankets on our backs and even then winter would be down on us and we should all be frozen to death before the end of the journey  besides even if we were to escape how could we ever show face after leaving all our supply of goods and stores to rot in the wilderness  truly replied my friend with a short laugh the picture you paint is not a lively one but it is i who ought to ask you to consider  there are many ways in which we might overcome our supposed difficulties  i will explain and let me begin by pointing out that your first error lies in conceiving an improbability and an impossibility  in the first place it is improbable that our boat should get smashed to pieces such an event seldom occurs in river navigation except in the case of going over something like niagara  in the second place it is impossible that a boat should be blown bodily away  but let us suppose that for the sake of argument something of the kind had happened and that our boat was damaged beyond repair or lost could we not think you fabricate a couple of birchbark canoes in a country where such splendid birchtrees grow and with these proceed to our destination  very true said i that did not occur to me but i continued waxing argumentative what if there had been no birchtrees in this part of the country  why then max there would be nothing to prevent our placing most of our goods en cache construct a small portable raft for crossing streams and start off each man with a small load for big otters home at which we should arrive in a week or two and there set about the erection of huts to shelter us begin a fishery and remain until winter should set fast the lakes and rivers cover the land with snow and thus enable us to go back for our goods and bring them forward on sledges with aid perhaps from the redmen  true true lumley that might be done  or continued my friend we might stay where the disaster overtook us remain till winter and send big otter on to tell his people that we were coming  when one plan fails you know all youve got to do is to try another  there is only one sort of accident that might cause us a deal of trouble and some lossand that is our boat getting smashed and upset in a rapid and our goods scattered  even in that case we might recover much of what could swim but lead and iron would be lost and powder damaged  however we wont anticipate evil  look there is a sight that ought to banish all forebodings from our minds  he pointed as he spoke to an opening ahead of us which revealed a beautiful little lake whose unruffled surface was studded with picturesque bushclad islets  waterfowl of many kinds were swimming about on its surface or skimming swiftly over it  it seemed so peaceful that i was led to think of it as a miniature paradise  come henri chante sing cried lumley with a touch of enthusiasm in eye and tone  our carpenter coppet was by general consent our leading singer  he possessed a sweet tenor voice and always responded to a call with a willingness that went far to counteract the lugubrious aspect of his visage  on this occasion he at once struck up the canoesong a la claire fontaine which besides being plaintive and beautiful seemed to me exceedingly appropriate for we were at that time crossing a height of land and the clear crystal waters over which we skimmed formed indeed the fountainhead of some of the great northern rivers  the sudden burst of song had a wonderful effect upon the denizens of clear lake as we named the sheet of water for after a brief momentary pause in their chatteras if of incredulity and blazing surprisethey all arose at once in such myriads that the noise of their wings was not unlike what i may style muffled thunder  before the song was well finished we had reached the other end of the lakelet and found that a deep river ran out of it in a noreasterly direction  the current of the river was powerful and we had not proceeded many miles down its course when we came to a series of turbulent rapids  as we entered them i could not help recalling lumleys remarks about the risks we ran in descending rapids but no thought of actual danger occurred to me until i saw blondin who was our bowman draw in his oar grasp a long pole with which he had provided himself and stand up in the bow the better to look out inquiringly ahead  now it must be explained that the bowmans is the most important post in river navigation in the norwestequal at all events to that of steersman  in fact the two act in concert the bowman whose position commands the best view of rocks and dangers ahead giving direction and the watchful steersman acting sympathetically with his long oar or sweep so that should the bowman with his pole thrust the head of the boat violently to the right the steersman sweeps its stern sharply to the left thus causing the craft to spin round and shoot aside from the danger whatever it may be  of course the general flow and turmoil of a rapid indicates pretty clearly to skilled eyes where the deepest water lies nevertheless in spite of knowledge skill and experience disasters will happen at times  monsieur said blondin in french to lumley as we gained a smooth piece of water at the foot of a short rapid i know not the rocks ahead  it may be well to land and look  do so blondin  we ran the boats head on shore and while the bowman and our leader went to look at the rapids in advance most of our men got out their pipes and began to chat quietly  our scouts quickly returned saying that the rapids though rough were practicable  soon we were among them darting down with what would have seemed to any inexperienced eye perilous velocity  the river at the place was about a hundred yards wide with an unusually rugged channel but with a distinctly marked rundeep and tortuousin the middle  on both sides of the run sweeping and curling surges told of rocks close to the surface and in many places these showed black edges above water which broke the stream into dazzling foam  have a care blondin said our chief in a warning voice as the bowman made a sudden and desperate shove with his pole  a side current had swept us too far in the direction of a forbidding ledge to touch on which might have been fatal  but henri coppet who acted as steersman as well as carpenter was equal to the occasion  he bent his lanky form almost double took a magnificent sweep with the oar and seconded blondins shove so ably that we passed the danger like an arrow with nothing but a slight graze  that danger past we were on the brink of another almost before we had time to think  at the time i remember being deeply impressed in a confused way with the fact that whatever might await us below there was now no possibility of our returning up stream  we were emphatically in for it and our only hope lay in the judgment boldness and capacity of the two men who guided our frail barkdoubly frail it seemed to me when contrasted with the waters that surged around and the solid rocks that appeared to bar our way in all directions  even some of our men at the oars whose only duty was to obey orders promptly began to show symptoms of anxiety if not of fear  smooth water ahead muttered lumley pointing to a small lake into which the turbulent river ran about a quarter of a mile further down  all right soon i said but just as i spoke the boat lightly touched a rock  blondin saw that there was not sufficient depth in a passage which he had intended to traverse  with a shout to the steersman he thrust his pole over the side with all his might  the obedient craft turned as if on a pivot and would have gone straight into a safe stream in another second if blondins pole had not stuck fast either in mud or between two rocks  in a moment our bowman was whisked over the side as if he had been a feather  letting go the pole he caught the gunwale and held on  the boat was carried broadside on the rocks and the gushing water raised her upper side so high that she was on the point of rolling over when all of usi think instinctivelysprang to that side and bore her down  over the side some of you cried lumley leaping into the water on the lower side followed by six of us including myself  some of us were breast deep others on rocks stood higher  nowtogethershoveand hold on  there was no need to give us the latter caution  our boat shot into deep water and we all held on for life  fortunately the more open part of the rapid had been gained  the steersman without aid could keep us in deep water and before we had fairly scrambled back into our places we were floating safely on the quiet lake into which the river ran  you may be sure that we had matter not only for gratulation but for conversation that night at supper for after discussing our recent adventure in all its phases nearly every one of our party had numerous similar incidents to tell ofeither as having occurred to himself or to his friends  but the pleasure of that nights intercourse and repose was materially diminished by a pest with which for some time previously we had not been much afflicted  who has not heard of mosquitoes  we may inform those who have never seen or felt them that they are peculiarly virulent and numerous and vicious and bloodthirsty in the swampy lands of north america and that night we had got into a region of swamps  it may also perhaps be unknown to some people that mosquitoes do not slumberunless indeed they do it on a preconcerted plan of relieving guard  either there is a day and night shift or they do not rest at all  as a consequence we did not rest  groans and maledictions were the order of the night  we spent much time in slapping our own faces and immolated hundreds of the foe at each slap but thousands came on to refill the ranks  we buried our heads under our blankets but could not sleep for suffocation  some of the men left their faces exposed went to sleep in desperate exhaustion after hours of fruitless warfare and awoke with eyes all but shut up and cheeks like dumplings  others lay down to leeward of the fire and spent the night in a compound experience of bloodsucking and choking  one ingenious mani think it was salamanderwrapped his visage in a kerchief leaving nothing exposed save the point of his nose for breathing purposes  in the morning he arose with something like a huge strawberry on the end of his prominent feature  indeed it was a wearing night to follow such a trying day    chapter eight  deep in the wilderness we find our home which is shared with the wild beast the wild bird and the savage  availing myself now of that wonderful power which we possess of projecting the mind instantaneously through space and time i will leave our adventurous furtraders and conveying my reader still deeper into the heart of the great wilderness set him down on the margin of one of those lesser sheets of water which lie some distance in a southwesterly direction from that mighty freshwater ocean called athabasca  this lake although small when compared with the vast reservoirs which stud those northern wilds is nevertheless of goodly dimensions being about six miles in diameter and studded here and there with numerous islets some of which are almost bare rocks of a few yards in extent while others are not less than a quarter of a mile in circumference and thickly wooded to the edge  it is a somewhat peculiar lake  it does not lie as many lakes do in the bottom of a valley from which the spectator lifts his eye to surrounding heights but rests in a little hollow on a height of land from many points of which the eye looks down on the surrounding low country  it is true that in one direction westward a line of distant blue hills is seen which are obviously higher than our lake for the land rises gently towards them but when you ascend a wooded knoll close by the summit of which is free from underwood it is seen at a glance that on all other sides the land is below you and your eye takes in at one grand sweep all round the compass a view of woodland and plain mound and morass lake river and rivulet such as is probably unequalledcertainly unsurpassedin any other part of the known world  solitude profoundas far as men and their works are concernedmarked this lovely region at the time of our arrival though there was the most telling evidence of exuberant animal life everywhere to the ear as well as to the eye for the air was vocal with the plaintive cries and whistling wings of wildfowl which sported about in blissful enjoyment of their existence while occasional breaks in the glassy surface of the water and numerous widening circles told that fish were not less jovial in the realms below  this was at last the longedfor lake wichikagan  man however was not altogether absent though less obviously present at that time  at the extreme western end of the lake where the view of the regions beyond was most extensive as well as most beautiful there was a bright green patch of land free from underwood as well as trees a sort of natural lawnwhich extended with a gentle slope towards the lake ending in a pebbly beach on which the waters rested so calm and pure that it was difficult to distinguish the line where dry land and water met  a little to the right of this beautiful spot there grew a small clump of bushes and in the midst of these there crouched two indians  one was middleaged the other was entering on the period of early manhood and a strongly marked resemblance in feature and form indicated plainly that they stood to each other in the relation of father and son  both were clothed in leather with the usual ornamentation of beads scalplocks and feathers  their faces however were not disfigured with warpainta sign that at that time they were at peace with all mankind  it might have struck an observer however that for men of peace they were in suspiciously warlike attitudes  the elder savage stooped low to conceal himself behind the foliage and held a long singlebarrelled gun in readiness for instant action while the youth also stooping low held an arrow ready fitted to his short bow  the eyes of both glared with expressions that might have been indicative of joy hope hate revenge expectation or anything else you pleasefor a glare is unquestionably an ambiguous expression at the best needing a context to expound it  let two die muttered the elder redskinof course in his own tongue i had the details from his own lips afterwards and translate them as literally as may be  ho replied the son without moving his glare from the direction from which the two doomed ones were expected to emerge  presently a flock of grey wildgeese came majestically along close to the margin of the lakeflying low as well as slow and following the curvings of the shore as if in search of a suitable feedingplace at which to alight  the green of the natural lawn had evidently attracted these birds for they skimmed over the bushes behind which our indians crouched almost within pistolshot  like statues the redmen stood until the geese were over them then an arrow from the sons bow quivered in the heart of one bird and brought it fluttering heavily to the ground  at the same instant the echoes around answered to the fathers gun and another goose lay dead upon the sward  waugh exclaimed both indians as they stepped forth and picked up their game  these sons of the wilderness were not however very communicative for they spake never a word more  perhaps they were hungry and it is wellknown that hungry men are not sociable  at all events they maintained a profound silence while they cut down a small decayed tree made a good fire and prepared dinner oras the sun was beginning to decline at the timei may call it supper  the mode of preparation was simple  of course they plucked the geese an operation which revealed the fact that both birds were plump and fat next they split them open with their scalpingknives and going down to the lake cleaned them out with the same weapons  then transfixing them on two pieces of stick after the manner of redmen they stuck them up before the fire to roast  the roasting did not take long for they were either partial to underdone food or impatient and began at once upon such portions of the birds as were first ready by cutting them off and chewing away without removing the remainder of the roasts from the fire  by degrees the solid parts were devoured  then the drumsticks and other extremities were picked after that the merrythoughts and smaller bones were cleaned and not until every fragment of edible matter was consumed did father or son cease his toil or utter a word  waugh exclaimed the father at last regarding the skeleton of his meal with a sad look as if grieved that all was over  hough responded the son with a sigh of satisfaction as he wiped his fingers on the grass and sheathed his scalpingknife  then searching in their little pouches which contained flint steel tinder etcetera they drew forth two little stone pipes with wooden stems which they filled and began to smoke  the first whiff seemed to break the magic spell which had hitherto kept them silent  with another emphatic waugh the elder savage declared that the goose was good that it distended him pleasantly and that it warmed the cockles of his heartor words to that effect  to which the son replied with a not less emphatic hough that he was entirely of the same opinion  thus whiffing gently letting the smoke slowly out of their mouths and trickling it through their nostrils so as to get the full benefitor or damageof the tobacco those sons of the wilderness continued for some time to enjoy themselves while the sun sank slowly towards the western horizon converting every lake and pond and every river and streamlet into a sheet or band or thread of burnished gold  at last the elder savage removed his pipe and sent a final shot of smoke towards the sky with some vigour as he said rather abruptlymozwa my brother must be dead  i hope not father returned the youth whose name mozwa signifies in the cree language moosedeer and had been given to the lad because he possessed an unusual power of running great distances and for long periods at a sort of swinging trot that left all competitors of his tribe far behind  i also hope not said his father whose name was maqua or bear but i am forced to think so for when big otter promises he is sure to perform  he said to waboose that he would be home before the berries were ripe  the berries are ripe and he is not home  without doubt he is now chasing the deer in the happy huntinggrounds with his fathers  waboose to whom this promise had been made was a favourite niece of big otter and had been named waboose or rabbit because she was pretty innocent soft and tender  my father said mozwa rather solemnly big otter has not broken his word for all the berries are not yet ripe  he plucked a berry which chanced to be growing near his hand as he spoke and held it up to view  waugh exclaimed the elder savage  hough returned the younger  what more might have been said at that time no one can tell for the conversation was cut short by a sound which caused both indians to listen with intense earnestness  their eyes glittered like the eyes of serpents and their nostrils dilated like those of the wildhorse while each man gently moved his right hand towards his weapon  and if the too inquisitive reader should ask me how i could possibly come to know all this seeing that i was not there at the time i reply that the whole matter was related to me with minute and dramatic power by young mozwa himself not long afterwards  there was indeed ground for the excitement and earnest attention of those redmen for the sweet and distant notes of a canadian canoesong had at that moment for the first time awakened the echoes of that part of the great norwest  the two men were not indeed ignorant of the fact that such songs were sung by canadian voyageursmaqua had even heard some of them hummed once by the men of muskrat house when a good while before he had paid a visit to that remote tradingpostbut never before had father or son listened to the songs sung in full chorus as they now heard them  spellbound they waited until the sound of oars mingled with the gradually strengthening song  then their fingers closed convulsively upon their weapons and they sprang up  what does my son think  he thinks that the white man may be on the warpath and it behoves the redman like the serpent to creep into the grass and lie still  the elder savage shook his head  no mozwa  the white man never goes on the warpath except to track down murderers  when he goes through the land he travels as the redmans friend  nevertheless it is well to be on our guard  as he spoke the song which had been increasing in strength every moment suddenly burst forth with great power in consequence of the boat which bore the singers rounding a rocky point and coming into full view  to sink into the grass imitate the serpent and vanish from the scene was the work of a few seconds on the part of maqua and his son  meanwhile the boat which i need scarcely say was ours came sweeping grandly on for the fineness of the evening the calmness of the lake the splendour of the scene and the prospect of a good supper to be followed by a good nights rest lent fresh vigour to the arms as well as to the voices of our men  hold on a bit boys cried jack lumley standing up in the stern and looking shoreward this seems a pretty good place to camp  there is a better place a few yards further on said big otter who pulled the stroke oar  i know every foot of the country here  it is a soft  what does big otter see asked lumley for the indian had come to a sudden stop and was gazing earnestly ahead  he sees the smoke of a fire  is it likely to be the fire of an enemy  nomore like to be the camp of some of my people but their wigwams are two days beyond this lake  perhaps hunters are out in this direction  we shall soon seegive way lads said lumley sitting down  in a few minutes the boat was on the beach  we sprang ashore and hastened to the spot where a thin wreath of smoke indicated the remains of a campfire  of course we carried our arms not knowing whom we should meet with  after examining the spot carefully big otter stood up and was about to speak to our chief when a slight peculiar chirp was heard in the bushes  it is probable that we should have deemed it that of some small bird and paid no attention to it if our indian had not suddenly bent his head on one side as if to listen  at the same time he replied to the chirp  again the sound was heard and big otter turning round quickly without uttering a word entered the bushes and disappeared  stand ready lads said lumley in a quiet voice bringing forward the muzzle of his gun theres no saying what may come of this  scarcely had he spoken when a rustling was heard in the bushes  next moment they were thrust aside and big otter reissued from them followed by two indians whom he introduced to us as his brother and nephew  at the same time he gave us the gratifying information that his tribe had moved up from the region in which they usually dwelt for the purpose of hunting and fishing in the neighbourhood of the lake and that the camp was not more than six or seven miles distant from the spot on which we stood  to this lumley replied by expressing his gratification at the news and shaking hands with the two indians who however received the shake with some distrust and much surprise until big otter explained the nature and meaning of the white mans salutation  he also explained the meaning of what cheer  on hearing which maqua not to be outdone in politeness extended his hand for another shake and exclaimed watchee with profound gravity  mozwa with some hesitation imitated his fathers example  while we were thus pleasantly engaged a sonorous trumpet sound was heard behind the clump of small trees near us  a moment later and two magnificent wild swans sailed over the treetops and above our heads they made a tumultuously wild swoop to one side on discovering the near proximity of their enemy man but were too late  almost before any of the party had time to move a muscle two sharp cracks were heard and both swans fell stone dead with a heavy splash at the margin of the lake  it was our chief jack lumley who had brought them down with his doublebarrelled fowlingpiece  i have omitted to mention that lumley was one of the noted crackshots of the country at that timenoted not only for the deadly precision but also for the lightninglike rapidity of his aim  the indians albeit themselves pretty fair marksmen were deeply impressed with this evidence of skill and it went far to strengthen the influence which our chiefs manly proportions and genial countenance had already begun to exercise  thats a good beginning lumley said i for it not only impresses our new friends favourably but provides excellent fresh meat for supper  yonder comes better meat for supper he replied pointing towards a neighbouring height where we could see the forms of two men approaching with the carcase of a deer between them  it was donald bane and james dougall who had been thus successful these sons of the scottish highlands being ardent sportsmen as well as good marksmen had been appointed to the post of hunters to our party and were frequently sent ashore to procure fresh meat  the country is swarmin wi game muster lumley said bane as they came up and flung down the deer  not only teer an rabbits but tucks an geese an all sorts o pirds  moreover tougall she got into a bog after wan o the peasts an i thought i wass goin to lose him altogither  shames tougall says i dont you go anither step till i come to you or youre a lost man but shames went onhe was always an obstinate loon  dat is true remarked salamander  hold yer noise said bane  well sur tougall went on an sure enough the very next step down he went up to the neck  no tonald interrupted dougall it wass not up to the neck it wass only to the waist  the nixt after that it wass up to the neck but then i wass soomin  ye would hey bin soomin yet shames if i had not pulled ye oot said his friend  oo ay tonald pane  that iss true but  well dougall interrupted lumley at this point it will be better to dry your garments than discuss the question just now  we will encamp here so go to work boys  there was no need for more  during our long journey into these faroff wilds each man had fallen into his allotted place and work and the force of habit had made us so like machines that i think if we had suddenly become a party of somnambulists we would have gone through the same actions each evening on landing  accordingly lumley and i gathered small branches and rekindled the indians fire which had by that time almost gone out  marcelle dumont being professionally a forger of axes and henri coppet being an artificer in wood went off to cut down trees for firewood and donald bane with his friend set about cutting up and preparing the venison while blondin superintended and assisted salamander and the others in landing the cargo and hauling up the boat  max said lumley to me that evening during an interval in our devotion to steaks and marrowbones look around for a moment if you can tear your gross mind from the contemplation of food and tell me what you see  he made a sweep with his arm to indicate the surrounding scenery which was at the moment irradiated by the afterglow of the setting sun as well as the brightening beams of the full moon  i see said i looking up a lovely lake dotted with islets of varied shape and size with the pale moon reflected almost unbroken in its glassy waters  what else do you see asked lumley  i see around and beyond a prospect of boundless woodland of plain mound hill lake and river extending with a grand sweep that suggests ideas which can only be defined by the word immensity  i see altogether a scene the like of which i never looked upon beforea scene of beauty peacefulness and grandeur which gladdens the eye to behold and fills the heart with gratitude to its maker  you say well max returned my friend and it seems to me that we may regard this lake wichikagan which we now look upon as our inheritance in the wilderness and that the spot on which we now sit shall be for some time at least our future home    chapter nine  a bright apparitionfollowed by rumours of war  while we were thus feasting and chatting on the green sward of the region which seemed destined to be our future home an object suddenly appeared among the bushes near the edge of the circle of light cast by our campfire  this object was by no means a frightful one yet it caused a sensation in the camp which could hardly have been intensified if we had suddenly discovered a buffalo with the nose of an elephant and the tail of a rattlesnake  for one moment we were all struck dumb then we all sprang to our feet but we did not seize our firearmsoh nofor there half concealed by the bushes and gazing at us in timid wonder stood a pretty young girl with a skin much fairer than usually falls to the lot of indian women and with light brown hair as well as bright blue eyes in all other respectsin costume and humble bearingshe resembled the women of the soil  i would not willingly inflict on the reader too much of my private feelings and opinions but perhaps i may be excused for saying that i fell over head and ears in love with this creature at once  i make no apology for being thus candid  on the contrary i am prepared rather to plume myself on the quick perception which enabled me not only to observe the beauty of the girls countenance but what is of far more importance the inherent goodness which welled from her loving eyes yes reader call me an ass if you will but i unblushingly repeat that i felltumbledplunged headlong in love with her  so did every other man in the camp  there is this to be said in excuse for us that we had not seen any members of the fair sex for many months and that the sight of this brilliant specimen naturally aroused many pleasant recollections of cousins sisters nieces aunts mothers grandmotherswell perhaps i am going too far though after all the tender lovingkindness in this girls eyes might well have suggested grandmothers  before any of us could recover the use of our limbs big otter had glided rapidly towards the girl  grasping her by the hand he led her towards lumley and introduced her as his sisters daughter waboose  the redman was evidently proud as well as fond of his fair niece and equally clear did it become in a short time that the girl was as fond and proud of him  your relative is very fair said lumley  she might almost have been the daughter of a white man  she is the daughter of a white man  indeed  yes her father was a white hunter who left his people and came to dwell with us and married my sister  he was much loved and respected by us  he lived and hunted and went on the warpath with us for many yearsthen he was killed  in war  i asked beginning to feel sympathetic regard for the father of one who had stirred my heart tobut i forget  it is not my intention to bore the reader with my personal feelings  no answered the indian  he perished in attempting to save his wife from a dangerous rapid  he brought her to the bank close to the head of a great waterfall and many hands were stretched out to grasp her  she was saved but the strength of the brave paleface was gone and we knew it not  before we could lay hold of his hand the current swept him away and carried him over the falls  how sad said lumley  what was the name of this white man  he told us that his name was weeumbut said the indian turning abruptly to waboose whose countenance betrayed feelings which were obviously aroused by other matters than this reference to her lost father my child has news of some sort  let her speak  thus permitted waboose opened her lips for the first timedisclosing a double row of bright little teeth in the actand said that she had been sent by her mother in search of maqua and his son as she had reason to believe that the camp was in danger of being attacked by dogrib indians  on hearing this maqua and mozwa rose picked up their weapons and without a word of explanation entered the bushes swiftly and disappeared  big otter looked after them for a moment or two in grave silence  you had better follow them suggested lumley  if you should require help send a swift messenger back and we will come to you  the indian received this with a quiet inclination of the head but made no reply  then taking his niece by the hand he led her into the bushes where his relatives had entered and like them disappeared  it seems like a dream said i to lumley as we all sat down again to our steaks and marrowbones  what seems like a dream maxthe grub  no the girl  truly yes  and a very pleasant dream too  almost as good as this bone  oh you unsentimental unsympathetic monster  does not the sight of a pretty young creature like that remind you of home and all the sweet refining influences shed around it by woman  i cannot say that it doeshand me another no not a little thing like that a big one full of marrow so  you see old boy a band of beads round the head a skyblue cloth bodice a skirt of green flannel reaching only to the knees cloth leggings ornamented with porcupine quills and moccasined feet do not naturally suggest my respected mother or sisters  for the first time in our acquaintance i felt somewhat disgusted with my friends levity and made no rejoinder  he looked at me quickly with slightly raised eyebrows and gave a little laugh  with a strong effort i crushed down my feelings and said in a tone of forced gaiety  well well things strike people in strangely different lights  i thought not of the girls costume but her countenance  come then max returned my friend with that considerate good nature which attracted men so powerfully to him i admit that the girls face might well suggest the thought of dearer faces in distant landsand especially her eyes so different from the piercing black orbs of indian squaws  did you note thethe softness i was going to say truthfulness of her strangely blue eyes  did i note them  the question seemed to me so ridiculous that i laughed by way of reply  i observed that lumley cast on me for the second time a sharp inquiring glance then he said  but i say max we must have our arms looked to and be ready for a sudden call  you know that i dont love fighting  especially at the commencement of our sojourn would i avoid mixing myself up with indians quarrels but if our guide comes back saying that their camp is in danger we must help him  it would never do you know to leave women and children to the mercy of ruthless savages  leave woman and children  i exclaimed vehemently thinking of only one woman at the moment i should think not  the tone of indignation in which i said this caused my friend to laugh outright  well well he said in a low tone its a curious complaint and not easily cured  what he meant was at the time a mystery to me  i have since come to understand  i suppose youll all agree with me lads said lumley to the men who sat eating their supper on the opposite side of the fire and raising his voice for we had hitherto been conversing in a low tone if big otters friends need help well be ready to give it  of course a hearty assent was given and several of the men having finished supper rose to examine their weapons  the guns used by travellers in the great norwest in those days were long singlebarrels with flintlocks the powder in which was very apt to get wet through primingpans and touchholes so that frequent inspection was absolutely necessary  as our party consisted of twelve men including ourselves and each was armedlumley and myself with doublebarrelled fowlingpieceswe were able if need be to fire a volley of fourteen shots  besides this my chief and i carried revolvers which weapons had only just been introduced into that part of the country  we were therefore prepared to lend effective aid to any whom we thought it right to succour  scarcely had our arrangements been made when the lithe agile form of mozwa glided into the camp and stood before lumley  the lad tried hard to look calm grave and collected as became a young indian brave but the perspiration on his brow and his labouring chest told that he had been running far at the utmost speed while a wild glitter in his dark eye betrayed strong emotion  pointing in the direction whence he had come he uttered the namebig otter  all right  i understand you said lumley springing up  now boys sharps the word we will go to the help of our guide  but two of you must stay behind to guard our camp  do you donald bane and james dougall remain and keep a bright lookout  is it to stop here we are asked bane with a mutinous look  yes exclaimed our leader so sharply that the mutinous look faded  an are we to be left behind growled dougall when theres fightin to be done  i have no time for words dougall said lumley in a low voice but if you dont at once set about preparation to defend the camp ill give you some fighting to do that you wont relish  dougall had no difficulty in understanding his leaders meaning  he and his friend at once set about the required preparations  now then mozwa said lumley  the young indian who had remained erect and apparently unobservant with his arms crossed on his still heaving chest turned at once and went off at a swift trot followed by all our party with the exception of the illpleased highlanders who in their eagerness for the fray did not perceive that theirs might be a post of the greatest danger as it certainly was one of trust  tonald said dougall sitting down and lighting his pipe after we were gone i wass vera near givin muster lumley a cood threshin  hum its well ye didnt try shames  an what for no  because hes more nor a match for ye  i dont know that tonald  im as stout a man as he is whatever  oo ay so ye are shames but yere no a match for him  hes been to school among thae englishers an can use his fists let me tell you  at this dougall held up a clenched hand hard and knuckly from honest toil that was nearly as big as a small ham  regarding it with much complacency he said slowly  an dont you think tonald that i could use my fist too  maybe you could in a kind o way returned the other also filling his pipe and sitting down but ill tell ye what muster lumley would do to you shames if ye offered to fight him  he would dance round you like a cooper round a cask then first of all he would flatten your nosewhich is flat enough already whateverwi wan hand an hed drive in your stummick wi the other  then he would give you one between the two eyes an raise a bridge there to make up for the wan hed destroyed on your nose an before you had time to sneeze he would put a rainbow under your left eye  or ever you had time to wink he would put another under your right eye and if that didnt settle you he would give you a finishin dig in the ribs shames trip up your heels an lay you on the ground where i make no doubt you would lie an meditate whether it wass worth while to rise up for more  all that would be verra unpleasant tonald said dougall with a humorous glance from the corners of his small grey eyes but i duffer with ye in opeenion  you would duffer in opeenion with the apostle paul if he wass here said the other rising as his pipe was by that time well alight and resuming his work but well better obey muster lumleys orders than argufy about him  ill agree with you there tonald just to convince you that i dont always duffer said the argumentative highlander rising to assist his not less argumentative friend  the two men pursued their labour in silence and in the course of an hour or so had piled all the baggage in a circle in the middle of the open lawn so as to form a little fortress into which they might spring and keep almost any number of savages at bay for some time because savages unlike most white men have no belief in that glory which consists in rushing on certain death in order to form a bridge of dead bodies over which comrades may march to victory  each savage is for the most part keenly alive to the importance of guarding his own life so that a band of savages seldom makes a rush where certain death awaits the leaders  hence our two highlanders felt quite confident of being able to hold their little fort with two guns each and a large supply of ammunition  meanwhile mozwa continued his rapid trot through wood and brake over swamp and plain and grassy mound  being all of us by that time strong in wind and limb we followed him without difficulty  lads be careful said lumley as we went along that no shot is fired whatever happens until i give the word  you see max he continued in a lower tone nothing but the sternest necessity will induce me to shed human blood  i am here to open up trade with the natives not to fight them or mix myself up in their quarrels  at the same time it would be bad policy to stand aloof while the tribes we have come to benefit and of which our guide is a member are assailed by enemies  we must try what we can do to make peace and risk something in the attempt  arrived at the indian camp we found a band of braves just on the point of leaving it although by that time it was quite dark  the tribeor rather that portion of it which was encamped in leathern wigwams on one of the grassy mounds with which the country aboundedconsisted of some hundred families and the women and children were moving about in great excitement while the warriors were preparing to leave  i was struck however by the calm and dignified bearing of one whitehaired patriarch who stood in the opening of his wigwam talking to a number of the elder men and women who crowded round him  he was the old chief of the tribe and being no longer able to go on the warpath remained with the aged men and the youths whose duty it was to guard the camp  my children he said as we came up fear not  the great spirit is with us for our cause is just  he has sent big otter back to us in good time and see has he not also sent white men to help us  the warparty was detained on our arrival until we should hold a palaver with the old chief and principal braves  we soon ascertained that the cause of disagreement between the two tribes and of the declaration of war was a mere trifle strongly resembling in that respect the causes of most wars among civilised nations  a brave of the one tribe had insultingly remarked that a warrior of the other tribe had claimed the carcase of a moosedeer which had been mortally wounded and tracked and slain by him the insulter  the insulted one vowed that he shot the deer deadhe would scorn to wound a deer at alland had left it in hiding until he could obtain assistance to fetch the meat  young hotheads on both sides fomented the quarrel until older heads were forced to take the matter up they became sympathetically inflamed and finally war to the knife was declared  no blood had yet been shed but it was understood by big otters friendswho were really the injured partythat their foes had sent away their women and children preparatory to a descent on them  now salamander said lumley who although he had considerably increased his knowledge of the indian language by conversing with the guide during our voyage preferred to speak through an interpreter when he had anything important to say tell the old chief that this warparty must not go forth  tell him that the great white chief who guides the affairs of the traders has sent me to trade furs in this region and that i will not permit fighting  this was such a boldalmost presumptuous way of putting the matter that the old red chief looked at the young white chief in surprise but as there was neither bluster nor presumption in the calm countenance of lumleyonly firmness coupled with extreme good humourhe felt somewhat disconcerted  how will my white brother prevent war asked the old chief whose name was muskrat  by packing up my goods and going elsewhere replied lumley directly without an instants hesitation in the indian tongue  at this there was an elongation of the faces of the men who heard it and something like a soft groan from the squaws who listened in the background  that would be a sad calamity said old muskrat and i have no wish to fight but how will the young white chief prevent our foes from attacking us  tell him salamander that i will do so by going to see them  my young braves will be happy to go out under the guidance of so strong a warrior returned muskrat quite delighted with the proposal  nay old chief you mistake me i will take no braves with me  no matter returned muskrat doubtless the white men and their guns will be more than a match for our red foes  still you misunderstand said lumley  i am no warrior but a man of peace  i shall go without guns or knivesand alone except that i will ask young mozwa to guide me  alone unarmed murmured the old man in astonishment almost too great for expression  what can one do against a hundred with weapons  you shall see said lumley with a light laugh as he turned to me  now max dont speak or remonstrate like a good fellow we have no time to discuss only to act  i find that muskrats foes speak the same dialect as himself so that an interpreter is needless  i carry two revolvers in the breast of my coat  you have a claspknife in your pocket make me a present of it will you  thanks  now have our men in readiness for instant action  dont let them go to rest but let them eat as much and as long as they choose  keep the old chief and his men amused with long yarns about what we mean to do in these regions and dont let any one follow me  keep your mind easy  if i dont return in three hours you may set off to look for me though it will i fear be of no use by that time and stay if you should hear a pistolshot run out with all our men towards it  now mozwa lead on to the enemys camp  the young indian who was evidently proud of the trust reposed in him and cared nothing for danger stalked into the forest with the look and bearing of a dauntless warrior    chapter ten  salamander gives and receives a surprise and war is averted by wise diplomacy  it has been already said that our interpreter salamander possessed a spirit of humour slightly tinged with mischief which while it unquestionably added to the amusement of our sojourn in those lands helped not a little to rouse our anxieties  on returning to our men after parting from lumley for the purpose of giving them their instructions i found that salamander was missing and that no one could tell where he had gone  i caused a search to be made for him which was unsuccessful and would have persevered with it if there had not pressed upon me the necessity of obeying my chiefs orders to keep the savages amused  this i set about doing without delay and having like my friend been a diligent student of the language on the journey found that i succeeded more than i had ventured to hope for in communicating my ideas  as the disappearance of salamander however was the subject which exercised my mind most severely at the time and as he afterwards gave me a full account of the cause in detail i shall set it down here  being possessed that evening as he confessed with a spirit of restlessness and remembering that our two highlanders had been left to guard the camp at lake wichikagan he resolved to pay them a visit  the distance as i have said elsewhere was not much more than six milesa mere trifle to one who was as fleet as a young deer and strong as an old bear  he soon traversed the ground and came up to the camp  at first he meant merely to give the men a surprise but the spirit to which i have already referred induced him to determine on giving them a fright  approaching very cautiously therefore with this end in view he found that things were admirably arranged for his purpose  donald bane and james dougall having finished their fortress in the centre of the open lawn as already described returned to their fire which it may be remembered was kindled close to the edge of the bushes  there they cooked some food and devoured it with the gusto of men who had well earned their supper  thereafter as a matter of course they proceeded to enjoy a pipe  the night besides being fine and calm was unusually warm thereby inducing a feeling of drowsiness which gradually checked the flow of conversation previously evoked by the pipes  it is not likely the redskins will come up here to give us a chance when theres such a lot of our lads gone to meet them said bane with a yawn  i agree with you tonald answered dougall grumpily  it is quite new to hev you agreein with me so much shames returned bane with another yawn  you are right  an it is more lively to disagree whatever rejoined dougall with an irresistible because sympathetic yawn  oo ay thats true shames  yieaou  this yawn was so effusive that dougall refusing to be led even by sympathy yawned internally with his lips closed and swallowed it  the conversation dropped at this point though the puffs went on languidly  as the men were extended at fulllength one on his side the other on his back it was not unnatural that being fatigued they should both pass from the meditative to the dreamy state and from that to the unconscious  it was in this condition that salamander discovered them  asleep at their posts he said mentally  that deserves punishment  he had crept on hands and knees to the edge of the bushes and paused to contemplate the wideopen mouth of bane who lay on his back and the prominent right ear of dougall whose head rested on his left arm  the debris of supper lay around themscraps of pemmican pannikins spoons knives and the broken shells of tealduck eggs which having been picked up some time before had gone bad  suddenly an inspirationdoubtless from the spirit of mischiefcame over salamander  there was one small unbroken egg on the ground near to banes elbow  just over his head the branch of a bush extended  to genius everything comes handy and nothing amiss  salamander tied the egg to a piece of small twine and suspended it to the twig in such fashion that the egg hung directly over banes wideopen mouth  at a glance he had seen that it was possible to lay a light hand on the inner end of the branch and at the same time bend his mouth over dougalls ear  he drew a long breath for it was a somewhat delicate and difficult being a duplicate manoeuvre  pressing down the branch very slowly and with exceeding care he guided the egg into banes mouth  he observed the precise moment when it touched the sleepers tongue and then exploded a yell into dougalls ear that nearly burst the tympanum  banes jaws shut with a snap instantly  need weno we need not dougall leaped up with a cry that almost equalled that of salamander both men rushed to the fortress and bounded into it the one spurting out gaelic expletives the other rotten egg and bits of shell  they seized their guns and crouched glaring through the various loopholes all round with finger on trigger ready to sacrifice at a moments notice anything with life that should appear  indeed they found it difficult in their excited condition to refrain from blazing at nothing  their friendly foe meanwhile had retired highly delighted with his success  he had not done with them however  by no means  the spirit of mischief was still strong upon him and he crept into the bushes to meditate  it wass an evil speerut shames gasped donald bane when he had nearly got rid of the egg  did you smell his preath  no tonald it wass not  spirits are not corporeal and cannot handle eggs much less cram them down a mans throat  it wass the egg you did smell  that may be so shames but it could not be a redskin for he would be more likely to cram a scalpin knife into my heart than an egg into my mouth  iss it not dreamin ye wass an tryin to eat some more in your sleep you wass always fond of overeatin yourselfwhativertonald  before this question could be answered another yell of the most appalling and complex nature rang out upon the nightair struck them dumb and seemed to crumple up their very hearts  salamander had been born with a natural gift for shrieking and being of a sprightly disposition had cultivated the gift in boyhood afterwards being also a good mimic he had made the subject a special study with a view to attract geese and other game towards him  that he sometimes prostituted the talent was due to the touch of genius to which i have already referred  when the crumpledup organs began to recover bane said to dougall shames this iss a bad business  dougall having been caught twice that evening was on his guard  he would not absolutely agree with his friend but admitted that he was not far wrong  again the yell burst forth with intensified volume and complicated variation  salamander was young he did not yet know that it is possible to overact  shames whispered bane i hev got a notion in my hid  i hope its a coot wan tonald for the notions that usually git into it might stop there with advantage  they are not much to boast of  you shall see  just you keep talkin out now an then as if i wass beside you an dont whativer ye do fire into the bushes  ferry coot answered dougall  another moment and donald bane glided over the parapet of their fort at the side nearest the lake and creeping serpentfashion for a considerable distance round gained the bushes where he waited for a repetition of the cry  he had not long to wait  with that boldness not to say presumption which is the child of success salamander now began to make too many drafts on genius and invented a series of howls so preposterously improbable that it was impossible for even the most credulous to believe them the natural cries of man beast demon or monster  following up the sound donald bane soon came to a little hollow where in the dim light he perceived salamanders visage peering over a ridge in the direction of the fortress his eyes glittering with glee and his mouth wideopen in the act of giving vent to the hideous cries  the highlander had lived long in the wilderness and was an adept in its ways  with the noiseless motion of a redskin he wormed his way through the underwood until close alongside of the nocturnal visitor and then suddenly stopped a howl of more than demoniac ferocity by clapping a hand on salamanders mouth  with a convulsive wriggle the youth freed his mouth and uttered a shriek of genuine alarm but banes strong arm pinned him to the earth  ye dirty loon growled the man in great wrath wass you thinkin to get the better of a heelandman  come along with ye  ill give you a lesson that youll not forgetwhatever  despite his struggles bane held salamander fast until he ceased to resist when he grasped him by the collar and led him towards the little fort  at first salamander had been on the point of confessing the practical joke but the darkness of the night induced him to hope for another escape from his position  he had not yet uttered a word and as he could not distinguish the features of the highlander it was possible he thought that the latter might have failed to recognise him  if he could give him the slip he might afterwards deny having had anything to do with the affair  but it was not easy to give the slip to a man whose knuckly hand held him like a vice  shames said bane as he came near the fortress ive cot the peast come oot man an fetch a stick wi you  ill had im while you lay on  salamander who understood well enough what he might expect no sooner heard dougall clambering over the barricade than he gathered himself up for a tremendous wriggle but received such a fearful squeeze on the neck from the vicelike hand of his captor that he was nearly choked at the moment a new idea flashed into his fertile brain  his head dropped suddenly to one side his whole frame became limp and he fell as it were in a heap on the ground almost bringing the highlander on the top of him  oh the miserable cratur exclaimed bane relaxing his grasp with a feeling of selfreproach for he had a strong suspicion that his captive really was salamander  i do believe ive killed him  wow  shames man lend a hand to carry him to the fire and plow up a bit flame that we may see what weve gotten  iss he tead tonald asked dougall in a pitiful tone as he came forward  no shames hes no tead yet  take up his feet man an ill tak his shouthers  dougall went to salamanders feet turned his back to them and stooped to take them up as a man takes a wheelbarrow  he instantly received a kick or rather a drive from salamanders soles that sent him sprawling on his hands and knees  donald bane stooping to grasp the shoulder received a buffet on the cheek which being unexpected sent him staggering to the left while the sly youth springing to his feet bounded into the bushes on the right with a deeptoned roar ending in a laugh that threw all his previous efforts quite into the shade  the highlanders rose but made no attempt to pursue  my friend said bane softly if that wass not an evil speerut i will be fery much surprised  no tonald it wass not a speerut replied the other as they returned to their fortress  speeruts will not be kickin an slappin like that they are not corporeal  while these scenes were enacting on the margin of lake wichikagan lumley and mozwa arrived at the enemys camp  it was a warcamp  all the women and children had been sent away none but armed and painted braves remained  they were holding a palaver at the time  the spot was the top of an open eminence which was so clear of underwood that the approach of a foe without being seen was an impossibility  although the night was rather dark lumley and his guide had been observed the instant they came within the range of vision  no stir however took place in the camp for it was instantly perceived that the strangers were alone  with the grave solemnity of redskin warriors they silently awaited their coming a small fire burned in their midst for they made no attempt at concealment  they were prepared to fight at a moments notice  the red flames gleamed on their dusky faces and glittered in their glancing eyes as lumley and mozwa strode boldly into the circle and stood before the chief  intense surprise filled the hearts of the warriors at this unexpected apparition of a white man but not an eye or muscle betrayed the smallest symptom of the feeling  the paleface is welcome said the chief after a short pause  the paleface is glad to meet with his darkskinned brother and thanks him returned lumley  if the surprise at the sudden appearance of the paleface was great the astonishment to find that he spoke the indian tongue was greater but still the feeling was not betrayed  after a few short complimentary speeches our hero came at once to the point  my brothers he said looking round on the dusky warriors who remained sitting all the time the white chief of the furtraders has sent me into this country to trade with you  this statement was received with a waugh of satisfaction from several of the warriors  and continued lumley i have brought menstrong men who can work wellto help me to build a house so that we may live among you and hunt together  he paused here to let the statement have its full effect  then he continued  i have also brought plenty of guns and powder and lead  again he paused and an emphatic waugh proved that the remark was fully appreciated  the white man knows continued lumley in a more flowing style that his red brothers have need of many things which they do not possess while the white man is in need of furs and does not possess them  it is for the good of each that we should exchange  the great spirit who is allwise as well as allgood has seen fit to scatter his children over a wide world and he has given some of them too much of one thing some of them too much of another  why has he done so  may we not think that it is for the purpose of causing his children to move about the world and mingle and help each other and so increase love  some of the bad children prefer to move about and steal  but there is no need it is easier to do good than to do evil  if all men would help and none would steal there would be more than enough for all  again a pause  some of the savages who were thoughtful men were greatly tickled in their minds by the arguments set forth  others who could not understand were deeply impressed  now continued lumley coming to the marrow of his discourse the redmen have more than enough of furs  waugh in a tone of emphasis that implied thats true  and the palefaces have few furs but want some very much  waugh interrogatively in a tone that implied what then  well but the palefaces are not poor  they are rich and have far too much of many things  they have far too much of those pleasant sweet things called sugar and molasses the indians involuntarily licked their lips  too much cloth as bright as the sun at setting and as blue as the sky at noon the indian eyes glistened  too many guns and too much powder and shot the savage eyes glared  they have more beads and blankets and hatchets and tobacco than they know what to do with so they have sent some of these things here to be given to you in exchange for furs and food and leather  the waughs and hows and hos with which these remarks were followed up were so hearty that lumley thought it best to make a considerable pause at this point then he resumed  but my brothershe stopped for a considerable time and looked so grave that the hearts of the redmen sank lest the glorious vision which had been suddenly revealed to them should be as suddenly withdrawn in some way  but repeated lumley again with a sort of awful emphasis the palefaces detest war  they can fightyes and when they must fight they will fight but they do not love fighting and if they are to stay here and open up trade with their guns and their powder and their blankets and beads and cloth he wisely went all over it again for the sake of effect there must be peace in the land  if there is war the palefaces will take all their good things and go awaywaugh  finishing off in the true redman style lumley sat down with decision as though to say now the ball is at your own feet kick it which way you please  then the chief of the savages rose with dignity but with a tinge of eagerness which he could not altogether conceal and said  let not my white brother talk of going away  war shall cease at his bidding  let him and his palefaced warriors fell trees and build wigwams and hunt  we have plenty fursthe black fox the red fox the beaver the marten the minks the bear and many other animals are plentiful  we will exchange them for the goods of the white man  we will bury the hatchet and smoke the calumet of peace and the sound of the warwhoop shall no more be heard in the landwaugh  are my brothers ready to go to the camp of big otter and make friends at once asked lumley  this was a testing question and for some time remained unanswered while the chiefs and braves looked preposterously solemn  at last however they seemed to make up their minds and the chief replied we are ready  that night the hostile savages met on the shores of lake wichikagan and encamped with the furtraders  fires were lighted and kettles put on a royal feast was prepared and the reunited tribes of redmen finally buried the warhatchet there and smoked the pipe of peace    chapter eleven  lumley on dutyfort wichikagan begins to grow  the bold and prompt manner in which peace was established among the contending savages of lake wichikagan did more to raise my friend jack lumley in their estimation than if he had fought a hundred successful battles and subdued a nation of foes  it seemed to be felt on all hands that he was a man who could be trusted and his pointed reference to the great spirit conveyed an impression that truth and justice must be his guiding principles  and on this point these children of nature read his character correctly for as i have had frequent occasion to observe my friend was strictly truthful and i might almost say sternly just  duty indeed was his polestarduty to god and man  max he once said to me when we had got into a confidential chat beside our campfire let me advise you to take a sound view and a good grasp of what men call duty  there is a right and a wrong in everything that the mind or hand of man can be brought to bear upon  it is our duty to discover and do the right if we canto recognise and avoid the wrong  true success in life depends upon this principle being acted on at all times and in all things  even what worldly men deem successthe acquisition of wealth fame etceterais largely dependent on strict regard to duty  of course i heartily agreed with him in this matter but i am free to confess that i feel woefully far short of the standard to which he attained  perhaps a soft and somewhat undecided nature had something to do with my failure  i say not this by way of excuse but explanation whatever the cause i felt so very far below my friend that i looked up to him as a sort of demigod  strange to say his affection for me was also very strong  he never seemed to perceive my weak pointsbut then he was of a largehearted generous disposition and he came to be loved not only by me and the indians but by the men of the expedition some of whom although good workers were rather turbulent fellows  all things having been satisfactorily arranged as detailed in the last chapter we now set about preparation for wintering  the first point to settle was the site for our establishment and a council of the whole party was called to settle it on the lawnlike spot on the margin of our lake where the first fire had been kindled  no spot could be better i think said our chief as we stood in a picturesque group around him with masqua mozwa and several other indians looking on  the little rising ground and clump of wood at the back will shelter us from the north winds the underwood on the east and west is sufficiently high to form a slight protection in those directions and to the south the islandstudded bosom of lake wichikagan lies spread out before us to supply us with fish and water and a cheering prospect  and to remind donald bane and james dougall said i of loch lomond or loch ness  i rather think said lumley that it strikes dougall as having more resemblance to loch awe if we may judge from the awesome expression of his face  weel muster lumley returned dougall with a slight smile not to spoil your choke sir it wass thinkin o the fush i wass an wonderin if they wass goot fush  big otter says they are good returned our chief and i think we may rely on his opinion  theres a little stretch of rock over there jutting out from the shore which could be made into a capital pier for our boats and canoes without much labour  what say you henri coppet could not a few trees and some planks be easily fitted to these rocks  oui monsieuryes sirvery easily answered the carpenter in french  ay an wan or two big stones on the other pint o rocks there observed donald bane would make a goot breakwater an a fine harbour whatever  and im sure nothing could be finer than the view said i with feelings of enthusiasm  well then since we all seem agreed on that pointhere shall our house be raised rejoined lumley driving the point of a stick he carried into the ground  come now boys go to work  max you will superintend the placing of the goods in a secure position and cover them with tarpaulin in the meantime  well soon have a hut ready  dumont set up your forge under yon pinetree and get your tools ready overhaul your nets blondin and take salamander to help youespecially the seinenet ill try a sweep this afternoon or tomorrow  come here max i want to speak with you  now max he said when we had gone aside some distance see that you arrange the goods so that they may be easily guarded and dont let the redskins come too near  they may be honest enough but we wont throw temptation in their way  we shall want one of them by the bye to keep house for us  what say you to hiring waboose  out of the question said i quickly  why so max  why becausedont you seeshes far above that sort o thing shes quite a kind of princess in the tribe  havent you noticed how respectful they all are to her  and besides she is sowhat one might almost call ladylike  i am convinced that her father must have been a gentleman  perhaps so returned lumley with a quiet laugh well we wont insult her by asking her to fill such a position  away to work now  i will sketch out the plan of our establishment  when the goods are all safe send your men to fell heavy timber for the houses and let them also cut some firewood  off you go  in a few minutes we were all at work busy as beescarrying hauling cutting hammering and chopping while some of the indians looked on intensely interested others assisted under the direction of big otter and the woods resounded with the noise of the newborn activity  soon blondin had a net down and before evening we had caught enough of that splendid staple of the north american lakes the whitefish to supply us with a good meal and leave something over for our red friends  i observed during these operations that after planning sketching and measuring our chief took his axe into the wood and felled a tall pine from which he proceeded to remove the branches and bark  towards evening he took a spade and dug a deep hole in the ground on the most prominent part of the lawn in front of what was to be our future home  come now four of you he said and help me to set up our flagstaff  i ran with three others to assist and in another minute or two the end of the tall taper stick was dropped into the hole and fixed there  a hole had been already bored in the top and a rope rove through it to which lumley soon attached the corners of a small red bundle  ho lads he shouted when all was ready in a voice that rang out full and strong fall in  we had previously been trained to obey this order with the utmost alacrity by running towards our leader carrying our loaded guns with us and forming into line so as to be ready for any emergency  it was a fancy of lumley to drill us thus and we fell in with his humour most of us counting it a piece of fun to break off from what we chanced to be doing at the moment the order was given and trying who should be first to reach the spot where he stood  as our guns were always loaded and primed we never had to lose time in charging them  on the occasion of which i write we amazed and somewhat alarmed the indians by our prompt action for we stood together in a silent row in less than half a minute after the summons was shouted  i have called you up lads said lumley to take part in a little ceremony  through the goodness of the almighty we have been brought in safety and health to our new home  it is already part of the queen of englands dominions and i now take possession of it in the name of the hudsons bay company  may god prosper and bless us while we stay here  he hoisted as he spoke the small red bundle which when shaken out proved to be a flag on which were the letters hbc in white  now boys send a volley at the new moon up there  readypresent fire  hoorah  the crash of the united volley and the wild huzza which followed caused many a redskins heart to leap and would doubtless have caused many a foot to run but for the fact that their own redskin brotherbig otterwas one of the firing party and perhaps the wildest cheerer of the band  the ceremony ended orders were given to knock off work for the day and set about the preparation oh supper  the food was sweet that night sweeter than usual for we were very hungry the stars were bright that night brighter than usual for we were very happy at the auspicious commencement of our sojourn and our sleep was unusually sound for we felt safer than ever under the guidance of a chief who had proved himself so capable of turning threatened war into peace  this being the condition of things it was not surprising that we indulged in a longer rest than usual and continued to slumber long after the sun had risen and converted lake wichikagan into a glorious sheet of silver  it is true that our guide with that sense of responsibility which seems to weigh heavy on guides even when asleep had awakened at the usual hour of startingdaybreakand from the mere force of habit had given forth his accustomed and sonorous leve leverise rise  from the mere force of habit too we all turned round to have a few seconds repose on our other sides before obeying the order but suddenly light flashed into our minds and various growls in varied keys saluted our guide  go to sleep men said our chief with a half laugh which ended in a sigh of contentment  french growls of doubtful meaning issued from the lips of dumont and coppet but blondin condescended on no remark at all unless pooh may be considered such  hoots manheighho remonstrated donald bane while his comrade dougall merely said wow and followed it with a prolonged snore  for myself i felt inclined to laugh but being much too lazy to do so turned over and was instantly lost again in oblivion  the whole camp was immediately in the same condition and thus as i have said we remained till the sun was high  soon after daybreak however the indians began to stir in their camp which lay a little apart from oursand ascending a slight eminence whence they could look down on our slumbering forms at their leisure squatted there and continued to gazeperhaps to wonder how long we meant to rest  they were soon joined by othersmen women and childrenfrom the neighbouring camp  selfrestraint at least in some matters is a characteristic of the redmen and they remained very patiently and silently there even the children spoke in whispers and gazed in solemn earnestness at our slumbering camp  when we rose and began active preparations for breakfast the little ones melted awayinfluenced either by fear or by the orders of their parents  they returned however in greater force than ever when we began the labours of the day  being all more or less naked they resembled a band of brown monkeys without tails whose great eyes were capable of expressing only one powerful sentimentthat of surprise  thus watched with deep interest by a large portion of the tribe we proceeded to the erection of the first house  the hall will stand here max said lumley to me as i approached him bearing one end of a long squared log on my shoulder the other end of which was carried by big otter while bane and one of the canadians supported the centre of it  set it down there ladsa little more this wayso  we laid the timber on the green sward facing the lake in such a way that it corresponded with the front line of a large square which had been traced on the turf by lumley  stay with me max i want your help and advice  the men went back to the bush from which at the same moment four others of our party issued bearing a similar log  it was laid at the other side of the square parallel to the first one in a few minutes the two end logs were carried up and deposited in their places  these logs had all been cut squared mortised at their ends and fitted together in the woods before being brought to the lawn  now the question is said lumley as he stood with coat off shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows and pencil and plan in hand shall we turn the front of the house a little more to the south or a little more to the east  we must decide that now before fixing the framework together  we should get more of the rising sun said i if we turned it more towards the east  and you know we shall not have too much of its beams in winter to gladden our hearts and eyes  right max but then we might have too much of the east winds to trouble our toes and noses  still the view eastward said i is so extensive and variedso full of sublimity  while that to the southward urged lumley is so soft and beautiful so full of poetry and romance  come jack dont laugh at me  you know that i am not jesting i mean what i say  i know it max but though i may seem to be half jesting is it not possible that i too may thoroughly mean what i say  he pointed as he spoke to the southward where certain combinations of light and shade thrown on the numerous islets as well as on the clouds all of which were reflected in the clear waterpresented a scene which it is easier to imagine than describe  i at once admitted the justice of his remark and it was finally settled that the house should face due south  fix the frame together now coppet said lumley to our carpenter who came forward with a load of small timbers and let it face as it now lies  the ground is fortunately so flat that we wont require much levelling of foundations  now the next thing max he added turning to me and consulting the plan is thishave we made the best possible arrangement of our space  you see i am not much of an architect but luckily we have not to contend with the civilised difficulties of lobbies and staircases  you intend our palace to have only one storey i suppose said i  just so max  arctic gales you see might carry a top storey off  we shall have no lobby at allonly a front door and a back door entering direct upon our hall  of course i shall have a porch and door outside of each to keep wind and snow out  now see here  there you observe is the foundation frame now being laid down  well onethird of the space in the middle is to be the hallour drawingroom diningroom library snuggery smokery publicroom etcetera all in one  it will extend from front to rear of the building but at the back you see i have marked a little oblong space which is to be boarded off as a sort of larder and gunroom and place for rubbish in general  it will extend along the width of the hall leaving only space for the back door  what a capital contrivance said i it will besides being so useful break in on the oblong shape of the hall and give variety of form  just so max then the space left on each side of the hall shall be partitioned off into four roomstwo on either sidewith the doors opening into the hall  no passages you see anywhere and no wasted space  one room for me one for you one for salamander who is to be our manservant as well as interpreter and one for blondin whom i intend to make a sort of overseer of the men  we shant want a spare room for we wont be troubled much i fear with guests but if such a blessing should ever descend on us we can turn blondin or salamander out  they will have to mess with the men at any rate and by the way we must start the mens house and the store immediately for i intend to carry on all three at the same time so that we and the men and the goods may all get housed together  are you to have attics  i asked  no but there will be a space under the sloping roof which can be turned into a garret and may be reached through a trapdoor by a movable ladder  as to windows the hall is to have twoone on each side of the door which will give the house the lively aspect of appearing to have two eyes and a nose  the bedrooms will each have one window in its side and you may take the one looking eastward if you choose max  in winter these windows shall have double frames and glass to keep the cold out  go now my boy and see to the foundation of the mens house  need i say that we all toiled with hearty goodwill for although the weather was pleasantly warm at the time we knew that the shortlived autumn would quickly pass and render a good roof over our heads most desirable  soon a pitsaw which we had brought with us was set to work and planks began to multiply  henri coppet and his men swung their great axes and trees began to fall around and to take unwonted shapes  the ring of marcelle dumonts anvil was heard from morn till eve echoing through the wildwoods and powerful bands and nuts and screws of varied size and form were evolved from our bundle of iron bars  thus the whole party wrought with untiring energy and our future abode began to grow  at all this our red friends gazed with countenances expressive of inconceivable surprise and profound admiration    chapter twelve  a narrow escapea strange meeting and a halfrevealed mystery  one afternoon not very long after our arrival at lake wichikagan lumley and i found ourselves on the summit of a rising ground which was scantily clothed with trees and from the top of which we could see the region all round like a map spread at our feet  we were out after a black bear whose footprints had led us to the spot  bruin has escaped us this time said lumley and i dont feel disposed to go after him any further  you see max i must be up early tomorrow to superintend coppet at his watermill so i would advise resting here a bit to refresh ourselves at this spring and then make tracks for home  he descended as he spoke towards a small basin in the rocks into which fell a rivulet formed by the spring referred to and flung himself down beside it  seating myself at his side i said  coppet needs superintendence i suspect for although he is an excellent carpenter and reliable workman im not sure that he understands complicated or large worksexcept indeed the building of houses but then he has been taught that since he was a boy  thats just it max returned lumley filling the hollow of his hand with clear water for want of a better drinkingcup he can do anything which he has been taught but i find that he cannot originate and suspect that he has not a very deep knowledge of the strength of materials or the power of forces  the worst of it is that neither you nor i are very profound in such matters  however we must do our best and make everything ten times stronger than there is any occasion for and thus make up for the lack of engineering knowledge  shall you want my help tomorrow earlier than usual  i asked  nonot till after breakfast  well then as there is no necessity for my going to bed before my ordinary time ill let you return alone for i dont feel at all disposed to give up this bear after tracking him so many hours  hes only a small one to judge from his footprints and i am a pretty sure shot you know  be it so maxbut dont be late else ill have to send men to look for you  lumley got up and left memaking a straight line for fort wichikagan as we had named our outpost and leaving me in a dreamy state of mind beside the spring  it was a delightful afternoon in that most charming period of the american season which is styled the indian summer when mosquitoes sandflies and all other insecttormentors disappear and the weather seems to take a last enjoyable fortnight of sunny repose before breaking into winter  i fell into a pleasant reverie  the backwoods of the great norwest vanished from my mental view and with eyes half closed i indulged in memories of home and all its sweet associations  bethinking me suddenly of my reason for remaining where i was i sprang up seized my gun and began to follow the trail of the bear  before descending from the eminence however i took a look round the landscape and saw the figure of an indian woman in the distance proceeding towards our fort  although too faroff to be distinguished by feature i could clearly perceive the lightblue cotton kerchief which formed part of the dress of waboose  at once my interest in the bear vanished and i began to follow the indian girl instead  i had not seen her since the evening of our arrival at the lake and i felt a strong desire to make further inquiries as to the circumstances of her fathers life among the indians and his unfortunate death  waboose had not seen me  by making a wide and rapid detour i got in front of her and sat down on a fallen tree at a spot where she was sure to pass  as she drew near i could not fail to observe how graceful her port was and how different from that of the other girls with whom her lot had been cast  assuredly muttered i to myself her father was a gentleman  leaving my gun on the bank on which i had been seated i advanced to meet her  she showed a very slight symptom of surprise and i thought of uneasiness on seeing me but made no remark until i had spoken  at first i was about to adopt the indian style of address and begin with my red sister but the phrase besides being false appeared to me ridiculous still the ice had to be broken somehow so i made a bungling plunge  blueeyes wanders far today from the wigwams of herherpeople  a gleam of surprise mingled with pleasure rippled over her pretty face when she found that i could speak to her in the native tongue  yes she replied in the same language  i have wandered far  i was the bearer of a message  as she volunteered no more i continued  if waboose goes to her wigwam will she object to the paleface bearing her company  with something like a graceful inclination of the head the indian girl gave me to understand that she had no objection  an indian thought i shes a lady in disguise as sure as i am a furtrader  of course i was careful not to give her either by tone or look the slightest hint of what was passing in my mind and was about to continue my remarks when a rustling in the bushes caused us both to look round quickly  the foliage parted next moment close to us and before i had time to think a large brown bear bounded into the open space  it seemed to be taken as much by surprise as we were and i have no doubt would have turned and fled if it had not been so near  it rose on its hind legs however to attack us and then i perceived that it was not the small bear which lumley and i had been tracking  the blood rushed to my head when i remembered that the monster stood between me and the bank on which my gun was lying  then the feeling that the helpless indian girl was at its mercy filled me with feelings which are indescribable  thought is swifter than the lightningflash much more than i have written flashed through my brain during those two or three seconds but one overmastering idea filled mei would save her or perish  i glanced sharply round  to my surprise she had fled  so much the better  i could at least keep the creature engaged till she had got well away  drawing the small hatchet which like all norwesters i carried in my belt i rushed at the bear and made a cut at its head with all the force that lay in my arm  where the blow fell i know not but apparently it was ineffective for with a quick vicious turn of its paw the bear struck my weapon from my hand with such violence that it flew over the treetops as if shot from a catapult and i stood unarmedhelplessat the creatures mercy  the terrible feeling that death was so near almost unnerved me but the thought of waboose caused me to utter a roar of mingled rage and despair as i doubled my fist and launched it full against the monsters nose  at that moment a loud report at my ear deafened and almost stunned me next instant the bear lay dead at my feet  i looked round and beheld waboose standing close to me with my gun in her hands  noble heroine  i exclaimed but as i exclaimed it in english she did not understand  she had indeed a very slight smattering of that languageof which more hereafterbut noble heroine was not at that time in her vocabulary  instead of trembling or looking pale as i might have expected to see her waboose looked at me in the most composed manner and with something on her lip that seemed to me like a smile of amusement  in some confusion i thanked her for having saved my life  she did not object to the thanks but replied by asking me if it was the usual practice of white men to attack bears with their fists  i could not help laughing at this  no waboose i replied as i recharged my gun it is by no means usual but when a man has no other weapon at hand he is compelled to use his fists  and let me tell you i added for i was somewhat nettled by the obvious laugh that nestled in the girls blue eyeslet me tell you that we english are pretty good at using our fists  i know that she replied becoming suddenly very grave as we walked on  you know that  i repeated in surprise how came you to know that  my dear father was english she answered in a low sad tone that smote me to the heart for having felt nettledthough i believe i did not show the feeling on my face or in my tone  ah  big otter told me that said i in an earnest tone of sympathy if it does not hurt her feelings too much to recall the past i should like waboose to tell me about her father  the girl looked at me in surprise  i had a fancy at the time that this was the result of the novel sensation of a man having any consideration for her feelings for indian braves are not as a rule much given to think about the feelings of their women  indeed from the way in which many of them behave it is probable that some redmen think their women have no feelings at all  in a low melodious voice and with some of that poetic imagery which marks the language more or less of all north american indians the girl began to speakraising her eyes wistfully the while to the sky as if she were communing with her own thoughts rather than speaking to me  my father was goodoh so good and kind she said  when i was small like the foolish rabbit when it is a baby he used to take me on his shoulders and run with me over the prairie like the wild mustang sometimes he put me in his bark canoe and skimmed with me over lake wichikagan till i fancied i was a greygoose or a swan  ah those were happy days  no one can ever understand how much my father loved me  my mother loves me much but she is not like my father  perhaps it is the nature of the palefaces to love more deeply than the redmen  waboose uttered this last sentence as if she were questioning the sky on the point  i felt at the time that there was at least one paleface who loved her better than all the redmen or women on earth but a sense of justice caused me to repudiate the general idea  no waboose said i firmly that is a mistake  rough surroundings and a harsh life will indeed modify the hearts affections but the mere colour of the skin has nothing to do with it  the heart of the redskin can love as deeply as that of the white manboth were made by the same great master of life  the girl cast her eyes meditatively on the ground and murmured simply it may be so  the reader must not suppose that i expressed my meaning in the indian tongue during this conversation as clearly as i have set it down in english  no doubt i mangled the sentences and confused the ideas sadly nevertheless waboose seemed to have no difficulty in understanding me i had certainly none in comprehending her  i was about to ask waboose to relate the circumstances of her fathers death while in the act of rescuing her mother but feeling that it might cause her needless pain and that i could get the details as easily from some of the indians i asked her instead where her father came from she looked at me sadly as she replied  i cannot tell  my dear father had nothing to conceal from me but that on all other things his heart was open  he spoke to me of all the wonders of this world and of other places that my people know nothing of and of the great master of life and of his son jesus who came to save us from evil and of the countries where his white brothers live but when i asked him where he came from he used to pat my head and smile and say that he would perhaps tell me one day but not just then i shall never know it now  at all events you must know his name waboose  his name was weeum replied the girl quickly  was that all  all she replied with a quick look was not that enough  well perhaps it was i replied scarce knowing what to say  and why did he give you the name of waboose  i asked  because when i was small i was round and soft replied the girl with a slight smile like the little animal of that name  he told me that in his own language the animal is called rubbit  rabbit not rubbit said i with a laugh  my father taught me rubbit returned waboose with a simple look and he was always right  i felt that it would be useless to press my correction and therefore changed the subject by asking if her father had never tried to teach her english  immediately she answered with a somewhat bashful air  yes a leetil  why you can speak english waboose i exclaimed stopping and looking down at her with increasing interest  nonote mush but me unerstan gooddeal she returned with a hearty laugh at my expression  i found on trial however that the girls knowledge of english was so slight that we could not readily converse in it  we therefore fell back on the indian tongue  i wish i had known your father waboose i said earnestly  he must have been a very good man  she looked at me gratefully  yes she returned he was very good  as she said this waboose cast on me a look which i could not understand it was so intense as if she were trying to read my thoughts and at the same time seemed mingled with doubt  then with some hesitation she said  my father left a secret with me  he told me never to show it to my tribe as they could not understand itnot even to my mother  what is the secret waboose  i asked seeing that she hesitated again and looked at me with another of her searching glances  i do not know she replied  it must indeed be a secret if none of your people know it and you dont know it yourself i returned with a peculiar smile  it is a written secret i believe but iido not know  he told me never to show it to any but a white manto one whom i felt that i could trust  may i trust you she asked looking me full in the face  the question naturally surprised as well as flattered me  you may trust me waboose i said earnestly laying my hand involuntarily on my heart i would die rather than deceive or injure you  she seemed satisfied and resumed in a low tone  not long before my dear father died he took me into the woods to walk in a place that we were both fond of  we had long sweet talks in that wood sometimes walking under the trees sometimes sitting on the hilltops and always happyvery happy  one day he looked sad  he took my hand as we sat together on a bank  he said i have sometimes longed to open up all my heart to you my rubbit he was fond of calling me by the english name but i cannot do so yet  why not my father  i asked  becausebecause he answered it could do no good and it might do harm  no my rubbit the time may come but not nownot yet  listen for your mothers sake i left the home of the palefaces and came to live with your tribe  for her sake i shall remain  but you know that life is uncertain  we cannot tell when the great master of life may call us away  sometimes he calls us suddenly and we are forced to leave our works unfinished  i may be called away thus before the time comes when i may tell you what i want you to know  if so you will find it all here  my father took from the breast of his coat a small bundle wrapped in birchbark and placed it in my hands  do not open it he said  do not show it to man or woman in the tribe  they could not understand but if ever a white man comes here whom you feel that you can trust show it to him  my father rose as he said this and as he seemed to wish not to speak more about it i did not trouble him but i went and hid the parcel with care  it was almost immediately afterwards that my dear father was taken from me  we were suddenly interrupted at this point by the appearance of a man in the distance walking smartly towards us  i could perceive as he drew near that it was james dougall  well well muster maxby he said on coming up its gled i am to find you  ive been seekin you far an near  nothing wrong i hope dougall said i with some anxiety on observing that the man was perspiring and panting vehemently  no no nothin wrong muster maxby only its runnin aboot the wuds ive been lookin for ye an skirlin like a pair o pipes  were aboot to draw the seinenet ye see an tonald pane said it would be a peety says he to begin when ye wur awa an muster lumley agreet wi um an sent me oot to seek for eethats a  come along then dougall we wont keep them waiting  nodding adieu to waboose i hurried away towards fort wichikagan followed by the sturdy highlander    chapter thirteen  fishing and its resultsengineering and its consequences  i found on reaching wichikagan that the fun was about to begin blondin who was our chief fisherman had let down a long seinenet which was being drawn slowly in by a band of natives whose interest in a process which they had never before seen was deepening into excitement as they observed here and there a symptom of something shooting below the surface of the still water or beheld a large fish leap frantically into the air  at first when the net was being prepared those children of the forest had merely stood by and looked on with curiosity  when blondin and his men rowed out from the shore letting the net drop off the stern of our boat as they went they indulged in a few guesses and undertoned remarks  when the boat gradually swept round and turned shoreward again having left a long line of floats in its wake they perceived that a large sheet of water had been enclosed and a feeling of wonder combined with a half guess as to what all this portended caused their black orbs to enlarge and the whites thereof to glisten  but when they were requested to lay hold of a rope attached to the other end of the net and haul the true state of the case burst upon their awakened minds and proportionate excitement followed  as the circle of the net diminished and the evidences above referred to of life in the water became more frequent gleeful expectation took the place of wonder and a disposition to chatter manifested itself especially among the women and children who by that time had eagerly laid hold of the dragrope  soon it became apparent that a mighty mass of fish had been enclosed and the creatures seemed themselves to become suddenly alive to their danger for the crowded condition of their elementwhich no doubt caused only surprise at firstbecame so inconvenient that with one accord they made a terrified rush to the right  failing to obtain relief they turned and rushed to the left  discomfited again they dashed lakeward  each rush was followed by a howl of anxiety from the natives each failure was hailed with a yell of joy  three birchbark canoes followed the net to send the more obstreperous of the fish shoreward  finding that they could not escape the finny prisoners seemed to lose their wits and took to rushing skyward with splashing consequences that almost drove the redmen mad  hold on not so hard  youll break it shouted lumley to the men and women at the rope  what a tremendous haul said i as i joined my friend who stood at the outer end of our little wharf enjoying the scene  i hope the net wont break he replied  if it does we shall lose them all and the disappointment to the indians might be almost too much to bear  see they prepare for action  this was very obvious  the men of the tribe who might be described as glaring maniacs had dropped their robes and almost naked ran waistdeep into the water in a vain attempt to catch some of the larger fish as they were slowly forced towards the beach  even some of the women lost selfcontrol and regardless of petticoats floundered after the men  as for the children big and little they developed into imps of darkness gone deranged  suddenly a very wave of fish was sent upon the shore where of course they began to leap about wildly  not less wildly did the indians leap among them throttling the big ones and hurling armfuls of the lesser ones high up on the sward  by that time the net was close in shore  the whole of the enclosed space became a sweltering mass  treading on the fish at last many of both men and boys slipped in the water and fell down over head and ears so that the spectacle was presented of human beings bounding out of the water in apparent emulation of their prey  the excitement was almost too much for them  several of the boys were seen to rush up into the woods and dash back again with no apparent reason except the desire to get rid of superabundant energy  one brave in particular so far forgot the characteristic dignity of the redman that he rushed up on the bank bent forward clapped a hand on each knee threw back his head shut his eyes opened wide his mouth and sought to relieve his feelings in one stupendous roar  but it would not do  he became suddenly solemn glared again and went at the fish more furiously than ever  our men in the canoes landed and rendered assistance  salamander was in one of the canoes which ran alongside of the wharf  the only other occupant was donald bane who sat in the stern and steered  salamander was greatly excited  as the canoe ran up to the wharf the bow was thrust over the netrope and he gazed at the struggling creatures below with intense delight on his brown visage  you had petter take care said donald bane as he grasped the edge of the wharf and cautiously rose up for canoes are easily overturned but salamander was too much engrossed to hear or reply  the highlander who had not forgotten the trick formerly played on him and his countryman by the interpreter stepped carefully out on the wharf  as he did so he gave the canoe a little tilt with his foot and salamander went headforemost down among the fish  a simulated cry of consternation broke from donald bane  wowwow he exclaimed as salamanders head appeared with a number of little fish struggling in his hair and a pike or jackfish holding on to the lobe of his left ear the poor cratur  tak a grup o my hand man  here wow but it seems a fery frundly jackfush thatwhatever  amid much spluttering salamander was hauled out and regardless of his mishap both he and donald immediately joined the others in securing their prey  it wass a grand haul man tonald said dougall that night at supper  oo ay shames  it was no that paad replied donald  and truly it was a grand haul for not only did we obtain enough of every species of fish that swarmed in lake wichikagan to provide a right royal feast to ourselves and our red friends but a good many were left over and above to form the commencement of a store for the future  by that time we had fairly commenced the fishery with a view to a winter supply  the weather was still delicious and had begun to grow cool at nights but as there was yet no frost all the fish we took had to be hung up by the tail and thus partially dried  afterwards when the frost fairly set in this hanging process was dispensed with for fish once frozen in those regions remain perfectly fresh during the entire winter so that those eaten in spring are quite as good as those consumed in autumn  lumley now set me to superintend the digging and constructing of an icehouse which should be ready to receive in spring the ice that would be required to keep our provisions fresh during the following summer it consisted merely of a shallow square pit or hole in the ground over which a log hut was constructed  the pit we intended to floor with solid cubes of ice measuring about a yard on each side  this lowest foundation in those northern icehouses never melts but a fresh stratum is laid above it which is cleared out and renewed every spring and it is amongst this that the meat or fish to be preserved is laid in summer  another piece of work that lumley gave me to superintend at this time was the construction of a waterwheel and dam to drive our pitsaw  you see i had a turn for mechanics and was under the impression that my powers in that way were greater than they afterwards turned out to be we were sitting at tea alone in our hall at the time the subject was mooted  where have you sent the carpenter  i asked as i pushed in my pannikin for more of the refreshing beverage  i must interrupt the thread of my narrative here for a moment to say that we took no crockery with us on that expedition  our cups were tin pannikins our plates were made of tin our pots and kettles were either tin or copper  we had no sugar basins or butterdishes or tablecloths or any of the other amenities of civilised life  but everything we had was strong and serviceable and the same may be said of the things we constructed  the deal tables and chairs made for us by coppet were very strong if not elegant and the plank walls and ceiling of our rooms were cheerful though neither papered nor whitewashed  it has often struck me while sojourning in the great norwest that civilised man surrounds himself with a great many needless luxuries which do not by any means add to his comfort though the removal of them might add considerably to his distress  but to return  coppet is off said lumley in reply to my question to get some timber for oars as well as birchbark to make a canoe or two we must also set about making a new boat some day or other  lumley said i it has often occurred to me that it takes a terrible deal of time to cut trees into planks with our pitsaws and occupies far too much of the time of two men who might be much more profitably employed  true maxwhat then  why then said i what would you say if i were to construct a sawmill  id say you were a clever fellow replied my friend with one of his knowing looks  but what say you to my making the attempt  do so by all means my boyonly dont use up too many pitsaws in the attempt  i saw that he did not believe in my powers and became all the more determined to succeed  accordingly i went next day with coppet and dumont on whom of course i depended for the carrying out of my designs to examine the ground where the milldam was to be made  you see i explained we have a superabundance of water in the rivulet at the back of the fort and by collecting it we may get any amount of power we please which is of importance because it will enable us to simplify the machinery  oui oui monsieur said coppet who either was or wished to appear very knowing on such matters  now continued i here is a natural basin formed by rocks which only wants a small dam at its lower end to enable us to collect water enough to drive the biggest mill in the world  by making our opening at the very bottom of the basin the pressure of water when it is full will be so great that a very small waterwheel without any multiplying gear will suffice to drive our sawdont you see  oui monsieur oui answered dumont whose knitted brows showed that the worthy blacksmith was at least doing his best to understand me  well then i continued you see that we shall have no difficulty as to the dam  then as to the wheel it will be a simple one of not more than four feet diameter presented vertically to what i may term the waterspout so that its axle which will have a crank in it will work the saw direct thus avoiding toothed wheels and cogs we shall avoid friction and if need be increase the speed easily dyou see  bon monsieurgood good exclaimed coppet becoming quite enthusiastic in his appreciation of my plans  of course i continued the saw can easily be fitted to a frame and a very simple contrivance can be made to drive along the larger frame that will carry the logs to be sawn but these are trifling matters of detail which you and i will work out at our leisure dumont  oui monsieur oui replied the blacksmith with tighter knitted brows and with a readiness of assent which i do believe the good fellow would have accorded if i had proposed to fit a new axis to the world  there is only one thing that troubles me said i how are we to gauge or estimate the force of our waterspout so as to regulate our mill when made  do you understand such mattersthe measurement of force coppet  the carpenter shook his head  thats unfortunate  do you dumont  non monsieur  hm  im sadly ignorant on the point myself i continued  of course i know that so many cubic feet of water will exert a certain pressure but then i dont know what that certain pressure is nor how to find out how many cubic feet our somewhat irregular dam will contain  nor do i know precisely the strength of the material required in the dam to resist the water  dumont humbly suggested here that we could at all events act on the principle that guided adam and eve in the formation of their first watermill and find out by experiment  and coppet said that we could get over the difficulty about the strength of materials by making everything ten times stronger than was required  you are right lads said i much amused with the earnest manner in which they gave the advice  now let us go at it without delay so that we may get into working order before the frost stops us  we set to with enthusiasm and progressed with our labour much faster than i had expected  the natural basin to which i have referred lay just below a ledge of rock over which the rivulet flowed into it forming a pretty deep pool about ten feet in diameter  flowing out of this pool it ran about twelve feet further through a narrow gorge where it dropped over another ledge  now all that we had to do was to shut up the outlet of the narrow gorge with a strong dam and so cause the pool to swell and rise into a small but very deep pond  our first step was to divert the channel of the brook so as to leave us free to construct the dam  the nature of the ground rendered this easy enough  then before going further we made the trough which was to conduct the water out of the dam  it was made of four strong planks about ten feet long and eight inches wide forming so to speak a square pipe  this we laid firmly in the bottom of the basin with its end projecting over the lower ledge  to the inner end we attached a perpendicular piece of wooden piping which rose several feet from the ground  this was meant to prevent mud and stones from getting into and choking the pipe  this done we laid some very large timbers over the pipe and across the opening of the gorge above and between which we put heavy stones and large quantities of gravelalso turf and twigs and all sorts of rubbish  thus was the dam begun and we continued the process until we raised it to a height of some twenty feet or so  what a magnificent pool it will be to dive in said lumley one day when he came to see us at work  wont it said i especially in winter  whatever happens to your works the dam i think will never give way continued lumley it seems to me unnecessarily strong  not to try the readers patience i may say at once that we advanced with our labour without a hitch until it was nearly finished  to the opening in the pipe or spout we attached a powerful sluice by which to stop the flow desired and all being ready broke down the dyke that had turned aside our stream and let the water in  of course we had constructed an overflow part of the basin by which to conduct the surplus water back to its proper channel below our works  it was a trying moment when we first let the water in  would it leak would it break downwas in everyones mind  i had no fear as to the latter point but felt uncertain as to the former  we had much longer to wait however for the filling than i had expected but when at last it was full up to the brim and the trees around were reflected on its surface and no leak appeared anywhere i could not resist giving a cheer which was heartily taken up and echoed by our whole partyfor we had all assembled to watch the result  now coppet lend a hand at the winch  well open the sluice and observe the force  after a few turns our winch refused to move and only a small part of the opening had been uncovered from which the water was squirting furiously  something wrong said i looking down at the men below  just take a look salamander and see what it is  our lively interpreter went down on hands and knees and made an earnest examination despite the squirting water  oh  i sees  all right now he shouted heave away  get out of the way then we cried as we once more applied all our force to the winch  it turned with unexpected suddenness the sluice flew up and out came a straight column of water with extreme violence it hit salamander full in the stomach lifted him off his legs and swept him right down the gully pitching him headlong over another ledge where he fell with such force that his mortal career had certainly been ended then and there but for a thick juniper bush which fortunately broke his fall  as it was he was little the worse of his adventure but he had learned a lesson of prompt obedience to orders which he did not soon forget  i now planned a sort of movable buffer by which the force of the waterspout could be diminished or even turned aside altogether  it acted very well and under its protection we set up the saw and started it  we were all assembled again of course at the first starting of the saw along with a good many of our red friends whose curiosity in our various proceedings knew no bounds  opening the sluice slowly and fixing the buffer so as to turn at least threequarters of the furious waterspout aside i had the extreme satisfaction of seeing the saw begin to rip up a large log  it went on splendidly though still with somewhat greater force than i desired but alas my want of critical knowledge of engineering told heavily against us for all of a sudden the sluice broke  the buffer still acted however and being needlessly strong was i thought safe but the hinges of the thing were far too weak  they gave way  the violent spout thus set free dashed against the wheel with its full force turning it round with a whirrrr that sent the saw up and down so fast as to render it almost invisible  we stood aghast  what fearful termination to the machine impended we could not guess  a moment later and the crank broke entangled itself with the wheel and stopped it  as if maddened by this additional resistance the waterspout then swept the whole concern away after which like a wildhorse set free it took a leap of full thirty feeta straight column of solid waterbefore it burst itself on the ground and rushed wildly down to the lake  it was a humiliating termination and showed how terrible it is to create a power which one cannot control  i draw a veil over the story here  my feelings forbid me to write more    chapter fourteen  arrival of strange indians  about this time a band of strange indians came in with a large supply of valuable furs  they had heard they said of the establishment of the new post and had gladly come to trade there instead of making their customary long journey to muskrat house  the change to these indians was in truth of the utmost importance for so distant were some of their huntinggrounds from macnabs establishment that nearly all the ammunition obtained therethe procuring of which was one of the chief desires of their heartswas expended in shooting for mere subsistence on the way back to their huntinggrounds  it will be easily understood then that they received us with open arms  by this time we were quite prepared for their visit  the two dwellinghouses for ourselves and the men were completed so also was the store for our goods  there only remained unfinished one or two outhouses and our back kitchen the latter a detached building afterwards to be connected with the main dwelling by a passage  the store was an unusually strong loghouse of one storey with a very solid door  it was attached to the side of our dwelling with which it was connected by an inner door so that we could if necessary enter it without having to go outsidea matter of some importance in case we should ever be forced to defend the fort  i had just returned much dispirited from a visit to the camp of our own indians when this band of strangers arrived  remembering my last conversation with waboose and being very curious to know what were the contents of the mysterious packet she had mentioned i had gone to the camp to visit her but to my extreme regret found that big otter and several of the indians had struck their tents and gone off on a long hunting expedition taking their families with them waboose among the rest  on finding however that strange indians had arrived with a goodly supply of furs to trade thoughts of all other matters were driven out of my mind the depression of spirits fled and a burst of enthusiasm supervened as the thought occurred to me that now at last the great object of our expedition was about to begin in earnest  i verily believe that the same spirit of enthusiasm or satisfactioncall it what you willanimated more or less every man at the fort  indeed i believe that it is always so in every condition of life that men who lay claim to even the smallest amount of spirit or selfrespect experience a thrill of justifiable pride in performing their duty well and earning the approval of their official superiors  my own thoughts if defined would probably have amounted to this  now then heres a chance at last of driving a good trade and we will soon show the governor and council of the furtraders that they were well advised when they selected john lumley as the chief of this trading expedition into the remote wilderness  come max cried my friend whom i met hastening to the store as i arrived youre just in time  heres a big band of redskins with splendid packs of furs  i fear however that what is our gain will to some extent be poor macnabs loss for they say they used to take their furs to him in former years  but then said i will not the company gain the furs which used to be damaged and therefore lost on the long voyage to muskrat  besides the indians will now be enabled to devote the time thus saved to hunting and trapping and that will also be clear gain  we reached the store as i said this followed by a dozen indians with large packs on their shoulders  these were the chief men of the tribe who were to be attended to first  the others who had to await their turn with what patience they could command followed behind in a body to gaze at least upon the outside of the storethat mysterious temple of unknown wealth of which all of them had heard though many of them had never seen or entered one  putting a large key into the lock lumley turned it with all due solemnity for it was his plan among savages to make all acts of importance as impressive as possible in their eyes  and this act of visiting for the first time the storesthe palace of wealththe abode of blissthe redmans haven of restwas a very important act  it may not seem so to the reader but it was so to the savage  the very smell of the place was to him deliciousand no wonder for even to more cultivated nostrils there is an odour about the contents of a miscellaneous storesuch as tea molasses grindstones coffee brown paper woollen cloths sugar fishhooks raisins scalpingknives and soapwhich is pleasantly suggestive  entering then with the dozen indians this important place of which i was the chief and only clerk lumley salesman and trader and salamander warehouseman the door was shut  becoming instantly aware of a sudden diminution in the light i looked at the windows and observed a flattened brown nose a painted face and glaring eyes in the centre of nearly every pane  when i looked at this band of powerful lithe wiry covetous savages and thought of the hundreds of others whom they could summon by a single warwhoop to their side and of the smallness of our own party i could not help feeling that moral influence was a powerful factor in the affairs of man  no doubt they were restrained to some extent by the certain knowledge that if they attacked and killed us and appropriated our goods without the preliminary ceremony of barter the white men would not only decline to send them goods in future but would organise a force to hunt down and slay the murderers nevertheless savages are not much given to prudential reasoning when their cupidity or passions are roused and i cannot help thinking that we owed our safety under god to the belief in the savage mind that men who put themselves so completely in their power as we did and who looked so unsuspicious of evil must somehow be invulnerable  be that as it may we calmly acted as if there could be no question at all about our being their masters  lumley conveyed that impression however without the slightest assumption of dignity  he was all kindness gentleness and urbanity yet treated them with that unassertive firmness which a father exercisesor ought to exercise towards a child  now then salamander said lumley when he was inside the counter and the indians stood in a group on the other side tell the principal chief to open his pack  lumley i may remark made use of salamander as an interpreter until he found that the dialect of those indians was not very different from that to which he had been accustomed  then he dispensed with his services and took up the conversation himself to the obvious astonishment as well as respect of the indians who seemed to think the white chief had actually picked up a new language after listening to it for only half an hour  the principal chief opened his pack slowly and spread its contents on the counter with care  he did not hurry himself being a very dignified man  there were beavers martens otters silverfoxes and many other valuable furs for which large sums are given in the european markets to obtain these however the company of traders had to expend very large sums in transporting goods into those northern wilds and still larger sums would have to be paid to voyageurs clerks and employes generally as well as risks run and time spent before these furs could be conveyed to market and turned into goldhence our red chief had to content himself with moderate prices  these prices moreover he did not himself put on his furs  lumley did that for him according to the tariff used by the furtraders all over the country every article being rated at a standard unit of value styled a madebeaver in some parts of the countrya castore in other parts  on the counter was marked with a piece of chalk the value of each fura beaver was valued at so many castores according to its quality a fox at so manyand when the sum was added up the total was made known by a number of goosequills being presented to the chief each quill representing a castore  the indians being acquainted with this process did not require to have it explained  profoundly did that chief gaze at his bundle of quills on receiving them from lumley after salamander had swept his furs into a corner  he was studying as it were the credit balance of his bankaccount before investing  now then chief asked lumley with an urbane expression of countenance what shall i give you  the chief gazed solemnly round the store with his piercing black eyes while all the other piercing black eyes around gazed at him expectantly at last his gaze became riveted on a particular spot  the surrounding black eyes turned to that spot intently and the chief said  baskisigan  ah i thought soa gun said lumley hand one over salamander  the interpreter went to a box which contained half a dozen of the common cheap articles which were supplied for the trade  long singlebarrelled affairs they were the barrels of blue metal stocks extending to the muzzles and stained red brass mountings of toylike flimsiness and flintlocks the entire gun being worth something less than a pound sterling  these weapons were capable nevertheless of shooting pretty straight though uncomfortably apt to burst  one having been handed to the chief he received it with a grasp of almost reverential affection while lumley extracted from his funds the requisite number of quills in payment  what next asked salamander and again the solemn gaze went slowly round the store on the shelves of which our goods were displayed most temptingly  black eyes riveted once more  what is it  a green blanket  just so  fetch a fourpoint one max hes a big man  i took up one of our largestsized thick green blankets handed it to the chief and lumley abstracted a few more quills from the bundle  at this point the redman seemed to get into the swing of the thing for a white blanket of medium size and another of very small dimensions were demanded  these represented wife and infant  after this a tin kettle and a roll of tobacco were purchased  the chief paused here however to ponder and count his quills  do you observe said lumley to me in a low voice what a wellbalanced mind he has  i cant say that i do lumley  no  dont you see first a gunselfandfamilypreservation being the first law of nature then after thus providing for war and hunting comes repose dyou see a big blanket which immediately suggests similar comfort to the squaw a smaller blanket then comes comfort to the baby a miniature blanket then how naturally the squaw and the squawker conduct his mind to fooda tin kettle after which he feels justified in refreshing himself with a slight luxurytobacco  but youll see that he will soon repress self with indian stoicism and return to essentials  lumley was right for he had barely ceased to speak when the chief turned and demanded an axe then fishhooks then twine for lines then awls for boring holes in the bark with which he made his canoes then powder and shot and pipes  after this another fit of tenderness came over him and he bought some bright scarlet and blue clothdoubtless for the squaw or the babyand some brilliantly coloured silk thread with needles and variegated beads to ornament the same  soon his quills dwindled away till at last they disappeared yet his wants were not fully suppliedwould the paleface chief advance him some goods on credit  oh yeshe seemed a good and trustworthy bravethe paleface chief had no objection to do that  accordingly i opened a ledger and inserted the mans name  it was almost welshlike in difficulty of pronunciation but unlike a welshman i spelt it as pronounced and set down in order the additional goods he required  when lumley thought he had given him enough on credit he firmly closed the account gave the man a small gratuity of tobacco powder and shot etcetera and bade another chief come forward  it was slow but interesting work for as the indians grew familiar with the place and our ways those of them who were loquacious or possessed of humour began to chat and comment on the goods and on the white mans doings in a way that was very diverting  after the chief men had traded their furs the rank and file of the band came on and as is the case with all rank and file there were some indifferent and a few bad characters among them  it was now that i observed and admired the tact combined with firmness of lumley  he spoke to these indians with exactly the same respect and suavity that had characterised him when trading with the chiefs  when he saw any one become puzzled or undecided he suggested or quietly advised  if a mans eye appeared to twinkle he cut a mild joke with him  if one became too familiar or seemed disposed to be insolent he took no notice but turned aside and busied himself in arranging the goods  at last however an incident occurred which called for different treatment  there was among the indians a longlegged wiry fellow who had been named attick or reindeer because he was a celebrated runner those who disliked himand they were numeroussaid he was good at running away from his foes  however that might be he was undoubtedly dexterous in the use of his fingersand it was through this propensity that we were first introduced to him  it happened thus  lumley whose powers of observation often surprised me had noticed that attick looked often and with longing eyes at a very small roll of tobacco which belonged to one of his comrades and lay on the counter temptingly near at hand  slowly and as it were inadvertently he advanced his hand until it touched the tobacco then laying hold on it when the owner was busy with something else he carried it towards the bosom of his leather huntingshirt  before it reached that place of concealment however lumley quickly yet so quietly that the act was scarce perceived seized the elbow of the chief and gave him a look attick promptly put the tobacco down and looked at lumley with a scowl but the paleface chief was smilingly giving some advice to the man with whom he was trading  he thought that the man would not attempt anything more of a similar kind at least at that time but he was mistaken  he underestimated the force of covetousness and the power of temptation in a savage  soon afterwards he saw attick deftly pass a packet of bright beads belonging to another comrade from the counter to his breast where he let it remain grasped in his hand  immediately afterwards the owner of the beads missed them  he turned over his goods hastily but could not find the packet and looked suspiciously at salamander who had been standing near all the time besides fingering the things occasionally  a comrade has stolen it said lumley in a quiet voice and without looking at any one save the robbed man  this was received with scowls and strong marks of disapprobation  not so  the interpreter the paleface has stolen it returned the indian fiercely  instead of replying lumley vaulted lightly over the counter stood before the astonished attick thrust his hand into the bosom of that savage and by main force dragged forth the thieving fist still closed over the missing packet  the indians were too much taken by surprise at the promptness of the act to speakthey could only glare  my friends said lumley still maintaining however something of kindliness in his look of stern gravity the great master of life does not love thieving and no thief will be permitted to enter this store  what more he would have said i know not for swift as lightning attick drew his knife and made a plunge at my friends heart  expecting a scuffle i had also leaped the counter  lumley caught the wrist of the savage at the same time he exclaimed open the door max  i obeyed expecting to see the indian kicked out but i was wrong for my friend with a sharp twist turned atticks back to his own breast then seizing him by both elbows he lifted him off his feet as if he had been a mere infant carried him forward a few paces and set him gently down outside  then stepping back he shut the door  a roar of laughter from those without showed the light in which they viewed the incident and the amused looks of some of those in the store told that at least they did not disapprove of the act  without paying any regard to these things however lumley returned to his place and with his usual air of good humour continued to barter with the redmen  thus the work of trading went on for three days and during that time there was much fraternising of what i may call our homeindians with the newcomers and a great deal i regret to say of gambling  we found that this evil prevailed to a great extent among them insomuch that one or two of them gambled away all that they possessed and came to us with very penitent looks asking for a small quantity of goods on credit to enable them to face the winter  i need scarcely say that our amiable chief complied with these requests but only on the solemn promise that the goods so advanced should not be risked in gambling and i have reason to believe that these men were faithful to their promises  this gambling was of the simplest kind consisting of the method which is known by the name of odd or even  in the evenings the chiefs were encouraged to come into our hall and palaver  they availed themselves of the invitation to come and sometimes palavered but more frequently smoked with owlish solemnity squatting on the floor with their backs against the wall  nevertheless on these occasions we gained a good deal of information and lumley availed himself of the opportunities sometimes to lecture them on the sin of gambling  he always i observed laid much more stress on the idea that the great master of life was grieved with his children when they did evil than that he visited the sin with disagreeable consequences  on one of these occasions an elderly chief surprised us by suddenly putting the question do the palefaces trade firewater  every pipe was removed from every lip and the glittering eyes of expectancy coupled with the all but total cessation of breathing told of the intense interest with which they awaited the answer  no replied lumley we sell none  we do not love firewater  a deep but quiet sigh followed and the pipes were resumed in silent resignation  and i must add i felt devoutly thankful that we did not sell firewater when i looked at the strong features and powerful frames of the redmen around me    chapter fifteen  a catastrophe a letter and a surprise  autumn at length gradually drew to a close and we began to make preparations for the long winter that lay before us  our sawmill having been repaired and improved had worked so well that we had cut a considerable quantity of planks as well for the boats which we intended to build as for the houses  it was fortunate that this had been accomplished before the occurrence of an event which put an effectual stop to that branch of our industries  it happened thus  one afternoon the fine weather which we had been enjoying so long gave place to boisterous winds and deluges of rain confining us all to the fort and making us feel slightly miserable  but we mustnt grumble max said lumley to me as we looked out of our small windows  we must take the evil with the good as it comes and be thankful  please i wasnt grumbling said i sharply  no  i thought you were  no i was not  it must have been internal grumbling by yourself that you heard i retorted sauntering back to the fire which by that time we had begun to light daily  i daresay youre right max it has often struck me as a curious fact that when one is cross or grumpy he is apt to think all the rest of the world is also cross or grumpy  by the way that reminds methough i dont see why it should remind me seeing that the two things have no connectionthat coppet came to me last night saying he had discovered a slight leak in the dam  wed better look to it now as the rain seems to have moderated a little  we went out forthwith and found coppet already on the spot gazing at a small rill of water which bubbled up from behind a mass of rock that jutted out from the cliff and formed a support for the beams of our dam  something wrong there coppet said lumley inspecting the place carefully  oui monsieurit is true  can you guess where it comes through  i asked  vraiment monsieur i know not but surely the dam it is quite strong  strongof course it is unnecessarily strong said i looking up at its edge over which the water rendered muddy by the rains flowed in a considerable volume  what think you lumley  i asked my friends opinion somewhat anxiously because i observed that he seemed to examine the place with unusually grave looks  max he said at last your engineering is defective  it is true that the beams and stuffs of which the dam is composed could resist all the weight or force of water that can be brought to bear on themeven an untrained eye like mine can see thatbut you had not observed that this mass of rock against which the whole affair rests has got a crack in it so that it is partially if not altogether detached from the cliff no doubt it is a large heavy mass but the strain upon it must be very severe and its stability depends on its foundations  the foundations seem secure enough said i looking down  true but natural foundations are sometimes deceptive and that bubbling spring may be quietly washing these away  we must use a little art here  go coppet he added turning to the carpenter fetch all the men and your tools and as many heavy timbers as you can readily lay hands on  come max help me to lift this one  the decision of lumleys manner and the energetic way in which he threw off his coat and set to work convinced me that he thought danger of some sort was impending  i therefore followed his example and set to with a will  we fixed a heavy log in front of the suspected mass of rock placing its end against the centre of the mass and sinking the other end into the groundhaving previously however sunk a strong crossbeam into the ground to bear the pressure of that end  this of itself said my chief will go far to avert evil but we will adopt your tactics max and by giving it superabundance of strength make assurance doubly sure  in pursuance of this plan he ordered the men to plant several ponderous logs in the same position as the first beam over which other logs were thrown crosswise and the whole was weighted with heavy stones  during our operations which occupied us all till evening the rain increased tenfold and at last came down in absolute sheets flooding our dam to such an extent that it overflowed nearly all round the brim in pretty solid cataracts of dirty water which brought down branches and leaves and other debris from the higher parts of the stream  i was gratified to see however that our embankment showed no symptoms of weakness and felt assured that the powerful structure we had just set up was more than sufficient to prevent any rupture in the rock itself  comforted by these thoughts lumley and i returned to the hall in a burst of thunder lightning and rainthoroughly saturated and in a condition to do ample justice to the seabiscuit fried saltpork hung whitefish and tea which salamander had prepared for supper  blondin being a polite intelligent fellow as well as our foreman was privileged to take his meals with us besides occupying one of our four rooms  in consequence of this we conversed chiefly in the patois french of the country for the worthy man was not deeply learned in english salamander messed with the men in their own house after preparing and spreading our meals  what say you to a game of chess said lumley to me after the teathings had been carried away by blondin  by all means i replied going to a corner cupboard in which we kept miscellaneous articles and bringing out the chessboard  this board and its men by the way merit passing remark for they were fashioned by our chief entirely and very neatly out of the pith of a bush the name of which i forget and on the voyage many an hour that might otherwise have been tedious we whiled away with this interesting game  i knew nothing of it when we began but lumley taught me the moves and i soon picked up enough of the game to enable me to fight a fairish battle before being beaten  at first lumley always won and was wont to signalise his victory by the expression of a modest hope that the tables would be turned ere long  that hopewhether genuine or pretendedwas not long of being gratified for as my mind by degrees began to grasp the mysteries of chess i succeeded in winning a game now and then  on this particular night however the tables were turned literally and in a way that we little expected  blondin being left to himself had sought the companionship of his pipe and was dozing over the fire more than half asleepat least not more awake than was consistent with the keeping of his pipe between his lips  ever and anon he was startled into a more wakeful condition by the tremendous blasts which frequently shook the house but these did not disturb him much for he had helped to build the house and knew that it was strong  we were all indeed pretty well tired by our recent exertions and rather sleepy so that the game languished a little  salamander having obtained permission to retire was in bed in his own cornerroom entertaining us with a duet through the noseif i may call that a duet in which both nostrils played the same air  check said lumley rousing himself a little and placing a knight in such a position as to endanger my king  mate  i exclaimed ruefully  hallo cried blondin waking up at the familiar word  nonot that sort of mate said i with a laugh but the  i stopped abruptly for at that moment we heard a sound that sent a thrill to our hearts  it was something between a rend and a crash  we looked at each other in consternation  the dams going exclaimed lumley  another crash that there was no misunderstanding proved that it was gone  we ran towards the back door but before reaching it we had an additional proof that was even more convincing than the last  a rush of tumultuous water was heard outside  next moment the back door was burst inward and a deluge of water met us  lumley who was nearest the door was swept off his legs and came against me with such violence that i fell over him  blondin who was furthest off tried to stop us but also went down and all three were swept into the lower side of the hall amid a jumble of tables chairs billets of wood stray garments and chessmen  the fire had been put out so had the candle and we were thus in nearly pitch darkness when we heard a yell from salamander  it was followed by a great splash and we dimly perceived something like a halfnaked ghost floundering towards us  it was salamander  hold on shouted lumley  deres noting to hold on to monsieur cried the interpreter in desperation as he tripped over something and rose againgasping  the rush was over in half a minute but the great weight of water that had entered held the front door which opened inwards so tight that our hall was converted into a watertank about three feet deep while a huge mass of logs and debris outside blocked the opening of the back door  stay dont move till i get a light cried lumley wading to the corner cupboard where on an upper shelf we kept our candles with flint steel and tinder  while he was striking a light we all stood silent and shivering but when a candle was with difficulty lighted i burst into an irresistible fit of laughter for the scene we presented was ludicrous in the extreme it was not our woebegone looks which tickled me so much as the helpless drownedratlike aspect we had all assumedall except our chief whose tall strong figure holding a candle over his dishevelled head looked like the spirit of destruction presiding over a scene of desolation  a rapping at the front door was the first thing that recalled us to the necessity for action  is it drownded ye all are muster lumley  it was the voice of donald bane  not quite cried lumley with a laugh and a shiver  come in donald  ay ay sur i would come in if i could but the door wont open  shove hard donald  i wull sur  here shames lend a hand  we heard both the highlanders put their broad backs against the door and groan in gaelic as they heaved but they might as well have tried to lift the house  they caused the door to crack however  wheesht  whats that shames  weve splut the toor tonald  never mind heave again boys cried lumley  at that moment poor salamander who was groping about with nothing but his shirt on stumbled over something and in trying to recover himself pitched head first against the door with considerable violence  this was a climax  the door although it had withstood the pressure from without could not resist this additional pressure within  it collapsed and burst outwards suddenly  the great mass of water went forth with the gushing hilarity of a prisoner set free and with something like a roar of triumph carried salamander like a chip on its crest  he was launched into the bosom of the amazed james dougall who incontinently went with the stream laying hold of and carrying off donald bane as he passed  after a few turns over on the lawn the three men regained their footing and made their way back to the house while the stream subsiding almost immediately left us in peace to make the best of what james dougall called a paad chob  what had actually occurred was this the rock that held the main supports of our dam being detached from the cliff as lumley had surmised had been undermined by the unusual floods of the previous week  even in that condition it might have remained fast so strong was our artificial buttress but as the foundation wore away the rock heeled over to one side a little this deranged the direct action of the buttresses and in an instant they flew aside  the rock was hurled over and the whole of our dam was dashed in dire confusion into the bed of the stream  it was this choking of the natural channel which sent the great flood over our lawn and as we have seen created such a hubbub in the hall  of course all danger was now past  the roaring torrent soon forced its way into its own bed again and all we had to do was to repair damages as well as we could and make ourselves as comfortable for the night as circumstances would admit of  fortunately the next day was fine and warm with brilliant sunshine being sunday we let everything remain just as it was for lumley and i were of the same mind in regard to the sabbathday and from the commencement of our expedition had as far as possible rested from all weekday labour on that day  both of us had been trained to do so from infancy  well do i remember my dear old fathers last advice to me on this subject  punch said he wherever you go my boy remember the sabbathday to keep it holy  youll be tempted to do ordinary work and to go in for ordinary amusement on that day but dont do it my boydont do it  depend upon it a blessing always attends the respecter of the sabbath  but father said i venturing for the first time in my life to echo what i had often heard said is it true as some people assert that the sabbath is a jewish institution and no longer binding on christians  pardon my venturing to repeat this objection  objection interrupted my father why dear boy theres nothing i like better than to hear fair honest objections because then i can meet them  how can the sabbath be a jewish institution when the commandment begins with remember  the day to be remembered was instituted at creation given to man as a blessed day of rest from toil and recognised as binding by our saviour when he sanctioned works of necessity and mercy on that day  i never forgot my fathers advice on this subject and have experienced mental physical and spiritual benefit as the result  owing to our belief in the sabbath then we invariably while travelling remained in camp on that clay and found that we not only did not lose but actually had gained in speed at the end of each week comparing our rate of progress with that of those who did not rest on sundays  and i now recall to mind a certain bishop of the church of england who while travelling in the great norwest between two wellknown stations made the fastest journey on record although he regularly remained in camp on the sabbathday  on that day also after our arrival at lake wichikagan and all through the winter lumley made a regular practice of assembling the men and reading a sermon from a book which he had brought for the purpose  and he did not neglect instruction of another kind to which i shall refer as well as to our winter amusements in the proper place  during all this time our larder had been well supplied by blondin with fresh fish from the lake and by the indians with haunches of reindeer and moose or elk venison  they also brought us beavermeat the tails of which were considered the best portions  bearsmeat was offered us but we did not relish it much possibly from prejudice but we would have been glad of it doubtless if reduced to short allowance  of course wildfowl of all kinds were plentiful and many of these were shot by lumley and myself as well as by our men  some of the geese we had at first salted but the frost having come we were by that time able to preserve fish and meat quite fresh for winter useso that both net and gun were in constant occupation  one day while lumley and i were sitting at dinnerwhich we usually took about noonwe were agreeably surprised by the appearance of a strange indian and still more agreeably surprised by his entering the hall and holding out a packet to lumley  having delivered it the man who looked wayworn strode to the fire sat quietly down and began to smoke a pipe which i had handed to him ready charged  why whats this exclaimed lumley unwrapping the covering of the packet not a letter surelyyes i declare it isand from macnab too  come this is an unlookedfor treat  i was quite excitedindeed we both werefor a letter in those regions was about as rare as snow in july  lumley opened it hastily and read as follows  my dear lumley you will be surprised to get a letter from me and dated too from an unknown post  yes my boy like yourself i have been transferred from my old home to this region which is not more than two hundred miles from your present residence  the governor sent me to establish it soon after you left  i have named it the mountain house because theres a thing the shape and size of a sugarloaf behind it  so ill hope to look you up during the winter  before going further let me give you a piece of newsive got my sister out here to stay with me  just think of that  at this point lumley laid down the letter and stared at me  why max such a thing was never heard of before  if he had got a wife now i could have understood it but a sister  well whatever she is to him shes a civilised white woman and thats a sight worth seeing in those regions  i wonder what shes like said i  like himself of course  tall rawboned squareshouldered redhaired you know he told us she was redhaired squarejawed romannoseda macnab female could be nothing else  come said i dont be impolite to highland females but go on with the letter  lumley obeyed but the letter contained little more of interest  we cared not for that however  we had now a subject capable of keeping us in speculative talk for a weekthe mere fact that there was actually a civilised womana lady perhapsat all events a macnabwithin two hundred miles of us  no doubt shes a rugged specimen of the sex said lumley as we sat beside the fire that night no other kind of white female would venture to face this wilderness for the sake of a brother but she is a white woman and she is only two hundred miles offunless our friend is jokingand shes macnabs sisterjessie if i remember rightly    stalwart young jessie   the flower of  come lumley that will dogoodnight    chapter sixteen  the joys of camping outimportant additions to the establishment serious matters and winter amusements  at last winter came upon us in earnest  it had been threatening for a considerable time  sharp frosts had occurred during the nights and more than once we had on rising found thin ice forming on the lake though the motion of the running water had as yet prevented our stream from freezing but towards the end of october there came a day which completely changed the condition and appearance of things  every one knows the peculiar i may say the exhilarating sensations that are experienced when one looks out from ones window and beholds the landscape covered completely with the first snows of winter  well those sensations were experienced on the occasion of which i write in somewhat peculiar circumstances  lumley and i were out hunting at the time we had been successful and having wandered far from the fort resolved to encamp in the woods and return home early in the morning  i do love to bivouac in the forest i said as we busied ourselves spreading brushwood on the ground preparing the kettle plucking our game and kindling the fire especially at this season of the year when the sharp nights render the fire so agreeable  yes said lumley and the sharp appetites render food so delightful  to say nothing i added of the sharp wits that render intercourse so pleasant  ah and not to mention retorted lumley the dull wits stirred into unwonted activity which tone down that intercourse with flashes of weakly humour  now then max clap on more wood  dont spare the firingtheres plenty of it soisnt it grand to see the thick smoke towering upwards straight and solid like a pillar  seldom that one experiences a calm so perfect said i glancing upward at the slowlyrising smoke  dont you think it is the proverbial calm before the storm  dont know max  im not weatherwise  cant say that i understand much about calms or storms proverbial or otherwise and dont much care  thats not like your usual philosophical character lumley said isee the column is still quite perpendicular  come max interrupted my friend dont get sentimental till after supper  go to work and pluck that bird while i fill the kettle  if anything can drive away sentiment i replied taking up one of the birds which we had shot that day the plucking and cleaning of this will do it  on the contrary man returned lumley taking up the tin kettle as he spoke true sentiment if you had it would induce you to moralise on that bird as you plucked iton the romantic commencement of its career amid the reeds and sedges of the swamps in the great norwest on the bold flights of its maturer years over the northern wilderness into those mysterious regions round the pole which man with all his vaunted power and wisdom has failed to fathom and on the sadi may even say inglorioustermination of its course in a hunters pot to say nothing of a hunters stom  lumley said i interrupting do try to hold your tongue if you can and go fill your kettle  with a laugh he swung off to a spring that bubbled at the foot of a rock hard by and when he returned i had my bird plucked singed split open and cleaned out  you must understand reader that we were not particular  we were wont to grasp the feathers in large handfuls and such as would not come off easily we singed off  you see lumley said i when he came back i dont intend that this bird shall end his career in the pot  ill roast him  tis well most noble max for i wouldnt let you pot him even if you wished to  we have only one kettle and that must be devoted to tea  it was not long before the supper was ready  while it was preparing lumley and i sat chatting by the fire and gazing in a sort of dreamy delight at the glorious view of land and water which we could see through an opening among the trees in front of us for not only was there the rich colouring of autumn everywherethe greens yellows browns and reds of mosses grasses and variegated foliagebut there was a bright golden glow cast over all by the beams of the setting sun  ere long all this was forgotten as we lay under the starry sky in profound slumber  while we slept the creator was preparing that wonderful and beautiful change to which i have referred  clouds gradually overspread the skyi observed this when in a halfsleeping state i rose to mend our fire but thought nothing of it  i did not however observe what followed for sleep had overpowered me again the instant i lay down  softly silently persistently and in large flakes the snow must have fallen during the entire night for when we awoke it lay half a foot deep upon us and when we shook ourselves free and looked forth we found that the whole landscape far and near was covered with the same pure white drapery  the uniformity of the scene was broken by the knolls of trees and shrubs and belts of forest which showed powerfully against the white ground and by the water of the numerous ponds and lakes and streams which where calm reflected the bright blue sky and where rough sparkled in the rising sun while every twig and leaf of bush and tree bore its little fringe or patch of snow so that we were surrounded by the most beautiful and complicated forms of lacework conceivable of natures own making  it is glorious to look at said lumley after our first burst of enthusiasm but it will be troublesome to walk through i fear  we did not however find it as troublesome as we had expected for although nearly a foot deep the snow was quite dry owing to the frost which had set in and we could drive it aside with comparative ease when we started on our journey homeward  arrived at the fort we found our men and the few indians who had not left us for their huntinggrounds busy at the nets or finishing the buildings that were yet incomplete  we also found that big otter had come in bringing with him his wife and his niece waboose with her mother  the health of the latter had broken down and big otter had brought her to the fort in the hope that the white chief could do something for her  ill do what i can said lumley on hearing her case stated though i make no pretence to being a medicineman but i will do this for you and heri will engage you if you choose to help blondin at his fishery and your wife to make moccasins for us  ill also let you have that little hut beside our kitchen to live in  youll find it better and warmer than a wigwam and as there are two rooms in it you wont be overcrowded  big otter was delighted with this arrangement and i took him away at once to show him the hut he was to occupy  as this was the first time i had met with the unknown englishmans widow and the mother of waboose it was with no little interest and curiosity that i regarded her  she was evidently in very bad health but i could easily see that when young she must have been a very handsome woman  besides being tall and wellformed she had a most expressive countenance and a dignified air coupled with a look of tender kindness in it which drew me to her at once  she seemed in many respects much superiorin manners and habitsto the other indian women of the tribe though still far below her daughter in that respect and i could easily perceive that the latter owed her great superiority and refinement of manner to her father though she might well have derived her gentleness from her mother  what the illness was that broke that mother down i cannot tell  it resembled consumption in some respects though without the cough but she improved in health decidedly at first on getting into her new house and set to work with zeal to assist in the making of moccasins and other garments  of course waboose helped her and very soon after this arrival i began to give her lessons in the english language  lumley quizzed me a good deal about this at first but afterwards he became more serious  now max my boy he said to me one evening when we were alone in that kindlyserious manner which seemed to come over him whenever he had occasion to find fault with any one it is all very well your giving lessons in english to that indian girl but what i want to know is what do you expect to be the upshot of it  marriage said i with prompt decision ifif she will have me i added with a more modest air  my friend did not laugh or banter me as i had expected but in an earnest tone said  but think max you are only just entering on manhood you cant be said to know your own mind yet  suppose now that you were to express an intention to marry waboose the hudsons bay company might object till you had at least finished your apprenticeship  but i would not think of it before that said i  and then continued lumley not noticing the interruption if you do marry her you can never more return to the civilised world for she is utterly ignorant of its ways and would feel so ill at ease there and look so much out of place that you would be obliged to take to the woods again and live and die thereandwhat would your father say to that  i confess that this reference to my dear father shook me  but lumley said i she is not a mere indian girl and would not look out of place anywhere  her father was obviously a gentleman and has tried with much success i find to cultivate a naturally gentle and delicate mind and disposition in his child  surely very little is required to make a lady of heri mean in the sense that society understands by that termand even if that were not possible is mere polish to be weighed in the balance against gentleness sweetness unselfishness tenderness truthfulness modesty lovingkindnessto say nothing of beauty  a hearty laugh interrupted me here  oh  max i admit that polish must go down before such a splendid array of virtues  but added my friend becoming grave again is waboose a christian  yes i replied stoutly a far far better christian than i am for i find that her father has taught her the truths of the bibleand you you see that fruit in her which i fear you dont see much of in me  well we have not had much time to see the fruit yet but now i must speak to you as your chief  you say you have no thought of marriage till your apprenticeship is up  that is a good while yet  you may change your mind  never said i with emphasis  well i respect your honourable feelings my boy but it is just possible that even if she were willing which has yet to be proved she may change her mind therefore you must promise me faithfully that in all this teaching of english there shall be no lovemaking  you are bound in honour max to avoid trying to win her affections or in any way to influence her tilltill time a considerable timeshall have passed  i promise you lumley with all my heart  i think it is ennobling to a man to love a girl because of her pure and sterling qualities irrespective of her looks and i would count it foul disgrace to do anything to win her unless i saw my way quite clearly to wed her  which you do not at present max  which i do not at present lumley so i will continue the lessons with the air and manner of a heartless pedagogue  this having been arranged between us the subject was dropped and not again referred to for many months  meanwhile winter advanced with rapid strides  one night an intense frost set in and covered the entire lake as far at least as we could see with a sheet of pure ice  it had set fast in a profound calm and the surface was so smooth that every tree and bush on the outlying islets was reflected as if in water  indeed it could scarcely be told that the ice was not water except by going on it  being a somewhat expert skater and having brought my skates with me i put them on resolved to enjoy a few hours of what used to be a favourite amusement when i was a boy  lumley could not skate to my regret besides he had no skates and none of the men had ever learned the art so that i was forced to skate alone  and at this time i learned a lesson about solitary amusement which i never afterwards forgot  max said lumley as i went down to the lake skates in hand while youre off amusing yourself ill go finish the track on the hillside that will afford amusement enough for me and the men  ill give them a holiday as it is such a splendid day  thats a new kind of holiday said i with a laugh as i fixed on my skates to set them to the finishing of a track  the track referred to was a straight wide cutting up the face of the hill at the side of the fort  lumley had ordered the men to clear it of trees and shrubs from the hilltopwhich extended far behind as well as high above the fortdown to the edge of the lake  it had remained in this unfinished state for some time and now being covered with snow formed a long whitefloored avenue to the hilltop  im sorry you cant join me said i making a few circles before starting  it feels so selfish to go off alone  never mind old boy off you go and see that you dont get upon weak ice  lumley waved his hand as he spoke and i shot swiftly away over the glassy lake  oh it was a glorious burst that first dash over an apparently illimitable sheet of water for although small for an american lake the opposite shore of wichikagan was so faroff as to appear dim and low while in one direction the sky and water met at the horizon so that i enjoyed the romantic feeling of as it were skating out to sea the strength of youth thrilled in every nerve and muscle the vigour of health and life coursed in every vein  i felt just then as if exhaustion were impossible  the ice was so smooth that there was no sensation of roughness under foot to tell of a solid support  the swift gliding motion was more like the skimming of the swallow than the skating of a man  the smallest impulse sent me shooting ahead with an ease that almost surprised me  in sensation as well as in appearance i was rushing over a surface of water in which the sun was reflected with a brilliancy that quite dazzled me  i became almost wild with delight  indeed i grew reckless and gave a sort of leapwith what intent i know notwhich caused the back of my head to smite the ice and my body to proceed fifty yards or more on its back with the legs in the air and a starry constellation corruscating in the brain  considerably sobered by this i arose and cut the figure of eight thoughtfully for five minutes  after this i resumed my rapid pace which i kept up until the necessity of pausing to recover breath impressed me  making a wide circle outwards with my left leg in the air and my right hand pointed to the sky in the most approved manner i gradually caused the circle to diminish until i came to a stand  looking back i saw fort wichikagan like a mere speck on the horizon in the opposite direction the lake still presented a limitless horizon on either side the distant shores marked but could hardly be said to bound the view while closer at hand the islets were reflected in the ice as clearly as if it had been water  i felt as if standing on a liquid ocean  once more a bounding sense of joyous freedom and strength filled me  the starry corruscations had vanished  the bump on the back of my head had ceased to grieve me  away i went again likebut words fail me  imagery and description avail nothing when the indescribable is reached  after an hour of this enjoyment i took to circling and in the exuberance of my feelings attempted some quite new and complex performances which resulted in a few more corruscations and bumps  but these were trifles  i heeded them not  at last however i stood still and became thoughtful  we must all become thoughtful sooner or later  a sense of loneliness began to oppress me and i longed for companionship in my joy  knowing that this was a useless longing i cast it aside and resumed my evolutions rushes bumps and corruscations  but it would not do  the longing returned with redoubled violence  after another hour i turned to skate homeward very much toned down in spirits and deeply convinced of the truthin more senses than oneof the words it is not good that man should be alone  before leaving this subject i may add that i tried skating again the next day but again grew weary of it in less than an hour for want of companionship that i made up my mind in disgust to try no more and that on the day following sympathetic nature aided me in my resolve by covering the entire lake with eighteen inches of snowthus rendering my once favourite exercise impossible  but to return  when i drew near to the fort i observed that several black specks were gliding with lightning speed down the white track on the hillside which lumley had undertaken to finish  these specks after descending the steep hill slid over the level shore and shot far out upon the lake where some of them seemed to roll over and over wondering what this could be i put on a spurt  suddenly the truth dawned upon me  my friend lumley had cleared the slope for the purpose of sledging down it  max he had remarked to me long before when talking about our men and our plans all work and no play you know makes jack a dull boy so ill get up some kind of winter amusement for the lads which will keep them in health and spirits  need i say that my recent cogitations and experience led me to join this riotous crew with redoubled ardour  taking off my skates hurriedly and climbing up the hill i leaped on the tail of big otters toboggan without invitation just as he was starting at the top of the snowslope to follow lumley  i gave the sled such an impetus that we overtook our chief and upset him just as he reached the lake causing him to collide with donald bane and james dougall who seated on the same toboggan were anxiously striving to keep their balance  the result was that we all resolved ourselves into a conglomerate of toboggans and men which went shooting and struggling over the smooth lake for fifty yards or upwards at the rate of twelve miles an hour if not more  this of course afforded unutterable delight to the rest of our men and to waboose and her mother as well as to several indians who had just arrived  among these last were attick and maqua with his son mozwa  it was rough but healthgiving as well as enjoyable work and sent us to our respective beds that night in a condition of readiness to fall promptly into a state of absolute oblivion    chapter seventeen  describes a tremendous visitationa feasta surpriseand an attempt at murder  i must beg the reader now to leap with me into the middle of winter  it is new years day  that festive season of the year is not less marked and honoured in the great norwest than it is in civilised lands though there are comparatively few to honour it and their resources are somewhat meagre  these facts do not however diminish the hearty zeal of the fewperchance they tend rather to increase it  be that as it may i now convey the reader to an icebound forest  deep snow has buried the frozen ground  masses of snow weigh down the branches of the leafless trees and evergreens which are not leafless are literally overwhelmed almost obliterated by the universal covering  but the scene is by no means dismal  a blue sky overhead and a bright sun and calm frosty air render it preeminently cheerful  the ground is undulating and among these undulations you may see two men and a couple of sledges slowly making their way along  the sledge in rear is the ordinary provisionsled used by winter travellers in that land it is hauled by an indian  the one in front is styled a cariole  it resembles a slipperbath in form is covered with yellow parchment gaily painted and drawn by four fine wolflike dogs the rider in that cariole is so whelmed in furs as to be absolutely invisible  the man who beats the track has a straight stalwart frame and from what of his countenance is left exposed by his fur cap and whiskers one may judge that he is a white man  slowly and silently they plod along through the deep snowthe sleighbells on the dogs harness tinkling pleasantly  ere long they come out upon a lake where the snow being beaten pretty hard they proceed rapidlythe dogs trotting and the leader having changed to the rear holding on to the carioleline to restrain them  towards the afternoon the travellers draw towards the end of the lake and then a spirit of mischief seems to enter into the wolflike dogs for on turning round a point which reveals a wide reach of hard snow stretching away towards a distant group of buildings more than half buried in drift they make a sudden bound overturn the stalwart white man jerk the tailline from his grasp and career away joyously over the ice causing their bells to send up an exceeding merry and melodious peal  from certain incomprehensible growls that escape the stalwart white man as he picks himself up it might be conjectured that he had taken to the chipewyan tongue perhaps a scotsman might have been led by them to recall the regions that lie north of the grampians  lumley and i were sitting in the hall of fort wichikagan awaiting the advent of dinner when the sound of the sleighbells just referred to broke upon our ears  we bounded from our seats as if galvanised seized our caps and rushed out  a cariole shouted lumley  run away said i  as i spoke the figure of a man was seen rushing round the point in pursuit  macnab cried lumley with blazing eyes id know his figure at twenty miles off  i say max the runaway cariole must certainly contain the sisterthe carrotyhaired jessie  hurrah  we must stop it my boy else the dogs will run slap into the fort and dash the fair sixfooter against one o the houses  look out man  but lumley was wrong  either the dogs had run as much as they desired or the decided manner in which we faced them caused them to swerve aside and stop when they came close to us  the swerve had the effect of overturning the cariole gently and emptying its contents at our feet and out from the mass of wraps and furs there arosenot a redheaded sixfooter but a young and sprightly girl with clear dark complexion a neat rounded little figure and a pair of magnificent black eyes which at the moment were opened to their utmost with an expression of intense amazement  lumley gazed at this apparition openmouthed with a look of blank surprise  i believe that my own visage must also have worn some remarkable expression for suddenly the girls gorgeous eyes half closed and she burst into a hearty fit of laughter  well this is a surprise exclaimed lumley on recovering some of his usual selfpossession  so it would seem replied the apparition still laughing for it has robbed you of common politeness  why dont you introduce yourself and welcome me  no doubt you are my brothers friend mr lumley  she drew a very small white hand from a very large leather mitten and held it out  forgive me miss macnabfor of course you can be no other said lumley advancing promptly and grasping the hand but youryour sudden and i may almost say magical appearance has so taken me by surprise thatthat  yes yes i understand mr lumleythat you find it difficult to recover yourselfwhy your friend mr maxby has not yet recovered said the fair jessie turning and holding out her hand to me  she was right  i had not recovered but stood there openmouthed and eyed bereft of speech until the necessity for action was thrust upon me  my apologies were however cut short by the coming up of her brother who while yet a long way off began to shout in his stentorian tones  hallo  lumley my boy how are ye  here we are at last  a happy new year max  glad to see you once moreall alive and hearty  eh  more than i expected to find you jess after such a run with these rascally dogsabsolute wolves  but it might have been worse  give us a shake o your fists my boys on this happy new years day  by this time our hearty friend was beside us shaking us both vigorously by the hands wishing us all manner of good luck and compliments of the season and otherwise letting off the steam of his exuberant feelings  youve introduced yourselves i see he continued come lumley give your arm to jessie and show us the way to the fort  if miss macnab began lumley advancing but his speech was here cut short  miss macnab echoed the explosive peter in a sarcastic shout call her jessie man who ever heard of a miss macnab in the backwoods when men take to living in the wilderness its time to cast off all the humbuggin politenesses o civilised life  pardon me macnab returned my friend with more than his usual urbanity i differ from you there  oh ay i daresay ye do interrupted the other  its been said of scotsmen that they can aye objec and i think its equally true of englishmen that they can always differ  men who live in the wilderness continued lumley merely answering the interruption with a smile ought to be unusually particular about keeping up all the politenesses of civilised life instead of dropping them and ought to be inexpressibly thankful when a soft and civilising influence like miss macnab condescends to visit them with a ray of sunshine from the old country  bravo lumley cried macnab with a boisterous laugh that speech was worthy of an irishman  call her what you like my good fellow so long as you never call her too late for meals but come along now and lets have something to eat for im famishing  by this time the indian with the sled had joined us so we all went off to the fort in a state of boisterous joy of which those unfortunates who have never been banished from their fellows for monthsor for yearscan form no conception  as dinner was opportunely smoking on the table when we entered the hall our visitors hilarity was if possible increased  moreover we had company that new years day for a knife and fork had been laid in the hall for every man at the fort  you see lumley was a strict disciplinarian and therefore could afford at special times to relax without loss of dignity and with a great increase of goodwill on the part of all under him  at all other times we and the menexcepting our guidemessed apart but on christmas and new years days all distinctions were laid aside discipline was relaxed and we acted on the principle of that brotherhood which is based upon the assumption that all men have the same objects in life and the same hopes after death  that morning we had all played football on the ice together had slidden and tumbled down the snowslope together and now we were about to mess together in the hall  still further our company was to be increased and our festive board to be graced by the presence of waboose and her mother  little had we imagined when all this was planned that we were to have the addition of our old friend macnab and that glorious beam from the sun of civilisation his sister jessie  i will however make but brief reference to this festive occasion and proceed to tell of an event which created an unexpected sensation in our little community and might have closed our new years day amusements with a terrible tragedy  after dinner we circled round the blazing fire and enjoyed ourselves listening to macnab who had a happy facility in giving a graphic account of his sledge journey from the mountain forthis recently built tradingpostto fort wichikagan and i observed particularly that the presence of a lady among us had a most wonderful and irresistible influence in softening the tones and the manners of all  as the evening advanced tea was introducedwe had nothing stronger and did not indeed feel any desire for firewater  under the inspiriting influence of this beverage several of our men were induced to tell stories which were more or less humorous  during the mealat which lumley insisted that miss macnab should preside to the immense disgust of salamanderi observed that the darkhaired white girl and the fairhaired indian drew very closely together  it appeared to me that they had fallen in love with each other at first sight a fact which afforded me lively satisfaction though i had no very clear perception as to why it should do so  songs naturally followed the cheering cup and at this point lumley became unusually bold  i wonder he said with a peculiar air of modesty which somewhat puzzled me if i may venture to ask miss macnab for a song  ha ha shouted her brother before she could reply you may venture to ask my boy but youll find it difficult to draw a song out of jessie  why she never could sing a note  ive a good mind to sing now peter said the girl with a laugh just to prove that you are a false man  no no jessie spare me returned the highlander but get out your accordion and  accordion almost shouted lumley do you play the accordion  have you really got one here  it is but right to say in justification of lumleys enthusiasm that music of any kind was so seldom heard in those wilds that the mere prospect of hearing good music excited us for of course our natural thought was that a girl like jessie macnab could not perform anything but good music  as she rose to go for the instrument to salamanders roomwhich had been made over to hera growling gaelic exclamation made me aware of the fact that the faces of donald bane and james dougall were beaming with hope mingled with admiration of their countrywoman  she had naturally paid these men a good deal of attention and in addition to her other good qualities spoke their native tongue fluently  as dougall afterwards said she hes the gaelic  on returning to the hall with the once familiar and wellremembered instrument i believe every man there felt a tendency to worship her but who shall describe the effect produced when she began to play with the utmost facility and with deep feeling one of the most beautiful of the plaintive scottish melodies  bane and dougall shaded their rugged faces with their rugged hands to hide the tears that could not be restrained  lumley whose mind although untouched by associations was peculiarly susceptible to sweet sounds sat entranced  so did big otter who could only glare because instrument tune and performer were alike new and magical to him  even salamander forgot his jealousy and almost collapsed with wonder  as for dumont coppet and the othersthey clasped their hands opened their eyes and mouths and simply drank it in  there was no applause when the air ceased but a deep sigh from every one seemed to be the indication of a return to ordinary consciousness waboose and her mother did not sigh however  they sat still and gazed in silent wonder  jessie macnab with a slight blush at the unexpected effect ran her fingers lightly over the keys of her instrument and then suddenly began to play a highland reel with tremendous vigour  if an electric shock had traversed the marrow or our backbones the result could not have been more surprising  wow  tougall man exclaimed bane starting up and flinging away his chair  dougall said nothing but he uttered a celtic yell suggestive of war and all its horrors to big otter and starting up began the highland fling opposite to his friend in the most violent manner  as i was not a bad dancer of scots reels myself and the music had caused me also to boil over i started up likewise and faced macnab who being equally affected stood up to me in a moment and away we went hammer and tongs with stamp and whoop and snap of fingeroh the scene is indescribable  indeed i may say that to an ordinary civilised man who never saw it the scene is inconceivable sowe will pass on  while these stirring events were taking place inside the hall a blackfaced redpainted savage was flattening his ugly nose against a pane of glass outside one of the windows  it was attick whom our chief had convicted of stealing about the time of our arrival  that unpleasant savage had never forgiven lumley and being exceedingly vindictive had resolved to murder him  with this end in view he had been prowling about the place for several days having arrived with a band of his tribe who had assembled at christmastime to enjoy some of the good cheer which they understood to be going at that season among the palefaces  on new years night unknown to his comradesfor it was his intention to do the deed secretly and leave the imputation upon allhe watched his opportunity and thought he had found it when after the dance was over and the guests had retired he saw lumley seated by the fire in conversation with the newlyarrived paleface girl  macnab and i had gone with the men to their house for some purposei forget whatso that the two were left alone  attick might easily have opened the door and shot his victim but the report he knew would have roused every one besides his absence at the moment and his dirty gun would have betrayed him to his comrades so being a strong man he preferred the scalpingknife with the use of which he was of course familiar  now it chanced that there hung a small lookingglass over the hall fireplace  in that glass lumley could see not only himself but the door and windows of the room behind him as he sat chatting with jessie macnab  happening to glance into the glass he observed the flattened nose of attick on the windowpane with the glaring eyes above it  a teteatete with the fair jessie was too pleasant however to be interrupted by such a trifle he therefore continued the conversation though he kept a sharp lookout behind him  presently he saw the door openopen so gently that it gave forth no sound  immediately after a blackened and savage head appeared with a diabolical expression on the countenance  it was followed slowly by a hand in which a gleaming knife was clutched  lumley now fully understood what was meditated for he recognised attick through his warpaint  he did not move however for he felt that if he sprang up too soon the savage could easily leap back through the doorway and escape into the dark woods  he therefore laid strong constraint on himself and waited  miss macnabs back was turned to the savage but not having the advantage of the glass she could not see him and continued her pleasant prattle  like a dark noiseless shadow the indian advanced and raised his knife  then you like this wilderness life asked jessie at that moment  yes i confess miss macnab that it has its charms as well as its disagreeablesthe utter want of society being the worst of the latter  i should have thought said the girl looking up that youbut butwhy do you gaze and frown so fiercely at that  she was promptly answered for lumley sprang up at the moment with pantherlike agility wheeled round seized the uplifted arm and with a wrench so violent as to break it he hurled the savage to the ground  jessie macnab sprang up in consternation but did not give way to that supposed femaleinalarm necessitya scream  at the same moment macnab and i entered  hallo  lumley  whats all this cried macnab  nobody hurt i hope  i fear the indian is hurt somewhat said our chief looking down at his enemy who lay stunned upon the floor  go max assemble our men and fetch all the indians  in a few minutes all were assembled in the hall when lumley in a low stern voice related what had occurred appealing to jessie to corroborate what he said  now he added in conclusion turning to the indians i have no quarrel with you  there lies your comrade  he has forfeited his life to me but i forgive him  take him away  lumley said no more as in solemn surprise and silence the indians lifted up their comrade and bore him out of the hall but he took good care to make no reference whatever to the lookingglass and i verily believe that to this day it is believed by the redmen of that region that lumley has eyes in the back of his head    chapter eighteen  the mysterious packetfriends depart and lumley is caught singing  the uncertainty of all sublunary things is a truism so trite that i do not mean to insult the readers understanding by attempting to prove it i merely refer to it in order to say that the great norwest is not exempt from that general rule of uncertainty  at first peace and prosperity attended us at least in all the main lines of life with only trivial variations and we felt disposed to believe that the sunshine would continue to gladden us throughout the whole winter  but such was not to be the case  soon after the events narrated in the last chapter clouds began to gather the peaceful flow of our life was interrupted and at last a storm burst which filled the inhabitants of our little fort with consternation  after the attempted murder by attick on new years day the indians left the fort taking their wounded friend along with them  no doubt they felt that it would be scarcely reasonable in them to expect to be entertained with the good things of the palefaces after the dastardly attempt that had been made on our chiefs life  but attick who had been wounded more deeply in his feelings than in his body resolved to be revenged  he was the more urged to this because his savage affections had been fixed on and no doubt he had been sharp enough to perceive my own regard for the girl and was jealous enough to believe that i would take advantage of my position and of her residence at the fort to supplant him  bad men invariably find likeminded spirits ready to help them in their dark designs  among the redskins of his tribe attick found no difficulty in securing the allegiance of one or two men who were in the habit of looking up to him as their leader and it was not very long before he found his opportunityas shall soon be told  when the macnabs had spent three weeks with us they set off on the return journey to the mountain fort taking waboose along with themfor jessie macnab had taken so strong a fancy to the fairhaired halfcaste that she had prevailed on her to agree to visit the mountain fort in company with her mother from whom she refused to be separated even for a few days  before their departure however i had a conversation with waboose in which i reminded her of the packet about which she had spoken to me on a memorable occasion in the woods  i may remark here in passing that i had conscientiously held to my promise to lumley and had carefully abstained from making the slightest effort to gain the girls affections or to show her the state of my own feelings  indeed i had rather avoided her as much as possible without appearing rude or unkind of course i could not however help showing my pity for and sympathy with her poor invalid mother and as i was the only one in our little community who possessed the smallest knowledge of medicine or surgery i was forced to visit their hut daily in the capacity of doctor  waboose said i during the conversation above referred to you need not be anxious about your mother  i feel assured that her complaint is of such a nature that her general health will be benefited by a trip over the snowprovided she is kept warm and does not travel too far each day  of course there is no fear of that with you and miss macnab to look after her and i have given careful directions to mr macnab how to treat her  you are very kind replied the girl with much earnestness of tone and manner  and now waboose i continued you remember saying long ago you would show me the packet that  yes it is here she said quickly taking it out of the folds of a light shawl which covered her shouldersthe gift of jessieand handing it to me  thank you  well i will examine it carefully this afternoon and give it back to you tomorrow before you start  no keep it  i can trust you she said with a simple look that somehow depressed me for it was almost too simple and sisterly to my mind  besides she added it is safer in your hands than mine and when i come again you will explain to me what it contains  next day the party left us  it consisted of macnab who with his wonted energy of nature was leader and beater of the track the sprightly jessie in a cariole drawn by four dogs wabooses mother in a similar cariole and the fair waboose herself on snowshoes for she preferred the mode of travelling to which she had been most accustomed two indians dragging provisionsleds brought up the rear  it had been arranged that i should convoy the party to their first bivouac in the snow spend the night with them and continue to journey with them the second day as far as was consistent with the possibility of returning to the fort that night  jack lumley accompanied us at first but another small party of indians had come in to stay at the fort at that time and although he had i am certain a very strong desire to go further with his usual selfsacrificing spirit when duty pointed another way he turned and left us at the end of a few miles  i spent the night in the snowbivouac as arranged and continued to journey onward with the party next day until macnab refused to let me go another step  now max he said laughingly you must turn here  why man it will be midnight before you get in good walker though you be  come goodbye  well well i suppose its better to turn since you seem tired of my company said i turning to jessie who stood up in her sleigh to shake hands  goodbye miss macnab  jessie man jessienone of your miss macnabs here else ill tumble you into the snow by way of farewell shouted the irrepressible highlander  very well goodbye jessie said i with a laugh though my heart was heavy enough  goodbye waboosefarewell all  with a wave of his hand macnab tramped on ahead the sleighbells rang out merrily and the rest of the party followed  after they had gone a few yards waboose turned and waved her hand again as i looked on her fair face glowing with health and exercise her upright graceful figure in its picturesque costume and her modest mien i felt that two beams of light had shot from her bright blue eyes and pierced my heart right through and through  it was a double shotboth barrels if i may say sowell aimed at the centre of the bullseye  next moment she was gonethe whole party having dipped over the brow of a snowdrift  an indian a halfcaste  i exclaimed in a burst of contempt going off over the plain at five miles an hour nothing of the sort  a ladyone of natures ladiesborn and brno not bred no need for breeding where genuine purity gentleness tenderness simplicity modesty  i stuck at this point partly for want of words and partly because my snowshoes catching on a twig sent my feet into the air and stuck my head and shoulders deep into a drift of snow  though my words were stopped however the gush of my enthusiasm flowed steadily on  and what can be more worthy of mans admiration and respectful affection  i argued as i recovered my perpendicular coughed the snow out of my mouth and nose and rubbed it out of my eyes what more worthy of truehearted devotion than thisthiscreature ofof light this noble child of naturethis queen of the wilderness  i repeated this queen of the wilderness for a considerable time afterwards  it seemed to me a happy expression and i dwelt upon it with much satisfaction as i sped along sending the fine snow in clouds of white dust from my snowshoes and striding over the ground at such a pace that i reached fort wichikagan considerably before midnight in spite of macnabs prophecy  i am not naturally prone thus to lay bare the secret workings of my spirit  you will therefore i trust good reader regard the revelation of these things as a special mark of confidence  on reaching the fort i observed that a bright light streamed from the hall windows casting a ruddy glow on the snowheaps which had been shovelled up on each side of the footpath in front and giving if possible a paler and more ghostly aspect to the surrounding scenery  i went to one of the windows and imitating attick flattened my nose against a pane  a pain was the immediate result for the glass being intensely cold i was obliged to draw back promptly  lumley was seated alone at one side of the fire in the familiar attitude of a man who meditates profoundlyor sleepily namely with his legs stretched straight out in front of him his hands deep in his trouserspockets and his chin sunk on his breast while his eyes stared fixedly at the flames  i was about to quit my post of observation when a sudden action of my friend arrested me  drawing up his legs grasping his knees with his hands turning his eyes to the ceiling with that gaze which implies that planks and roof count for nothing in the way of intercepting the flight of mind to the realms of inspiration lumley opened his handsome mouth and broke forth into song  he had a magnificently harsh voice  i could distinguish both air and words through the double windows  the song was that which i have already quoted elsewherelovely young jessie the flower of dunblane the deep pathos of his tone was thrilling  it flashed a new thought into my brain  then i became amazed at my own blind stupidity  i now understood the meaning of that restless activity which had struck me recently as being so uncharacteristic of my sedate friend that anxiety to have all our food well cooked and nicely served in one who habitually took food just as it came and cared nothing for quality or appearance that unusual effort to keep our hall neat and in order those sharp reproofs to the astonished salamander for failure in punctuality at mealhours that very slight indication of a more frequent use of the brush and comb in one whose crisp curls required little aid from such implements  under the excitement of my discovery i burst into the room with oh lumley you deceiver cutting him short in the very middle of those repeated lovely young jessies which constitute the very pith and marrow of the song  why max back already cried my friend starting up with a slightlyconfused look which confirmed my suspicion and rattling on at a pace which was plainly meant to carry me past the subject  how you must have walked to be sure unless indeed you convoyed them only a short part of the way but that could not have been the case  it would have been so unlike your gallant nature maxeh  well and how did they get on  snow not too soft i hope  encampment comfortable  but no fear of that of course with peter macnab as leader  no capsizes  none said i seizing advantage of a slight pause everything went as well as possible and the carioles went admirablyespecially jessies  i looked at him pointedly as i said this but he coolly stooped to lift a billet and put it on the fire as he rattled on again  yes  thats just what i hoped for though i could not be quite sure of it for she has the old one which i had patched up as well as possible you see as macnab saidand of course i agreed with himit was only fair that the invalid should have the strongest and easiestgoing conveyance  by the way max ive heard some news  do you know that that scoundrel attick is stirring up the tribes against us  nois he said i quite forgetting the fair jessie at this piece of information  yes and the rascal i fear may do us irreparable damage before we can tame him for he has considerable influence with the young and fiery spirits among the savagesso big otter says  fortunately his power lies only in the tongue at present for it seems i broke his arm the night he tried to murder me but that will mend in time  very unfortunate said i that this should happen at the beginning of our career in this region  we must thwart his plans if we can  moreover continued lumley with a sly look i am told that he has the presumption to aspire to the hand of waboose  indeed  i exclaimed as a flame of indignation seemed to shoot through my whole frame we must thwart his plans in that direction emphatically  of course of course said my friend gravely it would never do to let such a sweet girl throw herself away on a savage besides shes such a favourite with jessie macnab you know  it would never do never  i looked at him quickly but he was gazing abstractedly at the fire  i felt that i was no match for my friend at badinage and gave it up  but what do you think he could do  i asked with some anxiety after a few minutes thought  you know that waboose would as soon think of marrying that bloodthirsty savage as she would think of marrying aa  a pinetree or a grizzly bear  yes i know interrupted lumley he will never get her with her own consent but you know that savages have a knack of marrying women without their consent and then there is the possibility of his attempting to carry her offand various other possibilities  i saw that my friend was jestingly attempting to test my feelings but i made no reply at first though i felt strongly on the subject  well lumley said i at length your first suggestion i meet with the reply that the consent of parents is not ignored among indians and that wabooses mother is an indian of so highminded and refined a naturepartly acquired no doubt from her husbandthat she will never consent to give her daughter to such a man such a brute i might say considering what he attempted  as to waboose herself her fathers gentle nature in her secures her from such a misfortune and as to her being carried offwell i dont think any savages would be bold enough to try to carry off anything from the grip of peter macnab and when we get her back here we will know how to look after her  it may be so said lumley with a sigh and now my boy to change the subject we must buckle to our winters work in right good earnest i mean what may be styled our philanthropic work for the other work firewoodcutting hunting store arranging preparation for the return of indians in spring with their furs and all the other odds and ends of dutyis going along swimmingly but our classes must be resumed now that the holidays are over for we have higher interests to consider than the mere eating that we may live and living that we may eat  all right said i heartily for i was very glad to help in a species of work which i felt gave dignity to all our other labours  ill get the slates out and start the men at arithmetic tomorrow evening from the place where we left off  what will you do  give them robinson crusoe over again  no max i wont do that not just now at all events  ill only finish the story and then begin the pilgrims progress  you observed no doubt that i had been extending my commentaries on robinson especially towards the last chapters  yeswhat of that  well i am free to confess that that was intentionally done  it was a dodge my boy to get them into the habit of expecting and submitting to commentary for i intend to come out strong in that line in my exposition of the pilgrimas you shall see  i brought the book with this very end and the long winter nights in view  and i mean to take it easy toospin it out  i wont bore them with too much at a time  good but dont spin it out too long lumley said i you know when men set their hearts on some magnificent plan or scheme they are apt to become prosy  i suppose youll also take the writing class as before  i suppose i must returned my friend with a sigh though it goes against the grain for i was never very good at penmanship and we have lost our best scholars too now that waboose and her mother are gone  by the way that reminds me said i that waboose gave me the packet which she received from her father not long before he was drowned  here it is  i drew it from my breastpocket and held it up  she told me her father had said it was no use her opening it as she could not read it but that she was to give it to the first white man whom she could trust you remember my mentioning that to you she gave it to me only yesterday and i have not yet found time to read it  did she say she could trust you max  of course she did  why not  oh certainly why not repeated my friend with a peculiar look did she say you might communicate its contents to me  well no she did not i replied feeling rather perplexed  but i am quite sure that if she meant to trust me at all she meant to trust to my discretion in the whole matter andjack lumley i added getting up and grasping my friends hand if i cannot trust you i can trust nobody  that will do he said returning the squeeze  you are safe  go ahead  the packet was wrapped in a piece of birchbark and tied with a bit of fibrous root  this covering removed i found a white cambric handkerchief inside of which was something hard  it turned out to be the miniature of a handsome man somewhere between forty and fifty beside it was a manuscript in english  on one corner of the kerchief was marked in faded ink the name eve  holding out the portrait i saidyou see  i knew he was a gentleman this must be her father  no doubt replied lumleybut what says this letter  unfolding the manuscript i spread it carefully on my knee and began to read    chapter nineteen  opening of the mysterious packet  the manuscript was without date or preface and its contents interested as well as surprised us not a little  it began at once as follows  whoever receives this packet and letter from my daughter receives a sacred trust which he dare not shake off and which i solemnly charge him in the sight of god to take up and fulfil  at the moment while i write i am well and strong and not old  it is my firm intention if god spares me to pursue the course which is herein detailed but i know too well the risk and dangers of the wilderness to feel assured that i shall live to act out my part  i therefore write down here as briefly as i can my story and my wishes and shall give the letter with my miniature to my darling waboosewhose christian name is eve though she knows it notwith directions not to open it or let it out of her hands until she meets with a white man whom she can trust for well assured am i that the man whom my innocent and wisehearted eve can trustbe he old or youngwill be a man who cannot and will not refuse the responsibility laid on him  why i prefer to leave this packet with my daughter instead of my dear wife is a matter with which strangers have nothing to do  i begin by saying that i have been a great sinner but thank god i have found jesus a great saviour  let this suffice  i was never given to open up my mind much and i wont begin nowat least not more than i can help  it is right to say at the outset that i have been regularly married by a travelling wesleyan minister to my dear wife by whom also eve and her mother were baptized  my fall began in disobedience to my mother  probably this is the case with most neerdowells  my name is william liston  my father was a farmer in a wild part of colorado  he died when i was a little boy leaving my beloved mother to carry on the farm  i am their only child my mother loved and served the lord christ  and well do i know that my salvation from an ungovernable temper and persistent selfwill is the direct answer to her unceasing prayers  i left home against her will with a party of backwoodsmen my heart being set on what i once thought would be the free and jolly life of a hunter in the great american wilderness  i have lived to find the truth of that proverb all is not gold that glitters and of that word there is no rest saith my god to the wicked  i was eighteen when i left home  since then i have been a homeless wandererunless a shifting tent may be considered home  long after my quitting home and while staying with a tribe of indians at the head waters of the saskatchewan river i met an indian girl whose gentle loving nature and pretty face were so attractive to me that i married her and joined her tribe  the marriage ceremony was as i have said confirmed by a wesleyan minister whose faithful words made such an impression on me that i resolved to give up my wild life and return with my wife and child to my old home  my character howeverwhich is extremely resolute and decided when following the bent of my inclinations and exceedingly weak and vacillating when running counter to the sameinterfered with my good intentions  the removal of the tribe to a more distant part of the land also tended to delay me and a still more potent hindrance lay in the objection of my wifewho has been faithful and true to me throughout god bless her  she could not for a long time see her way to forsake her people  ever since my meeting with the wesleyan my mind has been running more or less on the subject of religion and i have tried to explain it as far as i could to my wife and child but have found myself woefully ignorant as well as sinful  at last not long ago i procured a new testament from a trapper and god in mercy opened my eyes to see and my heart to receive the truth as it is in jesus  since then i have had less difficulty in speaking to my wife and child and have been attempting to teach the latter to read english  the former whose mother and father died lately has now no objection to go with me to the land of the palefaces and it is my present intention to go to my old home on the return of spring  i have not heard of my poor mother since i left her though at various times i have written to her  it may be that she is dead  i hope noti even think not for she was very young when she married my father and her constitution was strong  but her hair was beginning to silver even before i forsook herwith sorrow i fear on my account  oh mother mother  how unavailing is my bitter regret  what would i not give to kneel once more at your feet and confess my sin  this may perhaps be permittedbut come weal come woe blessed be god we shall meet again  if my prayer is granted this paper will never be seen by human eyes if god sees fit to deny me this and i should die in the wilderness then i charge the man to whom my packet is given to take my wife and daughter to colorado and if my mothermrs william liston of sunny creekbe still alive to present them to her with this written paper and miniature  if on the other hand she be dead then let him buy for them an annuity or otherwise invest four thousand pounds for their benefit according to the best of his judgment  how to come by the four thousand pounds i will now explain  away in the beautiful and sequestered valley at the head of lake wichikagan there stands a stunted pine near a rock fallen from the cliff above  the spot is not easily found but my eve knows it well it was a favourite resort of ours when we went picnicking together there is a small hole or dry cave in the cliff just behind the fallen rock  two feet underneath the soil there will be found a bag containing a set of diamonds worth the sum i have named with a smaller bag containing five hundred pounds in gold  it may not be amiss to say that both jewels and money have been honestly come by  the money i dug out of the californian mines and bought the jewels in a drunken frolic when in canadafor my future wife as i then boasted  my dear wife has never seen them nor has eve  they do not know of their existence  the five hundred pounds in gold is to be retained for himself by the man who accepts this trust to enable him to pay his way and carry it out  william liston  it is difficult to express the conflict of feelings that assailed me when i had finished reading this remarkable manuscript  for some time lumley and i gazed at each other in silence  you accept the trust i suppose said my friend at last  of course  how could i do otherwise  but you cannot remain in the service of the hudsons bay company if you do  they would never give you leave of absence for such a purpose  no matter  i will not ask leave of absence  i will resign  my time was up you know this year  i will write to the governor by the springbrigade and start away for colorado in summer  but this poor man may have been slightly deranged suggested lumley he says that at one time he led a wild life  it is possible that his brain may have been affected and he only dreams of these jewels and the gold  i think not said i decidedly the letter is so calm and simple in style that the idea is absurd besides we can soon test it by visiting the valley and the spot referred to  moreover even if there were no money and the poor man were really deranged he could never have imagined or invented all that about his mother and colorado if it were not true  even if we fail to find the jewels and cash i will accept the trust and fulfil it  what without money  ay without money said i firmly though i am bound to confess that i did not at the moment see clearly how the thing was in that case to be done  but i wasand indeed still amof an ardent disposition and felt sanguine that i should manage to fulfil the obligations of this remarkable trust somehow  well max you and i will visit this valley tomorrow said lumley rising meanwhile we will go to bed  accordingly next morning after breakfast lumley and i slung our snowshoes over our shoulders on the barrels of our gunsfor the lake was as hard as a sheet of white marbleand started off to pay a visit to the spot indicated in what i may style poor listons will  it was a bright bracing dayquite calm but with keen frost which tended to increase the feelings of excitement already roused by the object we had in view  as we passed through the lakes fringe of willows the tops of which just rose a foot or two above the drifted snow a great covey of ptarmigan rose with a mighty whirr and swept along the shore but we took no heed of theseour minds being bent on other game  the distance to the upper end of the lake was considerable and the day was far advanced when we reached it  as we took to the land the covey of ptarmigan which had preceded us to the place again rose  this time however we were prepared for them  lumley shot a brace right and left taking the two last that rose with sportsmanlike precision  i confess that i am not a particularly good shotnever wasand have not much of the sportsmans pride about me  i fired straight into the centre of the dense mass of birds six of which immediately fell upon the snow  what a lot of flukes exclaimed my companion with a laugh as he recharged  luck before precision any day said i following his example  ay max but there is this difference that luck is rather uncertain whereas precision is always sure  well be that as it may said i putting on my snowshoes for the snow in the wood we were about to enter was deep and soft we have enough for a good supper at all events  true and we shall need a good supper for we must camp out  there is no chance of our finding this treasureeven if it existsuntil we have had a good search and then it will be too late to return home with comfort or even safety for it is difficult on a dark night to distinguish tracks on the hard snow of a lake as ive sometimes found to my cost  we set up several other coveys of ptarmigan as we traversed the belt of willows lying between the lake and the woods and when we entered the latter several grouse of a species that takes to trees fluttered away from us but we did not molest them having already more than we could consume swinging at our belts  we went straight up the valley to what we deemed the most sequestered part of it and then paused  this looks somewhat like the spot doesnt it said lumley glancing round  yonder is a cliff with rocks at the base of it  yes but too many rocks said i the paper mentions only one besides it refers to a stunted pine and i see nothing of that sort here  true it must be higher up the valley  come along  on we plodded hour after hour halting often and examining with care many a secluded spot that seemed to answer more or less the description of the spot for which we searched but all in vain  sunset found us as far from our object as ever and as hungry as hawks darkness of course put an end to the search and with a feeling of disappointment and weariness that i had not experienced since arriving in that region i set to work to fell and cut up a tree for fire wood while lumley shovelled a hole in the snow at the foot of a pine and otherwise prepared our encampment  but youth is remarkably elastic in spirit  no sooner was the fire crackling the kettle singing and the delicious odour of roasted ptarmigan tickling our nostrils than disappointment gave way to hope and weariness to jollity  come we shall have at it again tomorrow said lumley  so we shall said imind that kettle  you have an unfortunate capacity for kicking things over  one of the disadvantages of long legs max  theyre always in the way get out the biscuit now  my ptarmigan is ready  at least if it isnt i cant wait  neither can i jack  i sometimes wish that it were natural to us to eat things raw  it would be so very convenient and save shalot oftime  hunger and a wrenchedoff drumstick checked further utterance  that night we lay in our snow camp gazing up at the stars with our feet to the fire talking of gold and diamonds with all the eagerness of veritable misersthough it is but justice to myself to add that eves blue eyes outshone in my imagination all the diamonds that ever decked the brow of wealth or beauty  when at last we slept our dreams partook of the same glittering ideascoupled of course with much of the monstrous absurdity to which dreams are liable  i had just discovered a gem which was so large that i experienced the utmost difficulty in thrusting it into my coatpocket and was busy shovelling small diamonds of the purest water into a wheelbarrow when a tremendous whack on my nose awoke me  starting up with an indignant gasp i found that it was a lump of snow which had been detached by the heat of our fire from a branch overhead  whats wrong max growled my companion who lay curled up in his buffalo robe like a huge newfoundland dog  bin dreamin  yes said i with a loud yawn i was dreaming of shovelling up diamonds by the thousand when a lump of snow fell and hit my nose  strnge sighed lumley in the sleepiest voice i ever heard sos i drmn f gldn sassgs an dmnd ruppleply  what nonsense are you talking man  what were you dreaming of  f goldn sausges an dimnd rollyply  i says fire out  nearly  s very cold  gt upmend it lke good fllow  ill help you drectly  he finished off with a prolonged snore so i rose with a slight laugh mended the fire warmed myself well observed in a sleepy way that the night was still bright and calm and then lay down in a state of semiconsciousness to drop at once into a nest made of golden filigree filled with diamond eggs  next morning we rose at daybreak relighted the fire and had breakfast after which we resumed our search but stillwithout success  i fear that my surmise as to the state of poor listons mind is correct said lumley  we have searched the whole valley i believe  nay not quite i returned it is much varied in form and full of outotheway nooks  besides we have not yet discovered the stunted pine and you know the paper says the spot is difficult to find  as to listons mind i feel quite sure that it was all right and that the man was a good and true one  the father of waboose could not have been otherwise  i said this somewhat decidedly for i felt sorely disappointed at our failure and slightly annoyed at my friends unbelief in one whose last writing proved himat least to my mindto be genuine and sincere  well max returned lumley with his wonted pleasant look and tone it may be that you are right  we will continue our search as long as there seems any chance of success  accordingly we ranged the valley round high and low until we had visited as we thought every nook and cranny in it and then much dispirited returned home  one morning about three months after these events lumley came into my bedroom where i was drawing a plan for a new store  max said he sitting down on the bed beside me i mean to start this afternoon on a visit to the mountain fort  you know i promised macnab that i would look him up about this time and fetch waboose and her mother back  indeed  when do you start  this afternoon  i was not surprised at the suddenness of this announcement  our chief was eminently a man of action  he seldom talked much about plans but thought them well out and when his mind was made up acted without delay  youll take my letter to the governor and tell mac to forward it with his spring packet said i  yes that is just what i came to see you about  is it readyand are you quite decided about retiring  quite decided  see here is the letter  and dont forget your promise to say nothing to waboose or anyone else about listons packet  not a word my boy  that afternoon my friend set off on snowshoes accompanied by two men  any message max he said at parting  of course  my kind regards to everybody  nothing warmer to anybody  oh yes i returned quickly i forgot you may if you choose say something a little more affectionate to miss macnab  i will max i will he replied with a loud ringing laugh and a cheery goodbye  some time after that an indian came to the fort bearing a letter from lumley  it was written he said merely because the indian chanced to be travelling towards wichikagan and contained nothing of importance to my surprise and disappointment it contained no reference whatever to waboose  on turning over the last page however i found a postscript it ran thus  psby the way i had almost omitted to mention eve  my dear boy i believe you are right  she is one of natures ladies  jessie has prevailed on her to put on one of her dresses and be her companion and when they are walking together with their backs towards me upon my word i have difficulty in deciding which is the more ladylike of the two and that you will admit is no small compliment from me  jessie has been giving her lessons in english and music and drawing too  just think of that  she says she is doing it with an end in view  i wonder what that end can be  jessie is sometimes difficult to understand  she is also remarkably wise and farsighted  i expect to be home soon farewell    chapter twenty  i come out in a new light and have a very narrow escape  during the absence of my friend everything went on at the fort in the usual quiet way with this difference that part of our educational course had to be given up and i had to read the pilgrims progress instead of my friend for the men had become so deeply interested in the adventures of christian that they begged of me to continue the readings  this i agreed to do but confined myself simply to reading  i observed however that my audience did not seem to appreciate the story as much as before and was getting somewhat disheartened about it when one evening as i was about to begin donald bane said to me  if ye please sur the other laads an mes been talking over this matter an they want me to say that they would pe fery much obleeged if ye would expound the story as you go along the same as muster lumley did  this speech both surprised and embarrassed me for i had never before attempted anything in the way of exposition  i felt however that it would never do for a man in charge of an outpost in the great norwest to exhibit weakness on any point whatever he might feel i therefore resolved to comply  well donald bane i said it had been my intention to leave the exposition of the allegory to mr lumley but as you all wish me to carry on that part of the reading i will do my best  so saying i plunged at once into the story and got on much more easily than i had expected ideas and words flowing into my mind copiously insomuch that i found it difficult to stop and on more than one occasion was awakened by a snore from one of the audience to the fact that i had sent some of them to sleep  in the midst of this pleasant and i hope not unprofitable work an event occurred which had wellnigh stopped my commentaries on the pilgrims progress and put an end to my career altogether  i had gone out one morning with my gun to procure a few fresh ptarmigan accompanied by big otter  our trusty indian was beginning by that time to understand the english language but he would not condescend to speak it  this however was of slight importance as i had learned to jabber fluently in the native tongue  we speedily halffilled the large gamebag which the indian carried  i think well go into the thicker woods now said i and try for some tree grouse by way of variety  big otter gave a mild grunt of assent  he was not naturally given to much talking and being amiable was always ready to conform to any plan without discussion unless expressly asked  indeed even when expressly asked it was not always possible to get a satisfactory answer out of him  do you think we should go up the dark valley or over the rocky knoll said i referring to two wellknown spots a considerable distance from the fort  the paleface chief knows best  yes but the paleface asks what the redface thinks said i somewhat amused by the answer  he thinks that there are grouse in the dark valley and also in the lands towards the setting sun over the rocky knoll  if i were to ask you big otter which of the two directions you would like to take what would you reply  i would reply the direction that best pleases the paleface chief  now big otter said i firmly for i was determined to get an answer out of him in which of the two paths are we most likely to find the greatest number of birds  assuredly in the path which shall be chosen by the paleface  is he not a great hunter  does he not know the land  i gave in with a short laugh and turning led the way over the rocky knoll into the dense forest at the back of the fort  passing through a belt of this we came upon more open ground where the trees grew in clumps with willowcovered spaces between  beyond that we reentered the thick woods and at once set up a covey of the birds we were in search of  there were six of them and they all perched on a neighbouring tree  now it is sometimes the case that the birds of which i write are so tame that they will sit still on a tree till they are all shot one by one if only the hunter is careful to fire at the lowest bird first and so proceed upwards  if he should kill the top bird first its fluttering fall disturbs the rest causing them to take wing  fully aware of this fact big otter and i fired alternate shots and in a few seconds brought down the whole covey  this quite filled one of our bags  you may take it home big otter said i and tell them not to be alarmed if i dont return till tomorrow  perhaps i shall camp out  with his usual quiet grunt of acquiescence my redskinned companion shouldered the full bag and left me  i then struck into the thick woods with the general bearings of which i was well acquainted and soon after came across the fresh tracks of a deer which i followed up hotly  i am naturally a keen sportsman and apt to forget both time and distance when pursuing game  as to distance however a backwoods hunter who intends to encamp on the spot where night finds him does not need to concern himself much about that  i therefore plodded on hour after hour until the waning light told of the approach of darkness and convinced me that further pursuit would be useless  looking round me then for a suitable spot on which to make my encampment i experienced almost a shock of surprise not unmingled with alarm on making the discovery that i had forgotten to bring my firebag  to some people the serious nature of this may not at first be apparent but they may appreciate the situation in some degree when i tell them that on that occasion i suddenly found myself about twenty miles from home fatigued hungry with the night descending over the wilderness the thermometer about thirtyfive below zero of fahrenheits scale with the snow for my bed and without that all important flint steel and tinder wherewith to procure fire for the cooking of my food and the warming of my frame  it is true i had my gun which was a flint one so that by rubbing some slightly moistened gunpowder on a piece of rag which i tore from my shirt for the purpose and snapping the lock over it there was a possibility of a spark catching but unfortunately the flint was a much worn one which i had chipped away to such an extent during the day to improve its fireproducing powers that only the merest glimmer of a spark was evolved after many snappings and it was so feeble as to be quite unable to catch hold of my extemporised tinder  after prolonged and fruitless efforts the intense cold began to chill me and being well aware of the great danger of getting benumbed or of falling into that torpid state of indifference to life coupled with intense desire for rest which precedes death from cold i made up my mind at once tired and hungry though i was to turn round and walk straight back to the fort  i knew myself to be quite capable of walking forty miles on snowshoes in ordinary circumstances  my being tired and the darkness of night were against me but what of that it would only require me to brace myself to a severer task than usual  i had not gone many miles however on the return journey when a doubt occurred as to whether i was taking the right direction  in the confidence of my knowledge of the country i had carelessly left my old track which was indeed rather a devious one and had struck what i believed to be a straight line for the fort  it was by that time too late to retrace my steps and too dark to distinguish the features of the landscape  i stopped for a minute to think and as i did so the profound oppressive silence of the night the weird pallid aspect of the scarce visible snow and the dark pines around me which were only a shade or two darker than the black sky above together with the everincreasing cold made such an impression on my mind that the prayer god help me burst almost involuntarily from my lips  feeling that delay surely meant death i started off again with redoubled energy and this impulse of determination along with the exercise increased my temperature somewhat so that hope became strong again and with it muscular energy  suddenly i came upon a snowshoe track  i went down on my knees to examine it but the light was insufficient to make it out clearly  what would i not have given for a match at that moment  however as the size of the shoeprint seemed to my feeling the same with that of the shoe i wore i concluded that it must certainly be my own track out from homeall the more that it ran almost parallel with the line i was following  getting upon it then i stepped out with much greater ease and with a lighter heart  after a time the track led me to a slightly open space where the light was better  i thought that objects seemed familiar to me as i looked round  advancing i came on a spot where the snow was much trodden down  there was a bank of snow near  i went towards it while a terrible suspicion flashed into my mind  yes it was the very spot on which i had been sitting hours before while i was making fruitless efforts to obtain a light from the flint of my gun  i had been doing that of which i had often read and heard walking unwittingly in a circle and had actually come back to the spot from which i set out  what my feelings were on making this discovery it is scarcely possible to describe  my first act was to look up and exclaim as before god help me  but there was nothing impulsive or involuntary in the prayer this time  i fully realised the extent of my danger and believing that the hour had come when nothing could save my life but the direct interposition of my creator i turned to him with all the fervour of my heart  at the same time i am bound to confess that my faith was very weak and my soul felt that solemn alarm which probably the bravest feel at the approach of death when that approach is sudden and very unexpected  nevertheless i am thankful to say that my powers of judgment and of action did not forsake me  i knew that it would be folly to attempt to follow my track back again through the intricacies of the forest in so dark a night especially now that the track was partly mingled and confused with that which i had made in joining it  i also knew that to give way to despair and lie down without a fire or food would be to seal my own doom  only one course remained and that was to keep constantly moving until the return of day should enable me to distinguish surrounding objects more clearly  i went to work therefore without delay but before doing so once again solemnly and earnestly committed my soul and body to the care of god and truly the circumstances of my case intensified that prayer  i felt as if i had never really prayed in earnest in my life before that night  then laying aside my gun blanket and cooking utensils so as to commence my task as light as possible i went to the most open space of ground i could find and there described a large circle with my snowshoes on  this was the track on which i resolved to perform a feat of endurance  to walk all night without intermission without rest so as to keep up my animal heat was the effort on the success of which depended the issue of life or death  i began with that vigour which is born of hopeful determination to succeed or die  but as time wore on the increasing weakness and exhaustion began to render me less capable of enduring the intense cold having my wallet on my back i took out some biscuit and pemmican and ate it as i walked  this revived me a good deal nevertheless i restrained myself feeling convinced that nothing but steady quiet perseverance would carry me through  soon thirst began to torment me yet i did not dare to eat snow as that would have merely injured the inside of my mouth and frozen the skin of my lips  this feeling did not however last long  it was followed by a powerful sense of drowsiness  this i knew to be the fatal premonitory symptom and strove against it with all my power  the better to resist it i began to talk aloud to myself  come now my boy you mustnt give way to that  it is death you know  hold up  be a man  act as lumley would have acted in similar circumstances  dear lumley  how he would run to help me if he only knew  suddenly the words in me is thy help seemed to sound in my very ears  i stopped to listen and was partly roused but soon hurried on again  yes yes i exclaimed aloud i know the text well but the words had scarcely left my lips when i stumbled and fell  owing to my sinking powers i had failed to keep the centre of the track my right snowshoe had caught on the edge of it and tumbled me into the soft snow  how shall i describe the delicious feeling of profound rest that ensued when i found myself prone and motionless  equally impossible is it to describe the agonising struggles that i made to induce my unwilling spirit to rouse my listless body  those who have striven in semiconsciousness to throw off the awful lethargy of nightmare may have some conception of my feelings  i knew even then that it was the critical momentthe beginning of the end  in a burst of anxiety i began to prayto shout with all my strengthfor deliverance  the effort and the strange sound of my own voice roused me  i staggered to my feet and was able to continue my walk  being somewhat brighter than i had been before the tumble i perceived that the circular track was by that time beaten hard enough to bear me up without snowshoes so i put them off and walked with much more ease  from this point however my mind became so confused that i can give no reliable account of what followed  i was conscious at various periods during that dreadful night of becoming alive to several incidents and states of mind  i recollect falling more than once as i had fallen before and of experiencing more than once that painful struggle against what i may style mental and physical inertia  i remember breaking out frequently into loud importunate prayer and being impressed with a feeling of reviving energy at such times  sometimes a text of scripture seemed to flash before my eyes and disappear  on these occasions i made terrible efforts to grasp the text and have an indistinct sensation of increased strength resulting from the mere efforts but most of the texts faded as quickly as they came with the exception of onegod is our hope  somehow i seemed to lay firm hold of that and to feel conscious of holding it even when sense was slipping away but of the blanks between those conditions i know nothing  they may have been long or they may have been shorti cannot tell  all remains on my memory now like the unsubstantial fragments of a hideous dream  the first thing after that which impressed itself on me with anything like the distinctness of reality was the sound of a crackling fire accompanied with the sensation of warmth in my throat  slowly opening my eyes i became aware of the fact that i was lying in front of a blazing fire surrounded by big otter blondin and dougall who stood gazing at me with anxious looks while henri coppet knelt at my side attempting to pour some warm tea down my throat  dere now monsieur said coppet who was rather fond of airing his english especially when excited yoos kom too ver queek  ony drink ha dere be noting like tea  wow man mind what yer aboot  yell scald him said dougall anxiously  you hole yoos tongue replied the carpenter contemptuously me knows wat mees do  don wants no scoshmans for tell me  voila  monsieur have swaller un peu  this was true  i had not only swallowed but nearly choked with a tendency to laugh at the lugubrious expression of my friends faces  where am i said i on recovering a little what has happened  oo ay muster maxby answered dougall with his wonted nasal drawl somethin hess happened but its no sae pad as what might hev happened whatever  as this did not tend to clear my mind much and as i knew from experience that the worthy celt refused to be hurried in his communications i turned an inquiring look on blondin who at once said in french  monsieur has been lost and nearly frozen and monsieur would surely have been quite frozen if james dougall had not discovered that monsieur had left his firebag at home by mistake no doubt we at once set out to search for monsieur and we found him with his head in the snow and his feet in the air  at first we thought that monsieur was dead but happily he was not so we kindled a fire and rubbed monsieur and gave him hot tea which has revived him  voila  perhaps monsieur will take a little more hot tea  while blondin was speaking the whole scene of the previous day and of the terrible night rushed in upon my brain like a flood and i thanked god fervently for my deliverance while i complied with the mans suggestion and sipped some more tea  it revived me much but on attempting to rise i found myself so weak that i fell back helplessly with a deep sigh  yeve no need to trouble yoursel muster maxby said dougall weve brought the new dowgsleigh for ee  looking in the direction in which he pointed i observed not faroff the splendid new dogsleigh which we had spent much time in making and painting that winter  our fine team of four semiwolf dogs gay with embroidered harness as they lay curled up on the snow were attached to it  i suspect i should have died but for your thoughtful care dougall i said gratefully as the good fellow assisted to place me in the vehicle and wrap the buffalo robes around me  hoots  muster maxby was the remonstrative reply  big otter placed himself in front of the cortege to beat the track the dogs followed him with the sleighbells ringing merrily  blondin took hold of the tailline and the others brought up the rear  thus comfortably with a bright sun shining in the blue sky i returned to fort wichikagan    chapter twenty one  a buffalo hunt followed by a palaver an arrival and a traitorchase  we must turn away now for a short time to another though not far distant part of the great norwest  it is a more open country than that immediately around fort wichikagan and lies to the south of it  here and there long stretches of prairie cut up the wilderness giving to the landscape a soft and parklike appearance  the scenery is further diversified by various lakelets which swarm with waterfowl for the season has changed early spring having already swept away the white mantle of winter and spread the green robes of nature over the land  it is such a region as a millionaire might select in which to build a palace but no millionaire has yet beheld the lovely spot  with unlimited wealth at his command he still confines himself to the smoke and dust of civilisation leaving the free air and the brilliant beauty of the wilderness to the wildfowl and the penniless hunter and the wandering savage  in the midst of one of the stretches of rolling prairieland great herds of buffalo are scattered in groups browsing with all the air of security peculiar to domestic cattle  happily their memories are short they seem prone to enjoy the present forgetful of the past and regardless of the futurehappily i say for those humpy and hairy creatures are not unacquainted with mans devicesthe sudden surprise the twang of the redmans bow and the crack of the hunters rifle  it was the forenoon of a splendid day when this peaceful scene was broken in upon by obstreperous fighting peacedestroying man  a little cloud of dust on the horizon was the first indication of his approach and a very antique buffalobull was first among the thousands of innocents to observe the cloud  it stirred the memory of other days no doubt within his capacious bosom and probably sent a thrill through his huge frame which terminating naturally in his tail caused that appendage to vibrate and curl slightly upwards  at the same time he emitted softly a low rumble which might have served for the bass of a cathedral organ  most of the cows near the patriarch looked up in evident surprise as though to say what in all the world do you mean by that  but the patriarch took no notice of them  he kept his wicked little eyes fixed intently on the cloud of dust twitching his tail nervously and rumbling cathedralorganically  if i might venture to guess at the mental operations of that patriarch i should say that he was growling to himself is that you again you galloping spitfiring twolegged yelling monsters or some such bovine expression  by degrees the cloud came nearer and enlarged  simultaneously the groups of buffaloes drew together and began to gazeperchance to remember  the patriarch became excited wriggled his tail which was ridiculously small for his body pawed the ground trotted hither and thither and commenced playing on all the deeper notes of his organ  at last there could be no doubt  the twolegged monsters came on mounted on fourlegged brutes which began to trot as the distance between them diminished  this was enough  the patriarch tossed his haunches to the sky all but wriggled off his tail gave utterance to a bursting bellow and went scouring over the plains like a gigantic wild pig  the entire buffalo host performing a similar toss and wriggle followed close on his heels  at this the redskins put their steeds to the gallop but did not at once overtake their prey  clumsy though their gait was the buffaloes were swift and strong causing the whole plain to resound under their mighty tread  indian steeds however are wiry and enduring  by slow degrees they lessened the distance between themboth pursued and pursuers lengthening out their ranks as the fittest came to the front thundering on they approached one of the large clumps of woodland with which the plain was covered as with islets  the patriarch led to the left of it  the savages sweeping aside took to the right  the sudden disappearance of the pursuers seemed to surprise the patriarch who slackened his pace a little and lifting his shaggy head looked right and left inquiringly  was it all a dream he thoughtno doubt  if he thought it was he received in a few minutes a rude awakening for the redskins came sweeping round the other end of the clump of trees yelling like fiends brandishing their weapons and urging their steeds to the uttermost  to snort bellow turn off at a tangent and scurry along faster than ever was the work of a moment but it was too late  the savages were in the midst of the snorting host  bows were bent and guns were levelled  the latter were smoothbores cheap and more or less inaccurate but that mattered not  where the range was only two or three yards guns and bows were true enough for the end in view  at such work even bad shots met their reward  arrows sank to the feathers bullets penetrated to the heart or shattered the bones  ere long numerous black lumps on the prairie told of death to the quadrupeds and success to the bipeds  but i do not drag the reader here merely to tell of savage sport and butchery  the indian was only following his vocationworking for his food  that same evening two of the indians stood on a hillock a little apart from their camp where smoking fires and roasting meat and marrowbones and ravenouslyfeeding men and women and gorging little boys and girls formed a scene that was interesting though not refined  one of the indians referred to was big otter  the other was muskrat the old chief of his tribe  does my father not know said big otter deferentially that attick plans mischief against the palefaces of wichikagan  no big otter returned the old chief with a scowl muskrat does not know that but he hears and if it is true he will have attick flayed alive and his skin dressed to make moccasins for our young squaws  it is true rejoined big otter sternly  his plan is to attack the fort by night kill the palefaces and carry off the goods  attick is a fool said muskrat contemptuously  does he not know that no more goods would evermore be sent into our lands if we did that and also that the palefaces always hunt murderers to death  no if that had been possible or wise muskrat would have done it himself long ago  after this candid statement he stared solemnly at his companion as though to say what think ye of that my brave  apparently my brave did not think much of it one way or other for he only looked indifferent and said waugh  big otters ears are sharp continued muskrat  how did he come to hear of atticks intentions  the younger indian paused thoughtfully before replying  waboose told me he said  does the daughter of weeum the good hold communion with evil spirits asked the old chief with a slight elevation of the eyebrows  not willingly but evil spirits force themselves upon the daughter of weeum the good  my father knows that attick is presumptuous  he wishes to mate waboose  yes i knew he was presumptuous but i did not know he was so great a fool replied the old chief scornfully  my father knows continued big otter that when the paleface chief went and brought waboose back to fort wichikagan attick was staying there in his wigwam by the lake  the big chief of the palefaces who fears nothing had forgiven him  attick went to waboose and offered to take her to his wigwam but the daughter of weeum the good turned away from him  attick is proud and he is fierce  he told waboose that he would kill all the palefaces  although a fool he does not boast waboose knew that he was in earnest  she went to the paleface muxbee by which name big otter styled my humble self and told him all for she has set her heart on muxbee  did she tell you so asked muskrat sharply  no but the blue eyes of waboose tell tales  they are like a kettle with holes in the bottomthey cannot hold secrets  they spoke to attick as well as to me and he became jealous  he swore he would take the scalp of muxbee  one day soon after the lake opened muxbee asked waboose to go with him in a canoe to the valley at the head of lake wichikagan  attick followed in another canoe but kept far behind they did not know it was attick  waboose found it out afterwards muxbee did not talk to waboose of love  the ways of the palefaces are strange  once i thought that muxbee liked waboose and that perhaps he might wed with her and stay with us as the good weeum did but i doubt it now  he only asked her to take him to the stunted pine where her father was so fond of going with her  when there he went looking here and there about the rocks and found a splendid thingi know not whatbut waboose told me it shone and sparkled like the stars  beside it was a bag of the yellow round things that the palefaces love so much  he told her he had expected to find these things but she must not ask him questions just thenhe would tell her afterwards  i suppose he is a great medicineman and holds intercourse with the spiritworld  big otter paused thoughtfully a few seconds and then continued  when he was putting these things in his breast waboose caught sight of attick among the bushes and pointed him out  muxbee sprang up and levelled his gun with the two pipes at him but did not fire  attick fled and they saw him no more  did waboose tell big otter all this asked the old chief  yes  waboose has no secrets from her mothers brother  and why has big otter left the palefaces and brought waboose away from them asked muskrat  because he fears for the palefaces that attick will kill them and carry off waboose  by bringing waboose here with us we draw attick along with us away from the palefaces and as long as waboose is in our camp she is safe  attick dare not harm her  a gleam of intelligence lit up the swarthy features of the old chief as he said waugh with much satisfaction  but both he and big otter were wrong in their calculations  so far indeed the latter was right  the presence of waboose in the camp effectually drew attick after them and thus removed danger from the inhabitants of fort wichikagan but they were wrong when they thought their camp a place of safety for the poor girl  did muxbee not care when big otter carried waboose away asked the old man  he did not know she was going and i did not tell her she was not to return  i took her away with her mother when muxbee was out hunting  i told the big paleface chief that i must go with my tribe to hunt the buffalo in the south and that they must go with me  he was very unwilling to let them go at first but i was resolved and waboose is a good obedient girl  that night two events occurred in the redskin camp which caused a good deal of surprise and commotion  the first was the sudden disappearance of waboose and her mother  they had been gone some time of course before any one thought of suspecting flight  the moment that suspicion was aroused however big otter went straight to the wigwam of attick  it was deserted  he knew well the bad and weak men of the tribe who were led or swayed by attick hurrying to their tents he found that these also had fled  this was enough  masqua he said to the first indian he chanced to meet at the moment of quitting the last wigwam attick has carried off waboose  assemble some of the young men  choose only the strong and those whose horses are swift  go yourself with your son mozwagallop round the camp till you find in which direction they have gonethen return to me at the council tent and wait  masqua understood the value of prompt obedience  without a word of reply he turned and bounded away  big otter hurried to the council tent where old muskrat was already surrounded by his chiefs  there was less than usual of the grave deliberation of north american indians in that meeting for the case was urgent  nevertheless there was no bustle for each bronzed warrior knew that the young men would require a little time to hunt up the trail of the fugitives mingled as it must be with the innumerable footprints of man and beast in the neighbourhood of a camp and until that trail was found they might as well deliberate calmlyespecially as all the men met at the council armed and ready to vault on the steeds which were already pawing the earth outside  these horses were restrained by youths who longed for the time when they too might be styled braves and meet in council  is all prepared asked the old chief as big otter entered the tent  the young men are out was the curt reply  good  the night is dark but my warriors have sharp eyes and the moon will rise soon  no effort must be spared  the daughter of weeum the good must be brought back  it is not necessary to bring back attick or his men  their scalps will do as well  waugh pronounced with much emphasis showed that the old mans words were not only understood but thoroughly appreciated  at this moment occurred the second event which i have said was the cause of surprise in the camp that night if not of commotion  while the old chief was yet speaking his words were checked by the sound of horses hoofs beating heavily on the prairie  the young men said muskrat they have been swift to find the trail  young men in haste bringing news do not trot said big otter  waugh assented the council  there are but two riders murmured the chief listening intently to the pattering sounds which rapidly grew louder  he was right for a few seconds later two horsemen were seen to trot into the camp and make straight for the council fire  some of the indians had turned out with arms ready as they approached but on hearing a word or two from one of the riders they quietly let them pass  pulling up sharply one of the strangers leaped to the ground flung his reins to the other and entered the council tent where he was received with looks of surprise and with the ejaculation from big otter of the single word muxbee  yes good reader that stranger was none other than myself and my companion was salamander  to account for our sudden appearance i must explain  on returning to fort wichikagan four days after big otter had left and hearing what had occurred i told lumley i would follow in pursuit and fetch waboose back  he remonstrated of course but in vain  you know that a sacred trust has been imposed upon me said i earnestly and i have resolved to fulfil it  the manner in which i should set about it has perplexed me sorely i confess but this sudden departure relieves me at all events from uncertainty as to my present course of duty  if waboose goes off with the tribe to no one knows where she may never be found again  you are aware that she is still ignorant of the contents of the packet and the value of the found treasure  i have kept her so temporarily by your advice  if i had told her and her kindred she would not probably have gone away but it is too late to regret that now  by going off at once i may overtake the tribe  three days journey on foot will bring me to indians who are rich in horses  once well mounted i can push on and will easily overtake them if you will lend me salamander to aid in following up the trail  but what of the service asked lumley with a sad smile for he saw i was resolved  you are not yet free  true but you know that spooner is already on his way here to replace me my resignation having been accepted  in a week or two at farthest he will arrive when i shall be absolutely free to go where i please meanwhile to prevent even a shadow of impropriety i ask your majesty for a fortnights leave of absence to go ahunting  surely you wont refuse so small a favour  i will be sure to find waboose and bring her back by that time  well max my boy i wont refuse  go and god go with you  i shall expect to see you again in two weeks if not sooner  unless of course circumstances render my return so soon impossible  of course of course said lumley  thus we parted and thus it was that salamander and i found ourselves at last in the indian camp  the pursuit however had been much longer than i had expected  more than the stipulated fortnight had already passed  but to return from this digression  after we had looked at each other silently for a few seconds in the council tent as already described i advanced to big otter and held out my hand  i then shook hands with the old chief sat down beside him and expressed a hope that i did not intrude  we palaver about the disappearance of waboose said the old chief  disappearance  waboose  i exclaimed turning abruptly to big otter  attick has fled said the indian sternly carrying waboose and her mother along with him  and you sit here idly talking i exclaimed almost fiercely as i sprang up  before i could take action of any kind the young indian mozwa entered the tent abruptly and said a few words to muskrat  at the same moment the councillors rose  we go in pursuit whispered big otter in my ear  mount and join us  almost bewildered but feeling perfect confidence in my indian friend i ran out and vaulted into the saddle  eager and quick though i was the redskins were mounted as soon as myself  no one seemed to give orders but with one accord they put their horses to the gallop and swept out of the camp  the last words of the old chief as we darted off were  bring her back my braves and dont forget the scalps of attick and his men    chapter twenty two  the chase the capture and the revelation  a stern chase is usually a long one  there are not many proverbs the truth of which comes more powerfully home than thisat least to those who have had the misfortune to engage in many such chases  to make a slant at a fugitive so as to cut him off or to make a short cut and head him is pleasant if you be strong in wind and limb but to creep up right astern inch by inch foot by foot yard by yard and to overcome him at last by sheer superiority and perseverance is a disheartening task  that was the task we undertook the night we left the indian camp and went off at full gallop over the rolling prairie in pursuit of the scoundrel attick and his crew  but indians are by nature persevering and for myself i was roused to the highest pitch of indignation and anxiety  salamander and i had ridden far and fast that day besides which we had eaten only a mouthful of pemmican and biscuit since breakfast nevertheless under the excitement of the moment our weariness vanished our hunger fled and we engaged in the pursuit with all the ardour of the youngest brave among them  fortunately i had secured two exceptionally fine horses so that they were quite able to compete with the inferior though fresher horses of the indians  how long is it since you discovered that they were gone said i as i galloped alongside of big otter  not more than an hour he replied  do you think they had a long start before that  i cannot tell  perhaps two hours perhaps four  certainly not five for they were seen in camp when the sun was high  i was greatly relieved to learn that they had not got a longer start of us and very thankful that i had come up in time to join the pursuers i was calming down somewhat under the influence of these thoughts when i had a sudden feeling of being shot from a cannon into the air  this was succeeded by a sensation of having my nose converted into a ploughshare and that was instantly followed by oblivion  in the uncertain light my steed had put his foot in a badger holethat was all but it sufficed to check the pace of the whole party  on recovering i found my head on salamanders knee  i felt dreamy and indifferent  what has happened  i asked in english  our interpreter who had a tendency to answer in whatever language he was addressedwhether english french or indianreplied  yoos bin amost busted sar  suddenly the true state of the case flashed upon me  langour fled  i leaped up and scrambled somehow into the saddle  have i been long insensible salamander  i asked as we resumed our headlong pace  ony what time i kin count twinty sar  rejoiced to find that no longer time had been lost i galloped along contentedly and in silence though with a rather confused feeling in my brain and a sensation of being possessed of six noses rolled into one  although no one as i have said seemed to lead the party when we started i soon found that big otter was really our chief  he rode ahead of us and more than once pulled up to dismount and examine the trail  on these occasions the rest of the party halted without orders and awaited his decision  once we were completely thrown off the scent the fugitives had taken to a wooded tract of country and it required our utmost caution not to lose the trail  presently we came to a small stream and crossed it but the trail ended abruptly here  we were not surprised being well aware of the common indian device of wading in a stream which holds no footprints so as to throw pursuers out  dividing our force one party went up stream the other down but although eager sharp and practised eyes examined the banks they could not discover the spot where the fugitives had again taken to dry land  returning to the place where we had divided big otter again examined the trail with minute care going down on his knees to turn over the blades of grass and examine the footprints  strange said i impatiently that so simple a device should baffle us  as i spoke the chief arose and dark though it was i could see a gleam of intelligence on his swarthy visage  attick thinks he is wise he said in a low voice but he has no more brains than a rabbit  he was from childhood an idiot  having paid his tribesman this compliment he remounted and to my surprise went straight back the way we had come  what means this  i asked unable to restrain my impatience  attick has doubled back that is all  if there had been more light we should easily have seen that  we shall soon find the place where the trail breaks off again  the indian was right  on clearing the wooded land we found that the moon was up and we followed the trail easily  coming to a hillock in the open ground the top of which was covered with thick and stunted bushes we rode into them and there experienced much difficulty in picking our way  suddenly big otter turned at a right angle from the line we had been hitherto pursuing and putting his horse to the gallop held on with the decision of one who knows he is on the right road  as the prairie was open and the moon growing brighter we had now no difficulty in following up the fugitives and pressed on as fast as our horses could go  daylight came and found us still galloping but as there was no sign of those whom we pursued and as our horses were getting tired we halted at a small stream for a short rest and breakfast  they must be well mounted said i as we sat on the banks of the stream appeasing our hunger with masses of dried buffalo meat while the horses munched the grass near us  attick is always well mounted replied big otter but his men may not be so well off and women are difficult to urge on when they are unwilling  then you have no doubt that we shall overtake them  i asked  we must overtake them was the laconic reply  i felt somewhat comforted by the decision of the indians tone and a good deal more so by his ordering his warriors to remount before half an hour had passed he did not however press on as hard as before fearing no doubt that the horses would break down  i felt assured that attick would not dare to halt until he believed himself almost beyond pursuit and as the chase therefore bade fair to be a very long one it seemed wise thus to spare the horses  about noon however we passed through a strip of woodland and on coming out at the other side observed a party of horsemen on the distant horizon  waugh exclaimed big otter shaking the reins of his steed and going off at racing speed  we soon began to overhaul the cavalcade and then perceived that they were doing their utmost to get away from us  it is attick and his partyis it not  i asked excitedly  it is attick was the brief reply  another belt of woodland lay a little to the right on the horizon  the fugitives headed for it  we urged our horses to their utmost speed and soon dashed through the belt of wood expecting to see the fugitives on the plain beyond  what was our surprise then to find them assembled in a group calmly tying up their horses and kindling a fire as if for the purpose of cooking their midday meal  as most of the men had laid aside their guns and we outnumbered them by two to one we checked our headlong course and trotted quietly up to them  to my great joy i saw as we approached that the girl who stooped to kindle the fire was waboose  her mother sat on a bank near her looking very pale and worn  attick who still carried his gun in the hollow of his left arm expressed wellfeigned surprise at seeing us  big otter seems to be on the warpath he said but i have seen no enemies  big otters enemy stands before him returned our leader sternly attick has been very foolish  why did he run away with the daughter of weeum the good  attick scorns to run away with a squaw  waboose agreed to go with him on the hunt  there she is ask her  this was a bold stroke of the wily savage  instead of flying from us he pretended to have been merely hurrying after a band of buffalo which was said to be moving southward and that he had halted in the chase for a short rest and food  this plan he had hastily adopted on perceiving that it was impossible to escape us having previously warned waboose that he would shoot her dead if she did not corroborate what he said but attick was incapable of believing that fearless heroism could dwell in the breast of a woman and little knew the courage of the daughter of weeum the good  he mistook her silence and her downcast eyes for indications of submission and did not doubt that the delicatelooking and shrinking girl was of much the same spirit as the other women of his tribe  great then was his astonishment when he saw the saxon blood in her veins rush to her fair brow while she gazed at him steadily with her large blue eyes and said  the tongue of attick is forked  he lies when he says that the daughter of weeum agreed to follow him  he knows that he carried her from the camp by force against her will  attick had thrown forward and cocked his gun but happily the unexpected nature of the girls reply and the indignant gaze of her eyes caused an involuntary hesitation  this did not afford time for any one to seize the intending murderer but it enabled me hastily to point my rifle at the villains head and fire  i have elsewhere said that my shooting powers were not remarkable i missed the man altogether but fortunately the bullet which was meant for his brain found its billet in the stock of his gun and blew the lock to atoms thus rendering the weapon useless  with a fierce shout he dropped the gun drew his scalpingknife and sprang towards waboose oras i had by that time found a pleasure in mentally styling hereve liston  of course every man of our party sprang forward but it fell to salamander to effect the rescue for that lighthearted and lightlimbed individual chanced to be nearest to the savage when i fired at him and ere the knife was well drawn had leaped upon his back with the agility of a panther  at the same moment big otter flung his tomahawk at him the weapon was well though hastily aimed  it struck the savage full on the forehead and felled him to the earth  the rest of atticks party made no attempt to rescue him  like all bad men they were false to each other in the hour of need  they quietly submitted to be disarmed and led away  we had to encamp early that evening because the unwonted and severe exercise to which wabooses mother had been exposed had rendered her quite unfit to travel further without rest  attick who had soon recovered sufficiently to be able to walk was bound along with his men and put under a guard  then the encampment was made and the fires kindled  while this was being done i led waboose aside to a little knoll from which we could see a beautiful country of mingled woodland and prairie stretching far away to the westward where the sun had just descended amid clouds of amber and crimson  is it not glorious  i exclaimed  should we not be grateful to the great spirit who has given us such a splendid home  waboose looked at me  yes it is glorious she saidand i am grateful but it is strange that you should use the very same words that were so often on the lips of my father just before he  she stopped abruptly  just before he went home eve i interposed no need to say died your father is not dead but sleepeth  you shall meet him again  but it is not very strange that men should use the same words when they are animated by the same love to the great spirit  the girl raised her large eyes with a perplexed inquiring look  what troubles you eve  i asked  eve she repeated almost anxiously  twice you have called me by a name that father sometimes used though not often and when he used it he always spoke low and very tenderly  i felt somewhat perplexed as to how i should reply and finally took refuge in another question  tell me waboose said i did your father ever tell you his own name  of course he did she answered with a look of surpriseyou know well it was weeum  yes william said i but  noweeum she said correcting me  once or twice i have heard him say willum but all our people call him weeum  had he no other name  i asked  no  why should he have another  is not one enough  you never heard of liston  listonno never  waboose said i with sudden earnestness i am going to tell you something that will probably surprise you and i will show you something that may give you pleasureor paini know not which  you remember that when i found the curious ornaments near to the stunted pinetree i asked you not to question me at that time about the packet you gave to me long ago  well the time has come when i ought to tell you all about it  but first look at this  i had taken from my pocket while speaking to her the miniature of her father which i now handed to her  she fixed her eyes on it with a startled look then sprang up with an exclamation at the same time drawing one hand across her eyes as if to clear away some mists that dimmed them  eagerly she gazed again with parted lips and heaving bosom then burst into a passionate flood of tears pressing the miniature alternately to her lips and to her heart  i stood helplessly gazing at heranxious to comfort but unable  oh why why she cried suddenly dropping the miniature why do you mock me with this  it is so little yet so like  it looks alive but it is dead  it is nothinga mockery  the poor girl caught it up however and began to kiss and caress it again  some time elapsed before her passionate grief was sufficiently subdued to permit of her listening to me  when it was nearly exhausted and found vent only in an occasional sob i took her hand gently and said  give me the picture now waboose  i will wrap it up again for i have much to say  then unfolding the last writing of the poor fellow whom the indians had styled weeum the good i slowly translated it into the indian language it was not an easy task for besides feeling that it stirred the heart of the listener with powerful emotions i had great difficulty in taking my eyes off her changeful face so as to read the manuscript  now eve listonfor that is your real name said i when i had finished what do you think ought to be done  the girl did not reply at once but sat so long with her hands clasped tightly on her lap and her eyes fixed wistfully on the ground that i had to repeat the question  what is to be done she replied simply of course what father wished to be done  and are you ready to go with me to the far south to see your fathers mother  can you trust me to protect you  oh yes she replied with a straightforward look that almost disconcerted me have you not protected me well already  and are you willing eve to leave your tribe and go off alone with me  alone she repeated with a look of surprise oh nonot alone mother must go too and also big otter  once more i felt somewhat confused for to say truth i had totally forgotten her mother and big otter for the moment  well now evefor i intend to call you by that name in future except when in the presence of your peoplei must talk this matter over with your mother and big otter  i have some fear that the latter may object to go with us  he will not object said waboose quietly  he loved my father and always obeyed him  very good  so much the better  now as to the valuable jewelsthe ornaments i mean  have you got them here asked eve  yes  knowing the risk i shall run of losing them or having them stolen from me i have had a belt made which fits round my waist under my clothes in which the jewels and the money are placed  if i can manage to get them and you safely conveyed to colorado all will be well but it is a long long journey eve and  i was interrupted at this point by big otter who came to tell us that supper was ready and that as the region in which they were encamped was sometimes visited by hostile indians as well as by white trappers many of whom were great scoundrelsit would be prudent to keep within the circle of sentinels after dark    chapter twenty three  attacked by banditsa sad death and a sudden rescue  it was well that we had been warned not to go beyond the camp for there happened at that time to be abroad on the prairies a band of miscreants who would certainly have shot whoever they had caught straying  the band was composed of white menthat class of white men who throwing off all moral and social restraints give themselves up to the practice of every species of iniquity fearing neither god nor man  they were in short a band of robbers and cutthroats whose special business at that time was hunting buffalo but who were not averse to sell their services to any nation that chanced to be at war or to practice simple robbery when opportunity offered  these men held the opinion that indians were vermin to exterminate which was commendable  when therefore they discovered our camp by the light of the fires they rode towards it with the utmost caution taking advantage of every bush and knoll until our sentinels observed them then they rushed upon us like a hurricane sending a volley of bullets before them  several of our men fell mortally wounded  our sentinels ran in and a wild attempt at defence was made but it was in vain we had been taken completely by surprise and as the only chance of safety our party scattered in all directions each man making for the nearest woods  only big otter salamander and i remained beside the campfires resolved to defend our helpless females or die with them  this brought about a most unexpected turn of affairs for the villains were so eager to hunt and kill the flying indians that every man went in hot pursuit of a fugitive leaving us for the moment absolutely alone  we were not slow in taking advantage of this  although at the onset some of our terrified horses broke their fastenings and galloped away others remained quiet  among these last i observed were my own horse and that of salamander which i have already said were splendid animals  scarcely believing our good fortune we all bounded towards these  in a moment i had mounted  eve seized my hand put her foot on my toe and with a light spring seated herself behind me  big otter vaulting on salamanders steed swung eves mother up behind him  catch another horsethere are plenty good enough for a light weight like you salamander said i as i put my horse to its utmost speed  salamander was not slow to obey but had scarcely mounted when a loud halloo told that our action had been observed  i did not look back one consuming idea filled my mind and that was to save eve liston that the miscreants who now thundered after us would show us no mercy i felt well assured and plied the heavy thong i carried with all my might  the noble steed did not require that  it strained every muscle to the uttermost  i felt cheered to observe that big otter kept well up with me and could hear that salamander was not far behind  we now felt that our only hope under god lay in the superiority of our horses and for some time we listened to the pattering of the hoofs behind us with intense anxiety  soon i began to fancy that we were distancing them and ere long we became sure of this at least as to the most of our pursuers but there was one who kept drawing closer and closer  presently a shot was fired and a bullet whizzed close past my head  at that moment big otter reined up so violently as to throw his horse almost on its haunches  i checked my speed but did not rein up looking back i saw my indian friend wheel round raise his gun to his shoulder and fire  the moon was bright and i could see that the man who had been closing with us dropped to the ground  whether he was killed or only wounded we did not wait to ascertain but dashed on again as fast as ever  we soon drew rein however on observing that the fall of our pursuer had checked his companions  on reaching him they halted dismounted and finally gave up the chase  we soon left them out of sight behind us but still we held on at a handgallop resolved to put as much distance as possible between us before encamping  during all this exciting chase wabooses mother had clung to her stalwart support with the uncomplaining patience of indian women but we were deeply concerned to find on halting that she was too much exhausted to dismount and that blood was trickling from her lips  indeed she would have fallen to the ground if big otter had not caught her in his arms  are you wounded mother exclaimed eve going down on her knees seizing one of the poor womans hands and kissing it tenderly  no waboose but i think there is something wrong here  she pressed her breast gently and coughed up some blood  she is quite worn out said i  come big otter let us carry her to a more comfortable place and make a fire  a cup of tea will soon revive her  i spoke cheerily with a view to comfort eve but i confess that great anxiety filled me when i looked at the poor womans wan face and emaciated frame  the blood too appeared to me a fatal symptom though i had but a hazy idea of everything relating to disease  the place we had selected for our encampment was a dense mass of forest which covered the prairie in that part to an extent of about two square miles  near the outer margin of this patch there was a curious steep mound which rose so high that from the top of it one could see over the surrounding trees  it rose somewhat in the form of a cone with a flat space at the apex of not more than twenty feet in diameter  on the outer rim of this apex was a fringe of rocks and low bushes  it was in fact a natural fortress which seemed so suitable for us in our circumstances that we at once set about making our camp on the top of it  we took care however to kindle our fire in the lowestlying and densest thicket we could find at the foot of the mound  we also made the fire as small and free from smoke as possible for fear of attracting any one to the spot  while i was busy down in the dell preparing the tea salamander having been left to take care of the camp on the mound big otter came to me i was alarmed by the solemn expression of his face  nothing wrong i hope said i anxiously  the wife of weeum the good is dying said the indian mournfully  oh say not so i exclaimed how dreadful to poor waboose if this were to happen just now  you must be mistaken  big otter may be mistaken  he is not a medicineman but he saw a young girl of his tribe with the same look and the same flow of blood from the mouth and she died  god forbid  i exclaimed as i took up the kettle in which the tea was being made  see it is ready i will take it to her  it may at least revive her  i hurried to the top of the mound where poor eve sat by the couch of brush we had spread holding her mothers hand and gazing into her face with painful anxiety  she looked up hastily as i approached and held up a finger  does she sleep  i asked in a low voice as i seated myself beside the couch and set down the kettle  yesi think sobut  she stopped for at the moment her mother opened her eyes and looked wistfully round  weeum she murmured in a faint voice  i thought i heard him speak  no dear mother said eve beginning to weep silently  your spirit was in the land of dreams  see said i pouring some hot tea into a cup and stirring it  i have brought you some of the palefaces sweetwater  i always carry a little of it about with me when i go hunting and had some in my wallet when we started on this wild race  was it not fortunate  come take a little it will strengthen you mother  it was the first time i had called her mother and i did so from a feeling of tenderness for she seemed to me at the time certainly to be dying but she misunderstood my meaning for she looked at me with pleased surprise and then laughed very softly as she glanced at eve  i perceived however from the innocent look of inquiry returned by the latter that she did not understand her  after taking some of the tea the poor woman revived and i whispered to her daughterdont you think it might please her to see the little picture  perhaps  i am not sure  yes give it to me  i will show it but say nothing about my fathers writing or wishes  i have not yet been able to speak to her  to our disappointment she could make nothing of the portrait  perhaps the moonlight was insufficient though very bright but it is more probable that her sight was even then failing  what is that said eve with a startled look pointing at something behind me  i turned sharply round and beheld a column of bright flame shooting high up into the nightair  an exclamation of bitter chagrin escaped me for i knew well what it was  after i had got the fire kindled down in the thicket on our arrival i had noticed that i had laid it close to the roots of a dead firtree the branches of which were covered to the top with a species of dried moss  at the time i knew that there was danger in this but as our fire was to be very small and to be extinguished the moment we were done with it i had allowed it to remain rather than be at the trouble of shifting and rekindling it  i afterwards found that big otter had left the fire in charge of salamander and gone to shift the position of the horses and salamander had left it to fetch water from a neighbouring spring  thus left to itself the fire took advantage of the chance to blaze up the moss on the dead tree had caught fire and the instantaneous result was a blaze that told of our whereabouts to whoever might be on the lookout within ten or fifteen miles of us in every direction  immediately afterwards big otter and salamander came leaping into our fortress  what is to be done now  i asked in a tone of deep mortification  i would say mount and fly replied the indian if it were not for her  he pointed to the dying woman as he spoke  it is quite out of the question said i  she cannot be moved  the paleface talks wisdom said big otter  we must put the place in a state of defence and watch instead of sleep  a deep sigh from salamander told that the proposed mode of spending the night was most unsatisfactory  having no other resource left however we at once set about our task  a number of large loose stones lay about on the little plateau that crowned our mound  these we rolled close to the edge of it and ranging them in line with those that were already there formed a sort of breastwork all round  our three guns we had of course brought with us as well as ammunition and as mine was a doublebarrelled fowlingpiece we had thus four shots at command at any moment  the weapons being already charged we placed ourselves at three points of our circle and prepared for a weary watch  the blaze of the burning firtree soon went out and there were fortunately no other dead trees at hand to be kindled by it  the moon had also become obscured with clouds so that we were left in comparative darkness  the dead silence which it was needful to maintain and the occasional murmur of the dying woman rendered our position eerie and sad in the extreme  at such times when danger threatens and everything that is calculated to solemnise surrounds one thought is apt to be very busy and often in such circumstances the mind is more prone to be occupied with distant scenes and persons than with those near at hand  ere long the sick woman appeared to have fallen asleep and her daughter was seated in perfect silence by her side  no sound whatever fell upon my listening ear for the night was intensely calm and in spite of my efforts to resist it my thoughts strayed away to the home in the old country to scenes of boyhood and to the kind old father who used as a term of endearment to call me punch  a slight motion on the part of salamander recalled me and by way of rousing myself to the necessity of present watchfulness i examined the priming of my gun  then it occurred to me that a bullet if fired at a foe in the dark would be very unlikely to hit i therefore drew both charges and loaded with buckshot instead  you see thought i there is no absolute necessity to kill any one  all i can possibly wish to do is to disable and big shot is more likely to do that without killing than bullets  while thus engaged the clouds rolled off the moon and i saw my companions clearly sitting like statues at their posts  in a few minutes i heard the sweet low voice of eve  she was speaking to her mother  as i sat there and observed her fair hair and skin and recalled for i could not just then see her blue eyes i found it difficult to believe that there was even a drop of indian blood in her veins  not that i object to indian blood i said to myself mentally in selfjustification by no means  indians are gods creatures as well as white men and many of them are a great deal better creatures than many white men but  at this point my mental remarks ceased for i observed to my surprise that eve opened a small book and from the continuous tone of her voice i knew that she was reading  it must be the testament thought i which poor liston mentioned in his manuscript as having been obtained from a hunter  the voice became more distinct as she proceeded and i could make out that she read the english slowly and with great difficulty and then translated it into indian to her mother  god so loved the world she read with peculiar emphasis and paused as if wishing to impress the blessed truth that he gave his onlybegotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life  she closed the book at this point and i observed that she bent over the sick woman a long time  suddenly there arose on the still nightair a low wail so deepso suggestive of a breaking heart that i sprang up and leaped to the girls side  there was no occasion to ask what had occurred  the mother lay there dead with the jaw dropped and the glazing eyes staring at the sky kneeling down i gently closed the eyes and with a napkin bound up the face  big otter glided towards us followed by salamander  one glance sufficed  they cast a look of pity at the orphan who with her face on her knees sobbed as if her heart would break  then without a word they glided back to their posts  i turned to eve and took her hand  dear girl i beganbut she checked me  go she said danger may be near your post is unguarded  raising her hand to my lips i left her without a word and resumed my watch  again profound silence reigned around broken only now and then by an irrepressible sob from eve  some hours afterwardsi knew not how many for i had been half asleep big otter came to me  we may not stay here he said  come i need your help  without reply i rose and followed  it was still very dark  he went to where the body of the indian woman lay  it was cold and stiff by that time  in passing i noticed that poor eve acted as sentinel for big otteroccupied his post and held his gun  i found that a shallow grave had been hollowed out close to where the corpse lay  understanding at once the purpose for which i had been called i kneeled at the head while the indian kneeled at the feet  grasping the shoulders carefully i waited for a word or look from big otter but instead he turned his head to one side and uttered the single wordcome  eve glided instantly towards us went down on her knees and printed a long passionate kiss on the cold forehead  then the indian looked at me and we lifted the body into the grave  eve spread a blanket carefully over it and at once left us to resume her post at the breastwork while we covered in the grave with earth and dead leaves  we had barely accomplished this duty when a loud report rudely broke the silence of the night and a rushing of feet was heard at the foot of the mound  leaping to my post i instantly fired one of the barrels of my gun  several fierce cries followed showing that the buckshot had taken effect and from the nature of the cries we at once perceived that our assailants were white men  i purposely reserved my second barrel for my comrades having also fired were swiftly reloading and therefore defenceless  it was well that i did so for two men who had not been in the first rush now came up the mound at a run  aiming right between them i fired and shot them both  they fell with hideous cries and rolling head over heels down the steep ascent went crashing into the bushes  they are the men from whom we have just escaped said i to big otter but my indian friend was so elated by the success of my shot and withal so excited by the fray that instead of answering he gave vent to a terrific warwhoop in true indian style  the attacking party had come on in front from the direction of the plains  to my consternation big otters war cry was replied to in our rear  turning quickly i saw the dark forms of several savages running up the slope of our fortress  these like the white men had been attracted to us by our column of fire  i was going to send a charge of buckshot amongst them when my indian friend stopped me  let them come he said quickly  they and the white men are sworn foes  be ready to follow me  this last was said to all of us for we had instinctively drawn to the centre of our plateau with the idea of fighting back to back with the foes who surrounded us  again we heard the white men charging up the front of our little hill but before they reached the top a dozen savages had leaped into our enclosure  help against the paleface dogs cried big otter pointing his gun and firing at them as they came up  a wild warwhoop rang out from the indians who were only too ready to accept the invitation to fight the palefaces  a defiant cheer burst in reply from the white men who were equally eager for the fray  come whispered big otter at this point  we had no difficulty in slipping away at the rear unperceived amid the din and smoke and ran to where our horses had been tied  mounting like squirrels we went off like the wind in the direction of the open prairie and soon left our little fortress far behind us with the redskins and the palefaces fighting on the top of it like wild cats    chapter twenty four  the power of sleepplans discussed and a far journey resolved on  it was broad daylight when we once again drew rein and then we were all so overcome with sleep and exhaustion after the prolonged watching and excitement of the night that we could scarcely sit on our horses  eve who sat behind me grasping my waist with both arms swayed so heavily once or twice as nearly to throw me down  we must stop said i to big otter who was close beside me  yes replied the indian but his tone told that he was barely awake  if you doosnt me drop said salamander  the worthy interpreter seemed to think english the easiest language in the circumstances  oh  im so sleepy said poor eve whose grief helped to increase her exhaustion  come we will camp in this thicket said big otter turning his horse in the direction of a long strip of bush that lay a few hundred yards to our right  on reaching it we penetrated almost mechanically to the thickest part of it dismounted and fastened our horses to the trees  turning instantly to assist eve in making a couch of leaves i found that she had lain down where she had dismounted and was already fast asleep  here salamander lend a hand to lift her i said looking round but salamander was also in the land of nod flat on his back with his eyes shut and his mouth open  turning to big otter i found that he was standing staring at me with an expression of such awful solemnity that i was partially roused with a feeling of alarm  hallo  i exclaimed what has happenedspeak man  but big otter only gazed more intensely than ever swayed slightly to and fro and gave a sort of wink or rather a slap together of both eyes  then i understood that the wretched man was only glaring like an owl in the sunshine in his tremendous efforts to keep awake  he assisted me however to lift eve to a more comfortable position and while he was in the act of laying her fair head gently on a pillow of moss i observed that he sank down and instantly fell into a profound slumber but even in that hour of mingled danger and exhaustion the indian did not neglect to hold his gun to his breast with a firm grasp i also had enough wit left to keep my doublebarrel in my hand and was in the act of examining the locks seated at eves feet where my own senses forsook me  we lay there perfectly silent and motionless during the whole of that day for it was not until the sun was descending towards the western horizon that we awoke  i happened to be the first to move  rising softly so as not to disturb the others i went to search for water and was fortunate enough to find a small pool which though not very clear was nevertheless sufficiently good to slake our thirst  sitting down beside the pool i lifted my heart and voice in thanksgiving to god for having thus far delivered and guided us  while thus engaged a slight rustling in the bushes caused me to spring up  it was caused by big otter who had followed me  what does the paleface think he asked sitting down beside me  he thinks that the great master of life has delivered us from our enemies  he is good said i being still influenced by the devotional feeling which had been broken in upon  for a few moments the indian did not reply but continued to look thoughtfully at the ground  at length he spoke  was the great master of life good when he let wabooses mother die in the midst of war and weakness  was he good to waboose when he left her fatherless and motherless  yes he was good i answered confidently  he took the mother of waboose home to dwell with himself and with her father weeum  and men and women you know cannot be taken to the happy land without leaving their children behind themfatherless and motherless  big otter did not reply but i saw by his grave look that he was not satisfied  after a brief pause he resumedwas the great master of life good to the wicked palefaces when he allowed the redmen to slay them in their sins  yes i returned he was good because the great master of life cannot be otherwise than good  he has made our brains capable of understanding that and our hearts capable of resting on it  but he is our father children do not understand all that a father does  big otter has touched on a great mystery  but what we know not now we shall know hereafter  only let the redman be sure of this that whatever we come to know in the hereafter will tend more and more to prove that the great master of life is good  for a long time the indian remained silent and i could not tell by the expression of his grave face whether my reasoning weighed with him or not i therefore offered up a brief prayer that the spirit of god might open his eyesas well as my ownto see and our hearts to receive the truth whatever that might be  then i saidthe thoughts of big otter are deep what do they lead to  no he replied his thoughts are not deep but they are confused for he has heard his paleface brother call waboose eve  how did he come to know that name  it was only used by weeum and seldom by himnever by any one else  it struck me that now was as suitable a time as might present itself to let the indian know about the contents of the packet so i saidlisten big otter i have something important to tell  from this point i went on and in as few words as possible related all that the reader knows about the packet and the wishes of poor william liston  i also showed him the miniature at which he gazed with visible but suppressed emotion  now said i in conclusion what do you think we should do  what weeum wished must be done he replied simply but firmly  you were fond of weeum  i said  yes big otter loved him like a brother  dont you think said i after some minutes thought that it is our duty first to return to the camp of your tribe and also that i should send salamander back to fort wichikagan to tell where i have gone and for what purpose  for salamander is not free like myself  he is still a servant of the furtraders  no that is not your duty said the indian decidedly  your duty is to obey the commands of weeum  my tribe will not die of grief because waboose does not return  as for salamandersend him where you please he is nobodynothing  although not quite agreeing with big otter in his contemptuous estimate of the value of salamander i believed that i could get along quite well without him and therefore resolved to send him backfirst to the indian camp to tell of our safety and intentions and then to the fort with an explanatory letter to lumley who i knew full well would be filled with great anxiety on my account as well as with uncertainty as to how he should act destitute as he was of the slightest clue to my fate or my whereabouts  and you my friend i said what will your movements be  big otter will go and help you to obey the commands of weeum he replied  there is no wife no child waiting for him to return  he must be a father to waboose  muxbee will be her brother  the trail to colorado is long  big otter has been there  he has been a solitary wanderer all his life and knows the wilderness well  he has crossed the great mountains where the snow lies deep even in summer  he can be a guide and knows many of the mountain tribes as well as the tribes of the prairiewaugh  well my friend said i grasping the indians strong hand i need not tell you that your decision gives me joy and i shall be only too glad to travel with you in the capacity of a son for you know if you are to be a father to waboose and i am to be her brother that makes you my fatherdont you see  the grave indian smiled faintly at this touch of pleasantry and then rose  we have nothing to eat he said as we returned to the place where we had slept and we cannot hunt in the night  is your bag empty  no said i glancing at the contents of my wallet there is enough of biscuit and pemmican to give us a light meal  that will do he returned we need rest more than food just now  this was indeed true for notwithstanding that i had slept so soundly during that day i still felt a strong disinclination to rouse myself to action and an intense desire to lie down again  these feelings being shared by my companions it was resolved to spend the night where we were but we took good care to kindle no fire to betray us a second time  we roused eve and salamander to take some food after which we all lay down and ere long were again sound asleep  this double allowance of rest had the most beneficial effect upon our frames  we did not awake till an early hour the following morning and felt so much refreshed as to be ready and anxious to set off on our journey without the delay of breakfasting  this was fortunate for the scraps that remained in my wallet would only have sufficed for one meal to a man of ordinary appetite and as it was important to expedite salamander on his return journey these had to be given to him  poor fellow he was much cast down on hearing of my decision in regard to him  but sar he said with a sorrowful countenance wat for i no go vith you  because you are still a servant of the fur company and not entitled to break your engagement  besides it is desirable that big otters people should know why he and waboose have left them and where they have gone and if you explain matters correctly they will be quite satisfied for they all respect the memory of weeum the good  moreover it is important that mr lumley should know what has prevented my return both to relieve his mind and prevent his sending out to search for me  but sar objected salamander wat if me meets vid de vite scoundrils  you must fight them or run away from them  vell me kin fight but me kin more joyfulerly run avay  but he continued still objecting me got no grub  here is enough for one day i said giving him all i possessed if you spin it out  tomorrow you can roast and eat your moccasins and the third day you can starve  surely thats not hard on a strong young fellow like you and if you push on fast enough youll reach the camp of the redskins early on the third day  salamander sighed but made no further objection and half an hour later he left us  as we now possessed only two horses it naturally fell to my lot being a light weight compared with big otter to take eve up behind me  we must get a horse for waboose said the indian as we galloped over the prairie that day  there is a tribe of blackfoot indians not far from here who have good horses and understand the value of gold for some of them have been to the settlements of the palefaces  you tell me that you have gold  yes i found a bag of five hundred gold pieces with the diamonds in weeums packet  big otter looked at me inquiringly but did not speak yet i guessed his thoughts for though i had shown him listons letter and the miniature i had not shown him the gold or the jewels and he must have wondered where i carried them for he knew of course that they were necessarily somewhat bulky and were not in my wallet which i had emptied more than once in his presence  i therefore explained to him  you know perhaps that gold is heavy and five hundred pieces are bulky and troublesome to carry so i have had a piece of cloth made with a hole in the middle of it for my head to go through one end of it hangs over my breast under my shirt like a breastplate and one end hangs over my back and on each of these plates there are rows of little pockets each pocket the size of a gold piece  thus you see the gold does not feel heavy being equally distributed and it does not show as it would if carried in a heapbesides it forms a sort of armour though i fear it would not resist a riflebullet  waugh exclaimed big otter with an intelligent look  as to the diamonds they are not bulky  i have concealed them in an underbelt round my waist  as big otter had predicted we came to a large village of blackfoot indians two days afterwards and were received with cordial friendship by the inhabitants who knew my indian well  he had visited them during his wanderings many a time and once at a very critical period in their history had rendered important service to the tribe besides saving the life of their chief  a new tent was set aside for our use and a small one pitched close to it for waboose whose dignified yet modest bearing made a profound impression on those children of the wilderness  they recognised no doubt that indian blood flowed in her veins but that rather increased their respect for her as it gave them so to speak a right to claim kinship with a girl who was obviously one of natures aristocracy besides possessing much of that refinement which the redmen had come to recognise as a characteristic of some of the best of the palefaces  indeed i myself found now that i had frequent opportunities of conversing with eve liston that the man who had been affectionately styled weeum the good by the indians had stored his childs mind with much varied secular knowledge such as indians never possess besides instilling into her the elevating and refining precepts of christianity being of a poetical turn of mind he had also repeated to eve many long and beautiful pieces from our best poets so that on more than one occasion the girl had aptly quoted several wellknown passagesto my inexpressible amazement  i wonder said i when we three were seated in our tent that night refreshing ourselves with a choice morsel of baked buffalohump with which the hospitable blackfeet had supplied us how it comes to pass that indians who are usually rather fond of gifts absolutely refuse to accept anything for the fine horse they have given to waboose  perhaps said eve with a little smile in which the extreme corners of her pretty mouth had the peculiar tendency to turn down instead of upperhaps it is because they are grateful  indians are not altogether destitute of that feeling  true eve true it must be that  will you tell us big otter how you managed to make these fellows so grateful  i saved the chiefs life returned the indian curtly  yes but how and when  four summers have passed since then  i was returning from a trip to the rocky mountains when it happened  many bad palefaces were in the mountains at that time  they were idle bad men from many lands who hated work and loved to fight  one of them had been killed by a sioux indian  they all banded together and swore that they would shoot every indian they came across  they killed manysome even who were friendly to the white men  they did not ask to what tribe they belonged  they were redskin varmints that was enough  the strong elk whose hospitality we enjoy tonight was chief of the blackfeet  i was on my way to visit him when one evening i came upon the camp of the palefaces  i knew that sometimes they were not friendly to the redman so i waited till dark and then crept forward and listened  their chief was loudvoiced and boastful  he boasted of how many indians he had killed  i could have shot him where i lay and then escaped easily but i spared him for i wished to listen  they talked much of the strong elk  i understood very little  the language of the paleface is difficult to understand but i came to know that in two hours when the moon should sink they would attack him  i waited to hear no more  i ran like the hunted buffalo  i came to strong elk and told him  it was too late to move the camp but we put it in a state of defence  when the palefaces came we were ready arrows thick as the snowflakes in winter met them when they came on and many of them bit the dust  some ran away  some who were brave still came on and leaped our barricades  they fought like fiends their boastful chief saw strong elk and rushed at him  they grappled and fell  the paleface had a keen knife  it was raised to strike one moment more and the blackfoot chief had been in the happy huntinggrounds with his fathers when the gun of big otter came down on the skull of the boastful one  it was enough  strong elk was saved and he is grateful waugh  well he has reason to be said i much impressed by the modest way in which the story was told  and now i added since we have got a capital horse and the journey before us is long dont you think we should start tomorrow  yes tomorrowand it is time for waboose to rest  she is strong but she has had much to weary her and her grief is deep  with a kindly acknowledgment of the indians thoughtful care of her eve rose and went to her tent  big otter lighted his pipe and i lay down to meditate but almost before i had time to think my head drooped and i was in the land of forgetfulness  it is not my purpose good reader to carry you step by step over the long varied and somewhat painful journey that intervened between us and colorado at that time  it was interestingdeeply sofor we passed through some of the most beautiful as well as wildest scenery of the north american wilderness  we kept far to the westward near the base of the rocky mountains so as to avoid the haunts of civilised men  but space will not permit of more than a brief reference to this long journey  i can only say that on arriving at a village belonging to a remote tribe of indians who were wellknown to my guide it was arranged that big otter and waboose should stay with them while i should go to the cities of the palefaces and endeavour to convert my diamonds into cash happening to have a friend in chicago i went there and through his agency effected the sale of the diamonds which produced a little over the sum mentioned by william liston in his paper  this i took with me in the convenient form of bills on wellknown mercantile firms in the region to which i was bound and having wrapped them in a piece of oiled silk and sewed them inside of the breastplate that contained my gold i set off with a light heart though somewhat weighted shoulders to return to my friends in the far west    chapter twenty five  tells of a wonderful meeting and a frustrated foe  i must change the scene now and advance the courteous reader considerably in regard to time as well as place on the journey which we have pursued so long together  it is one of those scenes of romantic beauty on the extreme frontiers of civilisation where the rifle has not even yet given place to the plough where the pioneer husbandman and the painted warrior often meetthe one to look with patronising superiority on the savage whom he means to benefit the other to gaze curiously at the paleface and to wonder somewhat indignantly when and where his encroachments are to cease  woodlands and prairies breezy uplands and grassy bottoms alternate in such picturesque confusion and such lovely colours comingle that a painterhad one been theremust have deemed the place at all events the vestibule of paradise  there is a small hamlet on the slope of a hill with a broad river winding in front a few hundred yards from the hamlet which opens out into a lake  on the margin of this lake lie a few boats  on the surface of it float a few more boats with one or two birchbark canoes some of these are moving to and fro the occupants of others which appear to be stationary are engaged in fishing  there is the sound of an anvil somewhere and the lowing of cattle and the voices of children and the barking of dogs at play and the occasional crack of a gun  it is an eminently peaceful as well as beautiful backwood scene  to a particular spot in this landscape we would direct attention  it is a framehouse or cottage which if not built according to the most approved rules of architecture is at least neat clean comfortablelooking and what one might style pretty  it is a clapboarded house painted white with an edging of brown which harmonises well with the green shrubbery around  there is a verandah in front a door in the middle two windows on either side and no upper storey but there are attics with dormer windows which are suggestive of snug sleepingrooms of irregular shape with low ceilings and hatcrushing doorways  this cottage stands on the apex of a little hill which overlooks the hamlet commands the river and the lake as well as an extensive view of a sparsely settled district beyond where the frontier farmer and the primeval forest are evidently having a lively time of it together  in short the cottage on the hill has a decidedly comfortable comeupquickandenjoyyourself air which is quite charming  on a certain fine afternoon in autumn eve liston alias waboose big otter and i rode slowly up the winding path which led to this cottage we had been directed to it by the postmaster of the hamleta man who if he had been condemned to subsist solely on the proceeds of the village postoffice would have been compelled to give up the ghost or the post in a week  we must be careful eve how we break it to her said i as we neared the top  arrived at the summit of the hill we found a rustic table also a rustic seat on which was seated a comely matron engaged in the very commonplace work of darning socks  she cast on us a sharp and remarkably penetrating glance as we approached  doubtless our appearance was peculiar for a pretty maiden in savage costume a somewhat ragged white man and a gigantic savage all mounted on magnificent steeds and looking travelstained and worn after a journey of many weeks was not probably an everyday sight even in those regions  dismounting and advancing to act as spokesman while my companions sat motionless and silent in their saddles i pulled off my cap  i have been directed to this house as the abode of mrs liston said i with a tremor of anxiety for i knew that the comely matron before me could not be she whom i sought and feared there might be some mistake  you have been directed aright sir  may i ask who it is that desires to see her  my name is maxby said i quickly for i was becoming nervously impatient  i am quite a stranger to mrs liston but i would see her because i bring her newsnews of importancein fact a message from her longlost son  from willie liston exclaimed the lady starting up and seizing my arm while she gazed into my face with a look of wild surprise  is hebut it cannot beimpossiblehe must be  he is dead said i in a low sad voice as she hesitated  yes she returned clasping her hands but without any of the wild look in her eyes now  we have mourned him as dead for many many years stay i will call hisbutperhapssometimes it is kindness to conceal  if there is anything sad to tell might it not be well to leave his poor mother in ignorance  she is old and  no madam i interrupted that may not be  i have a message from him to his mother  a message  then you knew him  no i never saw him  strange  you have a message from him yet never saw him  can you not give me the message to convey it to her  she is getting frail and a shock might be serious  i am william listons cousin and have come to take care of my aunt and manage her farm  the message by mr listons wish said i was to be delivered by me to his mother  i will be very careful to deliver it gently  well i will bring her to you  she usually comes out about this time to enjoy the sunset  i will trust to your discretion but bear in remembrance that she is not strong  forgive me she added turning to my companions this surprise has made me forget my duty  will your friends dismount  eve at once dismounted and shook the hand which the lady extended but big otter sat quite still like a grand equestrian statue while the lady entered the house  i saw that the poor girl was much agitated but true to her indian training she laid powerful constraint on herself  in a few minutes an old lady with the sweetest face and most benignant aspect i ever saw came out of the cottage and advanced to the rustic seat  before sitting down she looked at us with a pleasant smile and saidyou are heartily welcome  we are always glad to see strangers in these distant parts  while speaking she tremblingly pulled out and put on a pair of spectacles to enable her to have a clearer view of her visitors  the scene that immediately followed took me very much by surprise and completely frustrated all my wise plans of caution  she looked at me first and nodded pleasantly  then she looked at eve who was gazing at her with an intense and indescribable expression suddenly the old ladys eyes opened to their widest  a deathlike pallor overspread her old face  she opened her arms wide bent forward a little towards eve and gaspedcome to mewillie  never was invitation more swiftly accepted  eve bounded towards her and caught her in her arms just in time to prevent her falling  the poor old mother  for years she had prayed and longed for her lost willie though she never once regarded him as lost  is not the promise sure she was wont to say ask and ye shall receive  even when she believed that the erring son was dead she did not cease to pray for himbecause he might be alive  latterly however her tone of resignation proved that she had nearly if not quite given up all hope of seeing him again in this life yet she never ceased to think of him as not lost but gone before  and now when at last his very image came back to her in the form of a woman she had no more doubt as to who stood before her than she had of her own identity  she knew it was willies childone glance sufficed to convince her of thatbut it was only williethe longlost williethat she thought of as she pressed the weeping girl with feeble fervour to her old and loving heart  during the time that this scene was enacting big otter remained still motionless on his horse without moving a muscle of his grave countenance  was he heartless or was his heart a stone  an observer might readily have thought so but his conduct when the old lady at last relaxed her hold of eve proved that indian like he was only putting stern restraint on himself  dismounting with something of the deliberate and stately air of one who is resolved not to commit himself the indian strode towards mrs liston and tenderly grasping one of her hands in both of his saidweeum  truly there is but a step from the sublime to the ridiculous and in some cases that step is an exceeding short one  it seemed so to me now as i beheld the tall indian stooping to gaze with intense earnestness into the tearbesprinkled face of the little old lady who gazed with equally intense amazement into his huge dark visage  what does he mean by weeum she asked with an appealing look at me  weeum i replied is the indian way of pronouncing william  your late son dear madam was much beloved and respected by the tribe of indians with whom he dwelt and was known to them only by the name of william or weeum  this man was his most intimate and loving friend and brotherinlaw  the poor old lady was deeply affected while i spoke for of course my words confirmed at last her long resisted fear that willie was indeed no longer of this world  big otter waited a few seconds still holding her hand and then turning to me said in his native tonguetell the paleface mother that the sister of big otter was the wife of weeum that big otter loved weeum better than a brother and that weeum loved big otter more than any man of his tribe  every one loved weeum the good  he was so kind and so brave  at first he was very fierce but afterwards that passed away and when waboose began to grow tall and wise weeum turned soft like a woman  he spoke often to the redmen about the great master of life and he taught big otter to love the great master of life and the name of jesus  often weeum talked of going to the far south to see one whom he called a dear old one  we did not understand him then  big otter understands him now  so shall it be in the great hereafter things that are dark now shall be light then  but weeum could not leave his wife and child and we would not let him take them away  sometimes weeum spoke mysteries  one day he said to me brother i must go to the far south to see the dear old one  i will take my wife and child and will return to you againif the great master of life allows  if however i die or am killed waboose will reveal all that is in weeums heart  she cannot reveal it now  she will not even understand until a good paleface visits your tribe  weeum said no more  he left the mind of big otter dark  it is no longer dark  it is now clear as the sun at noon  the good paleface is here pointing to me as he spoke and the dear old one is before me  he paused a moment at this point and then with an evident effort to suppress emotion addedweeum was drowned soon after the day he spoke to me while trying to save life  since then there has been no sun in the sky for big otter  the poor old mother listened to this speech with intense interest and deepening emotion but i could see that the tears which flowed over the wrinkled cheeks were tears of gladness rather than of sorrow  it could scarcely at that time come as news to her that her son was dead but it did come as a gladsome surprise that her wilful willie had not only found the saviour himselfor rather been found of himbut that he had spent his latter days in striving to bring others to that great source of blessedness  being too much overcome to speak she submitted to be led away into the cottage by the comely matron who had been a keen and sympathetic observer of all that passed  of course eve accompanied them for weeums mother refused to let go her hand even for a moment and big otter and i were left outside alone  come said i vaulting into my saddle you and i will go and have a gallop my friend and see the land for i mean to dwell here and would strongly advise you to do the same  waugh exclaimed the indian as he leaped on the back of his steed and followed me  you see said i as we rode along followed by the admiring gaze of the village childrenfor accustomed though they were to savages they had never seen so grand an indian as big otter on so magnificent a horseyou see they will require some time to clear up matters in the cottage for eves english good though it be is not perfect and all their minds will naturally be a little confused at first  you did me good service today my friend  how  the speech of muxbee is mysterious  dont you see i replied that the speech you made to old mrs liston broke the ice as it were and told her nearly all that i had to tell  and if you knew how many anxious hours i have spent in thinking how i should best break the sad news to the poor old mother you would better understand how grateful i am to you  the speech of muxbee is still full of mystery  what does he mean by breaking news  when big otter has got news to tell he tells it  when people have got something to hear why should they not hear it at once  i felt that there are some things which some minds cannot understand so instead of answering changed the subject  see said i pointing to a part of the uncleared bush into which we had ridden there are two redskins  one is about to let fly an arrow hold onwe may disturb his aim  my companion looked and with a start threw forward the muzzle of his gun  little did i think riding as we then were in a semicivilised region what the aim was that i was so anxious not to disturb  i was suddenly and rudely enlightened when i heard the twang of the bow and saw the arrow flying straight towards me  it was too late to leap aside or dodge it  full on the centre of my chest the shaft struck me i experienced something of the shock that one feels when death is suddenly and very unexpectedly brought near  i have a distinct recollection of the solemn impression made by the belief that my last hour had come yet i did not fall  i saw that the savage was hastily fitting another arrow to the bow but was so stunned by surprise that i made no effort to save myself  happily big otter had his wits about him  he fired before the arrow winged its flight and shot the indian dead  the other savage at once turned and fled but my companion gave chase and overtook him in a few seconds  seeing that he could not escape he turned round flung down his weapons in token of submission and stood sullenly before his captor  big otter at once leaped off his steed seized the man bound his arms behind him with a thong and led him to the spot where the dead man was lying on his face  meanwhile i had discovered that the arrow which should have pierced my heart had been stopped by one of the gold pieces which formed my breastplate  it had indeed pierced the coin but had only entered my flesh about a quarter of an inch  thanking god for the wonderful deliverance i plucked it out and casting it away rode up to the place where the dead man lay  my companion had turned him over and to my great surprise revealed the face of my old foe attick  waugh exclaimed big otter turning to the captured savage  are there not deer enough in the woods and buffalo enough on the plains that the redman should take to testing his arrows on palefaces  i did not shoot was the stern reply  true but you were the companion perhaps the friend of the dead man  i was not his friend replied the savage more sullenly than ever  then how came you to be with him when making this cowardly attack  i asked in a tone which was meant to conciliate  the tone had the desired effect  the savage explained that about three weeks previously he had while in danger of being killed by a grizzly bear which he had wounded been rescued by attick who told him that he was in pursuit of a foe who had injured him deeply and whom he meant to hunt to death  out of gratitude the indian had consented to follow himbelieving his story to be true  attick explained that he had followed his foe from the far north day by day week by week month by month seeking an opportunity to slay him but so careful a watch had been kept by his foe and the indian and woman who travelled with him that he had not up to that time found an opportunity  attick and his new ally had then dogged us to sunny creekthe village at which we had arrivedand finding that we no longer feared danger from hostile indians and had relaxed our vigilance they had made up their minds to stay there patiently till the deed could be accomplished  that day while consulting about the matter in the woods we had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared before them and attick had discharged his arrow  but concluded the savage with a perplexed look the paleface cannot be killed  arrows cannot pierce him  you are right said i suddenly coming to a decision in regard to the man  neither bullet nor arrow can kill me till my work is done and the great master of life permits me to die  goand be more careful whom you follow in future  i cut the thong that bound him as i spoke and set him free  without a word though with an irresistible look of surprise the savage turned picked up his weapons and strode majestically into the bush  my brother is not wise remarked big otter  that may be so said i but it grieves me that the blood of one indian has been shed on my account and i dont want to let the authorities here have the chance of shedding that of another  come we must let them know what has happened  so saying i turned and rode off  we went direct to the authorities abovementioned told who we were and what we had done guided a party of men to the scene of the intended murder and then while the stars were beginning to twinkle in the darkening sky returned to see what was going on in the little cottage on the hill at sunny creek    chapter twenty six  one of the difficulties of correspondence enlarged oncoming events etcetera  about six weeks after the events narrated in the last chapter i seated myself before a desk in a charming atticroom in the cottageno need to say what cottageand began to pen a letter  i was in an exceedingly happy frame of mind  the weather was agreeable neither too hot nor too cold circumstances around me were conducive to quiet contemplation and my brain was quite clear nevertheless i experienced unusual difficulty in the composition of that letter  i began it at least halfadozen times and as many times threw my pen down tore it up and began another  at last i received a summons to dinner and had then got only halfway through my letter  our dinnerparty consisted of old mrs liston her comely niece mrs temple who by the way was a widow eve liston and myself  big otter unable to endure the restraints of civilisation had gone on a hunting expedition for a few days by way of relief  you is very stupid surely to take three hours to write one letter remarked eve with that peculiar smile to which i have before referred  eve said i somewhat sternly you will never learn english properly if you do not attend to my instructions  you is plural though i am singular and if you address me thus you must say you are not you is  you are right in saying you are singular interposed aunt temple who was rather sharp witted and had intensely black eyes  eve had called her aunt by mistake at first and now stuck to it  i dont think there is another man in the district continued the matron who would take so long to write a short letter  you said it was going to be short didnt you  yesshort and sweet though i doubt if the dear old man will think it so at first  but hell change his mind when he gets here  no doubt we will convert him said aunt temple  eve will at all events said i  there was not much more said at that dinner which calls for record  i will therefore return to the atticroom and the letter  after at least another hour of effort i succeeded in finishing my task though not entirely to my satisfaction  as the letter was of considerable importance and interestat least to those concernedi now lay it before the reader  it ran thus  my dear father  i scarcely know how to tell youor how to begin for i fear that you will not only be very much surprised but perhaps displeased by what i have to write  but let me assure you dear father that i cannot help it  it almost seems as if the thing had been arranged for me and as if i had had no say in the matter  the fact is that i have left the service of the furtraders and am engaged to be married to a dear beautiful halfcaste girl quite a lady however i assure you and have made up my mind to become a farmer in one of the wildest parts of colorado  thereive made a clean breast of it and if that does not take away your breath nothing will  but i write in all humility dearest father  do not fancy that having taken the bit in my teeth i tell you all this defiantly  very far from it  had it been possible nothing would have gratified me more than to have consulted you and asked your approval and blessing but with three thousand miles of ocean and i know not how many hundred miles of land between us that you know was out of the question besides it could not have altered matters for the thing is fixed  my eves mother was an indian  a very superior woman indeed let me hasten to say and an exceptionally amiable one  her father was an english gentleman named william listonson of a clergyman and a highly educated man  he was wild and wilful in his youth and married an indian but afterwards became a really good man and being naturally refined and with amiable feelings spent his life in doing good to the people with whom he had cast his lot and perished in saving the life of his wife  eve evidently takes after him  as to my eve herself  i will spare the reader what i said about eve herself  suffice it to say that after an enthusiastic account of her mental and physical qualities in which however i carefully refrained from exaggeration and giving a brief outline of my recent experiences i wound up withand now dear father forgive me if i have done wrong in all this and make up your mind to come out here and live with us or take a farm of your own near to us  you know there is nothing to tie you to the old country you were always fond of the idea of emigrating to the backwoods your small income will go twice as far here as there if properly laid out and youll live twice as long  come dear dad if you love me  i cant get married till you come  ever believe me your affectionate songeorge maxby  reader shall we visit the dear old man in his dingy little house in old england while he peruses the foregoing letter  yes let us go  it is worth while travelling between four and five thousand miles to see him read it  perhaps if you are a critical reader you may ask but how came you to know how the old gentleman received the letter  well although the question is impertinent i will answer it  i have a small cousin of about ten years of age  she dwells with my father and is an exceedingly sharp and precocious little girl  she chanced to be in the parlour waiting for my fatherwho was rather given to being late for breakfastwhen my letter arrived  the familiar domestic cat was also waiting for him  it had mounted the table and sat glaring at the butter and cream but being aware that stealing was wrong or that the presence of cousin maggie was prohibitive it practised selfdenial  finding a storybook my cousin sat down on the window seat behind the curtain and became absorbedso much absorbed that she failed to notice the entrance of my father failed to hear hisha a letter from punch at lastand was only roused to outward events by the crash which ensued when my father smote the table with his fist and exclaimed impossible  the cups and saucers almost sprang into the air  the cat did so completely and retired in horror to the furthest corner of the room  recovering itself however it soon returned to its familiar post of observation on the table  not so cousin maggie who observing that she was unperceived and feeling somewhat shocked as well as curious sat quite still with her mouth eyes and especially her ears wideopen  from maggie thenlong afterwardsi learned the details  my father sat down after smiting the table gasped once or twice pulled off and wiped his spectacles put them on again and laying strong constraint on himself read the whole through aloud and without a word of comment till he reached the end when he ejaculatedinconceivable laid the letter down and looking up glared at the cat  as that creature took no notice of him he incontinently flung his napkin at it and swept it off the table  then he gave vent to a prolonged whsh burst into a fiendish laugh and gave a slap to his thigh that shattered the cats peace of mind for the remainder of that morning after which he reopened the letter spread it carefully out on the table and in the most intensely cynical tones began a disjointed commentary on it as follows  your dear father indeed  thats the first piece of humbug in your precious letter  very dear i am to you no doubt  and youyoua chita mere boy he forgot that several years had elapsed since i left him  oh noim neither surprised nor displeasednot at all  the state of my mind is not to be expressed by such phraseologyby no means  and you were always such a smoothfaced quiet little beggar thatwellno matter  couldnt help it indeed  hm  quite a lady  oh of course  necessarily so when you condescended to fall in love with her  humility well  given up the service too colorado  one of the wildest partsas if a tame part wouldnt have done just as well  a farmer  much you know about farming  you dont tell all this defiantly  oh no certainly not but if you dont do it defiantly i have misunderstood the meaning of the word selfwill till i am bald  why didnt you consult me then  much you care for my blessingand the thing is fixed  exasperation was too much developed at this point to permit of blowing off steam in the form of sarcastic remark  my poor father hit the table with such force that the cream spurted out of its pot over the cloth and my father didnt care  the cat cared however when at a later period it had the cleaning up of that little matter all to itself this last explosion caused so much noisemy cousin told meas to attract the attention of my fathers only domestic who bounced into the room and asked did e ring  to which my father returned such a thundering no that the domestic fled precipitately followed by the catrampant  your eve indeed said my father resuming the sarcastic vein mother an indiana hottentot i suppose or something of that sort short skirt of peacock feathers no upper part worth mentioning flat nose and lips and smeared all over with fat i dare say  charming motherinlaw  calculated to create some impression on english society no wonder youve chosen the wilds of colorado  ah now as to my eve herselfjust let us have it strong my boyhm sweetyes yesamiable exactly fair hair and blue eyesha you expect me to swallow that oh graceful ha perfection undoubtedly forgive you  noboy ill never forgive you  youre the most arrant assidiotbut this caps allcome out here and live with us theyll give me one quarter of the wigwam i supposecurtained off with birchbark perhaps or deerskin  your affectionatedolt whwhy what do you glare like that for  this last question was put to my small cousin who in the horror of her belief that my father had gone mad had agitated the windowcurtain and revealed herself  my poor dear father  i can imagine the scene well and would not have detailed it so minutely here ifbut enough  i must not forecast  the afternoon on which this letter was despatched big otter returned to sunny creek cottage with a haunch of fat venison on his lusty shoulders  he found us all grouped round the rustic table in front of the door enjoying a cup of fragrant tea and admiring the view  eve was sitting on a low stool at the feet of mrs liston engaged in ornamenting a bright blue firebag with bead and quill work of the most gorgeous colouring and elegant design  the design of course was her own  mrs liston was knitting small squares of open cottonwork of a stitch so large that wooden needles about the size of a goosequill were necessary  it was the only work that the poor old ladys weak eyesight and trembling hands could accomplish and the simple stitch required little exercise of mind or muscle  when mrs liston completed a square she rolled it away  when sixteen squares were finished she sewed them together and formed a strip about eight feet long and six inches broad when sixteen such strips were completed she sewed them all together and thus produced a bedquilt  quilts of this sort she presented periodically with much ceremony and demonstration of regard to her most intimate friends  in that region the old lady had not many intimate friends but then it luckily took much time to produce a quilt  the quilt then in handat that time near its completionwas for eve  thank you so much for your venison said mrs liston as the hunter with an air of native dignity laid the haunch at her feet  take it to the kitchen dear she added to mrs temple who was pouring out the tea  it has just come in time said mrs temple with a pleasant nod to big otter we had quite run out of fresh meat and your friend muxbee is such a lazy boy that he never touches a gun  in fact i dont know how to get him out of the house even for an hour  as this was said in english big otter did not understand it but when he saw the speaker stoop to pick up the venison he stepped quickly forward and anticipated her  thank you carry it this way said aunt temple as i had begun to style her leading the indian to the pantry in rear of the cottage  well big otter said i when they returned now do you find the country round here in regard to game  there is much game he answered  then youll make up your mind to pitch your wigwam here i hope and make it your home  no big otters heart is in his own land in the far north  he will go back to it  what and forsake waboose said eve looking up from her work with an expression of real concern  with a gratified air the indian replied big otter will return  soon  i asked  not very long  when do you start  before yon sun rises again said big otter pointing to the westward where the heavens above and the heavens reflected in the lake below were suffused with a golden glow  then i shall have to spend the most of the night writing said i for i cannot let you go without a long letter to my friend lumley and a shorter one to macnab  i have set my heart on getting them both to leave the service and come here to settle alongside of me  you see your friend muxbee said aunt temple using the indians pronunciation of my name is like the fox which lost his tail  he wishes all other foxes to cut off their tails so as to resemble him  am i to translate that  i asked  if you can and will  having done so i continuedbut seriously big otter i hope you will try to persuade them to come here  give them a glowing account of the country and the climate and say ill not marry till they come to dance at my wedding  i would not wait for that however if it were not that eve thinks she is a little too young yet and besides she has set her heart on my father being present  ill explain all that in my letters of course but do you press it on them  and be sure you tell the darkhaired paleface said eve that waboose expects her to come  give these from her friend fairhairshe was fond of calling me fairhair  eve rose as she spoke and produced a pair of beautiful moccasins which had been made and richly ornamented by her own hands  at the same time she presented the firebag to the indian adding that she was glad to have had it so nearly ready when he arrived  for whom are these pretty things my dear asked mrs liston  the firebag mother is for big otter and the moccasins is  are eveareplural you know  is replied eve with emphasis for my dear friend jessie the blackhaired paleface  well done waboose exclaimed aunt temple  im glad to see that you improve under my tuition  you cant spoil her i retorted quietly  well my dear said mrs liston send a message from me to your darkhaired paleface that i shall begin a quilt for her next week  i hope she will come to receive it said aunt temple  tell her that muxbee with my love and add that i hope we shall be good friends when we meet  though i doubt it for i cant bear highlanderstheyre so dreadfully enthusiastic  how much of that message am i to send  i asked  as much as you please  i can trust to your discretion  that evening i retired to my snug little atticroom earlier than usual and spreading out a large sheet of narrowruled foolscap paper before me began a letter to my old chum on the banks of lake wichikagan  i had much to relate for much had happened since i had sent off the brief note by salamander and i found it difficult to check my pen when once it had got into the flow of description and the rush of reminiscence and the gush of reiterative affection  i had covered the whole of the first sheet of narrowruled foolscap and got well into the second sheet which i had selected unruled that i might write still more narrowly when i heard a gentle tap at the door  i knew the tap wellsprang up and opened the door  eve stood there looking as modest and beautiful and elegant as everwhich is saying a good deal for in deference to mrs listons prejudices she had exchanged her old graceful tunic reaching to a little below the knee and her pretty beadwrought leggings and other picturesque accompaniments of indian life for the long dress of civilisation however i consoled myself with the fact that nothing could spoil her and recalled with satisfaction the words i dont quite remember them which refer to a rose smelling equally sweet under any other name  prayers said eve  lest any one should feel perplexed by the brevity of her announcement i may mention that dear old mrs listons habit was to recognise her best benefactor night and morning by having worship in the household and invariably conducted it herself in her soft slightly tremulous but still musical voice  as we descended the stairs eve saidyou must sit beside me tonight geoge  when you sit opposite you gaze too much and make me uncomfortable  certainly dear one said i  but pray dont call me geogesay george  theres an r in it you know  yes geooorrrrge  eve i whispered as we sat on the sofa together while mrs liston was wiping her spectacles ive been earnestly considering that last attempt of yours and i think upon the whole that geoge is better    chapter twenty seven  a peculiar wedding and a wonderful walk  turn we once again to the great wilderness and if we do so with half the zest felt by big otter when he set forth on his journey we will certainly enjoy the trip you and i whoever you be  but we must take the journey at a bound  it is christmastime once more  lake wichikagan has put on its topcoat of the purest carrara marble  the roof of the little fort once again resembles a french cake overloaded with creamy sugar  the pines are black by contrast  the willows are smothered all save the tops where the snowflakey ptarmigan find food and shelter  smoke rises from the various chimneys showing that the dwellers in that remote outpost are enjoying themselves as of old  the volumes of smoke also suggest christmas puddings  let us look in upon our old friends  in the mens house great preparation for something or other is going on for each man is doing his best with soap water razor brush and garments to make himself spruce  salamander is there before a circular lookingglass three inches in diameter in the lid of a soapbox making a complicated mess of a necktie in futile attempts to produce the sailors knot  blondin is there before a similar glass carefully scraping the bristles round a frostbite on his chin with a blunt razor  henri coppet having already dressed is smoking his pipe and quizzing marcelle dumontwho is also shavingone of his chief jokes being an offer to give dumonts razor a turn on the grindstone  donald bane is stooping over a tin basin on a chair with his hair and face soapsudded and his eyes tight shut which fact being observed by his friend dougall induces that worthy to crytonal manlook here  did iver man or wuman see the likes o that  the invitation is so irresistible to donald that he half involuntarily exclaims wow man shameswhat ist and opens his eyes to find that shames is laughing at him and that soap does not improve sight  the old chief muskrat is also there having been invited along with masqua and his son mozwa with their respective squaws to the great event that is pending and to judge from the intense gravitynot to say owlish solemnityof these redskins they are much edified by the proceedings of the men  in the hall preparations are also being carried on for something of some sort  macnab is there with his coat off mounted on a chair which he had previously set upon a rickety table hammering away at a festoon of pinebranches with which one end of the room is being decorated spooner is also there weaving boughs into rude garlands of gigantic size  the darkhaired paleface jessie is there too helping spoonerwho might almost be called spooney he looks so imbecile and sweet  jack lumley is likewise there  he is calm collected suave as usual and is aiding macnab  it was a doubly auspicious day for it was not only christmas but a weddingday  it seems like a dream cried macnab stopping his noisy hammer in order to look round and comment with his noisy voice to think jessie that you should refuse at least a dozen sturdy highlanders north o the grampians and come out to the backwoods at last to marry an englishman  i wish you would attend to what you are doing brother said jessie blushing very much  she might have done worse remarked spooner who happened to be an englishman  lumley said nothing but a pleased smile flickered for a minute on his lips while macnab resumed his hammering with redoubled zest to a chuckling accompaniment  it would be nothing he resumed turning round again and lowering his hammer if you hadnt always protested that you would never marry butoh jessie i wonder at a girl who has always been so firm in sticking to her resolves turning out so fickle  i really never thought that the family of macnab could be brought so low through one of its female members  i know one of its male members said lumley in a warning voice who will be brought still lower if he keeps dancing about so on that ricketytherei told you so  as he spoke peter macnab missed his footing and came down on the table with a crash so tremendous that the crazy article of furniture became something like what easterns style a splitcamelits feeble legs spread outwards and its body came flat to the ground  sprawling for a moment macnab rose dishevelled from a mass of pinebranches and looked surprised  not hurt i hope said lumley laughing while jessie looked anxious for a moment  ii think not  noevidently not  yes jessie my dear you may regard this as a sort of practical illustration of the value of submission  if that table had resisted me i had been hurt probably giving way as it didim all right  your illustration is not a happy one said lumley for your own safety was purchased at the cost of the table  if you had taken the lesson home and said that pride goes before a fall it would have been more to the purpose  perhaps so returned macnab assisting to clear away the split table my pride is at its lowest ebb now anyhow for not only does jessie macnab become mrs lumley within an hour but i am constrained to perform the marriage ceremony myself as well as give her away  the highlander here referred to the fact that for the convenience of those numerous individuals whose lives were spent in the great norwest far removed at that time from clergymen churches and other civilised institutions the commissioned gentlemen in the service of the hudsons bay company were legally empowered to perform the marriage ceremony  of course jessie regretted much the impossibility of procuring a minister of any denomination to officiate in that remote corner of the earth and had pleaded for delay in order that they might go home and get married there but lumley pointed out firstly that there was not the remotest chance of his obtaining leave of absence for years to come secondly that the marriage tie as tied by her brothers would be as legally binding as if managed by an archbishop of canterbury or a moderator of the scottish general assembly and thirdly that as he was filled with as deep a reverence for the church as herself he would have the rite reperformed ceremonially observe jessie not really for that will be done today on the first possible opportunity  if jessie had been hard to convince lumley would not have ended that little discourse with thirdly  as it was jessie gave in and the marriage was celebrated in the decorated hall with voyageurs and hunters and furtraders as witnesses  macnab proved himself a worthy minister for he read the marriageservice from the church of england prayerbook with an earnest and slightly tremulous tone which betrayed the emotion of his heart  and if ever a true prayer by churchman or layman mounted to the throne that prayer was the fervent god bless you jessie to which the highlander gave vent as he pressed the bride to his heart when the ceremony was over  there were some peculiarities about this wedding in the wilderness which call for special notice  in the first place the weddingfeast though held shortly after midday was regarded as a dinnernot as a breakfast  it was rather more real too than civilised feasts of the kind  those who sat down to it were hungry  they meant feeding as was remarked by salamander when more venison steaks were called for  then there was no champagne or strong drink of any kind  teetotalismwith or without principlewas the order of the day but they had gallons of tea and they consumed them too and these stalwart norwesters afterwards became as uproarious on that inspiring beverage as if they had all been drunk  there was this peculiarity however in their uproar that it was reasonable hearty goodhumoured did not degenerate into shameful imbecility or shameless impropriety nor did it end in stupid incapacity  it subsided gradually into pleasant exhaustion and terminated in profound refreshing slumber  before that point was reached however much had to be done  games had to be undertaken as long as the daylight lastedchief among which were tobogganing down the snowslope and football on the ice  then after dark the hall was lighted up with an extra supply of candles round the roomthough the powerful blaze of the mighty wood fire in the open chimney rendered these almost unnecessary and another feast was instituted under the name of supper though it commenced at the early hour of six oclock  at this feast there was some speechifyingpartly humorous and partly touchingand it remains a disputed point to this day whether the touching was more humorous or the humorous more touching  i therefore refrain from perplexing the reader with the speeches in detail  only part of one speech will i refer to as it may be said to have had a sort of prophetic bearing on our tale  it fell from the lips of lumley  my friends he said with that grave yet pleasant urbanity which i have before said was so natural to him there is only one regret which i will venture to express on this happy day and it is this that some of those who were wont to enliven us with their presence at fort wichikagan are not with us tonight  i really do not think there would be a single element wanting in the joy which it has pleased a loving god to send me if i could only have had my dear young friend george maxby to be my best man  he had to pause a few moments at this point because of noisy demonstrations of assent  and i am quite sure he continued that it would have afforded as much satisfaction to you as it would to my dear wife and me if we could only have had our sedate friend big otter  again he had to pause for the shouting with which this name was received not only made the rafters ring but caused the very candles on the walls to wink  if we could only have had big otter repeated lumley to dance at our wedding  but it is of no use to sigh after the impossible  the days of miracles are over and  as he spoke the hall door slowly opened and a sight appeared which not only bereft the speaker of speech but for a few minutes absolutely petrified all the rest of the company  it was the face and figure of a mantall gaunt and worn  now good reader as lumley said without very good authority the days of miracles are over yet i venture to think that many events in this life do so much resemble miracles that we could not distinguish them from such unless the keys to their solution were given to us  i give you the key to the supposed miracle now in hand by asking you to accompany me deep into the wildwoods and backward in time to about an hour before noon of the day preceding christmas  it is a tangled shady spot to which i draw attention the snowfloor of which is overarched by dark pinebranches and surrounded by walls of willows and other shrubs  there is a somewhat open circular space in the centre of the spot into which an indian on snowshoes strode at the hour mentioned even his most intimate friends might have failed at a first glance to recognise big otter for he was at the time very near the close of a long hard wearisome journey during the course of which he had experienced both danger and privation  latterly he had conceived an idea which he had striven with all his powersand they were not smallto carry out  it was neither more nor less than to arrive in time to spend christmas day with his friends at fort wichikagan  but to accomplish this feat commencing at the time he conceived it required that the indian should travel without fail upwards of forty miles every day  this on snowshoes could only be done by a very hercules and that only for a few days at a stretch  big otter knew his powers of endurance and had carried out his resolve nearly to completion when a storm arose so fierce with temperature so bitterly cold that he could not force against it and thus lost the greater part of a day  still the thing was not impossible and as the difficulties multiplied our indians resolve to conquer increased  in this state of mind and much worn and fagged in body with soiled and rent garments that told of weeks upon weeks of toil he entered the circle or open space before referred to and coming to a stand rested the butt of his gun on one of his snowshoes heaved a deep sigh and looked round as if undecided how to act  but big otters periods of indecision never lasted long  being naturally of a sociable turn of mind he partially revealed his mental condition by low mutterings which i take leave to translate  yes i can do it  the palefaces are pleasant men pleasanter at christmastime than at other times  they love song and big otter loves to hear song though he does not love to do it  men do not love to try what they cannot do  the palefaces have much food too on christmas day and much goodwill  big otter loves both the goodwill and the food especially that round thing they are so fond ofplumpuddinn they call it  they dance much also  dancing gives not much joy though big otter can do some of itbut plumpuddinn is glorious  waugh  i will do it  having communed with himself thus far the indian leaned his gun against a tree flung down his provisionbag took off his snowshoes cleared away the snow kindled a fire spread his bed of pinebrush and his blanket above itand in short went through the usual process of encamping  it was early in the day to encamp but there was only one way in which our indian could hope to partake of the plumpuddinn and that was to walk a little over fifty miles at one stretch  that distance still lay between him and fort wichikagan and it had to be traversed within fourteen and fifteen hoursincluding rests and food  to prepare himself for the feat big otter drew from his wallet an enormous mass of venison which he roasted and consumed  then he filled a small portable kettle with snow which with the aid of a fierce fire he soon converted into tea  you see our indian was becoming civilised by intercourse with palefaces and rather luxurious for he carried tea and sugar on this journey  he did not deem butter a necessity but could afford to dispense with that because of having the remains of a rogan or birch basket of bears grease unscented of course which he had reserved at the end of his fall hunt  the meal or rather the gorging over big otter rolled himself head and feet in a blanket pillowed his head on the provisionwallet and suddenly went to sleep  hour after hour passed but not the slightest motion was perceptible in that recumbent figure save the slow regular rise and fall of the deep chest  the shortlived sun of winter soon passed its zenith and began to decline towards its early couch in the west but still the sleeper lay motionless like a log  at last the shades of early evening began to fall and then big otter awoke  he rose at once stretched himself with a sort of awful energy rolled up his blanket put on his snowshoes caught up wallet and gun and set off on his journey  to see a strong man stride over the land on snowshoes is a grand sight at any time but to see big otter do it on this occasion would have been worth a long journey  with his huge and weighty frame and his mighty stride he made nothing of small obstacles and was but little affected by things that might have retarded ordinary mortals  small bushes went down before him like grass larger ones he turned aside and thick ones he went crashing through like an african elephant through jungle while the fine frosted snow went flying from his snowshoes right and left there was no hesitancy or wavering as to direction or pace  the land he was acquainted with every inch  reserve force he knew lay stored in every muscle and he was prepared to draw it all out when fatigue should tell him that revenue was expended and only capital remained  as the sun went down the moon rose up  he had counted on this and on the fact that the land was comparatively open  yet it was not monotonous  now he was crossing a stretch of prairie at top speed anon driving through a patch of woodland  here he went striding over the surface of a frozen river or breasting the slope of a small hill  as the night wore on he tightened his belt but did not halt to do so  once or twice he came to a goodsized lake where all impediments vanished off went the snowshoes and away he went over the marble surface at a slow trotslow in appearance though in reality quicker than the fastest walk  then the moon went down and the grey light of morningchristmas morningdawned  still the redman held on his way unchanged apparently unchangeable  when the sun was high he stopped suddenly beside a fallen tree cleared the snow off it and sat down to eat  he did not sit long and the breakfast was a cold one  in a few minutes the journey was resumed  the indian was drawing largely on his capital now but looking at him you could not have told it  by a little after six oclock that evening the feat was accomplished and as i have said big otter presented himself at a critical moment to the wonderstricken eyes of the wedding guests  did they make much of him you ask  i should think they did  did they feed him  of course they didstuffed him to repletionset him down before the massive ruins of the plumpuddinn and would not let him rise till the last morsel was gone  moreover when big otter discovered that he had arrived at fort wichikagan not only on christmas day but on chief lumleys weddingday his spirit was so rejoiced that his strength came back again unimpaired like sampsons and he danced that night with the palefaces till the small hours of the morning to the strains of a piginitsagonies fiddle during which process he consumed several buckets of hot tea  he went to rest at last on a buffalo robe in a corner of the hall in a state of complete exhaustion and perfect felicity    chapter twenty eight  the wilderness againnew plans mootedtreacherous ice and a brave rescue  the wellknown disinclination of time and tide to wait for any man holds good in the wilderness of the great norwest as elsewhere  notwithstanding the momentous events which took place at fort wichikagan and in colorado as detailed in preceding chapters the winter passed away as usual spring returned and the voice of the greygoose and plover began once more to gladden the heart of exiled man  jack lumley sat on a rustic chair in front of the hall gazing with wistful eyes at the still icecovered lake and occasionally consulting an open letter in his hand with frowning looks of meditation  the sweet voice of jessie lumley came from the interior of the hall trilling a tuneful highland air which sweeping over the lawn and lake mingled with the discords of the plover and geese thus producing a species of wildwood harmony  peter macnabwho since the memorable day when the table became a splitcamel under his weight had been to the mountain fort and got back again to wichikagancame up sat down on a bench beside his brotherinlaw and saidshall i become a prophet  perhaps youd better not macnab  it is not safe to sail under false colours or pretend to powers which one does not possess  but what if i feel a sort of inspiration which convinces me that i do possess prophetic powers at least to some extent  then explode and relieve yourself by all means said lumley  you have read that letter resumed macnab at least fifty times if you have read it once  if you had said that i had read it a hundred and fifty times returned lumley you would have been still under the mark  just so  and you have meditated over it and dreamed about it and talked it over with your wife at least as many timesif not more  your claim to rank among the prophets is indisputable macnabat least as regards the past  what have you got to say about the future  the future is as clear to me my boy as yonder sun which gleams in the pools that stud the ice on lake wichikagan  i am afraid brotherinlaw returned lumley with a pitiful smile that your intellects are sinking to a par with those of the geese which fly over the pools referred to  listen resumed the highlander with a serious air that was unusual in him  i read the future thus  you have already as i am aware sent in your resignation  well you will not only quit the service of the hbc but you will go and join your friend maxby in colorado you will become a farmer and worst of all you will take my dear sister with you  in some respects said lumley also becoming serious you are right i have made up my mind that god willing i shall quit the servicenot that i find fault with it very much the reverse but it is too much of a life of exile and solitude to my dear jessie  i will also go to colorado and join maxby but i wont take your sister from you  i will take you with me brotherinlaw if you will consent to go and we shall all live together  what say you  macnab shook his head sadly  you forget my boy that your case is very different from mine  you have only just reached the end of your second term of service and are still a youth  whereas i am a commissioned officer of the fur trade with a fairish income besides being an elderly man and not very keen to throw all up and begin life over again  there was much in what macnab said yet not so much but that lumley set himself with all his powers of suasion and suavity to induce his brotherinlaw to change his mind  but lumley had yet to learn that no power of saxon logic or personal influence can move the will of a man from beyond the grampian range who has once made up his mind  when all was said macnab still shook his head and smiled regretfully  its of no use wasting your breath my boybut tell me is jessie anxious for this change  she is anxious  she naturally pines for female societythough she did not say so until i urged her solemnly to tell me all her mind  and she is right  it is not good for woman any more than for man to be alone and when i am away on these long expeditionstaking the furs to the depot searching out the indians hunting etceterashe is left unavoidably alone  i have felt this very strongly and that was why as you know i had made up my mind during the winter and written to the governor and council that as my time had expired i meant to retire this spring  yes boy i know returned macnab  i foresaw all this even long before you began to move in the matter and i also took steps with a view to contingencies  you know that i am entitled to a years furlough this spring  well i wrote during the winter to say that i intended to avail myself of it  now then this is what i intend to do  when you retire and go off to the states i will go with you on leave of absence  we wont lose time by the way for you may depend on it that maxby will not delay his wedding longer than he can help  fortunately his old father wont be able to wind up his affairs in england and set off to colorado quite as quickly as the son expects so that will help to delay matters and thus though we can hardly expect to be in time for the wedding we will at least be time enough to claim a revival and extension of the festivities  then you know big otter  aye what of him asked lumley seeing that macnab paused  well i think we may prevail on him to go with us as our guide till we reach the civilised world after which we can take him in charge turn the tables as it wereand guide him to sunny creek  yesor send him on in advance of us through the wood in a straight line like the swallow to announce our approach  at this point jessie who had been busy with the household bread came to the door with a face radiant from the combined effect of hard work and happiness  what is the subject of all this earnest conversation jack she asked pulling down the sleeves that had been tucked up above her elbows  ask your brother jess said lumley rising  i shall have time before supper to pay a visit to big otter on a matter of some importance  he passed into the house to take up his gun and powderhorn while jessie sat down on the rustic chair and her brother returned to the subject that had been interrupted  now there occurred that afternoon an event which might have put a final and fatal termination to the plans which had just been so eagerly discussed  i have said that spring was so far advanced at that time that pools of water were formed on the ice of lake wichikagan  the heat which caused these had also the effect of softening the snow in the woods so as to render walking in snowshoes very laborious  as walking without them however was impossible lumley had no other course left than to put them on and plod away heavily through the deep and pasty snow  big otter at that time occupied the important position of hunter to the establishment  he supplied it with fresh meat and dwelt in a small wigwam about six miles distant from the fort on the borders of a little lakelittle at least for that region but measuring somewhat over three miles in diameter  he also for his own advantage and recreation carried on the business of a trapper and had that winter supplied many a silver fox and marten to the furstores at wichikagan  when lumley set out to visit the chief he knew that there was a possibility of his being out after deer but in that case he meant to await his arrival at least until nightfall and then he could leave a hieroglyphic message which the indian would understand requiring his immediate presence at the fort  in any case lumley thought nothing of a twelvemile walk even though the snow was soft and deep  nothing worthy of notice occurred until he reached the lake abovementioned on the borders of which he halted  looking across the bay on the other side of which the hunters wigwam stood he could discern among the pines and willows the orangecoloured birchbark of which it was made but no wreath of blue smoke told of the presence of the hunter  hm not at home muttered lumley who then proceeded to debate with himself the propriety of venturing to cross the bay on the ice  now it must be told that ice on the north american lakes becomes exceedingly dangerous at a certain period of spring for retaining much of its winter solidity of appearance and indeed much of its winter thickness it tempts men to venture on it when in reality it has become honeycombed and rotten  ice of this kindno matter how thick it beis prone to give way without any of those friendly cracks and rends and other warnings peculiar to the new ice of autumn and instead of giving way in angular cakes it suddenly slides down letting a man through to the water by opening a hole not much larger than himself of course lumley was well aware of this dangerhence the debate with himself or rather with his judgment  it looks solid enough said lumley  looks are deceptive said his judgment  then its rather early yet for the ice to have become quite rotten said lumley  so everyone goes on saying every spring till some unfortunate loses his life and teaches others wisdom said judgment besides youre a heavy man  and it is a tremendous long way round by the shorenearly four times the distance murmured lumley  what of that in comparison with the risk you run remarked judgment growing impatient  ill venture it said the man sternly  youre a fool cried the other getting angry  it is surprising with what equanimity a man will stand insulting language from himself  with something like a contemptuous smile on his lips lumley took off his snowshoes and set off to cross the bay  as he had anticipated he found it as firm as a rock  the surface indeed had a dark wet look about it and there were various pools here and there which he carefully avoided but there was no other indication of danger until he had got threequarters of the way across  then without an instants warning the mass of ice on which he stood dropped below him like a trapdoor and left him struggling in a compound of ice and water  the first shock of the cold water on his robust frame was to give it a feeling of unusual strength  with a sharp shout caused by the cold rather than alarm he laid both hands on the edge of the ice and springing like an acrobat out of the water to his waist fell with his chest on the still sound ice but it was not long sound  his convulsive grip and heavy weight broke it off and down he sank again over head and ears  it is not easy to convince a very powerful man that he may become helpless  lumley rose and with another herculean grip laid hold of the edge of the ice  his mind had not yet fully admitted that he was in absolute danger  he had only been recklessly vigorous at the first attempt to get outthat was allnow he would exercise caution  with the coolness that was natural to himincreased perhaps by the coolness of the waterhe again laid his hands on the edge of the ice but he did not try to scramble upon it  he had been a practised gymnast at school  many a time had he got into a boat from deep water while bathing and he knew that in such an effort one is hampered by the tendency ones legs have to get under the boat and prevent actioneven as at that moment his legs were attempting to go under the ice adopting therefore his old plan and keeping his hands on the edge of the ice he first of all paddled backwards with his legs until he got himself into a quite perpendicular position so that when he should make the spring there would be no fear of retarding his action by scraping against the ice with his chest  while in this position he let himself sink to the very lipsnay even lowerand then acting with arms and legs at the same moment he shot himself full half his length out of the water  the whole process was well calculated for by sinking so deeply before the spring he thus made use of the buoyancy of water and rendered less pressure with his hands on the ice needful  but although he thus avoided breaking the ice at first he could not by any device lessen the weight of his fall upon it  again the treacherous mass gave way and once more he sank into the cold lake  cold far more than exertion tells on a man in such circumstances  a feeling of exhaustion such as poor lumley had never felt before came over him  god help me he gasped with the fervour that comes over men when in the hour of their extremity  death seemed at last evidently to confront him and with the energy of a brave man he grappled and fought him  again and again he tried the faithless ice each time trying to recall some device in athletics which might help him but always with the same result  then still clinging to life convulsively he prayed fervently and tried to meet his fate like a man  this effort is probably more easy on the battlefield with the vital powers unexhausted and the passions strong  it was not so easy in the lone wilderness with no comrades voice to cheer with the cold gradually benumbing all the vital powers and with life slipping slowly away like an unbelievable dream  the desire to live came over him so strongly at times that again and yet again he struggled back from the gates of the dark valley by the mere power of his will and renewed his fruitless efforts and when at last despair took possession of him from the depths of his capacious chest he gave vent to that    bubbling cry   of some strong swimmer in his agony  sleeping soundly in his wigwam big otter heard the cry  our indian was not the man to start up and stare and wonder and wait for a repetition of any cry  like the deer which he had so often roused he leaped up bounded through the doorway of his tent and grasped gun and snowshoes  one glance sufficed to show him the not far distant hole in the ice  dropping the gun he thrust his feet into the snowshoes and went off over the ice at racing speed  the snowshoes did not impede him much and they rendered the run over the ice less dangerous  probably lumley would not have broken through if he had used his snowshoes because of the larger surface of ice which they would have covered  to come within a few yards of the hole slide to the edge of it on his chest with both snowshoes spread out under that by way of diffusing his weight over as much surface as possible was the work of only a few minutes  but by that time the perishing man was almost incapable of helping himself  the great difficulty that the rescuer experienced was to rouse lumley once more to action for the torpor that precedes death had already set in and to get on his knees on the edge of the ice so as to have power to raise his friend would only have resulted in the loss of his own life as well  to make sure that he should not let go his hold and slip big otter tied the end of his long worsted belt round his friends right wrist  now he said earnestly try once more  too latetoo late  god bless you big he stopped and his eyes closed  no cried the indian vehemently giving the perishing mans head a violent shakethen putting his mouth close to his ear added in a deep tonenot too late for the master of life to save  think  the darkhaired paleface waits for you  this was a judicious touch  the energy which could not be aroused by any consideration of self was electrified by the thought of the waiting wife  lumley made one more desperate effort and once again cried to god for help  both acts contributed to the desired end and were themselves an answer to the prayer of faith  mysterious connection  hope revived and the vital fluid received a fresh impulse  in the strength of it lumley raised himself so far out of the water that the indian was able to drag half his body on the ice but the legs still hung down creeping back a few feet the indian still lying flat on his face cut a hole in the ice with his hatchet into which he stuck his toe and seized hold of the end of his worsted belt  thats right said his friend faintlywait  big otter knew that full consciousness had returned  he waited while lumley gently paddling with his legs got them into a horizontal position  now cried lumley  the indian pulledsoftly at first then vigorously and lumley slid fairly on the ice  the rest though still dangerous was easy  in a few minutes more the redman had the paleface stripped beside a rousing fire in the wigwamand thus he brought him back to life from the very gates of death  you have saved me my good friend said lumley when he began to recover  the great master of life saved you returned the indian  he made use of mefor which i thank him  it was not until late on the following day that lumley felt strong enough to return to the fort and relate what had occurred  then the plans for the future were laid before big otter and to the satisfaction of all parties he agreed at once to fall in with them  but said he big otter will not stay  he loves the great wilderness too well to be content to live among the wooden wigwams of the palefaces  well we wont bother ourselves on that point just now said macnab and so as thats comfortably settled ill pack up and away back to my mountain fort to get ready for a trip with you and lumley and jessie to colorado    chapter twenty nine  the last  once more i change the scene from the wild regions of the north to the little less wild lands of colorado  on a certain bright forenoon in autumn i stood in the doorway of sunny creek cottage watching a clumsy vehicle as it laboured slowly up the hill  i was alone that day old mrs liston eve and aunt temple having gone off in the waggon for a long drive to visit a relative with hunting proclivities who had built himself a loghut in a ravine of the neighbouring mountains that he might be in closer proximity to the bears and deer  with some curiosity i approached the lumbering machine to assist the occupant who seemed unable or too impatient to open the door  it was a stiff door and swung open with a jerk which caused the occupants hat to fall off and reveal a bald head  father  i gasped  punch my boy  the dear old man tripped in his haste to get down plunged into my bosom threw his arms round my neck to save himself and almost bore me to the ground  neither of us being demonstrative in our affections this unpremeditated not to say unintentional embrace i felt to be quite touching  my father obviously resolved to make the most of his opportunities for he gave me a thoroughly exhaustive hug before releasing me  iididnt mmean said my father blazing with excitement and gasping with a mingled tendency to laugh and weep didnt mean to come it quite so strong ppunch my boy bbut youll make allowance for a momentary weakness  im getting an old man punch  what makes you grin so you backwoods koonisquat  the last sentence with its opprobrious epithet coined on the spot was addressed with sudden asperity to the driver of the clumsy vehicle who was seated on his box with mouth expanded from ear to ear  wall stranger if you will insist on knowin said he its sympathy that makes me grin  i do like to see human natur out of its gotomeetin togs with its saddle off an no bridal on spurtin around in gushin simplicity  but youre wrong stranger continued the driver with a grave look quite wrong in callin me a koonisquat i have dropt in the social scale but i aint got quite so low as that i guess by a long chalk  well you compound of welshman and yankee be off and refresh yourself returned my father putting an extra dollar over and above his fare into the mans hand but dont consume it on your filthy firewater cocktails or ginslings or any other kind of slingtails if you must drink take it out in strong hot coffee  the man drove off still grinning and i hurried my father into the cottage where while i set before him a good luncheon he gave me a wildly rambling and interjectional account of his proceedings since the date of his last letter to me  but why did you take me by surprise in this way dear daddy why didnt you let me know you were coming  because i like to take people by surprise especially illdoing scapegraces likeby the way said my father suddenly laying down his knife and fork where is she  where is who  sheher of course thethe girl the hottentot the savage  oh george what an ass you are  if you mean eve sir said i she is away from homeand everybody else along with her  that comes of your taking people by surprise you see  nobody prepared to receive you nothing ready  no sheets aired even  well well punch my boy dont be sharp with your old father  i wont offend again  by the way he added quickly youre not married yet eh  no not yet  ah said my father with a sigh of relief as he resumed his knife and fork then theres the barest chance of a possibility that ifbut youve asked her to marry you eh  yes i have asked her  and she has accepted you  yes she has accepted me  i wrote all that to you long ago  ah said my father with a profound sigh of resignation then there is no chance of a possibility for if a man tries to win the affections of a girl and succeeds he is bound in honour to marry her even though he were the emperor of china and she aa hottentot  now punch i have made up my mind to like the girl even though she painted scarlet circles round her eyes and smeared her nose with skybluebut you must let your poor old father blow off the steam for you have been such aa donkeysuch a hasty impatient sentimental romantic idiot thatanother glass of that milk my boy  thankee where do you get it  beats english milk hollow  got it from one of our numerous cows daddy said i with a short laugh at this violent change of the subject and my eve made the butter  did she indeed  well im glad shes fit for even that small amount of civilised labour but you have not told me yet when i shall see her  that is a question i cannot exactly answer said i but you will at all events be introduced tonight to her fathers mother and her cousin whom we call aunt as well as to a young ladya miss waboosewho is staying with us at present  and now father i added come and well have a stroll round the farm  i dont expect the ladies back till evening  meanwhile i want you to do me a favour to humour what i may call a whim  if its not a very silly one punch ill do it though i have not much confidence in your wisdom now  it is simply that you should agree for this night only to pass yourself off for a very old friend of mine  you need not tell fibs or give a false name  you are a namesake you know  there are lots of maxbys in the world  weak my boy decidedly weak  theyll be sure to see through it and i wont be able to recollect not to call you punch  no matter  call me punch  ill tell them you are a very familiar old frienda sort of relation too which will account for the name  well well said my father with a smile of pity ill not object to humour your whim but its weakworthy of a man who could engage himself to a miserable redindian hottentot  this being finally settled and my father having been pretty well exhausted by his ramble round the farm i set him down on the rustic chair with a newspaper and left him saying that i should be back in an hour or so  i knew the road by which the waggon was to return walked along it several miles and then waited  soon it drove up to the spot where i stood  they were surprised to see me but more surprised when i ordered the ladies to get out and walk with me while the coachman drove on slowly in advance  then i hurriedly told of my fathers arrival and explained more fully than i had yet ventured to do his misconceptions and prejudices as to eve  now i want you all said i to help me to remove these prejudices and misconceptions as quickly as possible by falling in with my little plans  hereupon i explained that my father was to be introduced as an old friend and namesake while eve was to be presented to him as a visitor at the cottage named miss waboose  i had feared that old mrs liston would not enter into my plan but found that on the contrary having a strong sense of humour she quite enjoyed the notion of it  so did aunt temple but eve herself felt doubtful of her ability to act out her part  i had no doubt on that point for she had undertaken it and well did i know that whatever eve undertook she could and would accomplish  it might be tedious to recount in detail the scenes that followed  the dear old man was charmed with miss wabooseas i had fully expectedand miss waboose was more than charmed with the dear old man  so that when we bade the ladies goodnight he kissed her fair forehead with quite fatherly tenderness  when i conducted the old man to his room i was struck and made quite anxious by the disconsolate expression of his face and asked earnestly what was wrong  wrong he exclaimed almost petulantly  everythings wrong  more particularly you are wrong  oh george i cant get over it  to think that you are tied hard and fastirrevocablytoa redindian a painted savagea hottentot  it is tootoo bad  he kicked off one of his shoes so viciously at this point that it went straight into and smashed a lookingglass but he didnt seem to care a straw for that  he did not even condescend to notice it  and to think too he continued that you might have had that adorable young lady miss waboose whoin spite of her heathenish nameis the most charming artless modest young creature i ever saw oh  punch punch what a consummate idiot you have been  it was impossible to help laughing at my poor fathers comical expression of chagrin as he sat on the edge of his bed slapped his hands down on both knees and looked up in my face  excuse me daddy but what ground have you for supposing that miss waboose would accept me even if i were free to ask her hand  ground  why the ground that she is fond of you  any man with half an eye could see that by the way she looks at and speaks to you  of course you have not observed that  i trust my boy you are too honourable to have encouraged it  nevertheless it is a facta miserable tantalising exasperating facta maddening fact now that that hideous redindianhottentot stands in the way  that redindianhottentot said i unable any longer to cause my dear father so much pain does not stand in the way for i am happy to tell you that miss waboose and eve are one and the same person  come come punch returned my parent testily im in no humour for jesting  go away and let me get to bed and pillow my head on oblivion if possible  i do assure you reader that i had no slight difficulty in persuading my father that eve liston and waboose were really the same person  but the girls fair objected my father when the truth began to force an entrance  yespassing fair said i  and with blue eyes and golden hair said he  even so said i  no more like a savage than i am said my father  much less so said i  when at length he did take in the fact he flung his arms round my neck for the second time that day and did his best to strangle me  then under a sudden impulse he thrust me out into the passage and shut and locked the door  you wont pillow your head on oblivion now will you daddy  i asked through the keyhole  get away you deceiver was the curt reply  but surprises did not come singly at that time  call it a miracle or a coincidence or what you will it is a singular fact that on the very next day there arrived at sunny creek cottage four travellersnamely jack lumley the blackhaired paleface peter macnab and big otter  on beholding each other jessie lumley and eve liston uttering each a little shriek rushed into each others arms and straightway for the space of five minutes became a human amalgam  not too late i hope said lumley after the first excitement of meeting was over  too late for what said i  for the wedding of course said he  by no means  it is fixed for this day three weeks  goodjessie and i will have the knot tightened a little on the same day by the same man  wind and weather permitting said macnab with his wonted irreverence now maxby my boy take us into the house and introduce us to old mrs liston  but what splendid creature is this coming towards us  why thats aunt temple i whispered as she came forward  let me introduce you aunt to mr macnabthe jolly furtrader of whom you have heard me speak so often and so much  macnab made a profound obeisance and aunt temple returned a dignified bow expressing herself much pleased to make the acquaintance etcetera and saying that mrs liston being unable to come out to greet them was anxious that we should enter  particularly big otter said aunt temple turning to the grave chief for whom she has a very great regard  thus invited and specially complimented our tall indian stooped to enter the cottage door but not being accustomed to the wooden wigwams of the palefaces he did not stoop low enough struck his head against the top and rather damaged an eagles feather with which his hair was decorated  nothing almost could upset the dignity and imperturbable gravity of big otter  he stooped lower to conquer the difficulty and when inside drew himself up to his full height so that the eagles feather touched the ceiling and tickled up some flies that were reposing in fancied security there  glancing round till his black eyes caught sight of old mrs liston in a darkish corner on a sofa he stepped forward and stooping to grasp one of her small hands in both of his said tenderlywatchee  what cheerwhat cheer said the accommodating old lady responding to the salutation in kind  tell him george that im so happy to see once again the friend of my beloved william  big otter rejoices to meet again the mother of weeum replied the indian  and tell him said mrs listen that i hope he has now come to stay with us altogether  the indian smiled gravely and shook his head intimating that the question required consideration  when the other members of the party were introducedjessie and eve having been separated for the purposewe all adjourned to the verandah to interchange news  need it be said that we had much to hear and tell  i think not neither need the fact be enlarged on that we all retired late that night in a state of supreme felicity and mental exhaustion  there was one exception however as regards the felicity for mrs liston out of regard for the friend of her darling william insisted that big otter should occupy the best bedroom on the ground floor  the result was eminently unsatisfactory for big otter was not accustomed to best bedrooms  eve conducted the indian to his room  he cared nothing for his comfort and was prepared humbly to do whatever he was bid  he silently followed her and looked round the room with openmouthed wonder as she pointed to his bed and with a pleasant nod left him  resting his gun in a cornerfor he never parted with that weapon night or dayand laying his powderhorn and shotpouch on the ground he drew his tomahawk and scalpingknife and was about to deposit them beside the horn when his eye suddenly fell on a gigantic indian crouching as if on the point of springing on him  like lightning he sprang erect then an expression of intense humility and shame covered his grave features on discovering that a large mirror had presented him with a fulllength portrait of himself  a sort of pitiful smile curled his lip as he took off his hunting coat  being now in his ordinary sleeping costume he approached the bed but did not like the look of it  no wonder  besides being obviously too short it had white curtains with frills or flounces of some sort with various tags and tassels around and it did not look strong  he sat cautiously down on the side of it however and put one leg in  the sheets felt unpleasant to his naked foot but not being particular he shoved it in and was slowly letting himself down on one elbow when the bed creaked  this was enough  big otter was brave to rashness in facing known danger but he was too wise to risk his body on the unknown  drawing forth his leg he stood up again and glanced round the room  there was a small dressingtable opposite the bed beside it was the large glass which had given him such a surprise  further on a washhandstand with a towelrack beside it but there was no spot on which he could stretch his bulky frame save the middle of the floor  calmly he lay down on that having previously pulled off all the bedclothes in a heap and selected therefrom a single blanket  pillowing his head on a footstool he tried to sleep but the effort was vain  there was a want of aira dreadful silence as if he had been buried aliveno tinkling of water or rustling of leaves or roar of cataract  it was insupportable  he got up and tried to open the door but the handle was a mystery which he could not unriddle  there was a window behind the dressingtable  he examined that overturning and extinguishing the candle in the act  but that was nothing  the stars gave enough of light  fortunately the window was a simple cottage one which opened inwards with a pull  he put on his coat and belt resumed his arms and putting his long leg over the sill once more stood on his native soil and breathed the pure air  quietly gliding round the house he found a clump of bushes with a footpath leading through it  there he laid him down enveloped in one of mrs listons best blankets and there he was found next morning in tranquil slumber by our domestic when she went to milk the cows  before the three weeks were over peter macnab almost paralysed aunt temple by a cool proposal that she should exchange the civilised settlements for the wilderness and go back with him as mrs macnab to the mountain fort  the lady recovering from her semiparalytic affection agreed to the suggestion and thus peter macnab was according to his own statement set up for life  shall i dwell on the triple wedding  no  why worry the indulgent reader or irritate the irascible one by recounting what is so universally understood  there were circumstances peculiar no doubt to the special occasion  to eve and myself of course it was the most important day of our livesa day never to be forgotten and for which we could never be too thankful and my dear father pronounced it the happiest day of his life but i think he forgot himself a little when he said that  then old mrs liston saw but one face the whole evening and it was the face of willieshe saw it by faith through the medium of eves sweet countenance  but i must cut matters short  when all was over macnab said to his wife  now my dear we must be off at the end of one week  you see i have just one years furlough and part of it is gone already  the rest of it you and i must spend partly in the states partly in england and partly on the continent of europe so that we may return to the great norwest with our brains well stored with material for small talk during an eight or nine months winter  aunt macnab had no objection  accordingly that day week he and she bade us all goodbye and left us  big otter was to go with them part of the way and then diverge into the wilderness  he remained a few minutes behind the others to say farewell  you will come and settle beside us at last i hope said mrs liston squeezing the redmans hand  the indian stood gently stroking the arched neck of his magnificent horse in silence for a few moments  then he said in a low voice  big otters heart is with the palefaces but he cannot change the nature which has been given to him by the great master of life  he cannot live with the palefaces  he will dwell where his fathers have dwelt and live as his fathers have lived for he loves the great free wilderness  yet in the memory of his heart the mother of weeum will live and waboose and muxbee and the tall paleface chief who won the hearts of the redmen by his justice and his love  the darkhaired paleface too will never be forgotten  each year as it goes and comes big otter will come again to sunny creek about the time that the plovers whistle in the air  he will come and go till his blood grows cold and his limbs are frail  after that he will meet you all with weeum in the bright land of joy where the great master of life dwells for evermore  farewell  he vaulted on his steed at the last word and putting it to the gallop returned to his beloved wilderness in the great norwest  the end
