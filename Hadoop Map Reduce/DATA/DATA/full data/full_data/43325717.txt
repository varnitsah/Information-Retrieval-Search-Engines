43325717	the historical nights entertainment  first series   by rafael sabatini     preface  in approaching the historical nights entertainment i set myself the task of reconstructing in the fullest possible detail and with all the colour available from surviving records a group of more or less famous events i would select for my purpose those which were in themselves bizarre and resulting from the interplay of human passions and whilst relating each of these events in the form of a story i would compel that story scrupulously to follow the actual recorded facts without owing anything to fiction and i would draw upon my imagination if at all merely as one might employ colour to fill in the outlines which history leaves grey taking care that my colour should be as true to nature as possible for dialogue i would depend upon such scraps of actual speech as were chronicled in each case amplifying it by translating into terms of speech the paraphrases of contemporary chroniclers  such was the task i set myself i am aware that it has been attempted once or twice already beginning perhaps with the crimes celebres of alexandre dumas i am not aware that the attempt has ever succeeded this is not to say that i claim success in the essays that follow how nearly i may have approached successjudged by the standard i had set myselfhow far i may have fallen short my readers will discern i am conscious however of having in the main dutifully resisted the temptation to take the easier road to break away from restricting fact for the sake of achieving a more intriguing narrative in one instance however i have quite deliberately failed and in some others i have permitted myself certain speculations to resolve mysteries of which no explanation has been discovered of these it is necessary that i should make a full confession  my deliberate failure is the night of nuptials i discovered an allusion to the case of charles the bold and sapphira danvelt in macaulays history of englandquoted from an old number of the spectatorwhilst i was working upon the case of lady alice lisle there a similar episode is mentioned as being related of colonel kirke but discredited because known for a story that has a trick of springing up to attach itself to unscrupulous captains i set out to track it to its source and having found its first appearance to be in connection with charles the bolds german captain rhynsault i attempted to reconstruct the event as it might have happened setting it at least in surroundings of solid fact  my most flagrant speculation occurs in the night of hate but in defence of it i can honestly say that it is at least no more flagrant than the speculations on this subject that have become enshrined in history as facts in other words i claim for my reconstruction of the circumstances attending the mysterious death of giovanni borgia duke of gandia that it no more lacks historical authority than do any other of the explanatory narratives adopted by history to assign the guilt to gandias brother cesare borgia  in the cambridge modern history our most authoritative writers on this epoch have definitely pronounced that there is no evidence acceptable to historians to support the view current for four centuries that cesare borgia was the murderer  elsewhere i have dealt with this at length here let it suffice to say that it was not until nine months after the deed that the name of cesare borgia was first associated with it that public opinion had in the mean time assigned the guilt to a halfdozen others in succession that no motive for the crime is discoverable in the case of cesare that the motives advanced will not bear examination and that they bear on the face of them the stamp of having been put forward hastily to support an accusation unscrupulously political in purpose that the first men accused by the popular voice were the cardinal vicechancellor ascanio sforza and his nephew giovanni sforza tyrant of pesaro and finally that in matarazzos chronicles of perugia there is a fairly detailed account of how the murder was perpetrated by the latter  matarazzo i confess is worthy of no more credit than any other of the contemporary reporters of common gossip but at least he is worthy of no less and it is undeniable that in sforzas case a strong motive for the murder was not lacking  my narrative in the night of hate is admittedly a purely theoretical account of the crime but it is closely based upon all the known facts of incidence and of character and if there is nothing in the surviving records that will absolutely support it neither is there anything that can absolutely refute it  in the night of masquerade i am guilty of quite arbitrarily discovering a reason to explain the mystery of baron bjelkes sudden change from the devoted friend and servant of gustavus iii of sweden into his most bitter enemy that speculation is quite indefensible although affording a possible explanation of that mystery in the case of the night of kirk o field on the other hand i do not think any apology is necessary for my reconstruction of the precise manner in which darnley met his death the event has long been looked upon as one of the mysteries of historythe mystery lying in the fact that whilst the house at kirk o field was destroyed by an explosion darnleys body was found at some distance away together with that of his page bearing every evidence of death by strangulation the explanation i adopt seems to me to owe little to speculation  in the story of antonio perezthe night of betrayali have permitted myself fewer liberties with actual facts than might appear i have closely followed his own relacion which whilst admittedly a piece of special pleading must remain the most authoritative document of the events with which it deals all that i have done has been to reverse the values as perez presents them throwing the personal elements into higher relief than the political ones and laying particular stress upon the matter of his relations with the princess of eboli the night of betrayal is presented in the form of a story within a story of the containing story let me say that whilst to some extent it is fictitious it is by no means entirely so there is enough to justify most of it in the relaciori itself  the exceptions mentioned being made i hope it may be found that i have adhered rigorously to my purpose of owing nothing to invention in my attempt to flesh and clothe these few bones of history  i should add perhaps that where authorities differ as to motives where there is a conflict of evidence as to the facts themselves or where the facts admit of more than one interpretation i have permitted myself to be selective and confined myself to a point of view adopted at the outset  r s  london august 1917     contents       i  the night of holyrood              the murder of david rizzio       ii  the night of kirk o

holyroodthe murder of david rizzio  the tragedy of my lord darnleys life lay in the fact that he was a man born out of his proper stationa clown destined to kingship by the accident of birth and fortune by the blood royal flowing in his veins he could failing others have claimed succession to both the english and the scottish thrones whilst by his marriage with mary stuart he made a definite attempt to possess himself of that of scotland  the queen of scots enamoured for a season of the cleanlimbed grace and almost feminine beauty ladyfaced melville had called him once of this long lad of nineteen who came awooing her had soon discovered in matrimony his vain debauched shiftless and cowardly nature she had married him in july of 1565 and by michaelmas she had come to know him for just a lovely husk of a man empty of heart or brain and the knowledge transmuted affection into contempt  her natural brother the earl of murray had opposed the marriage chiefly upon the grounds that darnley was a catholic and with argyll chatellerault glencairn and a host of other protestant lords had risen in arms against his sovereign and her consort but mary had chased her rebel brother and his fellows over the border into england and by this very action taken for the sake of her worthless husband she sowed the first seeds of discord between herself and him it happened that stout service had been rendered her in this affair by the arrogant border ruffian the earl of bothwell partly to reward him partly because of the confidence with which he inspired her she bestowed upon him the office of lieutenantgeneral of the east middle and west marchesan office which darnley had sought for his father lennox that was the first and last concerted action of the royal couple estrangement grew thereafter between them and in a measure as it grew so did darnleys kingship hardly established as yetfor the queen had still to redeem her prenuptial promise to confer upon him the crown matrimonialbegin to dwindle  at first it had been the king and queen or his majesty and hers but by christmasfive months after the weddingdarnley was known simply as the queens husband and in all documents the queens name now took precedence of his whilst coins bearing their two heads and the legend hen et maria were called in and substituted by a new coinage relegating him to the second place  deeply affronted and seeking anywhere but in himself and his own shortcomings the cause of the queens now manifest hostility he presently conceived that he had found it in the influence exerted upon her by the seigneur daviethat piedmontese david rizzio who had come to the scottish court some four years ago as a starveling minstrel in the train of monsieur de morette the ambassador of savoy  it was rizzios skill upon the rebec that had first attracted marys attention later he had become her secretary for french affairs and the young queen reared amid the elegancies of the court of france grew attached to him as to a fellowexile in the uncouth and turbulent land over which a harsh destiny ordained that she should rule using his opportunities and his subtle italian intelligence he had advanced so rapidly that soon there was no man in scotland who stood higher with the queen when maitland of lethington was dismissed under suspicion of favouring the exiled protestant lords the seigneur davie succeeded him as her secretary and now that morton was under the same suspicion it was openly said that the seigneur davie would be made chancellor in his stead  thus the seigneur davie was become the most powerful man in scotland and it is not to be dreamt that a dour stiffnecked nobility would suffer it without demur they intrigued against him putting it abroad amongst other things that this foreign upstart was an emissary of the popes scheming to overthrow the protestant religion in scotland but in the duel that followed their blunt scotch wits were no match for his italian subtlety intrigue as they might his power remained unshaken and then at last it began to be whispered that he owed his high favour with the beautiful young queen to other than his secretarial abilities so that bedford wrote to cecil  what countenance the queen shows david i will not write for the honour due to the person of a queen  this bruit found creditindeed there have been ever since those who have believed itand as it spread it reached the ears of darnley because it afforded him an explanation of the queens hostility since he was without the introspection that would have discovered the true explanation in his own shortcomings he flung it as so much fuel upon the seething fires of his rancour and became the most implacable of those who sought the ruin of rizzio  he sent for ruthven the friend of murray and the exiled lordsexiled remember on darnleys own accountand offered to procure the reinstatement of those outlaws if they would avenge his honour and make him king of scots in something more than name  ruthven sick of a mortal illness having risen from a bed of pain to come in answer to that summons listened dourly to the frothing speeches of that silly lovely boy  no doubt youll be right about yon fellow davie he agreed sombrely and purposely he added things that must have outraged darnleys every feeling as king and as husband then he stated the terms on which darnley might count upon his aid  early next month parliament is to meet over the business of a bill of attainder against murray and his friends declaring them by their rebellion to have forfeited life land and goods ye can see the power with her o this foreign fiddler that it drives her so to attaint her own brother murray has ever hated davie knowing too much of what lies twixt the queen and him to her dishonour and master davie thinks so to make an end of murray and his hatred  darnley clenched teeth and hands tortured by the craftily administered poison  what then what is to do he cried  ruthven told him bluntly  that bill must never pass parliament must never meet to pass it you are her graces husband and king of scots  in name sneered darnley bitterly  the name will serve said ruthven in that name yell sign me a bond of formal remission to murray and his friends for all their actions and quarrels permitting their safe return to scotland and charging the lieges to convoy them safely do that and leave the rest to us  if darnley hesitated at all it was not because he perceived the irony of the situationthat he himself in secret opposition to the queen should sign the pardon of those who had rebelled against her precisely because she had taken him to husband he hesitated because indecision was inherent in his nature  and then he asked at last  ruthvens bloodinjected eyes considered him stonily out of a livid gleaming face  then whether you reign with her or without her reign you shall as king o scots i pledge myself to that and i pledge those others so that we have the bond  darnley sat down to sign the death warrant of the seigneur davie  it was the night of saturday the 9th of march  a fire of pine logs burned fragrantly on the hearth of the small closet adjoining the queens chamber suffusing it with a sense of comfort the greater by contrast with the cheerlessness out of doors where an easterly wind swept down from arthurs seat and moaned its dismal way over a snowclad world  the lovely goldenheaded young queen supped with a little company of intimates her natural sister the countess of argyll the commendator of holyrood beaton the master of the household arthur erskine the captain of the guard and one otherthat david rizzio who from an errant minstrel had risen to this perilous eminence a man of a swarthy illfavoured countenance redeemed by the intelligence that glowed in his dark eyes and of a body so slight and fragile as to seem almost misshapen his age was not above thirty yet indifferent health early privation and misfortune had so set their mark upon him that he had all the appearance of a man of fifty he was dressed with sombre magnificence and a jewel of great price smouldered upon the middle finger of one of his slender delicate hands  supper was at an end the queen lounged on a long seat over against the tapestried wall the countess of argyll in a tall chair on the queens left sat with elbows on the table watching the seigneur davies fine fingers as they plucked softly at the strings of a longnecked lute the talk which intimate and untrammelled had lately been of the child of which her majesty was to be delivered some three months hence was flagging now and it was to fill the gap that rizzio had taken up the lute  his harsh countenance was transfigured as he caressed the strings his soul absorbed in the theme of his inspiration very softlyindeed no more than tentatively as yethe was beginning one of those wistful airs in which his spirit survives in scotland to this day when suddenly the expectant hush was broken by a clash of curtainrings the tapestries that masked the door had been swept aside and on the threshold unheralded stood the tall stripling figure of the young king  darnleys appearance abruptly scattered the italians inspiration the melody broke off sharply on the single loud note of a string too rudely plucked  that and the silence that followed it irked them all conveying a sense that here something had been broken which never could be made whole again  darnley shuffled forward his handsome face was pale save for the two burning spots upon his cheekbones and his eyes glittered feveredly he had been drinking so much was clear and that he should seek the queen thus who so seldom sought her sober angered those intimates who had come to share her wellfounded dislike of him king though he might be in name into such contempt was he fallen that not one of them rose in deference whilst mary herself watched his approach with hostile mistrusting eyes  what is it my lord she asked him coldly as he flung himself down on the settle beside her  he leered at her put an arm about her waist pulled her to him and kissed her oafishly  none stirred all eyes were upon them and all faces blank after all he was the king and she his wife and then upon the silence ominous as the very steps of doom came a ponderous clanking tread from the anteroom beyond again the curtains were thrust aside and the countess of argyll uttered a gasp of sudden fear at the grim spectre she beheld there it was a figure armed as for a tourney in gleaming steel from head to foot girt with a sword the right hand resting upon the hilt of the heavy dagger in the girdle the helmets vizor was raised revealing the ghastly face of ruthvenso ghastly that it must have seemed the face of a dead man but for the blazing life in the eyes that scanned the company those questing eyes went round the table settled upon rizzio and seemed horribly to smile  startled disquieted by this apparition the queen half rose darnleys hindering arm still flung about her waist  whats this she cried her voice sharp  and then as if she guessed intuitively what it might portend she considered her husband with palefaced contempt  judas she called him flung away from his detaining arm and stood forth to confront that man in steel what seek ye here my lordand in this guise was her angry challenge  ruthvens burning eyes fell away before her glance he clanked forward a step or two flung out a mailed arm and with a hand that shook pointed to the seigneur davie who stood blankly watching him  i seek yon man he said gruffly let him come forth  he is here by my will she told him her anger mounting and so are not youfor which you shall be made to answer  then to darnley who sat hunched on the settle  what does this mean sir she demanded  whyhow should i know whywhy nothing he faltered foolishly  pray god that you are right said she for your own sake and you she continued addressing ruthven again and waving a hand in imperious dismissal be you gone and wait until i send for you which i promise you shall be right soon  if she divined some of the evil of their purpose if any fear assailed her yet she betrayed nothing of it she was finely tempered steel  but ruthven sullen and menacing stood his ground  let yon man come forth he repeated he has been here ower lang  over long she echoed betrayed by her quick resentment  aye ower lang for the good o scotland and your husband was the brutal answer  erskine of her guards leapt to his feet  will you begone sir he cried and after him came beaton and the commendator both echoing the captains threatening question  a smile overspread ruthvens livid face the heavy dagger flashed from his belt  my affair is not with any o ye but if ye thrust yersels too close upon my notice  the queen stepped clear of the table to intervene lest violence should be done here in her presence rizzio who had risen stood now beside her watching all with a white startled face and then before more could be said the curtains were torn away and half a score of men whose approach had passed unnoticed poured into the room first came morton the chancellor who was to be dispossessed of the great seal in rizzios favour after him followed the brutal lindsay of the byres kerr of faudonside blackbrowed brunston redheaded douglas and a halfdozen others  confusion ensued the three men of the queens household were instantly surrounded and overpowered in the brief sharp struggle the table was overturned and all would have been in darkness but that as the table went over the countess of argyll had snatched up the candlebranch and stood now holding it aloft to light that extraordinary scene rizzio to whom the sight of morton had been as the removal of his last illusion flung himself upon his knees before the queen frail and feeble of body and never a man of his hands he was hopelessly unequal to the occasion  justice madame he cried faites justice sauvez ma vie  fearlessly she stepped between him and the advancing horde of murderers making of her body a buckler for his protection white of face with heaving bosom and eyes like two glowing sapphires she confronted them  back on your lives she bade them  but they were lost to all sense of reverence even to all sense of decency in their blind rage against this foreign upstart who had trampled their scottish vanity in the dust george douglas without regard for her condition either as queen or womanand a woman almost upon the threshold of motherhoodclapped a pistol to her breast and roughly bade her stand aside  undaunted she looked at him with eyes that froze his triggerfinger whilst behind her rizzio grovelled in his terror clutching her petticoat thus until suddenly she was seized about the waist and half dragged halflifted aside by darnley who at the same time spurned rizzio forward with his foot  the murderers swooped down upon their prey kerr of faudonside flung a noose about his body and drew it tight with a jerk that pulled the secretary from his knees then he and morton took the rope between them and so dragged their victim across the room towards the door he struggled blindly as he went vainly clutching first at an overset chair then at a leg of the table and screeching piteously the while to the queen to save him and mary trembling with passion herself struggling in the arms of darnley flung an angry warning after them  if davies blood be spilt it shall be dear blood to some of you remember that sirs  but they were beyond control by now hounds unleashed upon the quarry of their hate out of her presence morton and douglas dragged him the rest of the baying pack going after them they dragged him screeching still across the antechamber to the head of the great stairs and there they fell on him all together and so wildly that they wounded one another in their fury to rend him into pieces the tattered body gushing blood from sixandfifty wounds was hurled from top to bottom of the stairs with a goldhilted daggerdarnleys in token of his participation in the deedstill sticking in his breast  ruthven stood forward from the group his reeking poniard clutched in his right hand a grin distorting his ghastly vulturine face then he stalked back alone into the royal presence dragging his feet a little like a man who is weary  he found the room much as he had left it save that the queen had sunk back to her seat on the settle and darnley was now standing over her whilst her people were still hemmed about by his own men without a by your leave he flung himself into a chair and called hoarsely for a cup of wine  marys white face frowned at him across the room  you shall yet drink the wine that i shall pour you for this nights work my lord and for this insolence who gave you leave to sit before me  he waved a hand as if to dismiss the matter it may have seemed to him frivolous to dwell upon such a trifle amid so much  its no frae lack o respect your grace he growled but frae lack o strength i am ill and i should ha been abed but for what was here to do  ah she looked at him with cold repugnance what have you done with davie  he shrugged yet his eyes quailed before her own  hell be out yonder he answered grimly evasive and he took the wine one of his followers proffered him  go see she bade the countess  and the countess setting the candlebranch upon the buffet went out none attempting to hinder her  then with narrowed eyes the queen watched ruthven while he drank  it will be for the sake of murray and his friends that you do this she said slowly tell me my lord what great kindness is there between murray and you that to save him from forfeiture you run the risk of being forfeited with him  what i have done he said i have done for others and under a bond that shall hold me scatheless  under a bond said she and now she looked up at darnley standing ever at her side and was the bond yours my lord  mme he started back i know naught of it  but as he moved she saw something else she leaned forward pointing to the empty sheath at his girdle  where is your dagger my lord she asked him sharply  my dagger ha how should i know  but i shall know she threatened as if she were not virtually a prisoner in the hands of these violent men who had invaded her palace and dragged rizzio from her side i shall not rest until i know  the countess came in white to the lips bearing in her eyes something of the horror she had beheld  what is it mary asked her her voice suddenly hushed and faltering  madamehe is dead murdered she announced  the queen looked at her her face of marble then her voice came hushed and tense  areyou sure  myself i saw his body madame  there was a long pause a low moan escaped the queen and her lovely eyes were filled with tears slowly these coursed down her cheeks something compelling in her grief hushed every voice and the craven husband at her side shivered as her glance fell upon him once more  and is it so she said at length considering him she dried her eyes then farewell tears i must study revenge she rose as if with labour and standing clung a moment to the tables edge a moment she looked at ruthven who sat glooming there dagger in one hand and empty winecup in the other then her glance passed on and came to rest balefully on darnleys face you have had your will my lord she said but consider well what i now say consider and remember i shall never rest until i give you as sore a heart as i have presently  that said she staggered forward the countess hastened to her and leaning upon her arm mary passed through the little door of the closet into her chamber  that night the common bell was rung and edinburgh roused in alarm bothwell huntly atholl and others who were at holyrood when rizzio was murdered finding it impossible to go to the queens assistance and fearing to share the secretarys fatefor the palace was aswarm with the murderers menatarmshad escaped by one of the windows the alarm they spread in edinburgh brought the provost and townsmen in arms to the palace by torchlight demanding to see the queen and refusing to depart until darnley had shown himself and assured them that all was well with the queen and with himself and what time darnley gave them this reassurance from a window of her room mary herself stood pale and taut amid the brutal horde that on this alarm had violated the privacy of her chamber while the ruffianly red douglas flashed his dagger before her eyes swearing that if she made a sound they would cut her into collops  when at last they withdrew and left her to herself they left her no illusions as to her true condition she was a prisoner in her own palace the anterooms and courts were thronged with the soldiers of morton and ruthven the palace itself was hemmed about and none might come or go save at the good pleasure of the murderers  at last darnley grasped the authority he had coveted he dictated forthwith a proclamation which was read next morning at edinburgh market crosscommanding that the nobles who had assembled in edinburgh to compose the parliament that was to pass the bill of attainder should quit the city within three hours under pain of treason and forfeiture  and meanwhile with poor rizzios last cry of justice still ringing in her ears mary sat alone in her chamber studying revenge as she had promised so that life be spared her justice she vowed should be donepunishment not only for that barbarous deed but for the very manner of the doing of it for all the insult to which she had been subjected for the monstrous violence done her feelings and her very person for the present detention and peril of which she was full conscious  her anger was the more intense because she never permitted it to diffuse itself over the several offenders ruthven who had insulted her so grossly douglas who had offered her personal violence the laird of faudonside morton and all the others who held her now a helpless prisoner she hew for no more than the instruments of darnley it was against darnley that all her rage was concentrated she recalled in those bitter hours all that she had suffered at his vile hands and swore that at whatever cost to herself he should yield a full atonement  he sought her in the morning emboldened by the sovereign power he was usurping confident that now that he showed himself master of the situation she would not repine over what was done beyond recall but would submit to the inevitable be reconciled with him and grant him perforcesupported as he now was by the rebellious lordsthe crown matrimonial and the full kingly power he coveted  but her reception of him broke that confidence into shards  you have done me such a wrong she told him in a voice of cold hatred that neither the recollection of our early friendship nor all the hope you can give me of the future could ever make me forget it jamais jamais je noublierai she added and upon that she dismissed him so imperiously that he went at once  she sought a way to deal with him groped blindly for it being as yet but half informed of what was taking place and whilst she groped the thing she sought was suddenly thrust into her land mary beaton one of the few attendants left her brought her word later that day that the earl of murray with rothes and some other of the exiled lords was in the palace the news brought revelation it flooded with light the tragic happening of the night before showed her how darnley was building himself a party in the state it did more than that she recalled the erstwhile mutual hatred and mistrust of murray and darnley and saw how it might serve her in this emergency  instantly she summoned murray to her presence with the message that she welcomed his return yet despite that message he hardly expectedconsidering what lay between themthe reception that awaited him at her hands  she rose to receive him her lovely eyes suffused with tears she embraced him kissed him and then nestling to him as if for comfort her cheek against his bearded face she allowed her tears to flow unchecked  i am punished she sobbedoh i am punished had i kept you at home murray you would never have suffered men to entreat me as i have been entreated  holding her to hint he could but pat her shoulder soothing her utterly taken aback and deeply moved too by this display of an affection for him that he had never hitherto suspected in her  ah mon dieu jamie how welcome you are to one in my sorrow she continued it is the fault of others that you have been so long out of the country i but require of you that you be a good subject to me and you shall never find me other to you than you deserve  and he shaken to the depths of his selfish soul by her tears her clinging caresses and her protestations of affection answered with an oath and a sob that no better or more loyal and devoted subject than himself could all scotland yield her  and as for this killing of davie he ended vehemently i swear by my souls salvation that i have had no part in it nor any knowledge of it until my return  i knowi know she moaned should i make you welcome else be my friend jamie be my friend  he swore it readily for he was very greedy of power and saw the door of his return to it opening wider than he could have hoped then he spoke of darnley begging her to receive him and hear what he might have to say protesting that the king swore that he had not desired the murder and that the lords had carried the matter out of his hands and much beyond all that he had intended  because it suited her deep purpose mary consented feigning to be persuaded she had realized that before she could deal with darnley and the rebel lords who held her a prisoner she must first win free from holyrood  darnley came he was sullen now mindful of his recent treatment and in fearnotwithstanding murrays reassuranceof further similar rebuffs she announced herself ready to hear what he might have to say and she listened attentively while he spoke her elbow on the carved arm of her chair her chin in her hand when he had done she sat long in thought gazing out through the window at the grey march sky at length she turned and looked at him  do you pretend my lord to regret for what has passed she challenged him  you tempt me to hypocrisy he said yet i will be frank as at an easter shrift since that fellow davie fell into credit and familiarity with your majesty you no longer treated me nor entertained me after your wonted fashion nor would you ever bear me company save this davie were the third can i pretend then to regret that one who deprived me of what i prized most highly upon earth should have been removed i cannot yet i can and do proclaim my innocence of any part or share in the deed that has removed him  she lowered her eyes an instant then raised them again to meet his own  you had commerce with these traitor lords she reminded him it is by your decree that they are returned from exile what was your aim in this  to win back the things of which this fellow davie had robbed me a share in the ruling and the crown matrimonial that was my right yet which you denied me that and no more i had not intended that davie should be slain i had not measured the depth of their hatred of that upstart knave you see that i am frank with you  aye and i believe you she lied slowly considering him as she spoke and he drew a breath of relief suspecting nothing of her deep guile and do you know why i believe you because you are a fool  madame he cried  she rose magnificently contemptuous  must i prove it you say that the crown matrimonial which i denied you is to be conferred on you by these lawless men believing that you signed their pardon and recall from exile ha you do not see my lord that you are no more than their tool their catspaw you do not see that they use you but for their ends and that when they have done with you they will serve you as they served poor davie no you see none of that which is why i call you a fool that need a womans wit to open wide your eyes  she was so vehement that she forced upon his dull wits some of the convictions she pretended were her own yet resisting those convictions he cried out that she was at fault  at fault she laughed let my memory inform your judgment when these lords with murray at their head protested against our marriage in what terms did they frame their protest they complained that i had set over them without consulting them one who had no title to it whether by lineal descent of blood by nature or by consent of the estates consider that they added rememberi repeat to you the very words they wrote and publishedthat while they deemed it their duty to endure under me they deemed it intolerable to suffer under you  she was flushed and her eyes gleamed with excitement she clutched his sleeve and brought her face close to his own looked deep and compellingly into his eyes as she continued  such was their proclamation and they took arms against me to enforce it to pull you down from the place to which i had raised you out of the dust yet you can forget it and in your purblind folly turn to these very men to right the wrongs you fancy i have done you do you think that men holding you in such esteem as that can keep any sort of faith with you do you think these are the men who are likely to fortify and maintain your title to the crown ask yourself and answer for yourself  he was white to the lips as much by her vehement pretence of sincerity as by the apparently irrefragable logic of her arguments she forced conviction upon him this brought a loathly fear in its train and the gates of his heart stood ever wide to fear he stepped aside to a chair and sank into it looking at her with dilating eyesa fool confronted with the likely fruits of his folly  thenthenwhy did they proffer me their help how can they achieve their ends this way  how do you still ask do you not see what a blind tool you have been in their crafty hands in name at least you are king and your signature is binding upon my subjects have you not brought them back from exile by one royal decree whilst by another you have dispersed the parliament that was assembled to attaint them of treason  she stepped close up to him and bending over him as he sat there crushed by realization she lowered her voice  pray god my lord that all their purpose with you is not yet complete else in their hands i do not think your life is to be valued at an appleparing you go the ways poor davie went  he sank his handsome head to his hands and covered his face a while he sat huddled there she watching him with gleaming crafty eyes at length he rallied he looked up tossing back the auburn hair from his white brow still fighting though weakly against persuasion it is not possible he cried they could not they could not  she laughed betwixt bitterness and sadness  trust to that she bade him yet look well at matters as they are already i am a prisoner here in these mens hands they will not let me go until their full purpose is accomplishedperhaps she added wistfully perhaps not even then  ah not that he cried out  even that she answered firmly but and again she grew vehement is it less so with you are you less a prisoner than i dye think you will be suffered to come and go at will she saw the increase of fear in him and then she struck boldly setting all upon the gamble of a guess i am kept here until i shall have been brought to such a state that i will add my signature to your own and so pardon one and all for what is done  his sudden start the sudden quickening of his glance told her how shrewdly she had struck home fearlessly then sure of herself she continued to that end they use you when you shall have served it you will but cumber them when they shall have used you to procure their security from me then they will deal with you as they have ever sought to deal with youso that you trouble them no more ali at last you understand  he came to his feet his brow gleaming with sweat his slender hands nervously interlocked  oh god he cried in a stifled voice  aye you are in a trap my lord yourself youve sprung it  and now you behold him broken by the terror she had so cunningly evoked he flung himself upon his knees before her and with upturned face and hands that caught and clawed at her own he implored her pardon for the wrong that in his folly he had done her in taking sides with her enemies  she dissembled under a mask of gentleness the loathing that his cowardice aroused in her  my enemies she echoed wistfully say rather your own enemies it was their enmity to you that drove them into exile in your rashness you have recalled them whilst at the same time you have so bound my hands that i cannot now help you if i would  you can mary he cried or else no one can withhold the pardon they will presently be seeking of you refuse to sign any remission of their deed  and leave them to force you to sign it and so destroy us both she answered  he ranted then invoking the saints of heaven and imploring her in their nameshe who was so wise and strongto discover some way out of this tangle in which his madness had enmeshed them  what way is there short of flight she asked him and how are we to fly who are imprisoned here you as well as myself alas darnley i fear our lives will end by paying the price of your folly  thus she played upon his terrors so that he would not be dismissed until she had promised that she would consider and seek some means of saving him enjoining him meanwhile to keep strict watch upon himself and see that he betrayed nothing of his thoughts  she left him to the chastening of a sleepless night then sent for him betimes on monday morning and bade him repair to the lords and tell them that realizing herself a prisoner in their hands she was disposed to make terms with them she would grant them pardon for what was done if on their side they undertook to be loyal henceforth and allowed her to resume her liberty  the message startled him but the smile with which she followed it was reassuring  there is something else you are to do she said if we are to turn the tables on these traitorous gentlemen listen and she added matter that begat fresh hope in darnleys despairing soul  he kissed her hands lowly now and obedient as a hound that had been whipped to heel and went below to bear her message to the lords  morton and ruthven heard him out but betrayed no eagerness to seize the opportunity  all this is but words that we hear growled ruthven who lay stretched upon a couch grimly suffering from the disease that was slowly eating up his life  she is guileful as the serpent morton added being bred up in the court of france she will make you follow her will and desire but she will not so lead us we hold her fast and we do not let her go without some good security of what shall follow  what security will satisfy you quoth darnley  murray and lindsay came in as he was speaking and morton told them of the message that darnley had brought murray moved heavily across to a windowseat and sat down he cleared a windowpane with his hand and looked out upon the wintry landscape as if the matter had no interest for him but lindsay echoed what the other twain had said already  we want a deal more than promises that need not be kept he said  darnley looked from one to the other of them seeing in their uncompromising attitude a confirmation of what the queen had told him and noting tooas at another time he might not have notedtheir utter lack of deference to himself their king  sirs he said i vow you wrong her majesty i will stake my life upon her honour  why so you may sneered ruthven but youll not stake ours  take what security you please and i will subscribe it  aye but will the queen wondered morton  she will i have her word for it  it took them the whole of that day to consider the terms of the articles that would satisfy them towards evening the document was ready and morton and ruthven representing all accompanied by murray and introduced by darnley came to the chamber to which her majesty was confined by the guard they had set upon her  she sat as if in state awaiting them very lovely and very tearful knowing that womans greatest strength is in her weakness that tears would serve her best by presenting her as if broken to their will  in outward submission they knelt before her to make the pretence of suing for the pardon which they extorted by force of arms and duress when each in his turn had made the brief pleading oration he had prepared she dried her eyes and controlled herself by obvious effort  my lords she said in a voice that quivered and broke on every other word when have ye ever found me bloodthirsty or greedy of your lands or goods that you must use me so and take such means with me ye have set my authority at naught and wrought sedition in this realm yet i forgive you all that by this clemency i may move you to a better love and loyalty i desire that all that is passed may be buried in oblivion so that you swear to me that in the future you will stand my friends and serve me faithfully who am but a weak woman and sorely need stout men to be my friends  for a moment her utterance was checked by sobs then she controlled herself again by an effort so piteous to behold that even the flintyhearted ruthven was moved to some compassion  forgive this weakness in me who am very weak for very soon i am to be brought to bed as you well know and i am in no case to offer resistance to any i have no more to say my lords since you promise on your side that you will put all disloyalty behind you i pledge myself to remit and pardon all those that were banished for their share in the late rising and likewise to pardon those that were concerned in the killing of seigneur davie all this shall be as if it had never been i pray you my lords make your own security in what sort you best please and i will subscribe it  morton proffered her the document they had prepared she conned it slowly what time they watched her pausing ever and anon to brush aside the tears that blurred her vision at last she nodded her lovely golden head  it is very well she said all is here as i would have it be between us and she turned to darnley give me pen and ink my lord  darnley dipped a quill and handed it to her she set the parchment on the little pulpit at her side then as she bent to sign the pen fluttered from her fingers and with a deep shuddering sigh she sank back in her chair her eyes closed her face piteously white  the queen is faint cried murray springing forward  but she rallied instantly smiling upon them wanly  it is naught it is past she said but even as she spoke she put a hand to her brow i am something dizzy my condition she faltered on a trembling note of appeal that increased their compassion and aroused in them a shame of their own harshness leave this security with me i will subscribe it in the morningindeed as soon as i am sufficiently recovered  they rose from their knees at her bidding and morton in the name of all professed himself full satisfied and deplored the affliction they had caused her for which in the future they should make her their amends  i thank you she answered simply you have leave to go  they departed well satisfied and counting the matter at an end they quitted the palace and rode to their various lodgings in edinburgh town murray going with morton  anon to maitland of lethington who had remained behind came one of the queens women to summon him to her presence he found her disposing herself for bed and was received by her with tearful upbraidings  sir she said one of the conditions upon which i consented to the will of their lordships was that an immediate term should be set to the insulting state of imprisonment in which i am kept here yet menatarms still guard the very door of my chamber and my very attendants are hindered in their comings and goings do you call this keeping faith with me have i not granted all the requests of the lords  lethington perceiving the justice of what she urged withdrew shamed and confused at once to remedy the matter by removing the guards from the passage and the stairs and elsewhere leaving none but those who paced outside the palace  it was a rashness he was bitterly to repent him on the morrow when it was discovered that in the night mary had not only escaped but had taken darnley with her accompanied by him and a few attendants she had executed the plan in which earlier that day she had secured her scared husbands cooperation at midnight they had made their way along the now unguarded corridors and descended to the vaults of the palace whence a secret passage communicated with the chapel through this and across the graveyard where lay the newly buried body of the siegneur daviealmost across the very grave itself which stood near the chapel door they had won to the horses waiting by darnleys orders in the open and they had ridden so hard that by five oclock of that tuesday morning they were in dunbar  in vain did the alarmed lords send a message after her to demand her signature of the security upon which she had duped them into counting prematurely  within a week they were in full flight before the army at the head of which the prisoner who had slipped through their hands was returning to destroy them too late did they perceive the arts by which she had fooled them and seduced the shallow darnley to betray them     ii the night of kirk o fieldthe murder of darnley   perhaps one of the greatest mistakes of a lifetime in which mistakes were plentiful was the hesitancy of the queen of scots in executing upon her husband darnley the prompt vengeance she had sworn for the murder of david rizzio  when rizzio was slain and she herself held captive by the murderers in her palace of holyrood whilst darnley ruled as king she had simulated belief in her husbands innocence that she might use him for her vengeful ends  she had played so craftily upon his cowardly nature as to convince him that morton ruthven and the other traitor lords with whom he had leagued himself were at heart his own implacable enemies that they pretended friendship for him to make a tool of him and that when he had served their turn they would destroy him  in his consequent terror he had betrayed his associates assisting her to trick them by a promise to sign an act of oblivion for what was done trusting to this the lords had relaxed their vigilance whereupon accompanied by darnley she had escaped by night from holyrood  hope tempering at first the rage and chagrin in the hearts of the lords she had duped they had sent a messenger to her at dunbar to request of her the fulfilment of her promise to sign the document of their security  but mary put off the messenger and whilst the army she had summoned was hastily assembling she used her craft to divide the rebels against themselves  to her natural brother the earl of murray to argyll and to all those who had been exiled for their rebellion at the time of her marriageand who knew not where they stood in the present turn of events since one of the objects of the murder had been to procure their reinstatementshe sent an offer of complete pardon on condition that they should at once dissociate themselves from those concerned in the death of the seigneur davie  these terms they accepted thankfully as well they might thereupon finding themselves abandoned by all meneven by darnley in whose service they had engaged in the murdermorton ruthven and their associates scattered and fled  by the end of that month of march morton ruthven lindsay of the byres george douglas and some sixty others were denounced as rebels with forfeiture of life and goods while one thomas scott who had been in command of the guards that had kept her majesty prisoner at holyrood was hanged drawn and quartered at the market cross  news of this reached the fugitives to increase their desperate rage but what drove the iron into the soul of the archmurderer ruthven was darnleys solemn public declaration denying all knowledge of or complicity in rizzios assassination nor did it soothe his fury to know that all scotland rang with contemptuous laughter at that impudent and cowardly perjury from his sickbed at newcastle whereon some six weeks later he was to breathe his last the forsaken wretch replied to it by sending the queen the bond to which he had demanded darnleys signature before embarking upon the business  it was a damning document there above the plain signature and seal of the king was the admission not merely of complicity but that the thing was done by his express will and command that the responsibility was his own and that he would hold the doers scatheless from all consequences  mary could scarcely have hoped to be able to confront her worthless husband with so complete a proof of his duplicity and baseness she sent for him confounded him with the sight of that appalling bond made an end to the amity which for her own ends she had pretended and drove him out of her presence with a fury before which he dared not linger  you see him then crushed under his load of mortification realizing at last how he had been duped on every hand first by the lords for their own purpose and then by the queen for hers her contempt of him was now so manifest that it spread to all who served himfor she made it plain that who showed him friendship earned her deep displeasureso that he was forced to withdraw from a court where his life was become impossible for a while he wandered up and down a land where every door was shut in his face where every man of whatsoever party traitor or true despised him alike in the end he took himself off to his father lennox and at glasgow he sought what amusement he could with his dogs and his hawks and such odd vulgar rustic loveaffairs as came his way  it was in allowing him thus to go his ways in leaving her vengeanceindeed her justicebut half accomplished that lay the greatest of the queens mistakes better for her had she taken with darnley the direct way that was her right better for her if acting strongly then she had banished or hanged him for his part in the treason that had inspired the murder of rizzio unfortunately a factor that served to quicken her abhorrence of him served also to set a curb of caution upon the satisfaction of it  this factor that came so inopportunely into her life was her regard for the arrogant unscrupulous earl of bothwell her hand was stayed by fear that men should say that for bothwells sake she had rid herself of a husband become troublesome that bothwell had been her friend in the hour when she had needed friends and knew not whom she might trust that by his masterfulness he seemed a man upon whom a woman might lean with confidence may account for the beginnings of the extraordinary influence he came so swiftly to exercise over her and the passion he awakened in her to such a degree that she was unable to dissemble it  her regard for him the more flagrant by contrast with her contempt for darnley is betrayed in the will she made before her confinement in the following june whilst to darnley she bequeathed nothing but the redenamelled diamond ring with which he had married herit was with this that i was married she wrote almost contemptuously i leave it to the king who gave it meshe appointed bothwell to the tutelage of her child in the event of her not surviving it and to the government of the realm  the king came to visit her during her convalescence and was scowled upon by murray and argyll who were at holyrood and most of all by bothwell whose arrogance by now was such that he was become the besthated man in scotland the queen received him very coldly whilst using bothwell more than cordially in his very presence so that he departed again in a deeper humiliation than before  then before the end of july there was her sudden visit to bothwell at alloa which gave rise to so much scandal hearing of it darnley followed in a vain attempt to assert his rights as king and husband only to be flouted and dismissed with the conviction that his life was no longer safe in scotland and that he had best cross the border yet to his undoing detained perhaps by the overweening pride that is usually part of a fools equipment he did not act upon that wise resolve he returned instead to his hawking and his hunting and was seldom seen at court thereafter  even when in the following october mary lay at the point of death at jedburgh darnley came but to stay a day and left her again without any assurance that she would recover but then the facts of her illness and how it had been contracted were not such as to encourage kindness in him even had he been inclined to kindness  bothwell had taken three wounds in a border affray some weeks before and mary hearing of this and that he lay in grievous case at hermitage had ridden thither in her fond solicitudea distance of thirty milesand back again in the same day thus contracting a chill which had brought her to the very gates of death  darnley had not only heard of this but he had found bothwell at jedburgh whither he had been borne in a litter when in his turn he had heard of how it was with mary and bothwell had treated him with more than the contempt which all men now showed him but which from none could wound him so deeply as from this man whom rumour accounted marys lover  matters between husband and wife were thus come to a pass in which they could not continue as all men saw and as she herself confessed at craigrnillar whither she repaired still weak in body towards the end of november  over a great fire that blazed in a vast chamber of the castle she sat sick at heart and shivering for all that her wasted body was swathed in a long cloak of deepest purple reversed with ermine her face was thin and of a transparent pallor her eyes great pools of wistfulness amid the shadows which her illness had set about them  i do wish i could be dead she sighed  bothwells eyes narrowed he was leaning on the back of her tall chair a long virile figure with a hawknosed bearded face that was sternly handsome he thrust back the crisp dark hair that clustered about his brow and fetched a sigh  it was never my own death i wished when a man stood in my road to aught i craved he said lowering his voice for maitland of lethingtonnow restored to his secretaryshipwas writing at a table across the room and my lord of argyll was leaning over him  she looked up at him suddenly her eyes startled  what devils counsel do you whisper she asked him and when he would have answered she raised a hand no she said not that way  there is another said bothwell coolly he moved came round and stood squarely upon the hearth his back to the fire confronting her nor did he further trouble to lower his voice we have considered it already  what have you considered  her voice was strained fear and excitement blended in her face  how the shackles that fetter you might be broken be not alarmed it was the virtuous murray himself propounded it to argyll and lethingtonfor the good of scotland and yourself a sneer flitted across his tanned face let them speak for themselves he raised his voice and called to them across the room  they came at once and the four made an odd group as they stood there in the firelit gloom of that november daythe lovely young queen so frail and wistful in her highbacked chair the stalwart arrogant bothwell magnificent in a doublet of peachcoloured velvet that tapered to a golden girdle argyll portly and sober in a rich suit of black and maitland of lethington lean and crafty of face in a long furred gown that flapped about his bony shanks  it was to lethington that bothwell addressed himself  her grace is in a mood to hear how the gordian knot of her marriage might be unravelled said he grimly ironic  lethington raised his eyebrows licked his thin lips and rubbed his bony hands one in the other  unravelled he echoed with wondering stress unravelled ha his dark eyes flashed round at them better adopt alexanders plan and cut it twill be more complete andand final  no no she cried i will not have you shed his blood  he himself was none so tender where another was concerned bothwell reminded heras if the memory of rizzio were dear to him  what he may have done does not weigh upon my conscience was her answer  he might put in argyll be convicted of treason for having consented to your graces retention in ward at holyrood after rizzios murder  she considered an instant then shook her head  it is too late it should have been done long since now men will say that it is but a pretext to be rid of him she looked up at bothwell who remained standing immediately before her between her and the fire you said that my lord of murray had discussed this matter was it in such terms as these  bothwell laughed silently at the thought of the sly murray rendering himself a party to anything so direct and desperate it was lethington who answered her  my lord murray was for a divorce that would set your grace free and it might be obtained he said by tearing up the popes bull of dispensation that permitted the marriage yet madame although lord murray would himself go no further i have no cause to doubt that were other means concerted he would be content to look through his fingers  her mind however did not seem to follow his speech beyond the matter of the divorce a faint flush of eagerness stirred in her pale cheeks  ah yes she cried i too have thought of thatof this divorce and god knows i do not want for grounds and it could be obtained you say by tearing up this papal bull  the marriage could be proclaimed void thereafter argyll explained  she looked past bothwell into the fire and took her chin in her hand  yes she said slowly musingly and again yes that were a way that is the way and then suddenly she looked up and they saw doubt and dread in her eyes but in that casewhat of my son  aye said lethington grimly he shrugged his narrow shoulders parted his hands and brought them together again thats the obstacle as we perceived it would imperil his succession  it would make a bastard of him you mean she cried demanding the full expansion of their thoughts  indeed it would do no less the secretary assented  so that said bothwell softly we come back to alexanders method what the fingers may not unravel the knife can sever  she shivered and drew her furred cloak the more closely about her  lethington leaned forward he spoke in kindly soothing accents  let us guide this matter among us madame he murmured and well find means to rid your grace of this young fool without hurt to your honour or prejudice to your son and the earl of murray will look the other way provided you pardon morton and his friends for the killing they did in darnleys service  she looked from one to the other of them scanning each face in turn then her eyes returned to a contemplation of the flaming logs and she spoke very softly  do nothing by which a spot might be laid on my honour or conscience she said with an odd deliberateness that seemed to insist upon the strictly literal meaning of her words rather i pray you let the matter rest until god remedy it  lethington looked at the other two the other two looked at him he rubbed his hands softly  trust to us madame he answered we will so guide the matter that your grace shall see nothing but what is good and approved by parliament  she committed herself to no reply and so they were content to take their answer from her silence they went in quest of huntly and sir james balfour and the five of them entered into a bond for the destruction of him whom they named the young fool and proud tiranne to be engaged in when mary should have pardoned morton and his fellowconspirators  it was not until christmas eve that she signed this pardon of some seventy fugitives proscribed for their participation in the rizzio murder towards whom she had hitherto shown herself so implacable  the world saw in this no more than a deed of clemency and charity befitting the solemn festival of goodwill but the five who had entered into that bond at craigmillar castle beheld in it more accurately the fulfilment of her part of the suggested bargain the price she paid in advance to be rid of darnley the sign of her full agreement that the knot which might not be unravelled should be cut  on that same day her grace went with bothwell to lord drummonds where they abode for the best part of a week and thence they went on together to tullibardine the rash and open intimacy between them giving nourishment to scandal  at the same time darnley quitted stirling where he had lately been living in miserable conditions ignored by the nobles and even stinted in his necessary expenses deprived of his ordinary servants and his silver replaced by pewter the miserable youth reached glasgow deadly sick he had been taken ill on the way and the inevitable rumour was spread that he had been poisoned later when it became known that his once lovely countenance was now blotched and disfigured it was realized that his illness was no more than the inevitable result of the debauched life he led  conceiving himself on the point of death darnley wrote piteously to the queen but she ignored his letters until she learnt that his condition was improving when at last on january 29th she went to visit him at glasgow it may well be that she nourished some hope that nature would resolve the matter for her and remove the need for such desperate measures as had been concerted but seeing him likely to recover two things became necessary to bring him to the place that was suitable for the fulfilment of her designs and to simulate reconciliation with him and even renewed and tender affection so that none might hereafter charge her with complicity in what should follow  i hope that in this i do her memory no injustice it is thus that i read the sequel nor can i read it in any other way  she found him abed with a piece of taffeta over his face to hide its disfigurement and she was so movedas it seemedby his condition that she fell on her knees beside him and wept in the presence of her attendants and his own confessing penitence if anything she had done in the past could have contributed to their estrangement thus reconciliation followed and she used him tenderly grew solicitous concerning him and vowed that as soon as he could be moved he must be taken to surroundings more salubrious and more befitting the dignity of his station  gladly then he agreed to return with her to holyrood  not to holyrood she said at least not until your health is mended lest you should carry thither infection dangerous to your little son  whither then he asked her and when she mentioned craigmillar he started up in bed so that the taffeta slipped from his face and it was with difficulty that she dissembled the loathing with which the sight of its pustules inspired her  craigmillar he cried then what i was told is true  what were you told quoth she staring at him brows knit her face blank  a rumour had filtered through to him of the craigmillar bond he had been told that a letter drawn up there had been presented to her for her signature which she had refused thus much he told her adding that he could not believe that she would do him any hurt and yet why did she desire to bear him to craigmillar  you have been told lies she answered him i saw no such letter i subscribed none nor was ever asked to subscribe any which indeed was literally true to this i swear as for your going to craigmillar you shall go whithersoever you please yourself  he sank back on his pillows and his trembling subsided  i believe thee mary i believe thould never do me any harm he repeated and if any other would he added on a bombastic note they shall buy it dear unless they take me sleeping but ill never to craigmillar  i have said you shall go where you please she assured him again  he considered  there is the house at kirk o field it has a fine garden and is in a position that is deemed the healthiest about edinburgh i need good air good air and baths have been prescribed me to cleanse me of this plague kirk o field will serve if it be your pleasure  she gave a ready consent dispatched messengers ahead to prepare the house and to take from holyrood certain furnishings that should improve the interior and render it as fitting as possible a dwelling for a king  some days later they set out his misgivings quieted by the tenderness which she now showed himparticularly when witnesses were at hand  it was a tenderness that grew steadily during those twelve days in which he lay in convalescence in the house at kirk o field she was playful and coquettish with him as a maid with her lover so that nothing was talked of but the completeness of this reconciliation and the hope that it would lead to a peace within the realm that would be a benefit to all yet many there were who marvelled at it wondering whether the waywardness and caprice of woman could account for so sudden a change from hatred to affection  darnley was lodged on the upper floor in a room comfortably furnished from the palace it was hung with six pieces of tapestry and the floor was partly covered by an eastern carpet it contained besides the handsome bedwhich once had belonged to the queens mothera couple of high chairs in purple velvet a little table with a green velvet cover and some cushions in red by the side of the bed stood the specially prepared bath that was part of the cure which darnley was undergoing it had for its incongruous lid a door that had been lifted from its hinges  immediately underneath was a room that had been prepared for the queen with a little bed of yellow and green damask and a furred coverlet the windows looked out upon the close and the door opened upon the passage leading to the garden  here the queen slept on several of those nights of early february for indeed she was more often at kirk o field than at holyrood and when she was not bearing darnley company in his chamber and beguiling the tedium of his illness she was to be seen walking in the garden with lady reres and from his bed he could hear her sometimes singing as she sauntered there  never since the ephemeral season of their courtship had she been on such fond terms with him and all his fears of hostile designs entertained against him by her immediate followers were stilled at last yet not for long into his fools paradise came lord robert of holyrood with a warning that flung him into a sweat of panic  the conspirators had hired a few trusted assistants to help them carry out their plans and a rumour had got abroadin the unaccountable way of rumoursthat there was danger to the king it was of this rumour that lord robert brought him word telling him bluntly that unless he escaped quickly from this place he would leave his life there yet when darnley had repeated this to the queen and the queen indignantly had sent for lord robert and demanded to know his meaning his lordship denied that he had uttered any such warning protested that his words must have been misunderstoodthat they referred solely to the kings condition which demanded he thought different treatment and healthier air  knowing not what to believe darnleys uneasiness abode with him yet trusting mary and feeling secure so long as she was by his side he became more and more insistent upon her presence more and more fretful in her absence it was to quiet him that she consented to sleep as often as might be at kirk o field she slept there on the wednesday of that week and again on friday and she was to have done so yet again on that fateful sunday february 9th but that her servant sebastienone who had accompanied her from france and for whom she had a deep affectionwas that day married and her majesty had promised to be present at the masque that night at holyrood in honour of his nuptials  nevertheless she did not utterly neglect her husband on that account she rode to kirk o field early in the evening accompanied by bothwell huntly argyll and some others and leaving the lords at cards below to while away the time she repaired to darnley and sat beside his bed soothing a spirit oddly perturbed as if with some premonition of what was brewing  yell not leave me the night he begged her once  alas she said i must sebastien is being wed and i have promised to be present  he sighed and shifted uneasily  soon i shall be well and then these foolish humours will cease to haunt me but just now i cannot bear you from my sight when you are with me i am at peace i know that all is well but when you go i am filled with fears lying helpless here  what should you fear she asked him  the hate that i know is alive against me  you are casting shadows to affright yourself said she  whats that he cried half raising himself in sudden alarm listen  from the room below came faintly a sound of footsteps accompanied by a noise as of something being trundled  it will be my servants in my roomputting it to rights  to what purpose since you do not sleep there tonight he asked he raised his voice and called his page  why what will you do she asked him steadying her own alarm  he answered her by bidding the youth who had entered go see what was doing in the room below the lad departed and had he done his errand faithfully he would have found bothwells followers hay and hepburn and the queens man nicholas hubert better known as french parisemptying a keg of gunpowder on the floor immediately under the kings bed but it happened that in the passage he came suddenly face to face with the splendid figure of bothwell cloaked and hatted and bothwell asked him whither he went  the boy told him  it is nothing bothwell said they are moving her graces bed in accordance with her wishes  and the lad overborne by that commanding figure which so effectively blocked his path chose the line of lesser resistance he went back to bear the king that message as if for himself he had seen what my lord bothwell had but told him  darnley was pacified by the assurance and the lad withdrew  did i not tell you how it was quoth mary is not my word enough  forgive the doubt darnley begged her indeed there was no doubt of you who have shown me so much charity in my affliction he sighed and looked at her with melancholy eyes  i would the past had been other than it has been between you and me he said i was too young for kingship i think in my green youth i listened to false counsellors and was quick to jealousy and the follies it begets then when you cast me out and i wandered friendless a devil took possession of me yet if you will but consent to bury all the past into oblivion i will make amends and you shall find me worthier hereafter  she rose white to the lips her bosom heaving under her long cloak she turned aside and stepped to the window she stood there peering out into the gloom of the close her knees trembling under her  why do you not answer me he cried  what answer do you need she said and her voice shook are you not answered already and then breathlessly she added it is time to go i think  they heard a heavy step upon the stairs and the clank of a sword against the rails the door opened and bothwell wrapped in his scarlet cloak stood bending his tall shoulders under the low lintel his gleaming eyes so oddly mocking in their glance for all that his face was set fell upon darnley and with their look flung him into an inward state of blending fear and rage  your grace said bothwells deep voice it is close upon midnight  he came no more than in time it needed the sight of him with its reminder of all that he meant to her to sustain a purpose that was being sapped by pity  very well she said i come  bothwell stood aside to give her egress and to invite it but the king delayed her  a momenta word he begged and to bothwell give us leave apart sir  yet king though he might be there was no ready obedience from the arrogant border lord her lover it was to mary that bothwell looked for commands nor stirred until she signed to him to go and even then he went no farther than the other side of the door so that he might be close at hand to fortify her should any weakness assail her now in this supreme hour  darnley struggled up in bed caught her hand and pulled her to him  do not leave me mary do not leave me he implored her  why what is this she cried but her voice lacked steadiness would you have me disappoint poor sebastien who loves me  i see sebastien is more to you than i  now this is folly sebastien is my faithful servant  and am i less do you not believe that my one aim henceforth will be to serve you and faithfully oh forgive this weakness i am full of evil foreboding tonight go then if go you must but give me at least some assurance of your love some pledge of it in earnest that you will come again tomorrow nor part from me again  she looked into the white piteous young face that had once been so lovely and her soul faltered it needed the knowledge that bothwell waited just beyond the door that he could overhear what was being said to strengthen her fearfully in her tragic purpose  she has been censured most for what next she did murray himself spoke of it afterwards as the worst part of the business but it is possible that she was concerned only at the moment to put an end to a scene that was unnerving her and that she took the readiest means to it  she drew a ring from her finger and slipped it on to one of his  be this the pledge then she said and so content and rest yourself  with that she broke from him white and scared and reached the door yet with her hand upon the latch she paused looking at him she saw that he was smiling and perhaps horror of her betrayal of him overwhelmed her it must be that she then desired to warn him yet with bothwell within earshot she realized that any warning must precipitate the tragedy with direst consequences to bothwell and herself  to conquer her weakness she thought of david rizzio whom darnley had murdered almost at her feet and whom this night was to avenge she thought of the judas part that he had played in that affair and sought persuasion that it was fitting he should now be paid in kind yet very woman that she was failing to find any such persuasion she found instead in the very thought of rizzio the very means to convey her warning  standing tense and white by the door regarding him with dilating eyes she spoke her last words to him  it would be just about this time last year that davie was slain she said and on that passed out to the waiting bothwell  once on the stairs she paused and set a hand upon the shoulder of the stalwart borderer  must it be oh must it be she whispered fearfully  she caught the flash of his eyes in the half gloom as he leaned over her his arm about her waist drawing her to him  is it not just is it not full merited he asked her  and yet i would that we did not profit by it she complained  shall we pity him on that account he asked and laughed softly and shortly come away he added abruptly they wait for you and so by the suasion of his arm and his imperious will she was swept onward along the road of her destiny  outside the horses were ready there was a little group of gentlemen to escort her and half a dozen servants with lighted torches whilst lady reres was in waiting a man stood forward to assist her to mount his face and hands so blackened by gunpowder that for a moment she failed to recognize him she laughed nervously when he named himself  lord paris how begrimed you are she cried and mounting rode away towards holyrood with her torchbearers and attendants  in the room above darnley lay considering her last words he turned them over in his thoughts assured by the tone she had used and how she had looked that they contained some message  it would be just about this time last year that davie was slain  in themselves those words were not strictly accurate it wanted yet a month to the anniversary of rizzios death and why at parting should she have reminded him of that which she had agreed should be forgotten instantly came the answer that she sought to warn him that retribution was impending he thought again of the rumours that he had heard of a bond signed at craigmillar he recalled lord roberts warning to him afterwards denied  he recalled her words to himself at the time of rizzios death consider well what i now say consider and remember i shall never rest until i give you as sore a heart as i have presently and further he remembered her cry at once agonized and fiercely vengeful jamais jamais je noublierai  his terrors mounted swiftly to be quieted again at last when he looked at the ring she had put upon his finger in pledge of her renewed affection the past was dead and buried surely though danger might threaten she would guard him against it setting her love about him like a panoply of steel when she came tomorrow he would question her closely and she should be more frank and open with him and tell him all meanwhile he would take his precautions for tonight  he sent his page to make fast all doors the youth went and did as he was bidden with the exception of the door that led to the garden it had no bolts and the key was missing yet seeing his masters nervous excited state he forbore from any mention of that circumstance when presently he returned to him  darnley requested a book of psalms that he might read himself to sleep the page dozed in a chair and so the hours passed and at last the king himself fell into a light slumber out of this he started suddenly at a little before two oclock and sat upright in bed alarmed without knowing why listening with straining ears and throbbing pulses  he caught a repetition of the sound that had aroused him a sound akin to that which had drawn his attention earlier when mary had been with him it came up faintly from the room immediately beneath her room some one was moving there he thought then as he continued to listen all became quiet again save his fears which would not be quieted he extinguished the light slipped from the bed and crossing to the window peered out into the close that was faintly illumined by a moon in its first quarter a shadow moved he thought he watched with increasing panic for confirmation and presently saw that he had been right not one but several shadows were shifting there among the trees shadows of men they were and as he peered he saw one that went running from the house across the lawn and joined the others now clustered together in a group what could be their purpose here in the silence he seemed to hear again the echo of marys last words to him  it would be just about this time last year that davie was slain  in terror he groped his way to the chair where the page slept and shook the lad vigorously  afoot boy he said in a hoarse whisper he had meant to shout it but his voice failed him his windpipe clutched by panic afootwe are beset by enemies  at once the youth was wide awake and together the king just in his shirt as he wasthey made their way from the room in the dark groping their way and so reached the windows at the back darnley opened one of these very softly then sent the boy back for a sheet making this fast they descended by it to the garden and started towards the wall intending to climb it that they might reach the open  the boy led the way and the king followed his teeth chattering as much from the cold as from the terror that possessed him and then quite suddenly without the least warning the ground it seemed to them heaved under their feet and they were flung violently forward on their faces a great blaze rent the darkness of the night accompanied by the thunders of an explosion so terrific that it seemed as if the whole world must have been shattered by it  for some instants the king and his page lay half stunned where they had fallen and well might it have been for them had they so continued but darnley recovering staggered to his feet pulling the boy up with him and supporting him then as he began to move he heard a soft whistle in the gloom behind him over his shoulder he looked towards the house to behold a great smoking gap now yawning in it through this gap he caught a glimpse of shadowy men moving in the close beyond and he realized that he had been seen the white shirt he wore had betrayed his presence to them  with a stifled scream he began to run towards the wall the page staggering after him behind them now came the clank and thud of a score of overtaking feet soon they were surrounded the king turned this way and that desperately seeking a way out of the murderous human ring that fenced them round  what dye seek what dye seek he screeched in a pitiful attempt to question with authority  a tall man in a trailing cloak advanced and seized him  we seek thee fool said the voice of bothwell  the kingliness that he had never known how to wear becomingly now fell from him utterly  mercymercy he cried  such mercy as you had on david rizzio answered the border lord  darnley fell on his knees and sought to embrace the murderers legs bothwell stooped over him seized the wretched mans shirt and pulled it from his shivering body then flinging the sleeves about the royal neck slipped one over the other and drew them tight nor relaxed his hold until the young mans struggles had entirely ceased  four days later mary went to visit the body of her husband in the chapel of holyrood house whither it had been conveyed and there as a contemporary tells us she looked upon it long not only without grief but with greedy eyes thereafter it was buried secretly in the night by rizzios side so that murderer and victim lay at peace together in the end     iii the night of betrayalantonio perez and philip ii of spain   you a spaniard of spain had been her taunt dry and contemptuous i do not believe it  and upon that she had put spur to the great black horse that bore her and had ridden off along the precipitous road by the river  after her he had flung his answer on a note of laughter bitter and cynical as the laughter of the damned laughter that expressed all things but mirth  oh a spaniard of spain indeed madame la marquise very much a spaniard of spain i assure you  the great black horse and the woman in red flashed round a bend of the rocky road and were eclipsed by a clump of larches the man leaned heavily upon his ebony cane sighed wearily and grew thoughtful then with a laugh and a shrug he sat down in the shade of the firs that bordered the road behind him crowning the heights loomed the brown castle built by gaston phoebus count of foix two hundred years ago and the tower of montauzet its walls scarred by the shots of the rebellious biscayans below him nourished by the snows that were dissolving under the sunshine of early spring sped the tumbling river beyond this spread pasture and arable land to the distant hills and beyond those stood the gigantic sharpsummited wall of the pyrenees its long ridge dominated by the cloven cone of the snow clad pic du midi there was in the sight of that great barrier at once natural and political a sense of security for this fugitive from the perils and the hatreds that lurked in spain beyond here in bearn he was a kings guest enjoying the hospitality of the great castle of pau safe from the vindictive persecution of the mean tyrant who ruled in spain and here at last he was at peace or would have been but for the thought of this womanthis marquise de chantenacwho had gone to such lengths in her endeavours to soften his exile that her ultimate object could never have been in doubt to a coxcomb though it was in some doubt to antonio perez who had been cured for all time of coxcombry by suffering and misfortune to say nothing of increasing age it was when he bethought him of that age of his that he was chiefly intrigued by the amazing ardour of this great lady of bearn a dozen years agobefore misfortune overtook himhe would have accepted her flagrant wooing as a proper tribute for then he had been the handsome wealthy witty profligate secretary of state to his catholic majesty king philip ii with a power in spain second only to the kings and sometimes even greater in those days he would have welcomed her as her endowments merited she was radiantly lovely in the very noontide of her resplendent youth the wellborn widow of a gentleman of bearn and it would not have lain within the strength or inclinations of antonio perez as he once had been to have resisted the temptation that she offered ever avid of pleasure he had denied himself no single cup of it that favouring fortune had proffered him it was indeed because of this that he was fallen from his high estate it was a woman who had pulled him down in ruin tumbling with him to her doom she poor soul was dead at last which was the best that any lover could have wished her but he lived on embittered vengeful with gall in his veins instead of blood he was the pale faded shadow of that arrogant reckless joyous antonio perez beloved of fortune he was fifty gaunt holloweyed and grey half crippled by torture sickly from long years of incarceration  what he asked himself sitting there his eyes upon the eternal snows of the barrier that shut out his past was there left in him to awaken love in such a woman as madame de chantenac was it that his tribulations stirred her pity or that the fame of him which rang through europe shed upon his withering frame some of the transfiguring radiance of romance  it marked indeed the change in him that he should pause to question whose erstwhile habit had been blindly to accept the good things tossed by fortune into his lap but question he did pondering that parting taunt of hers to which for emphasis she had given an odd redundancyyou a spaniard of spain could her meaning have been plainer was not a spaniard proverbially as quick to love as to jealousy was not spain that scented land of warmth and colour of cruelty and blood of throbbing lutes under lattices ajar of mitred sinners doing public penance that land where lust and piety went hand in hand where passion and penitence lay down togetherwas not spain the land of loves most fruitful growth and was not a spaniard the very hierophant of love  his thoughts swung with sudden yearning to his wife juana and their children held in brutal captivity by philip who sought to slake upon them some of the vindictiveness from which their husband and father had at last escaped not that antonio perez observed marital fidelity more closely than any other spaniard of his time or of any time but antonio perez was growing old older than he thought older than his years he knew it madame de chantenac had proved it to him  she had reproached him with never coming to see her at chantenac neglecting to return the too assiduous visits that she paid him here at pau  you are very beautiful madame and the world is very foul he had excused himself believe one who knows the world to his bitter cost tongues will wag  and your spanish pride will not suffer that clods may talk of you  i am thinking of you madame  of me she had answered why of me they talk alreadytalk their fill i must pretend blindness to the leering eyes that watch me each time i come to pau feign unconsciousness of the impertinent glances of the captain of the castle there as i ride in  then why do you come he had asked pointblank but before her sudden change of countenance he had been quick to add oh madame i am full conscious of the charity that brings you and i am deeply deeply grateful but  charity she had interrupted sharply on a laugh that was selfmocking charity  what else madame  ask yourself she had answered reddening and averting her face from his questioning eyes  madame he had faltered i dare not  dare not  madame how should i i am an old man broken by sickness disheartened by misfortune daunted by tribulationa mere husk cast aside by fortune whilst you are lovely as one of the angels about the throne of heaven  she had looked into the haggard face into the scars of suffering that seared it and she had answered gently tomorrow you shall come to me at chantenac my friend  i am a spaniard for whom tomorrow never comes  but it will this time tomorrow i shall expect you  he looked up at her sitting her great black horse beside which he had been pacing  better not madame better not he had said  and then he saw the eyes that had been tender grow charged with scorn then came her angry taunt  you a spaniard of spain i do not believe it  oh there was no doubt that he had angered her women of her temperament are quick to anger as to every emotion but he had not wished to anger her god knows it was never the way of antonio perez to anger lovely womenat least not in this fashion and it was an ill return for her gentleness and attention to himself considering this as he sat there now he resolved that he must make amendsthe only amends it was possible to make  an hour later in one of the regal rooms of the castle where he enjoyed the hospitality of king henri iv of france and navarre he announced to that most faithful equerry gil de mesa his intention of riding to chantenac tomorrow  is it prudent quoth mesa frowning  most imprudent answered don antonio that is why i go  and on the morrow he went escorted by a single groom gil de mesa had begged at first to be allowed to accompany him but for gil he had other work of which the instructions he left were very full the distance was shortthree miles along the gave de pauand don antonio covered it on a gently ambling mule such as might have been bred to bear some aged dignitary of holy church  the lords of chantenac were as noble as proud and as poor as most great lords of bearn their lineage was long their rentrolls short and the last marquis had suffered more from this dual complaint than any of his forbears and he had not at all improved matters by a certain habit of gaming contracted in youth the chateau bore abundant signs of it it was a burnt red pile standing foursquare on a little eminence about the base of which the river went winding turbulently it was turreted at each of its four angles imposing in its way but in a sad state of dilapidation and disrepair  the interior when don antonio reached it was rather better the furnishings though sparse were massive and imposing the tapestries on the walls if old were rich and choice but everywhere the illassorted marriage of pretentiousness and neediness was apparent the floors of hall and livingroom were strewn with freshcut rushes an obsolescent custom which served here alike to save the heavy cost of carpets and to lend the place an ancient baronial dignity whilst pretence was made of keeping state the servitors were all old and insufficient in number to warrant the retention of the infirm seneschal by whom don antonio was ceremoniously received a single groom aged and without livery took charge at once of don antonios mule his servants horse and the servant himself  the seneschal hobbling before him conducted our spaniard across the great hall gloomy and half denuded through the main livingroom of the chateau into a smaller more intimate apartment holding some trace of luxury which he announced as madames own room and there he left him to await the coming of the chatelaine  she at least showed none of the outward disrepair of her surroundings she came to him sheathed in a gown of shimmering silk that was of the golden brown of autumn tints caught to her waist by a slender girdle of hammered gold eyes of deepest blue pondered him questioningly whilst red lips smiled their welcome so you have come in spite of all she greeted him be very welcome to my poor house don antonio  and regally she proffered her hand to his homage  he took it observing the shapely pointed fingers the delicately curving nails reluctantly almost he admitted to himself how complete was her beauty how absolute her charm he sigheda sigh for that lost youth of his perhapsas he bowed from his fine lean height to press cold lips of formal duty on that hand  your will madame was stronger than my prudence said he  prudence quoth she and almost sneered since when has antonio perez stooped to prudence  since paying the bitter price of imprudence you know my story  a little i know for instance that you murdered escovedoall the world knows that is that the imprudence of which you speak i have heard it said that it was for love of a woman that you did it  you have heard that too he said he had paled a little you have heard a deal marquise i wonder would it amuse you to hear more to hear from my own lips this story of mine which all europe garbles would it  there was a faint note of anxiety in his voice a look faintly anxious in his eyes  she scanned him a moment gravely almost inscrutably what purpose can it serve she asked and her tone was forbiddingalmost a tone of fear  it will explain he insisted  explain what  how it comes that i am not this moment prostrate at your feet how it happens that i am not on my knees to worship your heavenly beauty how i have contrived to remain insensible before a loveliness that in happier times would have made me mad  vive dieu she murmured half ironical perhaps that needs explaining  how it became necessary he pursued never heeding the interruption that yesterday you should proclaim your disbelief that i could be as you said a spaniard of spain how it happens that antonio perez has become incapable of any emotion but hate will you hear the storyall of it  he was leaning towards her his white face held close to her own a smouldering fire in the dark sunken eyes that now devoured her  she shivered and her own cheeks turned very pale her lips were faintly twisted as if in an effort to smile  my friendif you insist she consented  it is the purpose for which i came he announced  for a long moment each looked into the others eyes with a singular intentness that nothing here would seem to warrant  at length she spoke  come she said you shall tell me  and she waved him to a chair set in the embrasure of the mullioned window that looked out over a tract of meadowland sweeping gently down to the river  don antonio sank into the chair placing his hat and whip upon the floor beside him the marquise faced him occupying the padded windowseat her back to the light her countenance in shadow  and here in his own words follows the story that he told her as she herself set it down soon after whilst more elaborate and intimate in parts it yet so closely agrees throughout with his own famous relacion that i do not hesitate to accept the assurance she has left us that every word he uttered was burnt as if by an acid upon her memory   the story of antonio perez   as a lovestory this is i think the saddest that ever was invented by a romancer intent upon wringing tears from sympathetic hearts how sad it is you will realize when i tell you that daily i thank god on my kneesfor i still believe in god despite what was alleged against me by the inquisitors of aragonthat she who inspired this love of which i am to tell you is now in the peace of death she died in exile at pastrana a year ago anne de mendoza was what you call in france a great parti she came of one of the most illustrious families in spain and she was a great heiress so much all the world knew what the world forgot was that she was a woman with a womans heart and mind a womans natural instincts to select her mate there are fools who envy the noble and the wealthy they are little to be envied those poor pawns in the game of statecraft moved hither and thither at the will of players who are themselves no better the human nature of them is a negligible appendage to the names and rentrolls that predetermine their place upon the board of worldly ambition a board befouled by blood by slobberings from the evil mouth of greed and by infamy of every kind  so because anne was a daughter of the house of mendoza because her endowments were great they plucked her from her convent at the age of thirteen years knowing little more of life than the merest babe and they flung her into the arms of ruy gomez prince of eboli who was old enough to have been her father but eboli was a great man in spain perhaps the greatest he was first minister to philip ii and between his house and that of mendoza an alliance was desired to establish it that tender child was sacrificed without ruth she discovered that life held nothing of all that her maiden dreamings had foreseen that it was a thing of horror and greed and lovelessness and worse for there was much worse to come  eboli brought his childprincess to court he wore her lightly as a ribbon or a glove the insignificant appendage to the wealth and powerful alliance he had acquired with her and at court she came under the eye of that pious satyr philip the catholic king is very devoutperfervidly devout he prays he fasts he approaches the sacraments he does penance all in proper season as prescribed by mother church he abominates sin and lack of faithparticularly in others he has drenched flanders in blood that he might wash it clean of the heresy of thinking differently from himself in spiritual matters and he would have done the same by england but that godwho cannot after all be quite of philips way of thinkingwilled otherwise all this he has done for the greater honour and glory of his maker but he will not tolerate his makers interference with his own minor pleasures of the flesh he is as you would say a spaniard of spain  this satyrs protruding eyes fell upon the lovely princess of ebolifor lovely she was a very pearl among women i spare you details eboli was most loyal and submissive where his king was concerned most complacent and accommodating that was but logical and need not shock you at all to advance his worldly ambitions had he taken anne to wife why should he scruple then to yield her again that thus he might advance those ambitions further  if poor anne argued at all she must have argued thus for the rest she was told that to be loved by the king was an overwhelming honour a matter for nightly prayers of thankfulness philip was something very exalted hardly human in fact almost if not quite divine who and what was anne that she should dispute with those who knew the world and who placed these facts before her never in all her little life had she belonged to herself always had she been the property of somebody else to be dealt with as her owner might consider best if about the court she saw some men more nearly of her own agethough there were not many for philips court was ever a gloomy sparsely peopled placeshe took it for granted that such men were not for her this until i taught her otherwise which however was not yet a while had i been at court in those days i think i should have found the means at whatever cost of preventing that infamy for i know that i loved her from the day i saw her but i was of no more than her own age and i had not yet been drawn into that whirlpool  so she went to the arms of that rachitic prince and she bore him a sonfor as all the world knows the duke of prastana owns philip for his father and eboli increased in power and prosperity and the favour of his master and also no doubt in the contempt of posterity there are times when the thought of posterity and its vengeances is of great solace  it would be some six years later when first i came to court brought thither by my father to enter the service of the prince of eboli as one of his secretaries as i have told you i loved the princess from the moment i beheld her from the gossip of the court i pieced together her story and pitied her and pitying her i loved her the more her beauty dazzled me her charm enmeshed me and she had grown by now in worldly wisdom and mental attainments yet i set a mask upon my passion and walked very circumspectly for all that by nature i was as reckless and profligate as all the world could ever call me she was the wife of the puissant secretary of state the mistress of the king who was i to dispute their property to those exalted ones  and another consideration stayed me she seemed to love the king young and lacking in wisdom this amazed me in age he compared favourably with her husband he was but thirteen years older than herselfbut in nothing else he was a weedy unhealthylooking man weakly of frame rachitic undersized with spindleshanks and a countenance that was almost grotesque with its protruding jaw gaping mouth great doglike eyes and yellow tuft of beard a great king perhaps this philip having so been born but a ridiculous man and an unspeakable lover and yet this incomparable woman seemed to love him  let me pass on for ten years i nursed that love of mine in secret i was helped perhaps by the fact that in the mean time i had marriedoh just as eboli himself had married an arrangement dictated by worldly considerationsand no better truer mate did ever a man find than i in juana coello we had children and we were happy and for a seasonfor years indeedi began to think that my unspoken passion for the princess of eboli was dead and done with i saw her rarely now and my activities increased with increasing duties at twentysix i was one of the ministers of the crown and one of the chief supporters of that party of which eboli was the leader in spanish politics i sat in philips council and i came under the spell of that taciturn suspicious man who utterly unlovable as he was had yet an uncanny power of inspiring devotion from the spell of it i never quite escaped until after long years of persecution yet the discovery that one by nature so entirely antipathetic to me should have obtained such sway over my mind helped me to understand annes attachment to him  when eboli died in 1573 i had so advanced in ability and royal favour that i took his place as secretary of state thus becoming all but the supreme ruler of spain i do not believe that there was ever in spain a minister so highly favoured by the reigning prince so powerful as i became not eboli himself in his halcyon days had been so deeply esteemed of philip or had wielded such power as i now made my own all europe knows itfor it was to me all europe addressed itself for affairs that concerned the catholic king  and with my power came wealthabundant prodigious wealth i was housed like a prince of the blood and no prince of the blood ever kept greater state than i was ever more courted fawned upon or t flattered and remember i was young little more than thirty with all the strength and zest to enjoy my intoxicating eminence i was to my party what eboli had been though the nominal leader of it remained quiroga archbishop of toledo on the other side was the duke of alva with his following  you must know that it was king philips way to encourage two rival parties in the state between which he shared his confidence and sway thus he stimulated emulation and enlightened his own views in the opposing opinions that were placed before him but the power of my party was absolute in those days and alva himself was as the dust beneath our feet  such eminences they say are perilous heads that are very highly placed may at any moment be placed still higherupon a pike i am all but a living witness to the truth of that and yet i wonder would it so have fallen out with me had i mistrusted that slumbering passion of mine for anne i should have known that where such fires have once been kindled in a man they never quite die out as long as life endures time and preoccupations may overlay them as with a film of ashes but more or less deeply down they smoulder on and the first breath will fan them into flame again  it was at the kings request i went to see her in her fine madrid house opposite santa maria mayor some months after her husbands death there were certain matters of heritage to be cleared up and having regard to her high rank it was philips wish that iwho was by now ebolis official successorshould wait on her in person  there were documents to be conned and signed and the matter took some days for ebolis possessions were not only considerable but scattered and his widow displayed an acquired knowledge of affairs and a natural wisdom that inspired her to probe deeply to my undoing she probed too deeply in one matter it concerned some landa little propertyat velez she had been attached to the place it seemed and she missed all mention of it from the papers that i brought her she asked the reason  it is disposed of i told her  disposed of quoth she but by whom  by the prince your husband a little while before he died  she looked up at meshe was seated at the wide carved writingtable i standing by her sideas if expecting me to say more as i left my utterance there she frowned perplexedly  but what mystery is this she asked me to whom has it gone  to one sancho gordo  to sancho gordo the frown deepened the washerwomans son you will not tell me that he bought it  i do not tell you so madame it was a gift from the prince your husband  a gift she laughed to sancho gordo so the washerwomans child is ebolis son  and again she laughed on a note of deep contempt  madame i cried appalled and full of pity i assure you that you assume too much the prince  let be she interrupted me do you dream i care what rivals i may have had however lowly they may have been the prince my husband is dead and that is very well he is much better dead don antonio the pity of it is that he ever lived or else that i was born a woman  she was staring straight before her her hands fallen to her lap her face set as if carved and lifeless and her voice came hard as the sound of one stone beating upon another  do you dream what it can mean to have been so nurtured on indignities that there is no anger left no pride to wound by the discovery of yet another nothing but cold cold hate that don antonio is my case you do not know what my life has been that man  he is dead madame i reminded her out of pity  and damned i hope she answered me in that same cold emotionless voice he deserves no less for all the wrongs he did to me the least of which was the great wrong of marrying me for advancement he acquired me for his advancement he bartered and used me and made of me a thing of shame  i was so overwhelmed with grief and love and pity that a groan escaped me almost before i was aware of it she broke off short and stared at me in haughtiness  you presume to pity me i think she reproved me it is my own fault i was wrong to talk women should suffer silently that they may preserve at least a mask of dignity otherwise they incur pityand pity is very near contempt  and then i lost my head  not mine not mine i cried throwing out my arms and though that was all i said there was such a ring in my choking voice that she rose stiffly from her seat and stood tense and tall confronting me almost eye to eye reproof in every line of her  princess forgive me i cried it breaks my heart in pieces to hear you utter things that have been in my mind these many years poisoning the devotion that i owed to the late prince poisoning the very loyalty i owe my king you say i pity you if that were so none has the better right  who gave it you she asked me breathless  heaven itself i think i answered recklessly what you have suffered i have suffered for you when i came to court the infamy was a thing accomplishedall of it but i gathered it and gathering it thanked heaven i had been spared the pain and misery of witnessing it which must have been more than ever i could have endured yet when i saw you when i watched youyour wistful beauty your incomparable gracethere was a time when the thought to murder stirred darkly in my mind that i might at least avenge you  she fell away before me white to the very lips her eyes dilating as they regarded me  in gods name why she asked me in a strangled voice  because i loved you i replied always always since the day i saw you unfortunately that day was years too late even had i dared to hope  antonio something in her voice drew my averted eyes her lips had parted her eyes kindled into life a flush was stirring in her cheeks  and i never knew i never knew she faltered piteously  i stared  dear heaven why did you withhold a knowledge that would have upheld me and enheartened me through all that i have suffered once long long agog i hoped  you hoped  i hoped antoniolong long ago  we were in each others arms she weeping on my shoulder as if her heart would burst i almost mad with mingling joy and painand as god lives there was more matter here for pain than joy  we sat long together after that and talked it out there was no help for it it was too late on every count on her side there was the king most jealous of all men whose chattel she was become on mine there was my wife and children and so deep and true was my love for anne that it awakened in me thoughts of the loyalty i owed juana thoughts that had never troubled me hitherto in my pleasureloving lifeand this not only as concerned anne herself but as concerned all women there was something so ennobling and sanctifying about our love that it changed at once the whole of my life the whole tenor of my ways i abandoned profligacy and became so staid and orderly in my conduct that i was scarcely recognizable for the antonio perez whom the world had known hitherto  we parted there that day with a resolve to put all this behind us to efface from our minds all memory of what had passed between us poor fools were we to imagine we could resist the vortex of circumstance which had caught us for three months we kept our engagement scrupulously and then at last resistance mutually exhausted we yielded each to the other both to fate  but because we cherished our love we moved with caution i was circumspect in my comings and goings and such were the precautions we observed that for four years the world had little suspicion and certainly no knowledge that i had inherited from the prince of eboli more than his office as secretary of state this secrecy was necessary as long as philip lived for we were both fully aware of what manner of vengeance we should have to reckon with did knowledge of our relations reach the jealous king and i think that but for don john of austrias affairs and the intervention in them of the escovedo whom you saywhom the world says i murdered all might have been well to this day  escovedo had been like myself one of ebolis secretaries in his day and it was this that won him after ebolis death a place at the royal council board it was but an inferior place yet the king remarked him for a man shrewd and able who might one day have his uses  that day was not very long in coming though the opportunity it afforded escovedo was scarcely such as in his greedy insatiable ambition he had hoped for yet the opportunity such as it was was afforded him by me and had he used it properly it should have carried him far certainly much farther than his talent and condition warranted  it came about through don john of austrias dreams of sovereignty you will have heardas who has notso much of don john the natural son of charles v that i need tell you little concerning him in body and soul he was a very different man indeed from his halfbrother philip of spain as joyous as philip was gloomy as open and frank as philip was cloudy and suspicious and as beautiful as philip was grotesque don john was the bayard of our day the very mirror of all knightly graces to the victory of lepanto which had made him illustrious as a soldier he had added in 73the year of ebolis death the conquest of tunis thereby completing the triumph of christianity over the muslim in the mediterranean success may have turned his head a little he was young you know and an emperors son he dreamt of an empire for himself of sovereignty and of making tunis the capital of the kingdom he would found  we learnt of this indeed don john made little secret of his intentions but they went not at all with philips views it was far from his notions that don john should go founding kingdoms of his own his valour and talents were required to be employed for the greater honour and glory of the crown of spain and nothing further  philip consulted me who was by then the depositary of all his secrets the familiar of his inmost desires there was evidence that don johns ambitions were being fomented by his secretary who dreamt no doubt of his own aggrandizement in the aggrandizement of his master philip proposed the mans removal  that would be something i agreed but not enough he must be replaced by a man of our own a man loyal to your majesty who will not only seek to guide don john in the course that he should follow but will keep close watch upon his projects and warn you should they threaten to neglect your interests the interests of spain for his own  and such a man where shall we find him  i considered a moment and bethought me of escovedo he was able he had charm and an ingratiating manner i believed him loyal and imagined that i could quicken that loyalty by showing him that advancement would wait upon its observation he could well be spared from the council where as i have said he occupied a quite inferior post lastly we were friends and i was glad of the opportunity to serve him and place him on the road to better things  all this i said to philip and so the matter was concluded but escovedo failed me his abilities and ingratiating manner endeared him quickly to don john whilst himself he succumbed entirely not only to don john of austrias great personal charm but also to don johns ambitious projects the road to advancement upon which i had set him seemed to him long and toilsome by contrast with the shorter cut that was offered by his new masters dreams he fell as the earlier secretary had fallen and more grievously for he was the more ambitious of the two and from merely seconding don johns projects it was not long before he spurred them on not long before he was dreaming dreams of his own for don john to realize  from tunis which had by now been recovered by the turks and any hopes concerned with which king philip had discouraged the eyes of don john were set at escovedos bidding i believe upon the crown of england  he had just been invited by philip to make ready to take in hand the affairs of flanders sadly disorganized under the incompetent rule of alva it occurred to him that if he were to issue victoriously from that enterpriseand so far victory had waited upon his every ventureif he were to succeed in restoring peace and spanish order in rebellious flanders he would then be able to move against england with the spanish troops under his command overthrow elizabeth deliver mary stuart from the captivity in which she languished and by marriage with her set the crown of england on his brow to this great project he sought the support of rome and rome accorded it very readily being naturally hostile to the heretic daughter of anne boleyn  it was escovedo himself who went as don johns secret ambassador to the vatican in this affair escovedo who had been placed with don john to act as a curb on that young mans ambitions nor did he move with the prudence he should have observed  knowledge of what was brewing reached us from the papal nuncio in madrid who came to see me one day in the matter  i have a dispatch from rome he announced in which his holiness instructs me to enjoin upon the king that the expedition against england be now executed and that he consider bestowing its crown upon don john of austria for the greater honour and glory of holy church  i was thunderstruck the expedition against england i knew was no new project three years before a secret envoy from the queen of scots an italian named ridolfi had come to propose to philip that in concert with the pope he should reestablish the catholic faith in england and place mary stuart upon the throne it was a scheme attractive to philip since it agreed at once with his policy and his religion but it had been abandoned under the dissuasions of alva who accounted that it would be too costly even if successful here it was again emanating now directly from the holy see but in a slightly altered form  why don john of austria i asked him  a great soldier of the faith and the queen of scots must have a husband  i should have thought that she had had husbands enough by now said i  his holiness does not appear to share that view he answered tartly  i wonder will the king said i  the catholic king is ever an obedient child of mother church the oily nuncio reminded me to reprove my doubt  but i knew betterthat the kings own policy was the measure of his obedience this the nuncio should learn for himself for if i knew anything of philips mind i knew precisely how he would welcome this proposal  will you see the king now i suggested maliciously anxious to witness the humbling of his priestly arrogance  not yet it is upon that i came to see you i am instructed first to consult with one escoda as to the manner in which this matter shall be presented to his majesty who is escoda  i never heard of him said i perhaps he comes from rome  no no strange he muttered frowning and plucked a parchment from his sleeve it is here he peered slowly at the writing and slowly spelled out the name juan de escoda  in a flash it came to me  escovedo you mean i cried  yes yesescovedo to be sure he agreed having consulted the writing once more where is he  on his way to madrid with don john i informed him he is don johns secretary  i will do nothing then until he arrives he said and took his leave  oh monstrous indiscretion that dispatch from rome so cunningly and secretly contrived in cipher had yet contained no warning that escovedos share in this should be concealed there are none so imprudent as the sly i sought the king at once and told him all that i had learnt he was aghast indeed i never saw him more near to anger for philip of spain was not the man to show wrath or any other emotion he had a fishlike cold impenetrable inscrutability true his yellow skin grew yellower his gaping mouth gaped wider his goggle eyes goggled more than usual left to himself i think he would have disgraced don john and banished escovedo there and then as he did indeed suggest and i have since had cause enough to wish to god that i had left him to himself  who will replace don john in flanders i asked him quietly he stared at me he is useful to you there use him sire to your own ends  but they will press this english business  acquiesce  acquiesce are you mad  seem to acquiesce temporize answer them one thing at a time say when the flanders business is happily concluded we will think of england give them hope that success in flanders will dispose you to support the other project thus you offer don john an incentive to succeed yet commit yourself to nothing  and this dog escovedo  is a dog who betrays himself by his bark we will listen for it  and thus it was determined thus was don john suckled on the windy pap of hope when presently he came to court with escovedo at his heels distended by that empty fare he went off to the low countries leaving escovedo in madrid to represent him with secret instructions to advance his plans  now escovedos talents were far inferior to my conception of them  he was just a greedy schemer without the wit to dissemble his appetite or the patience necessary to secure attainment  affairs in flanders went none too well yet that did not set a curb upon him he pressed his masters business upon the king with an ardour amounting to disrespect and disrespect was a thing the awful majesty of philip could never brook escovedo complained of delays of indecision and finallyin the summer of 76he wrote the king a letter of fierce upbraidings criticizing his policy in terms that were contemptuous and which entirely exasperated philip  it was in vain i strove to warn the fellow of whither he was drifting in vain i admonished and sought to curb his headlong recklessness i have said that i had a friendship for him and because of that i took more pains perhaps than i should have taken in anothers case  unless you put some judgment into that head of yours my friend you will leave it in this business i told him one day  he flung into a passion at the admonition heaped abuse upon me swore that it was i who thwarted him i who opposed the fulfilment of don johns desires and fostered the dilatory policy of the king  i left him after that to pursue his course having no wish to quarrel with this headstrong upstart yet liking him as i did i spared no endeavour to shield him from the consequences he provoked but that letter of his to philip made the task a difficult one philip showed it to me  if that man he said had uttered to my face what he has dared to write i do not think i should have been able to contain myself without visible change of countenance it is a sanguinary letter  i set myself to calm him as best i could  the man is indiscreet which has its advantage for we always know whither an indiscreet man is heading his zeal for his master blinds him and makes him rash it is better perhaps than if he were secretive and crafty  with such arguments i appeased his wrath against the secretary but i knew that his hatred of escovedo his thirst for escovedos blood dated from that moment in which escovedo had forgotten the reverence due to majesty i was glad when at last he took himself off to flanders to rejoin don john but that was very far from setting a term to his pestering the flanders affair was going so badly that the hopes of an english throne to follow were dwindling fast something else must be devised against the worst and now don john and escovedo began to consider the acquisition of power in spain itself their ambition aimed at giving don john the standing of an infante both of them wrote to me to advance this fresh project of theirs to work for their recall so that they could ally themselves with my partythe archbishops partyand ensure its continuing supreme escovedo wrote me a letter that was little better than an attempt to bribe me the king was ageing and the prince was too young to relieve him of the heavy duties of state don john should shoulder these and in so doing escovedo and myself should be hoisted into greater power  i carried all those letters to the king and at his suggestion i even pretended to lend an ear to these proposals that we might draw from escovedo a fuller betrayal of his real ultimate aims it was dangerous and i enjoined the king to move carefully  be discreet i warned him for if my artifice were discovered i should not be of any further use to you at all in my conscience i am satisfied that in acting as i do i am performing no more than my duty i require no theology other than my own to understand that much  my theology he answered me takes much the same view you would have failed in your duty to god and me had you failed to enlighten me on the score of this deception these things he added in a dull voice appal me  so i wrote to don john urging him as one who counselled him for his good who had no interest but his own at heart to remain in flanders until the work there should be satisfactorily completed he did so since he was left no choice in the matter but the intrigues continued later we saw how far he was from having forsaken his dreams of england when i discovered that he had engaged the pope to assist him with six thousand men and one hundred and fifty thousand ducats when the time for that adventure should be ripe  and then quite suddenly entirely unheralded escovedo reappeared in madrid having come to press philip in person for reinforcements that should enable don john to finish the campaign he brought news that there had been a fresh rupture of the patchedup peace that don john had taken the field once more and had forcibly made himself master of namur this was contrary to all the orders we had sent a direct overriding of philips wishes the king desired peace in the low countries because he was in no case just then to renew the war and escovedos impudently couched demands completed his exasperation  my will he said is as naught before the ambitions of these two you sent my clear instructions to escovedo who was placed with don john that he might render him pliant to my wishes instead he stiffens him in rebellion there must be an end to this man  sire i cried it may be they think to advance your interests  heaven help me he cried did ever villain wear so transparent a mask as this dog escovedo to advance my intereststhat will be his tale no doubt he will advance them where i do not wish them advanced he will advance them to my ruin he will stake all on a success in flanders that shall be the preliminary to a descent upon england in the interests of don john i say there must be an end to this man before he works more mischief  again i set myself to calm him as i had so often done before and again i was the shield between escovedo and the royal lightnings of whose menace to blot him out the fool had no suspicion for months things hung there until in january of 78 when war had been forced in earnest upon spain by elizabeths support of the low countries don john won the great victory of gemblours this somewhat raised the kings depression somewhat dissipated his overgrowing mistrust of his halfbrother and gave him patience to read the letters in which don john urged him to send moneyto throw wood on the fire whilst it was alight or else resign himself to the loss of flanders for all time as it meant also resigning himself to the loss of all hope of england for all time escovedos activities were just then increased a hundredfold  send me money and escovedo was the burden of the almost daily letters from don john to me and at my elbow was escovedo perpetually pressing me to bend the king to his masters will another matter on which he pressed me then was that i should obtain for himself the governorship of the castle of mogro which commands the port of santander an ambition this which intrigued me deeply for i confess i could not fathom what it had to do with all the rest  and then something else happened from the spanish ambassador at the louvre we learnt one day of a secret federation entered into between don john and the guises known as the defence of the two crowns its object was as obscure as its title but it afforded the last drop to the cup of philips mistrust this time it was directly against don john that he inveighed to me and to defend don john in the interests of common justice i was forced to place the blame where it belonged  nay sire i assured him these ambitions are not don johns with all his fevered dreams of greatness don john has ever been will ever be loyal to his king  if you know anything of temptation he answered me you should know that there is a breakingpoint to every mans resistance of it how long will don john remain loyal while escovedo feeds his disloyalty adds daily to the weight of temptation the burden of a fresh ambition i tell you man i feel safe no longer he rose up before me a blotch on his sallow face his fingers tugging nervously at the tuft of strawcoloured beard i tell you some blow is about to fall unless we avert it this man this fellow escovedomust be dispatched before he can kill us  i shrugged and affected carelessness to soothe him  a contemptible dreamer i said pity him sire he has his uses to remove him would be to remove a channel through which we can always obtain knowledge precisely of what is doing  again i prevailed and there the matter hung a while but the king was right his fears were well inspired escovedo always impatient was becoming desperate under persistent frustration i reasoned with himwas he not still my friendi held him off urged prudence and patience upon him and generally sought to temporize i was as intent upon saving him from leaving his skin in this business as i was on the other hand intent upon doing my duty without pause or scruple to my king but the fool forced my hand a court is a foul place always even so attenuated a court as that which philip of spain encouraged rumour thrives in it scandal blossoms luxuriantly in its fetid atmosphere and rumour and scandal had been busy with the princess of eboli and me though i did not dream it  we had been indiscreet no doubt we had been seen together in public too often we had gone to the play together more than once she had been present with me at a bullfight on one occasion and it was matter of common gossip as i was to learn that i was a too frequent visitor at her house  another visitor there was escovedo when in madrid have i not said that in his early days he had been one of ebolis secretaries on that account the house of eboli remained open to him at all times the princess liked him was kindly disposed towards him and encouraged his visits we met there more than once one day we left together and that day the fool set spark to a train that led straight to the mine on which all unconsciously he stood  a word of advice in season don antonio he said as we stepped forth together do not go so often to visit the princess  i sought to pull my arm from his but he dung to it and pinned it to his side  nay nownay now he soothed me not so hot my friend what the devil have i said to provoke resentment i advise you as your friend  in future advise that other friend of yours the devil i answered angrily and pulled my arm away at last don juan you have presumed i think i did not seek your advice it is yourself that stands in need of advice this moment more than any man in spain  lord of the world he exclaimed in amiable protest listen to him i speak because i owe friendship to the princess men whisper of your comings and goings i tell you and the king you know well should he hear of this i am in danger of losing my only friend at court and so  another word of this i broke in fiercely now or at any other time and ill skewer you like a rabbit  i had stopped my face was thrust within a handsbreadth of his own i had tossed back my cloak and my fingers clutched the hilt of my sword he became grave his fine eyeshe had great sombre liquid eyes such as youll scarcely ever see outside of spainconsidered me thoughtfully a moment then he laughed lightly and fell back a pace  pish said he saint james i am no rabbit for your skewering if it comes to skewers i am a useful man of my hands antonio come manand again he took my armif i presume forgive it out of the assurance that i am moved solely by interest and concern for you we have been friends too long that i should be denied  i had grown cool again and i realized that perhaps my show of anger had been imprudent so i relented now and we went our ways together without further show of illhumour on my part or further advice on his but the matter did not end there indeed it but began going early in the afternoon of the morrow to visit anne i found her in tearstears as i was to discover of anger  escovedo had been to visit her before me and he had dared to reproach her on the same subject  you are talked about you and perez he had informed her and the thing may have evil consequences it is because i have eaten our bread that i tell you this for your own good  she had risen up in a great passion  you will leave my house and never set foot in it again she had told him you should learn that grooms and lackeys have no concern in the conduct of great ladies it is because you have eaten my bread that i tell you this for your own good  it drove him out incontinently but it left her in the condition in which i was later to discover her i set myself to soothe her i swore that escovedo should be punished but she would not be soothed she blamed herself for an unpardonable rashness she should not have taken that tone with escovedo he could avenge himself by telling philip and if he told philip and philip believed himas philip would being jealous and mistrustful beyond all menmy ruin must follow she had thought only of herself in dismissing him in that highhanded manner coming since to think of me it was that she had fallen into this despair she clung to me in tears  forgive me antonio the fault is all minethe fault of all always have i known that this danger must overhang you as a penalty for loving me always i knew it and knowing it i should have been stronger i should have sent you from me at the first but i was so starved of love from childhood till i met you i hungered so for lovefor your love antoniothat i had not the strength i was weak and selfish and because i was ready and glad to pay the price myself whatever it should be and whenever asked i did not take thought enough for you  take no thought now i implored her holding her close  i must i cant help it i have raised this peril for you he will go to philip  not he he dare not i am his only hope i am the ladder by which he hopes to scale the heaven of his high ambition if he destroys me there is the kennel for himself he knows it  do you say that to comfort me or is it really true  gods truth sweetheart i swore and drew her closer  she was comforted long before i left her but as i stepped out into the street again a man accosted me evidently he had been on the watch awaiting me he fell into step beside me almost before i realized his presence it was escovedo  so he said very sinister youll not be warned  nor will you i answered no whit less sinister myself  it was broad daylight a pale march sunshine was beating down upon the cobbled streets and passersby were plentiful there was no fingering of hilts or talk of skewering on either side nor must i show any of the anger that was boiling in me my face was too well known in madrid streets and a secretary of state does not parade emotions to the rabble so i walked stiff and dignified amain that dog in step with me the while  she will have told you what i have said to her he murmured  and what she said to you it was less than your deserts  groom and lackey eh said he and less than i deservea man of my estate oh ho groom and lackey those are epithets to be washed out in blood and tears  you rant i said  or else to be paid forhandsomely his tone was slyso sly that i answered nothing for to answer a sly man is to assist him and my business was to let him betray the cause of this slyness followed a spell of silence then do you know said he that several of her relatives are thinking seriously of killing you  many men have thought seriously of thatso seriously that they never attempted it antonio perez is not easily murdered don juan as you may discover  it was a boast that i may claim to have since justified  shall i tell you their names quoth he  if you want to ruin them  ha it was a short bark of a laugh you talk glibly of ruiningbut then you talk to a groom and lackey the epithets rankled in his mind they were poison to his blood it seemed it takes a woman to find words that burn and blister a man yet groom and lackey that i am i hold you both in the hollow of my hand if i close that hand it will be very bad for you very bad for her if for instance i were to tell king philip that i have seen her in your arms  you dog  i havei swear to god i have with these two eyesat least with one of them applied to the keyhole half an hour ago her servants passed me in a ducat or two well bestowedyou understand  we had reached the door of my house i paused and turned to him  you will come in i invited  as the wolf said to the lamb eh well why not and we went in  you are well housed he commented his greedy envious eyes considering all the tokens of my wealth it were a pity to lose so much i think the king is at the escurial i am told  he was he had gone thither into retreat that he might cleanse his pious murky soul against the coming of eastertide  you would not i am sure compel me to undertake so tedious a journey said he  will you put off this slyness and be plain i bade him you have some bargain in your mind propound it  he did and left me aghast  you have temporized long enough perez he began you have been hunting with the dogs and running with the stag there must be an end to all that stand by me now and i will make you greater than you are greater than you could ever dream to be oppose me betray mefor i am going to be very frankand the king shall hear things from me that will mean your ruin and hers you understand  then came his demands first of all the command of the fortress of mogro for himself i must obtain him that at once secondly i must see to it that philip pledged himself to support don johns expedition against england and elizabeth and to seat don john upon the throne with mary stuart for his wife these things must come about and quickly or i perished nor was that all indeed no more than a beginning he opened out the vista of his dreams that having blackmailed me on the one hand he might now bribe me on the other once england was theirs he aimed at no less than a descent upon spain itself that was why he wanted mogro to facilitate a landing at santander thus as the christians had originally come down from the mountains of the asturias to drive the moors from the peninsula so should the forces of don john descend again to reconquer it for himself  it was a madmans fancy utterlyfruit of a brain that ambition had completely addled and i do not believe that don john had any part in it or even knowledge of it escovedo saw himself perhaps upon the throne of one or the other of the two kingdoms as don johns viceregentfor himself and for me if i stood by him there was such power in store as no man ever dreamed of if i refused he would destroy me  and if i go straight to the escurial and lay this project before the king i asked him  he smiled  you will force me to tell him that it is a lie invented to deliver you from a man who can destroy you by the knowledge he possesses knowledge which i shall at once impart to philip think what that will mean to you think he added very wickedly what it will mean to her  as i am a christian i believe that had it been but the consideration of myself i would have flung him from my house upon the instant and bade him do his worst but he was well advised to remind me of her whatever philips punishment of me it would be as nothing to his punishment of that longsuffering woman who had betrayed him oh i assure you it is a very evil ill judged thing to have a king for rival particularly a fishsouled tyrant of king philips kind  i was all limp with dread i passed a hand across my brow and found it chill and moist  i am in your hands escovedo i confessed miserably  say rather that we are partners forget all else he was eager joyous believing all accomplished such was his faith in my influence with philip and now mogro for me and england for don john about it with dispatch  the king is in retreat we must wait some days  till easter then and he held out his hand i took it limply thus clenching the bargain of infamy between us what else was there for me what otherwise was to become of anne  oh i may have been selfseeking and made the most of my position as was afterwards urged against me i may have been extortionate and venal and i may have taken regal bribes to expedite affairs but always was i loyal and devoted to the king never once had i been bribed to aught that ran counter to his interests never until now when at a stroke i had sold my honour and pledged myself to this betrayal of my trust  not in all spain was there a more miserable man than i all night i sat in the room where i was wont to work and to my wifes entreaties that i should take some rest i answered that the affairs of spain compelled attention and when morning found me haggard and distraught came a courier from philip with a letter  i have letters from don john he wrote more insistent than ever in their tone he demands the instant dispatch of money and escovedo i have been thinking and this letter confirms my every fear i have cause to apprehend some stroke that may disturb the public peace and ruin don john himself if he is allowed to retain escovedo any longer in his service i am writing to don john that i will see to it that escovedo is promptly dispatched as he requests do you see him dispatched then in precise accordance with his deserts and this at once before the villain kills us  my skin bristled as i read here was fatality itself at work philip was at his old fearsand heaven knows he was not without justification of his intuitions as i had learnt by nowthat escovedo meditated the most desperate measures he was urging me again as he had urged me before and more than once to dispatch this traitor whose restless existence so perpetually perturbed him i was not deceived as to the meaning he set upon that word dispatch i knew quite well the nature of the dispatch he bade me contrive  conceive now my temptation escovedo dead i should be safe and anne would be safe and this without any such betrayal as was being forced upon me and that death the king himself commanded a secret royal execution such as his confessor frey diego de chaves has since defended as an expedient measure within the royal prerogative he had commanded it before quite unequivocally but always i had stood between escovedo and the sword was i to continue in that attitude could it humanly be expected of me in all the circumstances again to seek to deflect the royal wrath from that too daring head i was after all only a man subject to the temptations of the flesh and there was a woman whom i loved better than my own salvation to whose peace and happiness that fellow escovedo was become a menace  if he lived and for as long as he lived she and i were to be as slaves of his will and i was to drag my honour and my loyalty through the foul kennels of his disordered ambitions and the king my master was bidding me clearly see to it that he died immediately  i sat down and wrote at once and the burden of my letter was be more explicit sire what manner of dispatch is it your will that escovedo should be given  on the morrow which was thursday of holy week that note of mine was returned to me and on the margin of it in philips own hand escovedos deathwarrant i mean that it would be well to hasten the death of this rascal before some act of his should render it too late for he never rests nor will anything turn him from his usual ways do it then and do it quickly before he kills us  there was no more to be said my instructions were clear and definite obedience alone remained i went about it  just as all my life i have been blessed with the staunchest friends so have i too been blessed with the most faithful servants and of these none was more faithful than my steward diego martinez unless indeed it be my equerry gil de mesa who to this day follows my evil fortunes but mesa at that time was as yet untried whilst in diego i knew that i had a man devoted to me heart and soul a man who would allow himself to be torn limb from limb on the rack on my behalf  i placed the affair in diegos hands i told him that i was acting under orders from the king and that the thing at issue was the private execution of a dangerous traitor who could not be brought to trial lest there he should impeach of complicity one whose birth and blood must be shielded from all scandal i bade him get what men he required and see the thing done with the least possible delay and thereupon i instantly withdrew from madrid and went to alcala  diego engaged five men to assist him in the task these were a young officer named enriquez a lackey named rubio the two aragonesemesa and insaustiand another whose name was bosque he clearly meant to take no chances but i incline to think that he overdid precaution and employed more hands than were necessary for the job however the six of them lurked in waiting on three successive nights for escovedo near his house in the little square of santiago at last on the night of easter monday march 31st they caught him and dispatched him he died almost before he realized himself beset from a swordthrust with which insausti transfixed him but there were at least half a dozen wounds in the body when it was found diego i have said was a man who made quite certain  no sooner was it done than they dispersed whilst the lackey rubio instantly quitting madrid brought me news of the deed to alcala and the assurance that no arrests had been made but there was a great ado in madrid upon the morrow as you may imagine for it is no everyday occurrence to find a royal secretary murdered in the streets  the alcaldes set out upon a rigorous search and they began by arresting and questioning all who attempted to leave the city on the next day they harassed with their perquisitions all those who let lodgings they were still at this work in the evening when i returned to madrid brought backas it would seemfrom my country rest by the news of this murder of my friend and colleague i bore myself as i should have done had i no knowledge of how the thing had been contrived that was a necessity as imperative as it was odious and no part of it more odious than the visit of condolence i was forced to pay to the escovedo family which i found plunged in grief  from the very outset suspicion pointed its finger at me although there were no visible traces to connect me with the deed rumour however was astir and as i had powerful friends so too i had the powerful enemies which envy must always be breeding for men in high places such as mine escovedos wife mistrusted me though at first she seems equally to have suspected in this deed the hand of the duke of alva who was hostile to don john and all his creatures very soon as a result of this came the court alcalde to visit and question me his stated object was in the hope that i might give him information which would lead to the discovery of the assassin but his real object rendered apparent by the searching insistent nature of his questions was to lead me to incriminate myself i presented a bold front i pretended to see in this perhaps the work of the flemish states i deploredthat i might remind him of itmy absence from madrid at the time  he was followed by another high official who came in simulated friendship to warn me that certain rumours linking me with the deed were in circulation in reality to trap me into some admission to watch my countenance for some betraying sign  i endured it stoutly but inwardly i was shaken as i wrote to philip giving him full details of what had been said and what answers i had returned what bitter draughts i had been forced to swallow  he wrote in reply i find that you answered very well continue to be prudent they will tell you a thousand things not for the sake of telling them but in the hope of drawing something out of you the bitter draughts you mention are inevitable but use all the dissimulation and address of which you are capable  we corresponded daily after that and i told him of every step i took how i kept my men about me for fear that if they attempted to leave madrid they would be arrested and how finally i contrived their departure one by one under conditions that placed them beyond all suspicion juan de mesa set out for aragon on a mission concerned with the administration of some property of the princess of ebolis rubio insausti and enriquez were each given an ensigns commission bearing the kings own signature and ordered to join the armies in various parts of italy the first was sent to milan the second to sicily and the last to naples bosque went back to aragon thus all were placed beyond the reach of the active justice of castile all save myselfand the king who wrote to me expressing his satisfaction that there had been no arrests  but rumour continued to give tongue and the burden of its tale was that the murder had been my work in complicity with the princess of eboli how they came to drag her name into the affair i do not know it may have been pure malice trading upon its knowledge of the relations between us she may have lent colour to the charge by her own precipitancy in denying it she announced indignantly that she was being accused almost before this had come to pass and as indignantly protested against the accusation and threatened those who dared to voice it  the end of it all was that a month later the escovedo family drew up a memorial for the consideration of the king in which they laid the murder to my charge and philip consented to receive don pedro de escovedothe dead mans sonand promised him that he would consider the memorial and that he would deliver up to justice whomsoever he thought right he was embarrassed by these demands of the escovedos my own danger his duty as king and his interests as an accomplice or rather as the originator of the deed  the escovedos were powerfully seconded by vasquez the secretary of the council a member of alvas party a secret enemy of my own consumed by jealousy of my power and no longer fearing to disclose himself and assail me since he believed himself possessed of the means of ruining me he spoke darkly to the king of a woman concerned in this business without yet daring to mention anne by name and urged him for the satisfaction of the state where evil rumours were abroad to order an inquiry that should reveal the truth of the affair  it was philip himself who informed me of what had passed sneering at the wildness of rumours that missed the truth so wildly and when i evinced distress at my position he sought to reassure me he even wrote to me after i had left him as long as i live you have nothing to fear others may change but i never change as you should know who know me  that was a letter that epitomized many others written me in those days to madrid from the escurial whither he had returned and those letters comforted me not only by their expressed assurances but by the greater assurance implicit in them of the kings good faith i had by now a great mass of his notes dealing with the escovedo business in almost every one of which he betrayed his own share as the chief murderer showing that i was no more than his dutiful instrument in that execution with those letters in my power what need i ever fear not philip himself would dare to betray me  but i went now in a new dreadthe dread of being myself murdered there were threats of it in the air the escovedo family and their partisans who included all my enemies and even some members of the eboli family who considered that i had sullied the honour of their name by my relations with anne talked openly of vengeance so that i was driven to surround myself by armed attendants whenever now i went abroad  i appealed again to philip to protect me i even begged him to permit me to retire from my ministerial office that thus the clamant envy that inspired my persecution might be deprived of its incentive finally i begged him to order me to stand my trial that thus since i was confident that no evidence could be produced against me i should force an acquittal from the courts and lay the matter to rest for all time  go and see the president of castile he bade me tell him the causes that led to the death of escovedo and then let him talk to don pedro de escovedo and to vasquez so as to induce them to desist  i did as i was bidden and when the president who was the bishop of pati had heard me he sent for my two chief enemies  i have don pedro he said your memorial to the king in which you accuse don antonio perez of the murder of your father and i am to assure you in the kings name that justice will be done upon the murderer whoever he may be without regard to rank but i am first to engage you to consider well what evidence you have to justify your charge against a person of such consideration for should your proofs be insufficient i warn you that matters are likely to take a bad turn for yourself finally before you answer me let me add upon my word as a priest that antonio perez is as innocent as i am  it was the truththe absolute truth so far as it was known to philip and to the bishopfor indeed i was no more than the instrument of my masters will  don pedro looked foolish almost awed he was as a man who suddenly becomes aware that he has missed stepping over the edge of a chasm in which destruction awaited him he may have bethought him at last that all his rantings had no better authority than suspicions which no evidence could support  sir he faltered since you tell me this i pledge you my word on behalf of myself and my family to make no more mention of this death against don antonio  the bishop swung then upon vasquez and his brow became furrowed with contemptuous anger  as for you sir you have heardwhich was more than your due for it is not your business by virtue of your office nor have you any obligations towards the deceased such as excuse don pedros rashness to pursue the murderers of escovedo your solicitude in this matter brings you under a suspicion the more odious since you are a priest i warn you sir to abstain for this affair is different far from anything that you imagine  but envy is a fierce goad a consuming irresistible passion corroding wisdom and deaf to all prudent counsels vasquez could not abstain ridden by his devil of spite and jealousy he would not pause until he had destroyed either himself or me  since escovedos immediate family now washed their hands of the affair vasquez sought out more distant relatives of the murdered man and stirred them up until they went in their turn to pester the courts not only with accusations against myself but with accusations that now openly linked with mine the name of the princess of eboli  we were driven to the brink of despair and in this anne wrote to philip it was a madness she made too great haste to excuse herself she demanded protection from vasquez and the evil rumours he was putting abroad implored the king to make an example of men who could push so far their daring and irreverence and to punish that moorish dog vasquezi dare say there was moorish blood in the fellows veinsas he deserved  i think our ruin dated from that letter philip sent for me to the escurial he wished to know more precisely what the accusations were i told him denying them then he desired of the princess proof of what she alleged against vasquez and she had no difficulty in satisfying him he seemed to believe our assurance that all was lies yet he did not move to punish vasquez but then i knew that sluggishness was his great characteristic time and i are one he would say when i pressed on matters  after that it was open war in the council between me and vasquez the climax came when i was at the escurial i had sent a servant to vasquez for certain state papers to be submitted to the king he brought them and folded in them a fiercely denunciatory letter full of insults and injuries not the least of which was the imputation that my blood was not clean my caste not good  in a passion i sought philip beside myself almost trembling under the insult  see sire what this moorish thief has dared to write me it transcends all bearing either you take satisfaction for me of these insults or you permit me to take it for myself  he appeared to share my indignation promised to give me leave to proceed against the man but bade me first wait a while until certain business in the competent hands of vasquez should be transacted but weeks grew into months and nothing was done we were in april of 79 a year after the murder and i was grown so uneasy so sensitive to dangers about me that i dared no longer visit anne and then philips confessor frey diego de chaves came to me one day with a request on the kings part that i should make my peace with vasquez  if he will retract was my condition and chaves went to see my enemy what passed between them what vasquez may have told him what he may have added to those rumours of my relations with anne i do not know but i know that from that date there was a change in the kings attitude towards me a change in the tone of the letters that he sent me and this continuing i wrote to him at last releasing him from his promise to afford me satisfaction against vasquez assuring him that since himself he could forgive the injuries against us both i could easily forgive those i had received myself and finally begging his permission to resign my office and retire  anne had contributed to this she had sent for me and in tears had besought me to make my peace with vasquez since the king desired it and this was no time in which to attempt resistance to his wishes i remained with her some hours comforting her for she was in the very depths of despair persuaded that we were both ruined and inconsolable in the thought that the blame of this was all her own  it may be that i was watched perhaps more closely than i imagined it may be that spies were close about us set by the jealous philip who desired confirmation or refutation of the things he had been told the rumours that were gnawing at his vitals  i left her little dreaming that i was never to see her again in this life that night i was arrested at my house by the court alcalde upon an order from the king the paltry reason advanced was my refusal to make my peace with vasquez and this when already the king was in possession of my letter acknowledging my readiness to do so for the king was in madrid unknown to me he came it seems that he might be present at another arrest effected that same night from the porch of the church of santa maria mayor he watched his alguazils enter the house of the princess of eboli bring her forth bestow her in a waiting carriage that was to bear her away to the fortress of pinto to an imprisonment which was later exchanged for exile to pastrana lasting as long as life itself  to sin against a prince is worse it seems than to sin against god himself for god forgives but princes wounded in their vanity and pride know nothing of forgiveness  i was kept for four months a prisoner by the alcalde no charge being preferred against me then because my health was suffering grievously from confinement and the anxiety of suspense i was moved to my own house and detained there for another eight months under close guard my friends besought the king in vain either to restore me to liberty or to bring me to trial he told them the affair was of a nature very different from anything they deemed and so evaded all demands  in the summer of 1580 philip went to lisbon to take formal possession of the crown of portugal which he had inherited i sent my wife to him to intercede for me but he refused to see her and so i was left to continue the victim of his vindictive lethargy after a year of this upon my giving a formal promise to renounce all hostility towards vasquez and never seek to do him harm in any way i was accorded some degree of liberty i was allowed to go out and to receive visitors but not to visit any one myself  followed a further pause vasquez was now a man of power for my party had fallen with me and his own had supplanted it in the royal councils it was by his work that at last in 84 i was brought to trial upon a charge of corruption and misappropriation i knew that my enemies had meanwhile become possessed of enriquez and that he was ready to give evidence that he was making no secret of his share in the death of escovedo and that the king was being pressed by the escovedos to bring me to trial upon the charge of murder instead the other charge alone was preferred  it was urged against me that i had kept a greater state than any grandee of spain that when i went abroad i did so with a retinue befitting a prince that i had sold my favour and accepted bribes from foreign princes to guard their interests with the king of spain  they sentenced me to two years imprisonment in a fortress to be followed by ten years of exile and i was to make within nine days restitution of some twenty million maravedisthe alleged extent of my misappropriationsbesides some jewels and furniture which i had received from the princess of eboli and which i was now ordered to deliver up to the heirs of the late prince           ten thousand pounds but with at least five times the           present purchasing power of that sum  perquisitions had been made in my house and my papers ransacked well i knew what they had sought for the thought of the letters that had passed between philip and myself at the time of escovedos death must now be troubling his peace of mind i had taken due precautions when first i had seen the gathering clouds foreshadowing this change of weather i had bestowed those papers safely in two ironbound chests which had been concealed away against the time when i might need them to save my neck and because now he failed to find what he soughtthe evidence of his own share in the deed and his present base duplicityphilip dared not slip the leash from those dogs who would be at my throat for the murder of escovedo that was why he bade them proceed against me only on the lesser charge of corruption  i was taken to the fortress of turruegano and there they came to demand of me the surrender of my papers which the alcalde had failed to discover at my house i imagined the uneasiness of philip in dispatching those emissaries i almost laughed as i refused those papers were my buckler against worse befalling me than had befallen already even now if too hard pressed i might find the opportunity of breaking my bonds by means of them i sometimes wonder why i did not apply myself to that yet there is small cause for wonder really from boyhood almost king philip had been my master loyalty to him was a habit that went to the very roots of my being i had served him without conscience and without scruple and the notion of betraying him save as a very last and very desperate resource was inconceivable i do not think he ever knew the depth and breadth of that loyalty of mine  my refusal led those sons of dogs to attempt to frighten my wife with threats of unmentionable horrors unless she delivered up the papers i had secreted she and our children were threatened with perpetual imprisonment on bread and water if she persisted in refusing to surrender them but she held out against all threats and remained firm even under the oily persecution to the same end of philips confessor frey diego finally i was notified that in view of her stubbornness and my own she and our children were cast into prison and that there they would remain until i saw fit to become submissive to the royal will  it is a subtle form of mental torture that will bid a man contemplate the suffering for his sake to which those who are dear to him are being subjected  i raged and stormed before the officer who brought me this infamous piece of news i gave vent to my impotent anger in blasphemous expressions that were afterwards to be used against me the officer was subtly sympathetic  i understand your grief don antonio he said believe me i feel for youso much that i urge you to set an end to the captivity of those dear ones who are innocent who are suffering for your sake  and so make an end of myself i asked him fiercely  reflection may show that even that is your duty in the circumstances  i looked into his smug face and i was within an ace of striking him then i controlled myself and my will was snapped  very well i said the papers shall be surrendered let my steward diego martinez come to me here and he shall receive my instructions to deliver the chests containing them to my wife that she in turn may deliver them to the king  he withdrew well pleased no doubt he would take great credit to himself for this within three days such haste did they make my faithful steward stood before me in my prison at turruegano  you conceive the despair that had overwhelmed me after giving my consent the consciousness that it was my life i was surrendering with those papersthat without them i should be utterly defenceless but in the three days that were sped i had been thinking and not quite in vain  martinez left me with precise instructions as a result of which those two ironbound chests locked and sealed were delivered together with the keys to the royal confessor martinez was asked what they contained  i do not know he answered my orders are merely to deliver them  i can conceive the kings relief and joy in his conviction that thus had he drawn my teeth that betide now what might i could never defend or justify myself the immediate sequel took me by surprise we were at the end of 85 and my health was suffering from my confinement and its privations and now my captivity was mitigated my wife juana even succeeded in obtaining permission that i should be taken home to madrid and there for fourteen months i enjoyed a half liberty and received the visits of my old friends among whom were numbered most of the members of the court  i imagined at first that since my teeth were drawn the king despised me and intended nothing further but i was soon to be disillusioned on that score it began with the arrest of martinez on a charge of complicity in the murder of escovedo and then one day i was again arrested without warning and carried off for a while to the fortress of pinto thence i was brought back in close captivity to madrid and there i learnt at last what had been stirring  in the previous summer king philip had gone into aragon to preside over the cortes and vasquez who had gone with him had seized the opportunity to examine the ensign enriquez who had meanwhile denounced himself of complicity in the murder of escovedo enriquez made a full confessionturned accuser under a promise of full pardon for himself and charged mesa rubio and my steward martinez with complicity denouncing martinez as the ringleader of the business the other two insausti and bosque were already dead  immediately vasquez attempted to seize the survivors but mesa had gone to earth in aragon and rubio was with him martinez alone remained and him they seized and questioned he remained as cool and master of himself as he was true and loyal to me their threats made no impression on him he maintained that the tale was all a lie begotten of spite that i had been escovedos best friend that i had been greatly afflicted by his death and that no man could have done more than i to discover his real murderers they confronted him with enriquez and the confrontation no whit disturbed him he handled the traitor contemptuously as a perjured suborned witness a false servant a man who as he proceeded to show was a scoundrel steeped in crime whose word was utterly worthless and who no doubt had been bought to bring these charges against his sometime master  the situation thanks to martinezs stoutness had reached a deadlock between the assertions of one man who was revealed to the judges for a worthless scoundrel and the denials of the other against whom nothing was known it was impossible for the court of inquiry to reach any conclusion at least another witness must be obtained and vasquez laboured with all his might and arts and wiles to draw rubio out of aragon into the clutches of the justice of castile but he laboured in vain for i had secretly found the means to instruct my trusty mesa to retain the fellow where he was  in this inconclusive state of things the months dragged on and my captivity continued i wrote to philip imploring his mercy complaining of these unjust delays on the part of vasquez which threatened to go on forever and begging his majesty to command the conclusion of the affair that was in august of 89 you see how time had sped all that came of my appeal was at first an increased rigour of imprisonment and then a visit from vasquez to examine and question me upon the testimony of enriquez as you can imagine the attempt to lure me into selfbetrayal was completely fruitless my enemy withdrew baffled to go question my wife but without any better success  nevertheless vasquez proclaimed the charge established against myself and martinez and allowed us ten days in which to prepare our answer immediately upon that don pedro de escovedo lodged a formal indictment against us and i was put into irons  to rebut the evidence of one single tainted witness i produced six witnesses of high repute including the secretary of the council of aragon they testified for me that i was at alcala at the time of escovedos death that i had always been escovedos friend that i was a good christian incapable of such a deed and that enriquez as an evil man whose word was worthless a false witness inspired by vengeance  thus in spite of the illwill of my judges and the hatred of my enemies it was impossible legally to condemn me upon the evidence there were documents enough in existence to have proved my part in the affair but not one of them dared the king produce since they would also show me to have been no more than his instrument and so desiring my death as it was now clear he did he must sit impotently brooding there with what patience he could command like a gigantic evil spider into whose web i obstinately refused to fling myself  my hopes began to revive when at last the court announced that it postponed judgment whilst fresh evidence was sought there was an outcry of indignation on all sides this was a tyrannical abuse of power men said and i joined my voice to theirs to demand that judgment be pronounced and my liberty restored to me pointing out that i had already languished years in captivity without any charge against mebeyond that of corruption which had been purged by nowhaving been established  then at last the king stirred in his diabolical underground manner he sent his confessor to me in prison the friar was mild and benign  my poor friend he said why do you allow yourself to suffer in this fashion when a word from you can set a term to it confess the deed without fear since at the same time you can advance a peremptory reason of state to justify it  it was too obvious a trap did i make confession indeed upon such grounds they would demand of me proof of what i asserted and meanwhile the documents to prove it had been extorted from me and had passed into the kings possession in the result i should be ruined completely as one who to the crime of murder added a wicked insidious falsehood touching the honour of his king  but i said naught of this i met guile with guile alas i have been tempted i answered him but i thank heaven i have known even in my extremity how to resist the temptation of such disloyalty i cannot forget brother diego that amongst the letters from the king was one that said be not troubled by anything your enemies may do against you i shall not abandon you and be sure their animosity cannot prevail but you must understand that it must not be discovered that this death took place by my order  but if the king were to release you from that command he asked  when his majesty in his goodness and generosity sends me a note in his own hand to say you may confess that it was by my express order that you contrived the death of escovedo then i shall thankfully account myself absolved from the silence his service imposes on me  he looked at me narrowly he may have suspected that i saw through the transparent device to ruin me and that in a sense i mocked him with my answer  he withdrew and for some days nothing further happened then the rigours of my captivity were still further increased i was allowed to communicate with no one and even the alguazil who guarded me was forbidden under pain of death to speak to me  and in january i was visited by vasquez who brought me a letter from the king not indeed addressed to me and in the terms i had suggested but to vasquez himself and it ran  you may tell antonio perez from me and if necessary show him this letter that he is aware of my knowledge of having ordered him to put escovedo to death and of the motives which he told me existed for this measure and that as it imports for the satisfaction of my conscience that it be ascertained whether or not those motives were sufficient i order him to state them in the fullest detail and to advance proof of what he then alleged to me which is not unknown to yourself since i have clearly imparted it to you when i shall have seen his answers and the reasons he advances i shall give order that such measures be taken as may befit  i the king  you see what a twist he had given to the facts it was i who had urged the death of escovedo it was i who had advanced reasons which he had considered sufficient trusting to my word and it was because of this he had consented to give the order let me confess so much let me prove it and prove too that the motives i had advanced were sound ones or i must be destroyed that was all clear and that false king held fast the two trunks of papers that would have given the lie to this atrocious note of his that would have proved that again and again i had shielded escovedo from the death his king designed for him  i looked into the face of my enemy and there was a twisted smile on my lips  what fresh trap is this i asked him king philip never wrote that note  you should know his hand look closer he bade me harshly  i know his handnone better but i claim too to know something of his heart and i know that it is not the heart of a perjured liar such as penned those lines  that was as near as a man dared to go in expressing his true opinion of a prince  for the rest i said i do not understand it i know nothing of the death of escovedo i have nothing to add to what already i have said in open court unless it be to protest against you who are a passionate hostile judge  six times in the month that followed did vasquez come to me accompanied now by a notary to press me to confess at last seeing that no persuasions could bend my obstinacy they resorted to other measures  you will drive us to use the torture upon you so that we may loosen your tongue snarled vasquez fiercely enraged by my obduracy  i laughed at the threat i was a noble of spain by birth immune from torture they dared not violate the law but they did dare there was no law human or divine the king was not prepared to violate so that he might slake his vengeance upon the man who had dared to love where he had loved  they delivered me naked into the hands of the executioner and i underwent the question at the rope they warned me that if i lost my life or the use of any of my limbs it would be solely by my own fault i advanced my nobility and the state of my health as allsufficient reasons why the torture should not be applied to me reminding them that for eleven years already i had suffered persecution and detention so that my vigour was all gone  for the last time they summoned me to answer as the king desired and then since i still refused the executioner was recalled he crossed my arms upon my breast bound them securely thrust a long rod beneath the cord and seizing one end of this in either hand gave the first turn  i screamed i could not help it enfeebled as i was but my spirit being stouter than my flesh i still refused to answer not indeed until they had given the rope eight turns not until it had sliced through my muscles and crushed the bone of one of my arms so that to this day it remains of little use to me did they conquer me i had reached the limit of endurance  in christs name release me i gasped i will say anything you wish  released at last half swooning smothered in blood agonized by pain i confessed that it was myself had procured the death of escovedo for reasons of state and acting upon the orders of the king the notary made haste to write down my words and when i had done it was demanded of me that i should advance proof of the state reasons which i had alleged  oh i had never been under any delusion on that score as i have shown you the demand did not take me by surprise at all i was waiting for it knowing that my answer to it would pronounce my doom but i delivered it none the less  my papers have been taken from me and without them i can prove nothing with them i could prove my words abundantly  they left me then on the morrow as i afterwards learnt they read my confession to my devoted martinez and the poor fellow who hitherto had remained staunch and silent under every test seeing that there was no further purpose to be served by silence gave them the confirmation they desired of enriquezs accusation  meanwhile i was very ill in a raging fever as you may well conceive and in answer to my prayer my own doctor was permitted to visit me in prison he announced that he found my case extremely grave and that i must perish unless i were relieved as a consequence and considering my weakness and the uselessness just then of both my arms one of which was broken first a page of my own then other servants and lastly my wife were allowed to come and tend me  that was at the end of february by the middle of april my wounds had healed i had recovered the use of my limbs though one remains half maimed for life and my condition had undergone a very considerable improvement but of this i allowed no sign to show no suspicion even i continued to lie there day after day in a state of complete collapse so that whilst i was quickly gathering strength it was believed by my gaolers that i was steadily sinking and that i should soon be dead  my only hope you see lay now in evasion and it was for this that i was thus craftily preparing once out of castile i could deal with philip and he should not find me as impotent as toothless as he believed but i go too fast  one night at last on april 20th by when all measures had been concerted and gil de mesa awaited me outside with horsesthe whole having been contrived by my dear wifei made the attempt my apparent condition had naturally led to carelessness in guarding me who would guard a helpless dying man soon after dark i rose donned over my own clothes a petticoat and a hooded cloak belonging to my wife and thus muffed walked out of my cell past the guards and so out of the prison unchallenged i joined gil de mesa discarded my feminine disguise mounted and set out with him upon that ninetymile journey into aragon  we reached saragossa in safety and there my first act was to surrender myself to the grand justiciary of aragon to stand my trial for the murder of escovedo with which i was charged  it must have sent a shudder through the wicked philip when he received news of that a very stricken man he must have been for he must have suspected something of the truth that if i dared after all the evidence amassed now against me including my own confession under torture openly to seek a judgment it was because i must possess some unsuspected means of establishing all the truththe truth that must make his own name stink in the nostrils of the world and so it was have you supposed that antonio perez who had spent his life in studying the underground methods of burrowing statecraft had allowed himself to be taken quite so easily in their snare have you imagined that when i sent for diego martinez to come to me at turruegano and instructed him touching the surrender of those two chests of documents that i did not also instruct him carefully touching the abstraction in the first instance of a few serviceable papers and the renewal of the seals that should conceal the fact that he had tampered with the chests if you have thought that you have done me less than justice there had been so much correspondence between philip and myself so many notes had passed touching the death of escovedo and there was that habit of philips of writing his replies in marginal notes to my own letters and so returning them that it was unthinkable he should have kept them all in his memory and the abstraction of three or four could not conceivably be detected by him  ever since then those few letters of a most deeply incriminating character selected with great acumen by my steward had secretly remained in the possession of my wife yet i had not dared produce them in castile knowing that i should instantly have been deprived of them and with them of my last hope they remained concealed against precisely such a time as this when beyond the immediate reach of philips justice i should startle the world and clear my own character by their production  you know the ancient privileges enjoyed by aragon privileges of which the aragonese are so jealous that a king of castile may not assume the title of king of aragon until bareheaded he shall have received from the grand justiciary of aragon the following admonition we who are of equal worth and greater power than you constitute you our king on the condition that you respect our privileges and not otherwise and to that the king must solemnly bind himself by oath whose violation would raise in revolt against him the very cobbles of the streets no king of spain had ever yet been found to dare violate the constitution and the fueros of aragon the independence of their cortes or parliament composed of the four orders of the state the grand justiciarys court was superior to any royally constituted tribunal in the kingdom to that court it was the privilege of any man to appeal for justice in any cause and there justice was measured out with a stern impartiality that had not its like in any other state of europe  that was the tribunal to which i made surrender of my person and my cause there was an attempt on the part of philip to seize me and drag me back to castile and his vengeance his officers broke into the prison for that purpose and already i was in their power when the men of the justiciary followed by an excited mob which threatened open rebellion at this violation of their ancient rights delivered me from their hands  baffled in thisand i can imagine his fury which has since been vented on the aragonesephilip sent his representatives and his jurists to accuse me before the court of the grand justiciary and to conduct my prosecution  the trial began exciting the most profound interest not only in aragon but also in castile which as i afterwards learnt had openly rejoiced at my escape it proceeded with the delays and longueurs that are inseparable from the sluggish majesty of the law one of these pauses i wrote to philip inviting him to desist and to grant me the liberty to live out my days in peace with my family in some remote corner of his kingdom i warned him that i was not helpless before his persecution as he imagined that whilst i had made surrender of two chests of papers i yet retained enough authentic documentsletters in his own handto make my innocence and his guilt apparent in a startling degree with very evil consequences to himself  his answer was to seize my wife and children and cast them into prison and then order the courts of madrid to pronounce sentence of death against me for the murder of escovedo such were the sops with which he sought to quench his vindictive rage  thereupon the trial proceeded i prepared my long memorial of the affair supporting it with proofs in the shape of those letters i had retained and then at last philip of spain took fright he was warned by one of his representatives that there was little doubt i should be acquitted on all counts and too late he sought to save his face by ordering the cessation of the prosecution he had instructed  he stated that since i had chosen a line of defence to answer whichas it could be answeredit would be necessary to touch upon matters of a secrecy that was inviolable and to introduce personages whose reputation and honour was of more consequence to the state than the condemnation of antonio perez he preferred to renounce the prosecution before the tribunal of aragon but he added a certificate upon his royal word to the effect that my crimes were greater than had ever been the crimes of any man and that whilst he renounced the prosecution before the courts of aragon he retained the right to demand of me an account of my actions before any other tribunal at any future time  my acquittal followed immediately and immediately again that was succeeded by fresh charges against me on behalf of the king first it was sought to prove that i had procured the death of two of my servantsa charge which i easily dispersed by proving them to have died natural deaths then it was sought to prosecute me on the charge of corruption for which i had once already been prosecuted condemned and punished confidently i demanded my release and philip must have ground his teeth in rage to see his prey escaping him to see himself the butt of scorn and contempt for the wrongs that it became clear he had done me  one weapon remained to him and a terrible weapon thisthe holy office of the inquisition a court before which all temporal courts must bow and quail he launched its power against me and behold me in the moment when i accounted myself the victor in the unequal contest accused of the dread sin of heresy words lightly weigheduttered by me in prison under stresshad been zealously gathered up y spies  on one occasion i had exclaimed i think god sleeps where my affairs are concerned and i am in danger of losing my faith the holy office held this to be a scandalous proposition offensive to pious ears  again when i heard of the arrest of my wife and children i had cried out in rage god sleeps god sleeps there cannot be a god  this they argued at length to be rank heresy since it is mans duty positively to believe and who does not believe is an infidel  yet again it seems i had exclaimed should things so come to pass i shall refuse to believe in god this was accounted blasphemous scandalous and not without suspicion of heresy  upon these grounds the supreme council of the inquisition at madrid drew up its impeachment and delivered it to the inquisitors of aragon at saragossa these at once sent their familiars to demand the surrender of me from the grand justiciary in whose hands i still remained the grand justiciary incontinently refused to yield me up  thereupon the three inquisitors drew up a peremptory demand addressed to the lieutenants of the justiciary summoning them by virtue of holy obedience under pain of greater excommunication of a fine in the case of each of them of one thousand ducats and other penalties to which they might later be condemned to deliver me up within three hours to the pursuivants of the holy office  this was the end of the justiciarys resistance he dared not refuse a demand so framed and surrender of me was duly made but the news of what was doing had run abroad i had no lack of friends whom i instantly warned of what was afoot and they had seen to it that the knowledge spread in an inflammatory manner saragossa began to stir at once here was a thinly masked violation of their ancient privileges if they suffered this precedent of circumventing their rights what was to become of their liberties in future who would be secure against an unjust persecution for their sympathies were all with me throughout that trial  i was scarcely in the prison of the holy office before the dread cry of contrafueros was ringing through the streets of saragossa summoning the citizens to arm and come forth in defence of their inviolable rights they stormed the palace of the grand justiciary demanded that he should defend the fueros to whose guardianship he had been elected receiving no satisfaction they attacked the palace of the inquisition clamouring insistently that i should immediately be returned to the justiciarys prison whence i had so unwarrantably been taken  the inquisitors remained firm a while but the danger was increasing hourly in the end they submitted for the sake of their skins and considering no doubt a later vengeance for this outrage upon their holy authority but it was not done until faggots had been stacked against the holy house and the exasperated mob had threatened to burn them out of it  castilian hypocrites had been the insurgent roar surrender your prisoner or you shall be roasted in the fire in which you roast so many  blood was shed in the streets the kings representative died of wounds that he received in the affray whilst the viceroy himself was assailed and compelled to intervene and procure my deliverance  for the moment i was out of danger but for the moment only there was no question now of my enlargement the grand justiciary intimidated by what had taken place by the precise expression of the kings will dared not set me at liberty and then the holy office under the direction of the king went to work in that subterranean way which it has made its own legal quibbles were raised to soothe the sensibilities of the aragonese with respect to my removal from the justiciarys prison to that of the holy office strong forces of troops were brought to saragossa to overawe the plebeian insolence and so by the following september all the preliminaries being concluded the inquisition came in force and in form to take possession of me  the mob looked on and murmured but it was intimidated by the show of ordered force it had perhaps tired a little of the whole affair and did not see that it should shed its blood and lay up trouble for itself for the sake of one who after all was of no account in the affairs of aragon i stood upon the threshold of my ruin all my activities were to go unrewarded doom awaited me and then the unexpected happened the alguazil of the holy office was in the very act of setting the gyves upon my legs when the first shot was fired followed almost at once by a fusillade  it was gil de mesa faithfullest servant that ever any man possessed he had raised an armed band consisting of some aragonese gentlemen and their servants and with this he fell like a thunderbolt upon the castilian menatarms and the familiars of the inquisition the alguazil fled leaving me one leg free the other burdened by the gyve and as he fled so fled all others being thus taken unawares the inquisitors scuttled to the nearest shelter the viceroy threw himself into his house and barricaded the door there was no one to guide no one to direct the soldiery in these circumstances and accounting themselves overpowered offered no resistance they too fled before the fusillade and the hail of shot that descended on them  before i realized what had happened the iron had been struck from my leg i was mounted on a horse and with gil at my side i was galloping out of saragossa by the gate of santa engracia and breasting the slopes with little cause to fear pursuit just yet such was the disorder we had left behind  and there very briefly you have the story of my sufferings and my escapes not entirely to be baulked numerous arrests were made by the inquisitors in saragossa when order was at last restored there followed an autodafe the most horrible and vindictive of all those horrors in which many suffered for having displayed the weakness of charity towards a persecuted man and since my body was no longer in their clutches they none the less sentenced me to death as contumaciously absent and my effigy was burnt in the holy fires they lighted amongst the human candles which they offered up for the greater honour and glory of a merciful god let me say no more lest i blaspheme in earnest  after months of wandering and hiding gil and i made our way here into navarre where we remain the guests of protestant king henri iv who does not love king philip any better since he has heard my story  still king philips vengeance does not sleep twice has he sent after me his assassinssince assassination is the only weapon now remaining to him but his poor tools have each time been taken exposed to philips greater infamy and shameand hanged as they deserve who can so vilely serve so vile a master it has even been sought to bribe my faithful gil de mesa into turning his hand against me and that attempt too has been given the fullest publication meanwhile my death today could no longer avail philip very much my memorial is published throughout europe for all to read it has been avidly read until philip of spain has earned the contempt of every upright man in his own dominions the voice of execration has been raised against him one of his own nobles has contemptuously announced that spain under philip has become unsafe for any gentleman and that a betrayal of a subject by his king is without parallel in history  that is some measure of vengeance but if i am spared i shall not leave it there henry of navarre is on the point of turning catholic that his interests may be better served elizabeth of england remains in her dominions where thrives the righteous hatred of philip and all the evil that he stands for i shall find a welcome and a channel for the activities that are to show him that antonio perez lives i have sent him word that when he is weary of the conflict he can signify his surrender by delivering from their prison my wife and children upon whom he seeks still to visit some of the vengeance i have succeeded in eluding when he does that then will i hold my hand but not before  that madame is my story said don antonio after a pause and from narrowing eyes looked at the beauty who had heard him through  daylight had faded whilst the tale was telling night was come and lights had long since been fetched the curtains drawn over the long windows that looked out across the parkland to the river  twice only had he paused in all that narrative once when he had described the avowal of his love for anne princess of eboli when a burst of sobs from her had come to interrupt him again when a curious birdnote had rung out upon the gathering dusk then he stopped to listen  curious that he had saidan eagles cry i have not heard it these many months not since i left the hills of aragon  thereafter he had continued to the end  considering her now his glance inscrutable he said  you weep madame tell me what is it that has moved youthe contemplation of my sufferings or of your own duplicity  she started up very white her eyes scared  i do not understand you what do you mean sir  i mean madame that god did not give you so much beauty that you should use it in the decoying of an unfortunate that you should hire it at an assassins fee to serve the crapulous king of spain  he rose and towered before her a figure at once of anger dignity and some compassion  so much ardour from youth and beauty to age and infirmity was in itself suspicious the catholic king has the guile of satan i remembered i wondered and hoped my suspicions might be unfounded yet prudence made me test them that the danger if it existed should manifest itself and be destroyed so i came to tell you all my story so that if you did the thing i feared you might come to the knowledge of precisely what it was you did i have learnt whilst here that what i suspected isalas quite true you were a lure a decoy sent to work my ruin to draw me into a trap where daggers waited for me why did you do this what was the bribe that could corrupt you lovely lady  sobs shook her her will gave way before his melancholy sternness  i do not know by what wizardry you have discovered it she cried it was true but it is true no longer i knew not what i did by that window across the meadows you can reach the river in safety she rose controlling her emotion that she might instruct him they wait for you in the enclosed garden  he smiled wistfully  they waited madame they wait no longer unless it be for death that eagles cry thrice repeated was the signal from my faithful gil not only that the trap was discovered but that those who baited it were taken suspecting what i did i took my measures ere i came antonio perez as i have told you is not an easy man to murder unlike philip i do not make war on women and i have no reckoning to present to you but i am curious madame to know what led you to this baseness  ii thought you evil andand they bribed me i was offered ten thousand ducats for your head we are very poor we chantenacs and so i fell but sirsirshe was on her knees to him now and she had caught his hand in herspoor as i am all that i have is yours to do with as you will to help to avenge yourself upon that spanish monster take what you will take all i have  his smile grew gentler gently he raised her  madame he said i am myself a sinner as i have shown you a man unequal to resisting temptation when it took me in its trammels of all that you offer i will take only the right to this kiss  and bending he bore her hand to his lips  then he went out to join gil and his men who waited in the courtyard guarding three prisoners they had taken  perez considered them by the light of the lantern that gil held aloft for him  one of you he announced shall return to castile and give tidings to philip his master that antonio perez leaves for england and the court of elizabeth to aid her by his knowledge of the affairs of spain in her measures against the catholic king and to continue his holy work which is to make the name of philip ii stink in the nostrils of all honest men one of you i will spare for that purpose you shall draw lots for it in the morning the other two must hang     iv the night of charitythe case of the lady alice lisle   of all the cases tried in the course of that terrible circuit justly known as the bloody assizes the only one that survives at all in the popular memory is the case of the lady alice lisle her advanced age the fact that she was the first woman known in english history to have suffered death for no worse an offence than that of having exercised the feminine prerogative of mercy and the further fact that even so this offencetechnical as it waswas never fully proved against her are all circumstances which have left their indelible stamp of horror upon the public mind there is also the further circumstance that hers was the first case tried in the west by that terrible chief justice baron jeffreys of wem  but the feature that renders her case peculiarly interesting to the historical psychologistand it is a feature that is in danger of being overlookedis that she cannot really be said to have suffered for the technical offence for which she took her trial that was the pretext rather than the cause in reality she was the innocent victim of a relentless undiscerning nemesis  the battle of sedgemoor had been fought and lost by the protestant champion james duke of monmouth in the west which had answered the dukes summons to revolt there was established now a horrible reign of terror reflecting the bigoted pitiless vindictive nature of the king faversham had left colonel percy kirke in command at bridgwater a ruthless ruffian who at one time had commanded the tangier garrison and whose men were full worthy of their commander kirkes lambs they were called in an irony provoked by the emblem of the paschal lamb on the flag of this the first tangier regiment originally levied to wage war upon the infidel  from bridgwater colonel kirke made a horrible punitive progress to taunton where he put up at the white hart inn now there was a very solid signpost standing upon a triangular patch of green before the door of the white hart and colonel kirke conceived the quite facetious notion of converting this advertisement of hospitality into a gallowsa signpost of temporal welfare into a signpost of eternity so forth he fetched the prisoners he had brought in chains from bridgwater and proceeded without any form of trial whatsoever to string them up before the inn the story runs that as they were hoisted to that improvised gibbet kirke and his officers standing at the windows raised their glasses to pledge their happy deliverance then when the victims began to kick convulsively kirke would order the drums to strike up so that the gentlemen might have music for their better dancing  the colonel you see was a humorist as humour was then understood upon the northern shores of africa where he had been schooled  when eventually colonel kirke was recalled and reprimanded it was not because of his barbarities many of which transcend the possibilities of decent printbut because of a lenity which this venal gentleman began to display when he discovered that many of his victims were willing to pay handsomely for mercy  meanwhile under his reign of terror men who had cause to fear the terrible hand of the kings vengeance went into hiding wherever they could among those who escaped into hampshire thinking themselves safer in a county that had not participated in the war were a dissenting parson named george hicks who had been in monmouths army and a lawyer named richard nelthorp outlawed for participation in the rye house plot in his desperate quest for shelter hicks bethought him of the charitable nonconformist lady of moyles court the widow of that john lisle who had been one of cromwells lords commissioners of the great seal and most active in bringing king charles i to justice  john lisle had fled to switzerland at the restoration but stuart vengeance had followed him set a price upon his head and procured his murder at lausanne that was twenty years ago since then his lady because she was known to have befriended and sheltered many royalists and because she had some stout tory friends to plead for her was allowed to remain in tranquil possession of her estates and there the lady alice lisleso called by courtesy since cromwells titles did not at law survive the restorationmight have ended her days in peace but that it was written that those who hated herinnocent and aged though she wasfor the name she bore who included her in the rancour which had procured her husbands assassination were to be fully satisfied and the instrument of fate was this parson hicks he prevailed upon dunne a baker of warminster and a nonconformist to convey to the lady lisle his prayer for shelter with that message dunne set out on july 25th for ellingham a journey of some twenty miles he went by way of fovant and chalk to salisbury plain but as he did not know the way thence he sought out a coreligionist named barter who undertook for a consideration to go with him and direct him  together the pair came in the late afternoon of that saturday to the handsome house of moyles court and to my ladys steward who received them dunne who appears to have been silly and imprudent states that he is sent to know if my lady will entertain a minister named hicks  carpenter the steward a staid elderly fellow took fright at once although he may not have associated an absconding presbyterian parson with the late rebellion he must have supposed at least that he was one of those against whom there were warrants for preaching in forbidden private meetings so to her ladyship above stairs carpenter conveyed a warning with the message  but that slight frail homely lady of seventy with kindly eyes of a faded blue smiled upon his fears she had sheltered fugitives beforein the old days of the commonwealthand nothing but good had ever come of it she would see this messenger  with misgivings carpenter haled dunne into her presence and left them alone together the impression conveyed by dunne was that hicks was in hiding from the warrants that were out against all nonconformist preachers but when he mentioned that hicks had a companion she desired to know his name  i do not know my lady but i do not think he has been in the army either  she considered a while but in the end pity conquered doubt in her sweetly charitable soul  very well she said i will give them entertainment for a week bring them on tuesday after dark and come by the back way through the orchard that they may not be seen  and upon this she rose and took up an ebony cane herself to reconduct him and to see to his entertainment before he left not until they came to the kitchen did she realize that he had a companion at sight of barter who rose respectfully when she entered she checked turned to dunne and whispered something to which his answer provoked from her a laugh  now barter intrigued by this whispering and laughing of which he deemed himself the object questioned dunne upon it as they rode forth again together  she asked me if you knew aught of the business replied dunne and i answered no  business sayst thou quoth barter what business  sure the business on which we came dunne evaded and he laughed  it was an answer that left barter uneasy nor was his mind set at rest by the parting words with which dunne accompanied the halfcrown for his services  this is but an earnest of whats to come if you will meet me here on tuesday to show me the way to moyles court again i shall be bringing two gentlemen with mewealthy men of a halfscore thousand pounds a year apiece i tell you there will be a fine booty for my part so fine that i shall never want for money again all the days of my life and so that you meet us here you too may count upon a handsome reward  consenting barter went his ways home but as he pondered dunnes silly speech and marvelled that honest men should pay so disproportionately for an honest service he came to the reasonable conclusion that he had to do with rebels this made him so uneasy that he resolved at last to lodge information with the nearest justice  now it happened by the irony of fate that the justice sought by barter was one colonel penruddockthe vindictive son of that penruddock whom the late john lislewhilst lord president of the high courthad sentenced to death some thirty years ago for participation in an unsuccessful wiltshire rising against the commonwealth  the colonel a lean stark man of fortyfive heard with interest barters story  art an honest fellow he commended him what are the names of these rogues  the fellow named no names sir  well well we shall discover that for ourselves when we come to take them at this trystingplace whither do you say you are to conduct them  to moyles court sir where my lady lisle is to give them entertainment  the colonel stared a moment then a heavy smile came to light the saturnine face under the heavy periwig beyond that he gave no sign of what was passing in his mind  you may go he said slowly at last be sure we shall be at the tryst to take these rascals  but the colonel did not keep his promise to barters surprise there were no soldiers at the tryst on salisbury plain on the following tuesday and he was suffered to lead dunne and the two men with him the short corpulent mr hicks and the long lean nelthorpto moyles court without interference  the rich reward that dunne had promised him amounted in actual fact to five shillings that he had from nelthorpe at parting puzzled by colonel penruddocks failure to do his part barter went off at once to the colonels house to inform him that the pair were now at lady lisles  why that is very well said the colonel his smile more sinister than ever trouble not yourself about that  and barter the unreasoning instrument of fate was not to know that the apprehending of a couple of traitorous jack presbyters was of small account to colonel penruddock by comparison with the satisfaction of the bloodfeud between himself and the house of lisle  meanwhile the fugitives were being entertained at moyles court and whilst they sat at supper in a room abovestairs dunne being still of the party my lady came in person to see that they had all that they required and stayed a little while in talk with them there was some mention of monmouth and the battle of sedgemoor which was natural that being the topic of the hour  my lady asked no questions at the time regarding hickss long lean companion but it occurred to her later that perhaps she should know more about him early next morning therefore she sent for hicks as he was in the act of sitting down to breakfast and by her direct questions elicited from him that this companion was that richard nelthorp outlawed for his share in the rye house plot not only was the information alarming but it gave her a sense that she had not been dealt with fairly as indeed she told him  you will see sir she concluded that you cannot bide here so long as i thought it was on the score of nonconformity alone that you were suffering persecution i was willing to take some risk in hiding you but since your friend is what he is the risk is greater than i should be asked to face for my own sake and for that of my daughters nor can i say that i have ever held plottings and civil war in anything but abhorrenceas much in the old days as now i am a loyal woman and as a loyal woman i must bid you take your friend hence as soon as your fast is broken  the corpulent and swarthy hicks stood dejectedly before her he might have pleaded but at that moment there came a loud knocking at the gates below and instantly carpenter flung into the room with a white scared face and whirling gestures  soldiers my lady he panted in affright we have been betrayed the presence of mr hicks here is known what shall we do what shall we do  she stood quite still her countenance entirely unchanged unless it were to smile a little upon carpenters terror the mercy of her nature rose dominant now  why we must hide these poor fellows as best we can said she and hicks flung down upon one knee to kiss her hand with protestations that he would sooner be hanged than bring trouble upon her house  but she insisted calm and selfcontained and carpenter carried hicks away to bestow him together with dunne in a hole in the malthouse under a heap of sacking nelthorp had already vanished completely on his own initiative  meanwhile the insistent knocking at the gate continued came shouted demands to open in the name of the king until from a window my ladys daughters looked out to challenge those who knocked  colonel penruddock who had come in person with the soldiers to raid the house of his hereditary foe stood forth to answer very stiff and brave in his scarlet coat and black plumed hat  you have rebels in the house he announced and i require you in the kings name to deliver them up to me  and then before they could answer him came carpenter to unbar the door and admit them to the court penruddock standing squarely before the steward admonished him very sternly  friend said he you had best be ingenuous with me and discover who are in your ladys house for it is within my knowledge that some strangers came hither last night  the stricken carpenter stood whitefaced and trembling  sirsir he faltered  but the colonel was impatient  come come my friend since i know they are here theres an end ont show me where they are hid if you would save your own neck from the halter  it was enough for carpenter the pair in the malthouse might have eluded all search but for the stewards pusillanimity incontinently he betrayed the hidingplace  but sir of your charity do not tell my mistress that i have told you pray sir  penruddock brushed him aside as if he had been a pestering fly and with his men went in and straight to the spot where hicks and dunne were lurking when he had taken them he swung round on carpenter who had followed  these be but two he said and to my knowledge three rogues came hither last night no shufling with me rascal where have you bestowed the other  i swear as heavens my witness i do not know where he is protested the afflicted steward truly enough  penruddock turned to his men  make search he bade them and search was made in the ruthless manner of such searches  the brutal soldiers passed from room to room beating the wainscoting with pike and musketbutts splintering and smashing heedlessly presses were burst open and their contents scattered chests were broken into and emptied the searchers appropriating such objects as took their fancy with true military cynicism a mirror was shattered and some boards of the floor were torn up because a sergeant conceived that the blows of his halbert rang hollow  when the tumult was at its height came her ladyship at last into the room where colonel penruddock stood watching the operations of his men she stood in the doorway leaning upon her ebony cane her faded eyes considering the gaunt soldier with reproachful question  sir she asked him with gentle irony masking her agitation has my house been given over to pillage  he bowed doffing his plumed hat with an almost excessive courtesy  to search madame he corrected her and added in the kings name  the king she answered may give you authority to search my house but not to plunder it your men are robbing and destroying  he shrugged it was the way of soldiers fine manners he suggested were not to be expected of their kind and he harangued her upon the wrong she had done in harbouring rebels and giving entertainment to the kings enemies  that is not true said she i know of no kings enemies  he smiled darkly upon her from his great height she was so frail a body and so old that surely it was not worth a mans while to sacrifice her on the altar of revenge but not so thought colonel penruddock therefore he smiled  two of them a snivelling jack presbyter named hicks and a rascal named dunne are taken already pray madame be so free and ingenuous with me aye and so kind to yourselfas if there be any other person concealed in your houseand i am sure there is somebody elseto deliver him up and you shall come to no further trouble  she looked up at him and returned him smile for smile  i know nothing she said of what you tell me or of what you ask  his countenance hardened  then mistress the search must go on  but a shout from the adjoining room announced that it was at an end nelthorp had been discovered and dragged from the chimney into which he had crept  almost exactly a month lateron august 27th the lady alice lisle was brought to the bar of the courthouse at winchester upon a charge of high treason  the indictment ran that secretly wickedly and traitorously she did entertain conceal comfort uphold and maintain john hicks knowing him to be a false traitor against the duty of her allegiance and against the peace of our sovereign lord the king that now is  demurely dressed in grey the little whitehaired lady calmly faced the lord chief justice jeffreys and the four judges of oyer and terminer who sat with him and confidently made her plea of not guilty  it was inconceivable that christian men should deal harshly with her for a technical offence amounting to an act of christian charity and the judge sitting there in his robe of scarlet reversed with ermine looked a gentle kindly man his handsome oval youthful facejeffreys was in his thirtysixth yearset in the heavy black periwig was so pale that the mouth made a vivid line of scarlet and the eyes that now surveyed her were large and liquid and compassionate as it seemed to her  she was not to know that the pallor which gave him so interesting an air and the dark stains which lent his eyes that gentle wistfulness were the advertisements at once of the debauch that had kept him from his bed until after two oclock that morning and of the inexorable disease that slowly gnawed away his life and enraged him out of all humanity  and the confidence his gentle countenance inspired was confirmed by the first words he had occasion to address to her she had interrupted counsel to the crown when in his opening address to the jurycomposed of some of the most considerable gentlemen of hampshirehe seemed to imply that she had been in sympathy with monmouths cause she was of course without counsel and must look herself to her defence  my lord she cried i abhorred that rebellion as much as any woman in the world  jeffreys leaned forward with a restraining gesture  look you mrs lisle he admonished her sweetly because we must observe the common and usual methods of trial in your case i must interrupt you now and upon that he promised that she should be fully heard in her own defence at the proper time and that himself he would instruct her in the forms of law to her advantage he reassured her by reverent allusions to the great judge of heaven and earth in whose sight they stood that she should have justice and as to what you say concerning yourself he concluded i pray god with all my heart you may be innocent  he was benign and reassuring but she had the first taste of his true quality in the examination of dunnea most unwilling witness  reluctantly under the pressure put upon him did dunne yield up the tale of how he had conducted the two absconders to my ladys house with her consent and it was sought to prove that she was aware of their connection with the rebellion the stubbornly evasive dunne was asked at last  do you believe that she knew mr hicks before  he returned the answer that already he had returned to many questions of the sort  i cannot tell truly  jeffreys stirred in his scarlet robes and his wistful eyes grew terrible as they bent from under beetling brows upon the witness  why he asked dost thou think that she would entertain any one she had no knowledge of merely upon thy message mr dunne mr dunne have a care it may be more is known to me of this matter than you think for  my lord i speak nothing but the truth bleated the terrified dunne  i only bid you have a care jeffreys smiled and his smile was more terrible than his frown truth never wants a subterfuge it always loves to appear naked it needs no enamel nor any covering but lying and snivelling and canting and hicksing always appear in masquerade come go on with your evidence  but dunne was reluctant to go on and out of his reluctance he lied foolishly and pretended that both hicks and nelthorp were unknown to him when pressed to say why he should have served two men whom he had never seen before he answered  all the reason that induced me to it was that they said they were men in debt and desired to be concealed for a while  then the thunder was heard in jeffreys voice  dost thou believe that any one here believes thee prithee what trade art thou  my lord stammered the unfortunate ii am a baker by trade  and wilt thou bake thy bread at such easy rates upon my word then thou art very kind prithee tell me i believe thou dost use to bake on sundays dost thou not  no my lord i do not cried dunne indignantly  alackaday art precise in that sneered the judge but thou canst travel on sundays to lead rogues into lurkingholes  later when to implicate the prisoner it was sought to draw from dunne a full account of the reception she had given his companions his terror under the bullying to which he was subjected made him contradict himself more flagrantly than ever jeffreys addressed the jury  you see gentlemen what a precious fellow this is a very pretty tool to be employed upon such an errand a knave that nobody would trust for half a crown a turk has more title to an eternity of bliss than these pretenders to christianity  and as there was no more to be got from dunne just then he was presently dismissed and barters damning evidence was taken thereafter the wretched dunne was recalled to be bullied by jeffreys in blasphemous terms that may not be printed here  barter had told the court how my lady had come into the kitchen with dunne and how when he had afterwards questioned dunne as to why they had whispered and laughed together dunne told him she had asked if he knew aught of the business jeffreys sought now to wring from dunne what was this business to which he had so mysteriously alludedthis with the object of establishing lady lisles knowledge of hickss treason  dunne resisted more stubbornly than ever jeffreys exasperatedsince without the admission it would be difficult to convict her ladyshipinvited the jury to take notice of the strange horrible carriage of the fellow and heaped abuse upon the snivelling canting sect of which he was a member finally he reminded dunne of his oath to tell the truth and addressed him with a sort of loving ferocity  what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul bellowed that terrible judge his eyes aflame is not this the voice of scripture itself and wilt thou hazard so dear and precious a thing as thy soul for a lie thou wretch all the mountains and hills of the world heaped upon one another will not cover thee from the vengeance of the great god for this transgression of falsewitness bearing  i cannot tell what to say my lord gasped dunne  in his rage to see all efforts vain the judges language became that of the cockpit recovering at last he tried gentleness again and very elaborately invited dunne in my ladys own interest to tell him what was the business to which he had referred to barter  she asked me whether i did not know that hicks was a nonconformist  that cannot be all there must be something more in it  yes my lord dunne protested it is all i know nothing more  was there ever such an impudent rascal roared the judge dolt think that after all the pains i have been at to get an answer thou canst banter me with such sham stuff as this hold the candle to his brazen face that we may see it clearly  dunne stood terrified and trembling under the glance of those terrible eyes  my lord he cried i am so baulked i am cluttered out of my senses  again he was put down whilst colonel penruddock gave his evidence of the apprehension of the rebels when he had told how he found hicks and dunne concealed under some stuff in the malthouse dunne was brought back yet again that jeffreys might resume his crossexamination  dunne how came you to hide yourself in the malthouse  my lord said dunne foolishly i was frighted by the noise  prithee what needest thou be afraid of for thou didst not know hicks nor nelthorp and my lady only asked thee whether hicks were a nonconformist parson surely so very innocent a soul needed no occasion to be afraid i doubt there was something in the case of that business we were talking of before if we could but get out of thee what it was  but dunne continued to evade  my lord i heard a great noise in the house and did not know what it meant so i went and hid myself  it is very strange thou shouldst hide thyself for a little noise when thou knewest nothing of the business  again the witness with a candle still held close to his nose complained that he was quite cluttered out of his senses and did not know what he was saying  but to tell the truth would not rob thee of any of thy senses if ever thou hadst any jeffreys told him angrily but it would seem that neither thou nor thy mistress the prisoner had any for she knew nothing of it either though she had sent for them thither  my lord cried her ladyship at that i hope i shall not be condemned without being heard  no god forbid mrs lisle he answered and then viciously flashed forth a hint of the true forces of nemesis at work against her that was a sort of practice in your late husbands timeyou know very well what i meanbut god be thanked it is not so now  came next the reluctant evidence of carpenter and his wife and after that there was yet a fourth equally futile attempt to drag from dunne an admission that her ladyship was acquainted with hickss share in the rebellion but if stupid dunne at least was staunch and so with a wealth of valedictory invective jeffreys dismissed him and addressed at last the prisoner inviting her to speak in her own defence  she rose to do so fearlessly yet gently  my lord what i have to say is this i knew of nobodys coming to my house but mr hicks and for him i was informed that he did abscond by reason of warrants that were out against him for preaching in private meetings for that reason i sent to him to come by night but i had never heard that nelthorp was to come with him nor what name nelthorp had till after he had come to my house i could die upon it as for mr hicks i did not in the least suspect that he had been in the army being a presbyterian minister that used to preach and not to fight  but i will tell you jeffreys interrupted her that there is not one of those lying snivelling canting presbyterian rascals but one way or the other had a hand in the late horrid conspiracy and rebellion  my lord i abhorred both the principles and the practices of the late rebellion she protested adding that if she had been tried in london my lady abergavenny and many other persons of quality could have testified with what detestation she had spoken of the rebellion and that she had been in london until monmouth had been beheaded  if i had known the time of my trial in the country she pursued i could have had the testimony of those persons of honour for me but my lord i have been told and so i thought it would have been that i should not have been tried for harbouring mr hicks until he should himself be convict as a traitor i did abhor those that were in the plot and conspiracy against the king i know my duty to my king better and have always exercised it i defy anybody in the world that ever knew contrary to come and give testimony  his voice broke harshly upon the pause have you any more to say  as to what they say to my denying nelthorp to be in the house she resumed i was in very great consternation and fear of the soldiers who were very rude and violent i beseech your lordship to make that construction of it and not harbour an ill opinion of me because of those false reports that go about of me relating to my carriage towards the old king that i was anyways consenting to the death of king charles i for my lord that is as false as god is true i was not out of my chamber all the day in which that king was beheaded and i believe i shed more tears for him than any other woman then living  and i do repeat it my lord as i hope to attain salvation i never did know nelthorp nor did i know of anybodys coming but mr hicks him i knew to be a nonconformist minister and there being as is well known warrants out to apprehend all nonconformist ministers i was willing to give him shelter from these warrants which i knew was no treason  have you any more to say for yourself he asked her  my lord she was beginning i came but five days before this into the country  nay he broke in i cannot tell when you came into the country nor i dont care it seems you came in time to harbour rebels  she protested that if she would have ventured her life for anything it would have been to serve the king  but though i could not fight for him myself my son did he was actually in arms on the kings side in this business it was i that bred him in loyalty and to fight for the king  well have you done he asked her brutally  yes my lord she answered and resumed her seat trembling a little from the exertion and emotion of her address  his charge to the jury began it was very long and the first half of it was taken up with windy rhetoric in which the almighty was invoked at every turn it degenerated at one time into a sermon upon the text of render unto caesar inveighing against the presbyterian religion and the dull length of his lordships periods combined with the monotone in which he spoke lulled the wearied lady at the bar into slumber she awakened with a start when suddenly his fist crashed down and his voice rose in fierce denunciation of the late rebellion but she was dozing againso calm and so little moved was shebefore he had come to apply his denunciations to her own case and this in spite of all her protests that she had held the rebellion in abhorrence  it was all calculated to prejudice the minds of the jurymen before he came to the facts and the law of the case and that charge of his throughout far from being a judicial summingup was a virulent address for the prosecution just as his bearing hitherto in examining and crossexamining witnesses had been that of counsel for the crown the statement that she had made in her own defence he utterly ignored save in one particular where he saw his opportunity further to prejudice her case  i am sorry he said his face lengthening to remember something that dropped even from the gentlewoman herself she pretends to religion and loyalty very muchhow greatly she wept at the death of king charles the martyrand owns her great obligations to the late king and his royal brother and yet no sooner is one in the grave than she forgets all gratitude and entertains those that were rebels against his royal successor  i will not say he continued with deliberate emphasis what hand her husband had in the death of that blessed martyr she has enough to answer for her own guilt and i must confess that it ought not one way or other to make any ingredient into this case what she was in former times  but he had dragged it in protesting that it should not influence the case yet coldly calculatingly intending it to do so she was the widow of a regicide reason and to spare in the views of himself and his royal master why she should be hounded to her death upon any pretext  thereafter he reviewed the evidence against her dwelt upon the shuffling of dunne deduced that the reason for so much lying was to conceal the damning truthnamely that she knew hicks for a rebel when she gave him shelter and thus became the partner of his horrible guilt upon that he charged them to find their verdict without any consideration of persons but considering only the truth  nevertheless although his commands were clear some of the jury would seem to have feared the god whom jeffreys invoked so constantly one of them rose to ask him pertinently in point of law whether it was treason to have harboured hicks before the man had been convicted of treason  curtly he answered them that beyond doubt it was and upon that assurance the jury withdrew the court settled down into an expectant silence and her ladyship dozed again in her chair  the minutes passed it was growing late and jeffreys was eager to be done with this prejudged affair that he might dine in peace his voice broke the stillness of the court protesting his angry wonder at the need to deliberate in so plain a case he was threatening to adjourn and let the jury lie by all night if they did not bring in their verdict quickly when at the end of a halfhour they returned his fierce impatient glance found them ominously grave  my lord said mr whistler the foreman we have to beg of your lordship some directions before we can bring our verdict we have some doubt upon us whether there be sufficient proof that she knew hicks to have been in the army  well might they doubt it for there was no proof at all yet he never hesitated to answer them  there is as full proof as proof can be but you are judges of the proof for my part i thought there was no difficulty in it  my lord the foreman insisted we are in some doubt about it  i cannot help your doubts he said irritably was there not proved a discourse of the battle and of the battle and of the army at suppertime  but my lord we are not satisfied that she had notice that hicks was in the army  he glowered upon them in silence for a moment they deserved to be themselves indicted for their slowness to perceive where lay their duty to their king  i cannot tell what would satisfy you he said and sneered did she not inquire of dunne whether hicks had been in the army and when he told her he did not know she did not say she would refuse if he had been but ordered him to come by night by which it is evident she suspected it  he ignored you see her own complete explanation of that circumstance  and when hicks and nelthorp came did she not discourse with them about the battle and the army as if that were not at the time a common topic of discussion come come gentlemen he said with amazing impudence it is plain proof  but mr whistler was not yet satisfied  we do not remember my lord that it was proved that she asked any such question  that put him in a passion  sure he bellowed you do not remember anything that has passed did not dunne tell you there was such a discourse and she was by but if there were no such proof the circumstances and management of the thing are as full proof as can be i wonder what it is you doubt of  mrs lisle had risen there was a faint flush of excitement on her grey old face  my lord i hope she began in trembling tones to get no further  you must not speak now thundered her terrible judge and thus struck her silent  the brief resistance to his formidable will was soon at an end within a quarter of an hour the jury announced their verdict they found her guilty  gentlemen said his lordship i did not think i should have occasion to speak after your verdict but finding some hesitancy and doubt among you i cannot but say i wonder it should come about for i think in my conscience the evidence was as full and plain as it could be and if i had been among you and she had been my own mother i should have found her guilty  she was brought up for sentence on the morrow together with several others subsequently convicted amid fresh invectives against the religion she practised he condemned her to be burned alivewhich was the proper punishment for high treasonordering the sheriff to prepare for her execution that same afternoon  but look you mrs lisle he added we that are the judges shall stay in town an hour or two you shall have pen ink and paper and if in the mean time you employ that pen ink and paper and that hour or two wellyou understand what i mean it may be that you shall hear further from us in a deferring of this execution  what was this meaning that he assumed she understood jeffreys had knowledge of kirkes profitable traffic in the west and it is known that he spared no means of acquiring an estate suitable to his rank which he did not possess by way of patrimony thus cynically he invited a bribe  it is the only inference that explains the subsequent rancour he displayed against her aroused by her neglect to profit by his suggestions the intercession of the divines of winchester procured her a weeks reprieve and in that week her puissant friends in london headed by the earl of abergavenny petitioned the king on her behalf even feversham the victor of sedgemoor begged her life of the kingbribed to it as men say by an offer of a thousand pounds but the king withheld his mercy upon the plea that he had promised lord jeffreys he would not reprieve her and the utmost clemency influential petitions could wring from james ii was that she should be beheaded instead of burned  she suffered in the marketplace of winchester on september 2d christian charity was all her sin and for this her head was demanded in atonement she yielded it with a gentle fortitude and resolution in lieu of speech she left with the sheriff a pathetic document wherein she protests her innocence of all offence against the king and forgives her enemies specificallythe judge who prejudiced her case and forgot that the court should be counsel for the prisoner and colonel penruddock though he told me he could have taken those men before they came to my house  between those lines you may read the true reason why the lady alice lisle died she died to slake the cruelly vindictive thirst of king james ii on the one hand and colonel penruddock on the other against her husband who had been dead for twenty years     v the night of massacrethe story of the saint bartholomew   there are elements of mystery about the massacre of saint bartholomew over which presumably historians will continue to dispute as long as histories are written indeed it is largely of their disputes that the mystery is begotten broadly speaking these historians may be divided into two schoolscatholic and anticatholic the former have made it their business to show that the massacre was purely a political affair having no concern with religion the latter have been equally at pains to prove it purely an act of religious persecution having no concern with politics those who adopt the latter point of view insist that the affair was long premeditated that it had its source in something concerted some seven years earlier between catherine of medicis and the sinister duke of alva and they would seem to suggest that henry of navarre the nominal head of the protestant party was brought to paris to wed marguerite de valois merely so that by this means the protestant nobles of the kingdom coming to the capital for the wedding should be lured to their destruction  it does not lie within the purview of the present narrative to enter into a consideration of the arguments of the two schools nor will it be attempted  but it may briefly be stated that the truth lies probably in a middle course of reasoningthat the massacre was political in conception and religious in execution or in other words that statecraft deliberately made use of fanaticism as of a tool that the massacre was brought about by a sudden determination begotten of opportunity which is but another word for chance  against the theory of premeditation the following cardinal facts may be urged  a the impossibility of guarding for seven years a secret that several must have shared  b the fact that neither charles ix nor his mother catherine were in any sense bigoted catholics or even of a normal religious sincerity  c the lack of concerted actionso far as the kingdom generally was concernedin the execution of the massacre  a subsidiary disproof lies in the attempted assassination of coligny two days before the massacre an act which might by putting the huguenots on their guard have caused the miscarriage of the entire planhad it existed  it must be borne in mind that for years france had been divided by religious differences into two camps and that civil war between catholic and huguenot had ravaged and distracted the country at the head of the protestant party stood that fine soldier gaspard de chatillon admiral de coligny virtually the protestant king of france a man who raised armies maintaining them by taxes levied upon protestant subjects and treated with charles ix as prince with prince at the head of the catholic partythe other imperium in imperiostood the duke of guise the third and weakest party in the state serving as it seemed little purpose beyond that of holding the scales between the other turbulent two was the party of the king  the motives and events that precipitated the massacre are set forth in the narration of the kings brother the duke of anjou afterwards henri iii it was made by him to miron his physician and confidential servant in cracow when he ruled there later as king of poland under circumstances which place it beyond suspicion of being intended to serve ulterior aims for partial corroboration and for other details of the massacre itself we have the narratives among others of sully who was then a young man in the train of the king of navarre and of lusignan a gentleman of the admirals household we shall closely follow these in our reconstruction of the event and its immediate causes  the gay chatter of the gallants and ladies thronging the long gallery of the louvre sank and murmured into silence and a movement was made to yield a free passage to the king who had suddenly made his appearance leaning affectionately upon the shoulder of the admiral de coligny  the duke of anjou a slender graceful young man in a goldembroidered suit of violet forgot the interest he was taking in his beautiful hands to bend lower over the handsome madame de nemours what time the unfriendly eyes of both were turned upon the admiral  the king and the great huguenot leader came slowly down the gallery an oddly contrasting pair coligny would have been the taller by a halfhead but for his stoop yet in spite of it there was energy and military vigour in his carriage just as there was a severe dignity amounting to haughtiness in his scarred and wrinkled countenance a bullet that had pierced his cheek and broken three of his teeth at the battle of moncontour had left a livid scar that lost itself in his long white beard his forehead was high and bald and his eyes were of a steely keenness under their tufted brows he was dressed with calvinistic simplicity entirely in black and just as this contrasted with the kings suit of sulphurcoloured satin so did the gravity of his countenance contrast with the stupidity of his sovereigns  charles ix a slimly built young man in his twentyfourth year was of a pallid muddy complexion with great shifty greenish eyes and a thick pendulous nose the protruding upper lip of his long thin mouth gave him an oafish expression which was increased by his habit of carrying his head craned forward  his nature was precisely what you would have expected from his appearancedull and gross he was chiefly distinguished among men of birth for general obscenity of speech and morphological inventiveness in blasphemy  at the end of the gallery coligny stooped to kiss the royal hand in leavetaking with his other hand charles patted the admirals shoulder  count me your friend he said body and soul heart and bowels even as i count you mine fare you well my father  coligny departed and the king retraced his steps walking quickly his head hunched between his shoulders his baleful eyes looking neither to left nor right as he passed out the duke of anjou quitted the side of madame de nemours and went after him then at last the suspended chatter of the courtiers broke loose again  the king was pacing his cabineta simple room furnished with a medley of objects appertaining to study to devotion and to hunting a large picture of the virgin hung from a wall flanked on either side by an arquebus and carrying a huntinghorn on one of its upper corners a little alabaster holywater font near the door crowned by a sprig of palm seemed to serve as a receptacle for hawkbells and straps there was a writingtable of beautifully carved walnut near the leaded window littered with books and papersa treatise on hunting lay cheek by jowl with a book of hours a string of rosary beads and a dogwhip lay across an open copy of ronsards verses the king was quite the vilest poetaster of his day  charles looked over his shoulder as his brother entered the scowl on his face deepened when he saw who came and with a grunt he viciously kicked the livercoloured hound that lay stretched at his feet the hound fled yelping to a corner the duke checked startled in his advance  well growled the king well am i never to have peace am i never to be alone what now bowels of god what do you want  his green eyes smouldered his right hand opened and closed on the gold hilt of the dagger at his girdle  scared by the maniac ferocity of this reception the young duke precipitately withdrew  it is nothing another time since i disturb you now he bowed and vanished followed by an evil cackling laugh  anjou knew how little his brother loved him and he confesses how much he feared him in that moment but under his fear it is obvious that there was lively resentment he went straight in quest of his mother whose darling he was to bear her the tale of the kings mood and what he accounted no doubt rightly the cause of it  it is the work of that pestilential huguenot admiral he announced at the end of a long tirade it is always thus with him after he has seen coligny  catherine of medicis considered she was a fat comfortable woman with a thick nose pinched lips and sleepy eyes  charles she said at length in her monotonous emotionless voice is a weathercock that turns with every wind that blows upon him you should know him by now and she yawned so that one who did not know her and her habit of perpetually yawning might have supposed that she was but indifferently interested  they were alone together in the intimate little tapestried room she called her oratory she half sat half reclined upon a couch of rose brocade anjou stood over by the window his back to it so that his pale face was in shadow he considered his beautiful hands which he was reluctant to lower lest the blood should flow into them and mar their white perfection  the admirals influence over him is increasing he complained and he uses it to lessen our own  do i not know it came her dull voice  it is time to end it said anjou passionately before he ends us your influence grows weaker every day and the admirals stronger charles begins to take sides with him against us we shall have him a tool of the huguenot party before all is done ah mon dieu you should have seen him leaning upon the shoulder of that old parpaillot calling him my father and protesting himself his devoted friend body and soul heart and bowels in his own words and when i seek him afterwards he scowls and snarls at me and fingers his dagger as if he would have it in my throat it is plain to see upon what subject the old scoundrel entertained him and again he repeated more fiercely than before it is time to end it  i know she said ever emotionless before so much emotion and it shall be ended the old assassin should have been hanged years ago for guiding the hand that shot francois de guise daily he becomes a greater danger to charles to ourselves and to france he is embroiling us with spain through this huguenot army he is raising to go and fight the battles of calvinism in flanders a fine thing that ah per dio for a moment her voice was a little warmed and quickened catholic france at war with catholic spain for the sake of huguenot flanders she laughed shortly then her voice reverted to its habitual sleepy level you are right it is time to end it coligny is the head of this rebellious beast if we cut off the head perhaps the beast will perish we will consult the duke of guise she yawned again yes the duke of guise will be ready to lend us his counsel and his aid decidedly we must get rid of the admiral  that was on monday august 18th of that year 1572 and such was the firm purpose and energy of that fat and seemingly sluggish woman that within two days all necessary measures were taken and maurevert the assassin was at his post in the house of vilaine in the cloisters of saintgermain lauxerrois procured for the purpose by madame de nemours who bore the admiral a mortal hatred  it was not however until the following friday that maurevert was given the opportunity of carrying out the task to which he had been hired on that morning as the admiral was passing accompanied by a few gentlemen of his household returning from the louvre to his house in the rue betisy the assassin did his work there was a sudden arquebusade from a firstfloor window and a bullet smashed two fingers of the admirals right hand and lodged itself in the muscles of his left arm  with his maimed and bleeding hand he pointed to the window whence the shot had been fired bidding his gentlemen to force a way into the house and take the assassin but whilst they were breaking in at the front maurevert was making his escape by the back where a horse waited for him and though pursued he was never overtaken  news of the event was instantly borne to the king it found him at tennis with the duke of guise and the admirals soninlaw teligny  in this assassins work sire said the blunt gentleman whom coligny had sent the admiral desires you to see the proof of the worth of the agreement between himself and monsieur de guise that followed upon the treaty of peace of saintgermain  the duke of guise drew himself stiffly up but said no word the king livid with rage looked at him balefully a moment then to vent some of his fury he smashed his racket against the wall  gods blood he cried mouthing horribly am i then never to have rest he flung away the broken remnants of his racket and went out cursing questioning the messenger further he learnt that the shot had been fired from the house of vilaine a sometime tutor to the duke of guise and that the horse upon which the assassin had fled had been held for him by a groom in the guise livery  meanwhile the duke and monsieur de teligny had gone their ways with no word spoken between themguise to shut himself up in his hotel and assemble his friends teligny to repair at once to his fatherinlaw  at two oclock in the afternoon in response to an urgent request from the admiral the king went to visit him accompanied by the queenmother by his brothers anjou and alencon and a number of officers and courtiers the royal party saw nothing of the excitement which had been prevailing in the city ever since the mornings event an excitement which subsided at their approach the king was gloomy resentful and silent having so far refused to discuss the matter with any one denying audience even to his mother catherine and anjou were vexed by the miscarriage of the affair anxious and no less silent than the king  they found the admiral awaiting them calm and composed the famous ambroise pare had amputated the two broken fingers and had dealt with the wound in the arm but although coligny might be considered to have escaped lightly and not to be in any danger a rumour was abroad that the bullet was poisoned and neither the admiral nor his people seem to have rejected the possibility one suspects indeed that capital was made out of it it was felt perhaps that thus should the admiral maintain a greater influence with the king for in any uncertainty as to whether coligny would live or die the kings feelings must be more deeply stirred than if he knew that the wound carried no peril to life  followed closely by his mother and his brothers charles swept through the spacious antechamber thronged now with grimfaced resentful huguenot gentlemen and so entered the room where coligny reclined upon a day bed near the window the admiral made shift to rise but this the king hurried forward to prevent  rest yourself my dear father he cried in accents of deep concern heart of god what is this they have done to you assure me at least that your life is safe or by the mass ill  i hold my life from god the admiral replied gravely and when he requires it of me i will yield it up that is nothing  nothing gods blood nothing the hurt is yours my father but the outrage mine and i swear to you by the blood and the death that i will take such a vengeance as shall never be forgotten  thereupon he fell into such a storm of imprecation and blasphemy that the admiral a sincerely devout godfearing heretic shuddered to hear him  calm sire he begged at last laying his sound hand upon the kings velvet sleeve be calm and listen for it is not to speak of myself of these wounds or of the wrong done me that i have presumed to beg you to visit me this attempt to murder me is but a sign of the evil that is stirring in france to sap your authority and power but he checked and looked at the three who stood immediately behind the king what i have to say is if you will deign to listen for your private ear  the king jerked round in a fashion peculiar to him his every action was abrupt and spasmodic he eyed his mother and brothers shiftily it was beyond his power to look any one directly in the face  outside he commanded waving an impatient hand almost in their faces do you hear leave me to talk with my father the admiral  the young dukes fell back at once ever in dread of provoking the horrible displays of passion that invariably followed upon any resistance of his feeble will but the sluggish catherine was not so easily moved  is monsieur de coligny strong enough do you think to treat of affairs at present consider his condition i beg she enjoined in her level voice  i thank you for your consideration madame said the admiral the ghost of an ironic smile about his lips but i am strong enough thank god and even though my strength were less than it is it would be more heavily taxed by the thought that i had neglected my duty to his majesty than it ever could be by the performance of that duty  ha you hear snapped the king go then go  they went returning to the antechamber to wait until the audience should conclude the three stood there in the embrasure of a window that looked out upon the hot sunlit courtyard there as anjou himself tells us they found themselves hemmed about by some two hundred sullen grimfaced gentlemen and officers of the admirals party who eyed them without dissembling their hostility who preserved a silence that was disturbed only by the murmurs of their constant whisperings and who moved to and fro before the royal group utterly careless of the proper degree of deference and respect  isolated thus in that hostile throng catherine and her sons became more and more uneasy so that as the queenmother afterwards confessed she was never in any place where her tarrying was attended by so much fear or her departure thence by so much pleasure  it was this fear that spurred her at last to put an end to that secret conference in the room beyond she did it in characteristic manner in the most complete outward composure stifling a yawn as she went she moved deliberately across to the door her sons following rapped shortly on the panel and entered without waiting to be bidden  the king who was standing by the admirals side wheeled sharply at the sound of the opening door his eyes blazed with sudden anger when he beheld his mother but she was the first to speak  my son she said i am concerned for the poor admiral he will have the fever if you continue to permit him to weary himself with affairs at present it is not to treat him as a friend to prolong this interview let business wait until he is recovered which will be the sooner if he is given rest at present  coligny stroked his white beard in silence while the king flared out striding towards her  par la mort dieu what is this sudden concern for the admiral  not sudden my son she answered in her dull voice her eyes intent upon him with something magnetic in their sleepy glance that seemed to rob him of half his will none knows more accurately than i the admirals precise value to france  anjou behind her may have smiled at that equivocal phrase  gods bowels am i king or what am i  it ill becomes a king to abuse the strength of a poor wounded subject she returned her eyes ever regarding him steadily come charles another day when the admiral shall have recovered more fully you may continue this discourse come now  his anger was subdued to mere sullenness almost infantile in its outward petulant expression he attempted to meet her glance and he was completely lost  perhaps ah ventre dieu my mother is right let the matter rest then my father we will talk of it again as soon as you are well  he stepped up to the couch and held out his hand  coligny took it and his eyes looked up wistfully into the weak young face of his king  i thank you sire for coming and for hearing me another day if i am spared i may tell you more meanwhile bear well in mind what i have said already i have no interests in this world but your own sire and he kissed the royal hand in farewell  not until they were back in the louvre did the queen attempt to break upon the kings gloomy abstraction to learnas learn she mustthe subject of the admirals confidential communication  accompanied by anjou she sought him in his cabinet nor would she be denied he sat at his writingtable his head sunken between his shoulders his receding chin in his cupped palms he glared at the pair as they entered swore savagely and demanded their business with him  catherine sat down with massive calm anjou remained standing beside and slightly behind her leaning upon the back of her tall chair  my son she said bluntly i have come to learn what passed between you and coligny  what passed what concern is that of yours  all your concerns are mine she answered tranquilly i am your mother  and i am your king he answered banging the table and i mean to be king  by the grace of god and the favour of monsieur de coligny she sneered with unruffled calm  whats that his mouth fell open and his eyes stared a crimson flush overspread his muddy complexion whats that  her dull glance met and held his own whilst calmly she repeated her sneering words  and that is why i have come to you she added if you are unable to rule without guidance i must at least do what i can so that the guidance shall not be that of a rebel of one who guides you to the end that he may master you  master me he screamed he rose in his indignation and faced her but his glance unable to support her steady eyes faltered and fell away foul oaths poured from his royal lips master me he repeated  ayemaster you she answered him master you until the little remnant of your authority shall have been sapped until you are no more than a puppet in the hands of the huguenot party a roi faineant a king of straw  by god madame were you not my mother  it is because i am your mother that i seek to save you  he looked at her again but again his glance faltered he paced the length of the room and back mouthing and muttering then he came to stand leaning on the priedieu facing her  by gods death madame since you demand to know what the admiral said you shall you prove to me that what he told me was no more than true he told me that a king is only recognized in france as long as he is a power for good or ill over his subjects that this power together with the management of all state affairs is slipping by the crafty contrivances of yourself and anjou there out of my hands into your own that this power and authority which you are both stealing from me may one day be used against me and my kingdom and he bade me be on my guard against you both and take my measures he gave me this counsel madame because he deemed it his duty as one of my most loyal and faithful servants at the point of death and  the shameless hypocrite her dull contemptuous voice interrupted him at the point of death two broken fingers and a fleshwound in the arm and he represents himself as in articulo mortis that he may play upon you and make you believe his lies  her stolidity of manner and her logic ponderous and irresistible had their effect his big green eyes seemed to dilate his mouth fell open  if he began and checked rapped out an oath and checked again are they lies madame he asked slowly  she caught the straining note of hope in that question of hisa hope founded upon vanity the vanity to be king in fact as well as king in name she rose  to ask me thatme your motheris to insult me come anjou  and on that she departed craftily leaving her suggestion to prey upon his mind  but once alone in her oratory with anjou her habitual torpor was sloughed away for once she quivered and crimsoned and raised her voice whilst for once her sleepy eyes kindled and flashed as she inveighed against coligny and the huguenots  for the moment however there was no more to be done the stroke had failed coligny had survived the attempt upon his life and there was danger that on the recoil the blow might smite those who had launched it but on the morrow which was saturday things suddenly assumed a very different complexion  that great catholic leader the powerful handsome duke of guise who more than suspected of having inspired the attempted assassination had kept his hotel since yesterday now sought the queenmother with news of what was happening in the city armed bands of huguenot nobles were riding through the streets clamouring  death to the assassins of the admiral down with the guisards  and although a regiment of gardes francaises had been hastily brought to paris to keep order the duke feared grave trouble in a city which the royal wedding had filled with huguenot gentlemen and their following then too there were rumours that the huguenots were arming everywhererumours which whether true or not were under the circumstances sufficiently natural and probable to be taken seriously  leaving guise in her oratory and summoning her darling anjou catherine at once sought the king she may have believed the rumours and she may even have stated them as facts beyond dispute so as to strengthen and establish her case against gaspard de coligny  king gaspard i she told him is already taking his measures the huguenots are arming officers have been dispatched into the provinces to levy troops the admiral has ordered the raising of ten thousand horse in germany and another ten thousand swiss mercenaries in the cantons  he stared at her vacuously some such rumour had already reached him and he conceived that here was definite confirmation of it  you may determine now who are your friends who your loyal servants she told him how is so much force to be resisted in the state in which you find yourself the catholics exhausted and weary as they are by a civil war in which their king was of little account to them are going to arm so as to offer what resistance they can without depending upon you thus within your state you will have two great parties under arms neither of which can be called your own unless you stir yourself and quickly unless you choose now between friends and foes you will find yourself alone isolated in grave peril without authority or power  he sank overwhelmed to a chair and took his head in his hands cogitating when next he looked at her there was positive fear in his great eyes a fear evoked by contemplation of the picture which her words had painted for him  he looked from her to anjou  what then he asked what then how is the danger to be averted  by a simple stroke of the sword she answered calmly slice off at a blow the head of this beast of rebellion this hydra of heresy  he huddled back horror in his eyes his hands slid slowly along the carved arms of his chair and clenched the ends so tightly that his knuckles looked like knobs of marble  kill the admiral he said slowly  the admiral and the chief huguenot leaders she said much in the tone she might have used were it a matter of wringing the necks of a dozen capons  ah ca par la mort dieu he heaved himself up raging thus would your hatred of him be served thus would you  coolly she sliced into his foaming speech  not inot i she said do nothing upon my advice summon your council send for tavannes biragues retz and the others consult with them they are your friends you trust and believe in them when they know the facts see if their counsel will differ from your mothers send for them they are in the louvre now  he looked at her a moment  very well he said and reeled to the door bawling hoarsely his orders  they came one by onethe marshal de tavannes the duke of retz the duke of nevers the chancellor de biragues and lastly the duke of guise upon whom the king scowled a jealous hatred that was now fully alive  the window which overlooked the quay and the river stood open to admit what air might be stirring on that hot day of august  charles sat at his writingtable sullen and moody twining a string of beads about his fingers catherine occupied the chair over beyond the table anjou sitting near her on a stool the others stood respectfully awaiting that the king should make known his wishes the shifty royal glance swept over them from under lowering brows then it rested almost in challenge upon his mother  tell them he bade her curtly  she told them what already she had told her son relating all now with greater detail and circumstance for some moments nothing was heard in that room but the steady drone of her unemotional voice when she had finished she yawned and settled herself to hear what might be answered  well snapped the king you have heard what do you advise speak out  nevers was the first to answer  there is no other way he said stiffly but that which her majesty advises the danger is grave if it is to be averted action must be prompt and effective  tavannes clasped his hands behind him and said much the same as did presently the chancellor  twisting and untwisting his chaplet of beads about his long fingers his eyes averted the king heard each in turn then he looked up his glance deliberately ignoring guise settled upon the duke of retz who held aloof  and you monsieur le marechal what is your counsel  retz drew himself up as if bracing himself to meet opposing forces he was a little pale but quite composed  if there is a man whom i should hate he said it is this gaspard de coligny who has defamed me and all my family by the foul accusations he has put abroad but i will not he added firmly take vengeance upon my enemies at the expense of my king and master i cannot counsel a course so disastrous to your majesty and the whole kingdom did we act as we have been advised sire can you doubt that we should be taxedand rightly taxed in view of the treaty that has been signedwith perfidy and disloyalty  dead silence followed that bombshell of opposition coming from a quarter whence it was least expected for catherine and anjou had confidently counted upon the dukes hatred of coligny to ensure his support of their designs  a little colour crept into the pale cheeks of the king his glance kindled out of its sullenness he was as one who sees sudden hope amid despair  that is the truth he said messieurs and you madame my mother you have heard the truth how do you like it  monsieur de retz is deceived by an excess of loyalty said anjou quickly because he bears a personal enmity to the admiral he conceives that it would hurt his honour to speak otherwise it must savour to him as he has said of using his king and master to avenge his own personal wrongs we can respect monsieur de retzs view although we hold it mistaken  will monsieur de retz tell us what other course lies open quoth the bluff tavannes  some other course must be found cried the king rousing himself it must be found do you hear i will not have you touch the life of my friend the admiral i will not have itby the blood  a hubbub followed all speaking at once until the king banged the table and reminded them that his cabinet was not a fishmarket  i say that there is no other way catherine insisted there cannot be two kings in france nor can there be two parties for your own safetys sake and for the safety of your kingdom i beseech you so to contrive that in france there be but one party with one headyourself  two kings in france he said what two kings  yourself and gaspard iking coligny the king of the huguenots  he is my subjectmy faithful loyal subject the king protested but with less assurance  a subject who raises forces of his own levies taxes of his own garrisons huguenot cities said biragues that is a very dangerous type of subject sire  a subject who forces you into war with protestant flanders against catholic spain added the blunt tavannes  forces me roared the king half rising his eyes aflash that is a very daring word  it would be if the proof were absent remember sire his very speech to you before you permitted him to embark upon preparations for this war give us leave he said to make war in flanders or we shall be compelled to make war upon yourself  the king winced and turned livid sweat stood in beads upon his brow he was touched in his most sensitive spot that speech of colignys was of all things the one he most desired to forget he twisted the chaplet so that the beads bit deeply into his fingers  sire tavannes continued were i a king and did a subject so address me i should have his head within the hour yet worse has happened since worse is happening now the huguenots are arming they ride arrogantly through the streets of your capital stirring up rebellion they are here in force and the danger grows acute and imminent  charles writhed before them he mopped his brow with a shaking hand  the dangeryes i see that i admit the danger but coligny  is it to be king gaspard or king charles rasped the voice of catherine  the chaplet snapped suddenly in the kings fingers he sprang to his feet deathly pale  so be it he cried since it is necessary to kill the admiral kill him then kill him he screamed in a fury that seemed aimed at those who forced this course upon him kill himbut see to it also that at the same time you kill every huguenot in france so that not one shall be left to reproach me not one do you hear take your measures and let the thing be done at once and on that his face livid and twitching his limbs shaking he flung out of the room and left them  it was all the warrant they required and they set to work at once there in the kings own cabinet where he had left them guise who had hitherto been no more than a silent spectator assumed now the most active part upon his own shoulders he took the charge of seeing the admiral done to death  the remainder of the day and a portion of the evening were spent in concerting ways and means they assured themselves of the provost of the merchants of paris of the officers of the gardes francaises and the three thousand swiss of the captains of the quarters and other notoriously factious persons who could be trusted as leaders by ten oclock at night all preparations were made and it was agreed that the ringing of the bell of saintgermain lauxerrois for matins was to be the signal for the massacre  a gentleman of the admirals household taking his way homeward that night passed several men bearing sheaves of pikes upon their shoulders and never suspected whom these weapons were to arm he met several small companies of soldiers marching quietly their weapons shouldered their matches glowing and still he suspected nothing whilst in one quarter he stopped to watch a man whose behaviour seemed curious and discovered that he was chalking a white cross upon the doors of certain houses  meeting soon afterwards another man with a bundle of weapons on his shoulder the intrigued huguenot gentleman asked him bluntly what he carried and whither he went  it is for the divertissement at the louvre tonight he was answered  but in the louvre the queenmother and the catholic leaders the labours of preparation ended were snatching a brief rest between two and three oclock in the morning catherine and anjou repaired again to the kings cabinet they found him waiting there his face haggard and his eyes fevered  he had spent a part of the evening at billiards and among the players had been la rochefoucauld of whom he was fond and who had left him with a jest at eleven oclock little dreaming that it was for the last time  the three of them crossed to the window overlooking the river they opened it and peered out fearfully even catherine trembled now that the hour approached the air was fresh and cool swept clean by the stirring breeze of the dawn whose first ghostly gleams were already in the sky suddenly somewhere near at hand a pistol cracked the noise affected them oddly the king fell into an ague and his teeth chattered audibly panic seized him  by the blood it shall not be it shall not be he cried suddenly  he looked at his mother and his brother and they looked at him ghastly were the faces of all three their eyes wide and staring with horror  charles swore in his terror that he would cancel all commands and since catherine and anjou made no attempt to hinder him he summoned an officer and bade him seek out the duke of guise at once and command him to stay his hand  the messenger eventually found the duke in the courtyard of the admirals house standing over the admirals dead body which his assassins had flung down from the bedroom window guise laughed and stirred the head of the corpse with his foot answering that the message came too late even as he spoke the great bell of saintgermain lauxerrois began to ring for matins  the royal party huddled at that window of the louvre heard it at the same moment and heard as if in immediate answer shots of arquebus and pistol cries and screams near at hand and then gradually swelling from a murmur the baying of the fierce multitude other bells gave tongue until from every steeple in paris the alarm rang out the red glow from thousands of torches flushed the heavens with a rosy tint as of dawn the air grew heavy with the smell of pitch and resin  the king clutching the sill of the window poured out a stream of blasphemy from between his chattering teeth then the hubbub rose suddenly near at hand the neighbourhood of the louvre was populous with huguenots and into it now poured the excited catholic citizens and soldiers soon the quay beneath the palace windows presented the fiercest spectacle of any quarter of paris  halfclad men women and children fled screaming before the assassins until they were checked by the chains that everywhere had been placed across the streets some sought the river hoping to find a way of escape but with satanic foresight the boats usually moored there had been conveyed to the other side thus some hundreds of huguenots were brought to bay and done to death under the very eyes of the king who had unleashed this horror doors were crashed open flames rose to heaven men and women were shot down under the palace wall bodies were flung from windows and on every sidein the words of daubignethe blood now flowed seeking the river  the king watched a while screams and curses pouring from his lips to be lost in the horrible uproar he turned perhaps to upbraid his mother and his brother but found that they were no longer at his side behind him in the room a page was crouching watching him with a white horrified face  suddenly the king laughedit was the fierce hysterical laugh of a madman his eyes fell on the arquebuses flanking the picture of the mother of mercy he took one of them down then caught the boy by the collar of his doublet and dragged him forward to the window  hither and load for me he bade him between peals of his terrible laughter then he levelled the weapon across the sill of the window parpaillots parpaillots he screamed kill kill and he discharged the arquebus into a fleeing group of huguenots  five days later the kingwho by now had thrown the blame of the whole affair with its slaughter of some two thousand huguenots upon the guises and their hatred of colignyrode out to montfaucon to behold the decapitated body of the admiral which hung from the gallows in chains a courtier of a poor but obtrusive wit leaned towards him  the admiral becomes noisome i think he said  the kings green eyes considered him his lips curling grimly  the body of a dead enemy always smells sweet he said     vi the night of witchcraftlouis xiv and madame de montespan   if you scrape the rubbishheap of servile coeval flattery that usually smothers the personality of a monarch you will discover a few kings who have been truly great many who have achieved greatness because they were wisely content to serve as masks for the great intellects of their time and for the rest some bad kings some foolish kings and some ridiculous kings but in all that royal gallery of history you will hardly find a more truly absurd figure than that of the resplendent roi soleil the grand monarque the fourteenth louis of france  i am not aware that he has ever been laughed at certainly never to the extent which he deserves the flatterers of his day inevitable products of his reign did their work so thoroughly that even in secret they do not appear to have dared to utterpossibly they did not even dare to thinkthe truth about him their work survives and when you have assessed the monstrous flattery at its true worth swept it aside and come down to the real facts of his life you make the discovery that the proudest title their sycophancy could bestow and his own fatuity acceptle roi soleil the sunkingmakes him what indeed he is a king of opera bouffe there is about him at times something almost reminiscent of the court buffoons of a century before who puffed themselves out with mock pride and aped a sort of sovereignty to excite laughter with this difference however that in his own case it was not intended to be amusing  a heartless voluptuary of mediocre intelligence he contrived to wrap himself in what saintsimon has called a terrible majesty he was obsessed by the idea of the dignity almost the divinityof kingship i cannot believe that he conceived himself human he appears to have held that being king was very like being god and he duped the world by ceremonials of etiquette that were very nearly sacramental we find him burdening the most simple and personal acts of everyday life with a succession of rites of an amazing complexity thus when he rose in the morning princes of the blood and the first gentlemen of france were in attendance one to present to him his stockings another to proffer on bended knee the royal garters a third to perform the ceremony of handing him his wig and so on until the toilette of his plump not unhandsome person was complete you miss the incense you feel that some noble thurifer should have fumigated him at each stage perhaps he never thought of it  the evil fruits of his reignevil that is to say from the point of view of his order which was swept away as so much anachronistic rubbishdid not come until a hundred years later in his own day france was great and this not because but in spite of him after all he was not the absolute ruler he conceived himself there were such capable men as colbert and louvois at the kings side there was the great genius of france which manifests itself when and as it will whatever the regimeand there was madame de montespan to whose influence not a little of louiss glory may be ascribed since the most splendid years of his reign were those between 1668 and 1678 when she was maitresse en titre and more than queen of france the women played a great part at the court of louis xiv and those upon whom he turned his dark eyes were in the main as wax under the solar rays of the sunking but madame de montespan had discovered the secret of reversing matters so that in her hands it was the king who became as wax for her modelling it is with this secreta page of the secret history of france that we are here concerned  francoises athenais de tonnaycharente had come to court in 1660 as a maid of honour to the queen of a wit and grace to match her superb beauty she was also of a perfervid piety a daily communicant a model of virtue to all maids of honour this until the devil tempted her when that happened she did not merely eat an apple she devoured an entire orchard pride and ambition brought about her downfall she shared the universal jealousy of which louise de la valliere was a victim and coveted the honours and the splendour by which that unfortunate favourite was surrounded  not even her marriage with the marquis de montespan some three years after her coming to court sufficed to overcome the longings born of her covetousness and ambition and then when the sunking looked with favour upon her opulent charms when at last she saw the object of her ambition within reach that husband of hers went very near to wrecking everything by his unreasonable behaviour this preposterous marquis had the effrontery to dispute his wife with jupiter was so purblind as not to appreciate the honour the sunking proposed to do him  in putting it thus i but make myself the mouthpiece of the court  when montespan began to make trouble by railing furiously against the friendship of the king for his wife his behaviour so amazed the kings cousin mademoiselle de montpensier that she called him an extravagant and extraordinary man to his face she told him that he must be mad to behave in this fashion and so incredibly distorted were his views that he did not at all agree with her he provoked scenes with the king in which he quoted scripture made opposite allusions to king david which were in the very worst taste and even ventured to suggest that the sunking might have to reckon with the judgment of god if he escaped a lettre de cachet and a dungeon in the bastille it can only have been because the king feared the further spread of a scandal injurious to the sacrosanctity of his royal dignity  the marchioness fumed in private and sneered in public when mademoiselle de montpensier suggested that for his safetys sake she should control her husbands antics she expressed her bitterness  he and my parrot she said amuse the court to my shame  in the end finding that neither by upbraiding the king nor by beating his wife could he prevail monsieur de montespan resigned himself after his own fashion he went into widowers mourning dressed his servants in black and came ostentatiously to court in a mourning coach to take ceremonious leave of his friends it was an affair that profoundly irritated the sunking and very nearly made him ridiculous  thereafter montespan abandoned his wife to the king he withdrew first to his country seat and later from france having received more than a hint that louis was intending to settle his score with him by that time madame de montespan was firmly established as maitresse en titre and in january of 1669 she gave birth to the duke of maine the first of the seven children she was to bear the king parliament was to legitimize them all declaring them royal children of france and the country was to provide titles dignities and royal rentrolls for them and their heirs forever do you wonder that there was a revolution a century later and that the people grown weary of the parasitic anachronism of royalty should have risen to throw off the intolerable burden it imposed upon them  the splendour of madame de montespan in those days was something the like of which had never been seen at the court of france on her estate of clagny near versailles stood now a magnificent chateau louis had begun by building a country villa which satisfied her not at all  that she told him might do very well for an operagirl whereupon the infatuated monarch had no alternative but to command its demolition and call in the famous architect mansard to erect in its place an ultraroyal residence  at versailles itself whilst the longsuffering queen had to be content with ten rooms on the second floor madame de montespan was installed in twice that number on the first and whilst a simple page sufficed to carry the queens train at court nothing less than the wife of a marshal of france must perform the same office for the favourite she kept royal state as few queens have ever kept it she was assigned a troop of royal bodyguards for escort and when she travelled there was a neverending train to follow her sixhorse coach and officers of state came to receive her with royal honours wherever she passed  in her immeasurable pride she became a tyrant even over the king himself  thunderous and triumphant madame de sevigne describes her in those days when the sunking was her utter and almost timid slave  but constancy is not a jovian virtue jupiter grew restless and then shaking off all restraint plunged into inconstancy of the most scandalous and flagrant kind it is doubtful if the history of royal amours with all its fecundity can furnish a parallel within a few months madame de soubise mademoiselle de rocheforttheobon madame de louvigny madame de ludres and some lesser ones passed in rapid succession through the furnace of the sunkings affectionwhich is to say through the royal bedand at last the court was amazed to see the widow scarron who had been appointed governess to madame de montespans royal children empanoplied in a dignity and ceremony that left no doubt on the score of her true position at court  and so after seven years of absolute sway in which homage had been paid her almost in awe by noble and simple alike madame de montespan neglected now by louis moved amid reflections of that neglect with arrogantly smiling lips and desperate rage in her heart she sneered openly at the royal lack of taste allowed her barbed wit to make offensive sport with the ladies who supplanted her yet ravaged by jealousy she feared for herself the fate which through her had overtaken la valliere  that fear was with her now as she sat in the window embrasure hell in her heart and a reflection of it in her eyes as fallen almost to the rank of a spectator in that comedy wherein she was accustomed to the leading part she watched the shifting chattering glittering crowd and as she watched her line of vision was crossed to her undoing by the slender wellknit figure of de vanens who dressed from head to foot in black detached sharply from that dazzling throng his face was pale and saturnine his eyes dark very level and singularly piercing thus his appearance served to underline the peculiar fascination which he exerted the rather sinister appeal which he made to the imagination  this young provencal nobleman was known to dabble in magic and there were one or two dark passages in his past life of which more than a whisper had gone abroad of being a student of alchemy a philosopherthat is to say a seeker after the philosophers stone which was to effect the transmutation of metalshe made no secret but if you taxed him with demoniacal practices he would deny it yet in a way that carried no conviction  to this dangerous fellow madame de montespan now made appeal in her desperate need  their eyes met as he was sauntering past and with a lazy smile and a languid wave of her fan she beckoned him to her side  they tell me vanens said she that your philosophy succeeds so well that you are transmuting copper into silver  his piercing eyes surveyed her narrowing a smile flickered over his thin lips  they tell you the truth he said i have cast a bar which has been purchased as good silver by the mint  her interest quickened by the mint she echoed amazed but then my friend she was breathless with excitement it is a miracle  no less he admitted but there is the greater miracle to comethe transmutation of base metal into gold  and you will perform it  let me but conquer the secret of solidifying mercury and the rest is naught i shall conquer it and soon  he spoke with easy confidence a man stating something that he knew beyond the possibility of doubt the marquise became thoughtful she sighed  you are the master of deep secrets vanens have you none that will soften flinty hearts make them responsive  he considered this woman whom saintsimon has called beautiful as the day and his smile broadened  look in your mirror for the alchemy needed there he bade her  anger rippled across the perfect face she lowered  i have lookedin vain can you not help me vanens you who know so much  a lovephiltre said he and hummed are you in earnest  do you mock me with that question is not my need proclaimed for all to see  vanens became grave  it is not an alchemy in which myself i dabble he said slowly but i am acquainted with those who do  she clutched his wrist in her eagerness  i will pay well she said  you will need to such things are costly he glanced round to see that none was listening then bending nearer there is a sorceress named la voisin in the rue de la tannerie well known as a fortuneteller to many ladies of the court who at a word from me will do your need  la montespan turned white the piety in which she had been rearedthe habits of which clung to her despite the irregularity of her lifemade her recoil before the thing that she desired sorcery was of the devil she told him so but vanens laughed  so that it be effective   said he with a shrug  and then across the room floated a womans trilling laugh she looked in the direction of the sound and beheld the gorgeous figure of the king bendingyet haughty and condescending even in adorationover handsome madame de ludres pride and ambition rose up in sudden fury to trample on religious feeling let vanens take her to this witch of his for be the aid what it might she must have it  and so one dark night late in the year louis de vanens handed a masked and muffled lady from a coach at the corner of the rue de la tannerie and conducted her to the house of la voisin  the door was opened for them by a young woman of some twenty years of agemarguerite monvoisin the daughter of the witchwho led them upstairs to a room that was handsomely furnished and hung with fantastic tapestry of red designs upon a black grounddesigns that took monstrous shapes in the flickering light of a cluster of candles black curtains parted and from between them stepped a short plump woman of a certain comeliness with two round black beads of eyes she was fantastically robed in a cloak of crimson velvet lined with costly furs and closely studded with doubleheaded eagles in fine gold which must have been worth a princes ransom and she wore red shoes on each of which there was the same eagle design in gold  ah vanens she said familiarly  he bowed  i bring you he announced a lady who has need of your skill  and he waved a hand towards the tall cloaked figure at his side  la voisin looked at the masked face  velvet faces tell me little madame la marquise she said calmly nor believe me will the king look at a countenance that you conceal from me  there was an exclamation of surprise and anger from madame de montespan she plucked off her mask  you knew me  can you wonder asked la voisin since i have told you what you carry concealed in your heart  madame de montespan was as credulous as only the very devout can be  since that is so since you know already what i seek tell me can you procure it me she asked in a fever of excitement i will pay well  la voisin smiled darkly  obdurate indeed is the case that will not yield to such medicine as mine she said let me consider first what must be done in a few days i shall bring you word but have you courage for a great ordeal  for any ordeal that will give me what i want  in a few days then you shall hear from me said the witch and so dismissed the great lady  leaving a heavy purse behind her as vanens had instructed her the marchioness departed with her escort and there with that initiation as far as we can ascertain ended louis de vanenss connection with the affair  at clagny madame de montespan waited for three days in a fever of impatience for the coming of the witch but when at last la voisin presented herself the proposal that she had to make was one before which the marchioness recoiled in horror and some indignation  the magic that la voisin suggested involved a coadjutor the abbe guibourg and the black mass to be celebrated by him madame de montespan had heard something of these dread sacrificial rites to satan sufficient to fill her with loathing and disgust of the whitefaced beadyeyed woman who dared to insult her by the proposal she fumed and raged a while and even went near to striking la voisin who looked on with inscrutable face and stony almost contemptuous indifference before that impenetrable almost uncanny calm madame de montespans fury at last abated then the urgency of her need becoming paramount she desired more clearly to be told what would be expected of her what the witch told her was more appalling than anything she could have imagined but la voisin argued  can anything be accomplished without cost can anything be gained in this life without payment of some kind  but the price of this is monstrous madame de montespan protested  measure it by the worldly advantages to be gained they are not small madame to enjoy boundless wealth boundless power and boundless honour to be more than queenis not all this worth some sacrifice  to madame de montespan it must have been worth any sacrifice in this world or the next since in the end she conquered her disgust and agreed to lend herself to this horror  three masses she was told would be necessary to ensure success and it was determined that they should be celebrated in the chapel of the chateau de villebousin where guibourg had been almoner to which he had access and which was at the time untenanted  the chateau was a gloomy mediaeval fortress blackened by age and standing surrounded by a moat in a lonely spot some two miles to the south of paris thither on a dark gusty night of march came madame de montespan accompanied by her confidential waitingwoman mademoiselle desceillets they left the coach to await them on the orleans road and thence escorted by a single male attendant they made their way by a rutted sodden path towards the grim castle looming faintly through the enveloping gloom  the wind howled dismally about the crenellated turrets and a row of poplars standing like black phantasmal guardians of the evil place bent groaning before its fury from the running waters of the moat swollen by recent rains came a gurgling sound that was indescribably wicked  desocillets was frightened by the dark the desolate loneliness and eeriness of the place but she dared utter no complaint as she stumbled forward over the uneven ground through the gloom and the buffeting wind compelled by the suasion of her mistresss imperious will thus by a drawbridge spanning dark oily waters they came into a vast courtyard and an atmosphere as of mildew a studded door stood ajar and through the gap from a guiding beacon of infamy fell a rhomb of yellow light suddenly obscured by a squat female figure when the steps of the marchioness and her companions fell upon the stones of the yard  it was la voisin who stood on the threshold to receive her client in the stoneflagged hall behind her the light of a lantern revealed her daughter marguerite monvoisin and a short craftyfaced misshapen fellow in black homespun and a red wiga magician named lesage one of la voisins coadjutors a rogue of some talent who exploited the witches of paris to his own profit  leaving leroythe marchionesss male attendant below in this fellows company la voisin took up a candle and lighted madame de montespan up the broad stone staircase draughty and cold to the anteroom of the chapel on the floor above mademoiselle desceillets followed closely and fearfully and marguerite monvoisin came last  they entered the anteroom a spacious chamber bare of furniture save for an oaken table in the middle some faded and mildewed tapestries and a canebacked settle of twisted walnut over against the wall an alabaster lamp on the table made an island of light in that place of gloom and within the circle of its feeble rays stood a gross old man of some seventy years of age in sacerdotal garments of unusual design the white alb worn over a greasy cassock was studded with black fircones the stole and maniple were of black satin with fircones wrought in yellow thread  his inflamed countenance was of a revolting hideousness his cheeks were covered by a network of blue veins his eyes squinted horribly his lips vanished inwards over toothless gums and a fringe of white hair hung in matted wisps from his high bald crown this was the infamous abbe guibourg sacristan of saint denis an ordained priest who had consecrated himself to the service of the devil  he received the great lady with a low bow which despite herself she acknowledged by a shudder she was very pale and her eyes were dilating and preternaturally bright fear began to possess her yet she suffered herself to be ushered into the chapel which was dimly illumined by a couple of candles standing beside a basin on a table the altar light had been extinguished her maid would have hung back but that she feared to be parted from her mistress she passed in with her in the wake of guibourg and followed by la voisin who closed the door leaving her daughter in the anteroom  although she had never been a participant in any of the sorceries practised by her mother yet marguerite was fully aware of their extent and more than guessed what horrors were taking place beyond the closed doors of the chapel the very thought of them filled her with loathing and disgust as she sat waiting huddled in a corner of the settle and yet when presently through the closed doors came the drone of the voice of that unclean celebrant to blend with the whine of the wind in the chimney marguerite urged by a morbid curiosity she could not conquer crept shuddering to the door which directly faced the altar and going down on her knees applied her eye to the keyhole  what she saw may very well have appalled her considering the exalted station of madame de montespan she beheld the white sculptural form of the royal favourite lying at full length supine upon the altar her arms outstretched holding a lighted candle in each hand immediately before her stood the abbe guibourg his body screening the chalice and its position from the eye of the watching girl  she heard the whine of his voice pattering the latin of the mass which he was reciting backwards from the last gospel and occasionally she heard responses muttered by her mother who with mademoiselle desceillets was beyond marguerites narrow range of vision  apart from the interest lent to the proceedings by the presence of the royal favourite the affair must have seemed now very stupid and pointless to marguerite although she would certainly not have found it so had she known enough latin to understand the horrible perversion of the credo but when the offertory was reached matters suddenly quickened in stealing away from the door she was no more than in time to avoid being caught spying by her mother who now issued from the chapel  la voisin crossed the anteroom briskly and went out  within a very few minutes she was back again her approach now heralded by the feeble quavering squeals of a very young child  marguerite monvoisin was sufficiently acquainted with the ghastly rites to guess what was impending she was young and herself a mother she had her share of the maternal instinct alive in every female animalwith the occasional exception of the human pervertand the hoarse plaintive cries of that young child chilled her to the soul with horror she felt the skin roughening and tightening upon her body and a sense of physical sickness overcame her that and the fear of her mother kept her stiff and frozen in an angle of the settle until la voisin had passed through and reentered the chapel bearing that piteous bundle in her arms  then when the door had closed again the girl horrified and fascinated sped back to watch she saw that unclean priest turn and receive the child from la voisin as it changed hands its cries were stilled  guibourg faced the altar once more that little wisp of humanity that was but a few days old held now aloft naked in his criminal hands his muttering slobbering voice pronouncing the words of that demoniac consecration reached the ears of the petrified girl at the keyhole  ashtaroth asmodeus princes of affection i conjure you to acknowledge the sacrifice i offer to you of this child for the things i ask of you which are that the kings love for me shall be continued and that honoured by princes and princesses nothing shall be denied me of all that i may ask  a sudden gust of wind smote and rattled the windows of the chapel and the anteroom as if the legions of hell had flung themselves against the walls of the chateau there was a rush and clatter in the chimney of the anterooms vast empty fireplace and through the din marguerite as her failing limbs sank under her and she slithered down in a heap against the chapel door seemed to hear a burst of exultantly cruel satanic laughter with chattering teeth and burning eyes she sat huddled listening in terror the child began to cry again more violently more piteously then quite suddenly there was a little choking cough a gurgle the chink of metal against earthenware and silence  when some moments later the squat figure of la voisin emerged from the chapel marguerite was back in the shadows hunched on the settle to which she had crawled she saw that her mother now carried a basin under her arm and she did not need the evidence of her eyes to inform her of the dreadful contents that the witch was bearing away in it  meanwhile in the chapel the ineffably blasphemous rites proceeded to the warm human blood which had been caught in the consecrated chalice guibourg had added among other foulnesses powdered cantharides the dust of desiccated moles and the blood of bats by the addition of flour he had wrought the ingredients into an ineffable paste and over this through the door which la voisin had left ajar marguerite heard his voice pronouncing the dread words of transubstantiation  marguerites horror mounted until it threatened to suffocate her it was as if some hellish miasma released by guibourgs monstrous incantations crept through to permeate and poison the air she breathed  it would be a halfhour later when madame de montespan at last came out she was of a ghastly pallor her limbs shook and trembled under her as she stepped forth and there was a wild horror in her staring eyes yet she contrived to carry herself almost defiantly erect and she spoke sharply to the halfswooning desceillets who staggered after her  she took her departure from that unholy place bearing with her the host compounded of devilish ingredients which when dried and reduced to powder was to be administered to the king to ensure the renewal of his failing affection for her  the marchioness contrived that a creature of her own an officer of the buttery in her pay should introduce it into the royal soup the immediate and not unnatural result was that the king was taken violently ill and madame de montespans anxiety and suspense were increased thereby on his recovery however it would seem that the demoniac sacramentthrice repeated by thenhad not been in vain  the sequel indeed appeared to justify madame de montespans faith in sorcery and to compensate her for all the horror to which in her despair she had submitted madame de ludres found herself coldly regarded by the convalescent king very soon she was discarded the widow scarron neglected and the fickle monarch was once more at the feet of the lovely marchioness her utter and devoted slave  thus was madame de montespan thunderously triumphant once more and established as firmly as ever in the sunkings favour madame de sevigne in speaking of this phase of their relations dilates upon the completeness of the reconciliation and tells us that the ardour of the first years seemed now to have returned and for two whole years it continued thus never before had madame de montespans sway been more absolute no shadow came to trouble the serenity of her rule  but it proved after all to be no more than the last flare of an expiring fire that was definitely quenched at last in 1679 by mademoiselle de fontanges a maid of honour to madame she was a child of not more than eighteen years fair and flaxen with pink cheeks and large childish eyes and it was for this doll that the regal montespan now found herself discarded  honours rained upon the new favourite louis made her a duchess with an income of twenty thousand livres and deeply though this may have disgusted his subjects it disgusted madame de montespan still more blinded by rage she openly abused the new duchess and provoked a fairly public scene with louis in which she gave him her true opinion of him with a disturbing frankness  you dishonour yourself she informed him among other things and you betray your taste when you make love to a pinkandwhite doll a little fool that has no more wit nor manners than if she were painted on canvas then with an increase of scorn she delivered herself of an unpardonable apostrophe you a king to accept the inheritance of that chits rustic lovers  he flushed and scowled upon her  that is an infamous falsehood he exclaimed madame you are unbearable he was very angry and it infuriated him the more that she should stand so coldly mocking before an anger that could bow the proudest heads in france you have the pride of satan your greed is insatiable your domineering spirit utterly insufferable and you have the most false and poisonous tongue in the world  her brutal answer bludgeoned that high divinity to earth  with all my imperfections she sneered at least i do not smell as badly as you do  it was an answer that extinguished her last chance it was fatal to the dignity to the terrible majesty of louis it stripped him of all divinity and revealed him authoritatively as intensely and even unpleasantly human it was beyond hope of pardon  his face turned the colour of wax a glacial silence hung over the agonized witnesses of that royal humiliation then without a word in a vain attempt to rescue the dignity she had so cruelly mauled he turned his red heels clicked rapidly and unsteadily across the polished floor and he was gone  when madame de montespan realized exactly what she had done nothing but rage remained to herrage and its offspring vindictiveness the duchess of fontanges must not enjoy her victory nor must louis escape punishment for his faithlessness la voisin should afford her the means to accomplish this and so she goes once more to the rue de la tannerie  now the matter of madame de montespans present needs was one in which the witches were particularly expert were you troubled with a rival did your husband persist in surviving your affection for him did those from whom you had expectations cling obstinately and inconsiderately to life the witches by incantations and the use of powdersin which arsenic was the dominant charmcould usually put the matter right for you indeed so wide and general was the practice of poisoning become that the authorities lately aroused to the fact by the sensational revelations of the marchioness de brinvilliers had set up in this year 1670 the tribunal known as the chambre ardente to inquire into the matter and to conduct prosecutions  la voisin promised help to the marchioness she called in another witch of horrible repute named la filastre her coadjutor lesage and two expert poisoners romani and bertrand who devised an ingenious plot for the murder of the duchess of fontanges they were to visit her romani as a cloth merchant and bertrand as his servant to offer her their wares including some grenoble gloves which were the most beautiful gloves in the world and unfailingly irresistible to ladies these gloves they prepared in accordance with certain magical recipes in such a way that the duchess after wearing them must die a lingering death in which there could be no suspicion of poisoning  the king was to be dealt with by means of a petition steeped in similar powders and should receive his death by taking it into his hands la voisin herself was to go to saintgermain to present this petition on monday march 13th one of those days on which according to ancient custom all comers were admitted to the royal presence  thus they disposed but fate was already silently stalking la voisin  it is to the fact that an obscure and vulgar woman had drunk one glass of wine too many three months earlier that the king owed his escape  if you are interested in the almost grotesque disparity that can lie between cause and effect here is a subject for you three months earlier a tailor named vigoureux whose wife secretly practised magic had entertained a few friends to dinner amongst whom was an intimate of his wifes named marie bosse this marie bosse it was who drank that excessive glass of wine which drowning prudence led her to boast of the famous trade she drove as a fortuneteller to the nobility and even to hint of something further  another three poisonings she chuckled and i shall retire with my fortune made  an attorney who was present pricked up his ears bethought him of the tales that were afloat and gave information to the police the police set a trap for marie bosse and she betrayed herself later under torture she betrayed la vigoureux la vigoureux betrayed others and these others again  the arrest of marie bosse was like knocking down the first of a row of ninepins but none could have suspected that the last of these stood in the royal apartments  on the day before she was to repair to saintgermain la voisin betrayed in her turn received a surprise visit from the policewho of course had no knowledge of the regicide their action was thwartingand she was carried off to the chatelet put to the question she revealed a great deal but her terror of the horrible punishment reserved for regicides prevented her to the day of her death at the stakein february of 1680 from saying a word of her association with madame de montespan  but there were others whom she betrayed under torture and whose arrest followed quickly upon her own who had not her strength of character among these were la filastre and the magician lesage when it was found that these two corroborated each other in the incredible things which they related the chambre ardente took fright la reynie who presided over it laid the matter before the king and the king horrorstricken by the discovery of the revolting practices in which the mother of his children had been engaged suspended the sittings of the chambre ardente and commanded that no further proceedings should be taken against lesage and la filastre and none initiated against romani bertrand the abbe guibourg and the scores of other poisoners and magicians who had been arrested and who were acquainted with madame de montespans unholy traffic  but it was not out of any desire to spare madame de montespan that the king proceeded in this manner he was concerned only to spare himself and his royal dignity he feared above all things the scandal and ridicule which must touch him as a result of publicity and because he feared it so much he could impose no punishment upon madame de montespan  this he made known to her at the interview between them procured by his minister louvois at about the time that the sittings of the chambre ardente were suspended  to this interview that proud domineering woman came in dread and in tears and humility for once the kings bearing was cold and hard cold and hard were the words in which he declared the extent of his knowledge of her infamy words which revealed the loathing and disgust this knowledge brought him if at first she was terrorstricken crushed under the indictment yet she was never of a temper to bear reproaches long under his scorn her anger kindled and her humility was sloughed  what then she cried at last eyes aflash through lingering tears is the blame all mine if all this is true it is no less true that i was driven to it by my love for you and the despair to which your heartlessness and infidelity reduced me to you she continued gathering force at every word i sacrificed everythingmy honour a noble husband who loved me all that a woman prizes and what did you give me in exchange your cruel fickleness exposed me to the low mockery of the lickspittles of your court do you wonder that i went mad and that in my madness i sacrificed what shreds of selfrespect you had left me and now it seems i have lost all but life take that too if it be your pleasure heaven knows it has little value left for me but remember that in striking me you strike the mother of your childrenthe legitimate children of france remember that  he remembered it indeed he was never in danger of forgetting it for she might have added that he would be striking also at himself and at that royal dignity which was his religion and so that all scandalous comment might be avoided she was actually allowed to remain at court although no longer in her firstfloor apartments and it was not until ten years later that she departed to withdraw to the community of saint joseph  but even in her disgrace this woman secretly convicted among other abominations of attempting to procure the poisoning of the king and of her rival enjoyed an annual pension of 1200000 livres whilst none dared proceed against those who shared her guiltnot even the infamous guibourg the poisoners romani and bertrand and la filastrenor yet against some scores of associates of these who were known to live by sorcery and poisonings and who might be privy to the part played by madame de montespan in that horrible night of magic at the chateau de villebousin  the hot blast of revolution was needed to sweep france clean     vii the night of gemsthe affairs of the queens necklace   under the stars of a tepid scented night of august of 1784 prince louis de rohan cardinal of strasbourg grand almoner of france made his way with quickened pulses through the park of versailles to a momentous assignation in the grove of venus  this illustrious member of an illustrious house that derived from both the royal lines of valois and bourbon was a man in the prime of life of a fine height still retaining something of the willowy slenderness that had been his in youth and of a gentle almost womanly beauty of countenance  in a grey cloak and a round grey hat with gold cords followed closely by two shadowy attendant figures he stepped briskly amain eager to open those gates across the path of his ambition locked against him hitherto by the very hands from which he now went to receive the key  he deserves your sympathy this elegant cardinalprince who had been the victim of the malice and schemings of the relentless austrian empress since the days when he represented the king of france at the court of vienna  the state he had kept there had been more than royal and royal in the dazzling french manner which was perturbing to a woman of marie thereses solid german notions his huntingparties his supperparties the fetes he gave upon every occasion the worldly inventiveness the sumptuousness and reckless extravagance that made each of these affairs seem like a supplement to the arabian nights entertainments the sybaritic luxury of his surroundings the incredible prodigality of his expenditure all served profoundly to scandalize and embitter the empress  that a priest in gay secular clothes should hunt the stag on horseback filled her with horror at his levity that he should flirt discreetly with the noble ladies of vienna made her despair of his morals whilst his personal elegance and irresistible charm were proofs to her of a profligacy that perverted the court over which she ruled  she laboured for the extinction of his pernicious brilliance and intrigued for his recall she made no attempt to conceal her hostility nor did she love him any the better because he met her frigid haughtiness with an ironical urbanity that seemed ever to put her in the wrong and then one day he permitted his wit to be bitingly imprudent  marie therese he wrote to daiguillon holds in one hand a handkerchief to receive her tears for the misfortunes of oppressed poland and in the other a sword to continue its partition  to say that in this witticism lay one of the causes of the french revolution may seem at first glance an outrageous overstatement yet it is certain that but for that imprudent phrase the need would never have arisen that sent rohan across the park of versailles on that august night to an assignation that in the sequel was to place a terrible weapon in the hands of the revolutionary party  daiguillon had published the gibe it had reached the ears of marie antoinette and from her it had travelled back to her mother in vienna it aroused in the empress a resentment and a bitterness that did not rest until the splendid cardinalprince was recalled from his embassy it did not rest even then by the ridicule to which the gibe exposed herand if you know marie therese at all you can imagine what that meantit provoked a hostility that was indefatigably to labour against him  the cardinal was ambitious he had confidence in his talents and in the driving force of his mighty family and he looked to become another richelieu or mazarin the first minister of the crown the empurpled ruler of france the guiding power behind the throne all this he looked confidently to achieve all this he might have achieved but for the obstacle that marie thereses resentment flung across his path the empress saw to it that through the person of her daughter her hatred should pursue him even into france  obedient ever to the iron will of her mother sharing her mothers resentment marie antoinette exerted all her influence to thwart this cardinal whom her mother had taught her to regard as a dangerous unprincipled man  on his return from vienna bearing letters from marie therese to louis xvi and marie antoinette the cardinal found himself coldly received by the dull king and discouraged from remaining at court whilst the queen refused to grant him so much as the audience necessary for the delivery of these letters desiring him to forward them instead  the chagrined cardinal had no illusions he beheld here the hand of marie therese controlling marie antoinette and through marie antoinette the king himself worse followed he who had dreamt himself another richelieu could only with difficulty obtain the promised position of grand almoner of france and this solely as a result of the powerful and insistent influence exerted by his family  he perceived that if he was to succeed at all he must begin by softening the rigorous attitude which the queen maintained towards him to that end he addressed himself but three successive letters he wrote to the queen remained unanswered through other channels persistently he begged for an audience that he might come in person to express his regrets for the offending indiscretion but the queen remained unmoved ruled ever by the austrian empress who through her daughter sought to guide the affairs of france  rohan was reduced to despair and then in an evil hour his path was crossed by jeanne de la motte de valois who enjoyed the reputation of secretly possessing the friendship of the queen exerting a sort of backstair influence and who lived on that reputation  as a drowning man clutches at a straw so the cardinalprince louis de rohan grand almoner of france landgrave of alsace commander of the order of the holy ghost clutched at this faiseuse daffaires to help him in his desperate need  jeanne de la motte de valoisperhaps the most astounding adventuress that ever lived by her wits and her beautyhad begun life by begging her bread in the streets she laid claim to lefthanded descent from the royal line of valois and her claim supported by the marchioness boulainvilliers who had befriended her she had obtained from the crown a small pension and had married the unscrupulous marc antoine de la motte a young soldier in the burgundy regiment of the gendarmerie  later in the autumn of 1786 her protectress presented her to cardinal de rohan his eminence interested in the ladys extraordinary history in her remarkable beauty vivacity and wit received the de la mottes at his sumptuous chateau at saverne near strasbourg heard her story in greater detail promised his protection and as an earnest of his kindly intentions obtained for her husband a captains commission in the dragoons  thereafter you see the de la mottes in paris and at versailles hustled from lodging to lodging for failure to pay what they owe and finally installed in a house in the rue neuve saintgilles there they kept a sort of state spending lavishly now the money borrowed from the cardinal or upon the cardinals security now the proceeds of pawned goods that had been bought on credit and of other swindles practised upon those who were impressed by the ladys name and lineage and the patronage of the great cardinal which she enjoyed  to live on your wits is no easy matter it demands infinite address coolness daring and resource qualities which madame de la motte possessed in the highest degree so that harassed and pressed by creditors she yet contrived to evade their attacks and to present a calm and therefore confidenceinspiring front to the world  the truth of madame de la motte de valoiss reputation for influence at court was never doubted there was nothing in the character of marie antoinette to occasion such doubts indiscreet in many things her majesty was most notoriously so in her attachments as witness her intimacy with madame de polignac and the princesse de lambelle and the public voice had magnifiedas it willthose indiscretions until it had torn her character into shreds  the fame of the countess jeanne de valoisas madame de la motte now styled herselfincreasing she was employed as an intermediary by placeseekers and people with suits to prefer who gratefully purchased her promises to interest herself on their behalf at court  and then into her web of intrigue blundered the cardinal de rohan who as he confessed was completely blinded by his immense desire to regain the good graces of the queen she aroused fresh hope in his despairing heart by protesting that as some return for all the favours she had received from him she would not rest until she had disposed the queen more favourably towards him  later came assurances that the queens hostility was melting under her persuasions and at last she announced that she was authorized by her majesty to invite him to submit the justification which so long and so vainly he had sought permission to present  rohan in a vertigo of satisfaction indited his justification forwarded it to the queen by the hand of the countess and some days later received a note in the queens hand upon blueedged paper adorned by the lilies of france  i rejoice wrote marie antoinette to find at last that you were not in fault i cannot yet grant you the audience you desire but as soon as the circumstances allow of it i shall let you know be discreet  upon the advice of the countess of valois his eminence sent a reply expressive of his deep gratitude and joy  thus began a correspondence between queen and cardinal which continued regularly for a space of three months growing gradually more confidential and intimate as time passed his solicitations of an audience became more pressing until at last the queen wrote announcing that actuated by esteem and affection for him who had so long been kept in banishment she herself desired the meeting but it must be secret an open audience would still be premature he had numerous enemies at court who thus forewarned might so exert themselves against him as yet to ruin all  to receive such a letter from a beautiful woman and that woman a queen whose glories her inaccessibility had magnified a thousandfold in his imagination must have all but turned the cardinals head the secrecy of the correspondence culminating in a clandestine meeting seemed to establish between them an intimacy impossible under other circumstances  into the warp of his ambition was now woven another tenderly romantic though infinitely respectful feeling   you realize i hope the frame of mind in which the cardinalprince took his way through that luminous fragrant summer night towards the grove of venus he went to lay the cornerstone of the proud edifice of his ambitions to him it was a night of nightsa night of gems he pronounced it looking up into the jewelled vault of heaven and in that phrase he was singularly prophetic  by an avenue of boxwood and yokeelm he entered into an open glade in the middle of which there was a circle where the intended statue of venus was never placed but if the cold marble effigy of a goddess were absent the warm living figure of a queen stood all in shimmering white amid the gloom awaiting him  rohan checked a moment his breath arrested his pulses quickened then he sped forward and flinging off his widebrimmed hat he prostrated himself to kiss the hem of her white cambric gown somethinga rose that she let fallbrushed lightly past his cheek reverently he recovered it accounting it a tangible symbol of her favour and he looked up into the proud lovely facewhich although but dimly discernible was yet unmistakable to him protesting his gratitude and devotion he perceived that she was trembling and caught the quiver in the voice that answered him  you may hope that the past will be forgiven  and then before he could drink more deeply of this cup of delight came rapid steps to interrupt them a slender man in whom the cardinal seemed to recognize the queens valet desclaux thrust through the curtains of foliage into the grove  quick madame he exclaimed in agitation madame la comtesse and mademoiselle dartois are approaching  the queen was whirled away and the cardinal discreetly effaced himself his happiness tempered by chagrin at the interruption  when on the morrow the countess of valois brought him a bluebordered note with her majestys wishes that he should patiently await a propitious season for his public restoration to royal favour he resigned himself with the most complete and satisfied submission had he not the memory of her voice and the rose she had given him soon afterwards came a bluebordered note in which marie antoinette advised him to withdraw to his bishopric of strasbourg until she should judge that the desired season of his reinstatement had arrived  obediently rohan withdrew   it was in the following december that the countess of valoiss good offices at court were solicited by a new client and that she first beheld the famous diamond necklace  it had been made by the court jewellers of the rue vendomebohmer and bassengeand intended for the countess du barry on the assembling of its component gems bohmer had laboured for five years and travelled all over europe with the result that he had achieved not so much a necklace as a blazing scarf of diamonds of a splendour outrivalling any jewel that the world had ever seen  unfortunately bohmer was too long over the task louis xv died inopportunely and the firm found itself with a necklace worth two million livres on its hands  hopes were founded upon marie antoinettes reputed extravagance but the price appalled her while louis xvi met the importunities of the jeweller with the reply that the country needed a ship of war more urgently than a necklace  thereafter bohmer offered it in various courts of europe but always without success things were becoming awkward the firm had borrowed heavily to pay for the stones and anxiety seems to have driven bohmer to the verge of desperation again he offered the necklace to the king announcing himself ready to make terms and to accept payment in instalments but again it was refused  bohmer now became that pest to society the man with a grievance that he must be venting everywhere on one occasion he so far forgot himself as to intrude upon the queen as she was walking in the gardens of the trianon flinging himself upon his knees before her he protested with sobs that he was in despair and that unless she purchased the necklace he would go and drown himself his tears left her unmoved to anything but scorn  get up bohmer she bade him i dont like such scenes i have refused the necklace and i dont want to hear of it again instead of drowning yourself break it up and sell the diamonds separately  he did neither one nor the other but continued to air his grievance and among those who heard him was one laporte an impecunious visitor at the house of the countess of valois  bohmer had said that he would pay a thousand louis to any one who found him a purchaser for the necklace that was enough to stir the needy laporte he mentioned the matter to the countess and enlisted her interest then he told bohmer of her great influence with the queen and brought the jeweller to visit her with the necklace  dazzled by the fire of those gems the countess nevertheless protestedbut in an arch manner calculated to convince bohmer of the contrarythat she had no power to influence her majesty yet yielding with apparent reluctance to his importunities she nevertheless ended by promising to see what could be done  on january 3d the cardinal came back from strasbourg correspondence with the queen through madame de valois had continued during his absence and now within a few days of his return an opportunity was to be afforded him of proving his readiness to serve her majesty and of placing her under a profound obligation to him  the countess brought him a letter from marie antoinette in which the queen expressed her desire to acquire the necklace but added that being without the requisite funds at the moment it would be necessary to settle the terms and arrange the instalments which should be paid at intervals of three months for this she required an intermediary who in himself would be a sufficient guarantee to the bohmers and she ended by inviting his eminence to act on her behalf  that invitation the cardinal who had been waiting ever since the meeting in the grove of venus for an opportunity of proving himself accepted with alacrity  and so on january 24th the countess drives up to the grand balcon the jewellers shop in the rue vendome her dark eyes sparkle the lovely piquant face is wreathed in smiles  messieurs she greets the anxious partners i think i can promise you that the necklace will very shortly be sold  the jewellers gasp in the immensity of the hope her words arouse  the purchase she goes on to inform them will be effected by a very great nobleman  bassenge bursts into voluble gratitude she cuts it short  that nobleman is the cardinalprince louis de rohan it is with him that you will arrange the affair and i advise you she adds in a confidential tone to take every precaution especially in the matter of the terms of payment that may be proposed to you that is all i think messieurs you will of course bear in mind that it is no concern of mine and that i do not so much as want my name mentioned in connection with it  perfectly madame splutters bohmer who is perspiring although the air is coldperfectly we understand and we are profoundly grateful if his hands fumble nervously at a case if you would deign madame to accept this trifle as an earnest of our indebtedness we  there is a tinge of haughtiness in her manner as she interrupts him  you do not appear to understand bohmer that the matter does not at all concern me i have done nothing she insists then melting into smiles my only desire she adds was to be of service to you  and upon that she departs leaving them profoundly impressed by her graciousness and still more by her refusal to accept a valuable jewel  on the morrow the great nobleman she had heralded the cardinal himself alighted at the grand balcon coming on the queens behalf to see the necklace and settle the terms by the end of the week the bargain was concluded the price was fixed at 1600000 livres which the queen was to pay in four instalments extending over two years the first falling due on the following august 1st  these terms the cardinal embodied in a note which he forwarded to madame de la motte that they might be ratified by the queen  the countess returned the note to him next day  her majesty is pleased and grateful she announced and she approves of all that you have done but she does not wish to sign anything  on that point however the cardinal was insistent the magnitude of the transaction demanded it and he positively refused to move further without her majestys signature  the countess departed to return again on the last day of the month with the document completed as the cardinal required bearing now the signature marie antoinette de france and the terms marked approved in the queens hand  the queen madame de la motte informed him is making this purchase secretly without the kings knowledge and she particularly begs that this note shall not leave your eminences hands do not therefore allow any one to see it  rohan gave the required promise but not conceiving that the bohmers were included in it he showed them the note and the queens signature when they came to wait upon him with the necklace on the morrow  in the dusk of evening a closed carriage drew up at the door of madame de la motte valoiss lodging on the place dauphine at versailles rohan alighted and went upstairs with a casket under his arm  madame awaited him in a whitepanelled indifferently lighted room to which there was an alcove with glass doors  you have brought the necklace  it is here he replied tapping the box with his gloved hand  her majesty is expecting it tonight her messenger should arrive at any moment she will be pleased with your eminence  that is all that i can desire he answered gravely and sat down in answer to her invitation the precious casket on his knees  waiting thus they talked desultorily for some moments at last came steps upon the stairs  quick the alcove she exclaimed you must not be seen by her majestys messenger  rohan with ready understanding a miracle of discretion effaced himself into the alcove through the glass doors of which he could see what passed  the door was opened by madames maid with the announcement  from the queen  a tall slender young man in black the queens attendant of that other night of gemsthe night of the grove of venusstepped quickly into the room bowed like a courtier to madame de la motte and presented a note  madame broke the seal then begged the messenger to withdraw for a moment when he had gone she turned to the cardinal who stood in the doorway of the alcove  that is desclaux her majestys valet she said and held out to him the note which requested the delivery of the necklace to the bearer  a moment later the messenger was reintroduced to receive the casket from the hands of madame de la motte within five minutes the cardinal was in his carriage again driving happily back to paris with his dreams of a queens gratitude and confidence  two days later meeting bohmer at versailles the cardinal suggested to him that he should offer his thanks to the queen for having purchased the necklace  bohmer sought an opportunity for this in vain none offered it was also in vain that he waited to hear that the queen had worn the necklace but he does not appear to have been anxious on that score moreover the queens abstention was credibly explained by madame de la motte to laporte with the statement that her majesty did not wish to wear the necklace until it was paid for  with the same explanation she answered the cardinals inquiries in the following july when he returned from a three months sojourn in strasbourg  and she took the opportunity to represent to him that one of the reasons why the queen could not yet consider the necklace quite her own was that she found the price too high  indeed she may be constrained to return it after all unless the bohmers are prepared to be reasonable  if his eminence was a little dismayed by this at least any nascent uneasiness was quieted he consented to see the jewellers in the matter and on july 10ththree weeks before the first instalment was duehe presented himself at the grand balcon to convey the queens wishes to the bohmers  bohmer scarcely troubled to prevent disgust from showing on his keen swarthy countenance had not his client been a queen and her intermediary a cardinal he would no doubt have afforded it full expression  the price agreed upon was already greatly below the value of the necklace he grumbled i should never have accepted it but for the difficulties under which we have been placed by the purchase of the stonesthe money we owe and the interest we are forced to pay a further reduction is impossible  the handsome cardinal was suave courtly regretful but firm since that was the case there would be no alternative but to return the necklace  bohmer took fright the annulment of the sale would bring him face to face with ruin reluctantly feeling that he was being imposed upon he reduced the price by two hundred thousand livres and even consented to write the queen the following letter whose epistolary grace suggests the cardinals dictation  madamewe are happy to hazard the thought that our submission with zeal and respect to the last arrangement proposed constitutes a proof of our devotion and obedience to the orders of your majesty and we have genuine satisfaction in thinking that the most beautiful set of diamonds in existence will serve to adorn the greatest and best of queens  now it happened that bohmer was about to deliver personally to the queen some jewels with which the king was presenting her on the occasion of the baptism of his nephew he availed himself of that opportunity two days later personally to hand his letter to her majesty but chance brought the comptrollergeneral into the room before she had opened it and as a result the jeweller departed while the letter was still unread  afterwards in the presence of madame de campan who relates the matter in her memoirs the queen opened the note pored over it a while and then perhaps with vivid memories of bohmers threat of suicide  listen to what that madman bohmer writes to me she said and read the lines aloud you guessed the riddles in the mercure this morning i wonder could you guess me this one  and with a halfcontemptuous shrug she held the sheet in the flame of one of the tapers that stood alight on the table for the purpose of sealing letters  that man exists for my torment she continued he has always some mad notion in his head and must always be visiting it upon me when next you see him pray convince him how little i care for diamonds  and there the matter was dismissed  days passed and then a week before the instalment of 350000 livres was due the cardinal received a visit from madame de la motte on the queens behalf  her majesty madame announced seems embarrassed about the instalment she does not wish to trouble you by writing about it but i have thought of a way by which you could render yourself agreeable to her and at the same time set her mind at rest could you not raise a loan for the amount  had not the cardinal himself dictated to bohmer a letter which bohmer himself had delivered to the queen he must inevitably have suspected by now that all was not as it should be but satisfied as he was by that circumstance he addressed himself to the matter which madame de la motte proposed but although rohan was extraordinarily wealthy he had ever been correspondingly lavish  moreover to complicate matters there had been the bankruptcy of his nephew the prince de guimenee whose debts had amounted to some three million livres characteristically and for the sake of the family honour rohan had taken the whole of this burden upon his own shoulders hence his resources were in a crippled condition and it was beyond his power to advance so considerable a sum at such short notice nor did he succeed in obtaining a loan within the little time at his disposal  his anxieties on this score were increased by a letter from the queen which madame de la motte brought him on july 30th in which her majesty wrote that the first instalment could not be paid until october 1st but that on that date a payment of seven hundred thousand livreshalf of the revised pricewould unfailingly be made together with this letter madame de la motte handed him thirty thousand livres interest on the instalment due with which to pacify the jewellers  but the jewellers were not so easily to be pacified bohmer at the end of his patience definitely refused to grant the postponement or to receive the thirty thousand livres other than as on account of the instalment due  the cardinal departed in vexation something must be done at once or his secret relations with the queen would be disclosed thus precipitating a catastrophe and a scandal he summoned madame de la motte flung her into a panic with his news and sent her away to see what she could do what she actually did would have surprised him realizing that a crisis had been reached calling for bold measures she sent for bassenge the milder of the two partners he came to the rue neuve saintgilles protesting that he was being abused  abused quoth she taking him up on the word abused do you say she laughed sharply say duped my friend for that is what has happened to you you are the victim of a swindle  bassenge turned white his prominent eyes bulged in his rather pasty face  what are you saying madame his voice was husky  the queens signature on the note in the cardinals possession is a forgery  a forgery the queens signature oh mon dieu he stared at her and his knees began to tremble how do you know madame  i have seen it she answered  butbut  his nerveless limbs succumbing under him he sank without ceremony to a chair that was opportunely near him with the same lack of ceremony mechanically in a dazed manner he mopped the sweat that stood in beads on his brow then raised his wig and mopped his head  there is no need to waste emotion said she composedly the cardinal de rohan is very rich you must look to him he will pay you  will he  hope and doubt were blended in the question  what else she asked can you conceive that he will permit such a scandal to burst about his name and the name of the queen  bassenge saw light the rights and wrongs of the case and who might be the guilty parties were matters of very secondary importance what mattered was that the firm should recover the 14000000 livres for which the necklace had been sold and bassenge was quick to attach full value to the words of madame de la motte  unfortunately for everybody concerned including the jewellers themselves bohmers mind was less supple panicstricken by bassenges report he was all for the direct method there was no persuading him to proceed cautiously and to begin by visiting the cardinal he tore away to versailles at once intent upon seeing the queen but the queen as we know had had enough of bohmer he had to content himself with pouring his mixture of intercessions and demands into the ears of madame de campan  you have been swindled bohmer said the queens lady promptly her majesty never received the necklace  bohmer would not be convinced disbelieving and goaded to fury he returned to bassenge  bassenge however though perturbed retained his calm the cardinal he insisted was their security and it was impossible to doubt that the cardinal would fulfil his obligations at all costs rather than be overwhelmed by a scandal  and this no doubt is what would have happened but for that hasty visit of bohmers to versailles it ruined everything as a result of it bohmer was summoned to wait instantly upon the queen in the mater of some paste buckles  the queen received the jeweller in private and her greeting proved that the paste buckles were a mere pretext she demanded to know the meaning of his words to madame de campan  bohmer could not rid himself of the notion that he was being trifled with had he not written and himself delivered to the queen a letter in which he thanked her for purchasing the necklace and had not that letter remained unanswereda silent admission that the necklace was in her hands in his exasperation he became insolent  the meaning madame the meaning is that i require payment for my necklace that the patience of my creditors is exhausted and that unless you order the money to be paid i am a ruined man  marie antoinette considered him in cold imperious anger  are you daring to suggest that your necklace is in my possession  bohmer was white to the lips his hands worked nervously  does your majesty deny it  you are insolent she exclaimed you will be good enough to answer questions not to ask them answer me then do you suggest that i have your necklace  but a desperate man is not easily intimidated  no madame i affirm it it was the countess of valois who  who is the countess of valois  that sudden question sharply uttered was a sword of doubt through the heart of bohmers confidence he stared wideeyed a moment at the indignant lady before him then collected himself and made as plain a tale as he could of the circumstances under which he had parted with the necklace madame de la mottes intervention the mediation of the cardinal de rohan with her majestys signed approval of the terms and the delivery of the necklace to his eminence for transmission to the queen  marie antoinette listened in increasing horror and anger a flush crept into her pale cheeks  you will prepare and send me a written statement of what you have just told me she said you have leave to go  that interview took place on august 9th the 15th was the feast of the assumption and also the nameday of the queen therefore a gala day at court bringing a concourse of nobility to versailles mass was to be celebrated in the royal chapel at ten oclock and the celebrant as by custom established for the occasion was the grand almoner of france the cardinal de rohan  but at ten oclock a meeting was being held in the kings cabinet composed of the king and queen the baron de breteuil and the keeper of the seals miromesnil they were met as they believed to decide upon a course of action in the matter of a diamond necklace in reality these puppets in the hands of destiny were helping to decide the fate of the french monarchy  the king fat heavy and phlegmatic sat in a gilded chair by an ormoluencrusted writingtable his bovine eyes were troubled two wrinkles of vexation puckered the flesh above his great nose beside and slightly behind him stood the queen white and imperious whilst facing them stood monsieur de breteuil reading aloud the statement which bohmer had drawn up  when he had done there was a moments utter silence then the king spoke his voice almost plaintive  what is to be done then but what is to be done  it was the queen who answered him harshly and angrily  when the roman purple and a princely title are but masks to cover a swindler there is only one thing to be done this swindler must be exposed and punished  but the king faltered we have not heard the cardinal  can you think that bohmer that any man would dare to lie upon such a matter  but consider madame the cardinals rank and family calmly interposed the prudent miromesnil consider the stir the scandal that must ensue if this matter is made public  but the obedient daughter of marie therese hating rohan at her mothers bidding and for her mothers sake was impatient of any such wise considerations  what shall the scandal signify to us she demanded the king looked at breteuil  and you baron what is your view  breteuil rohans mortal enemy raised his shoulders and flipped the document  in the face of this sire it seems to me that the only course is to arrest the cardinal  you believe then began the king and checked leaving the sentence unfinished  but breteuil had understood  i know that the cardinal must be pressed for money he said ever prodigal in his expenditure he is further saddled with the debts of the prince de guimenee  and you can believe the king cried that a prince of the house of rohan however pressed for money couldoh it is unimaginable  yet has he not stolen my name the queen cut in is he not proven a common stupid forger  we have not heard him the king reminded her gently  and his eminence might be able to explain ventured miromesnil it were certainly prudent to give him the opportunity  slowly the king nodded his great powdered head go and find him bring him at once he bade breteuil and breteuil bowed and departed  very soon he returned and he held the door whilst the handsome cardinal little dreaming what lay before him serene and calm a commanding figure in his cassock of scarlet watered silk rustled forward into the royal presence and so came face to face with the queen for the first time since that romantic night a year ago in the grove of venus  abruptly the king launched his thunderbolt  cousin he asked what purchase is this of a diamond necklace that you are said to have made in the queens name  king and cardinal looked into each others eyes the kings narrowing the cardinals dilating the king leaning forward in his chair elbows on the table the cardinal standing tense and suddenly rigid  slowly the colour ebbed from rohans face leaving it deathly pale his eyes sought the queen and found her contemptuous glance her curling lip then at last his handsome head sank a little forward  sire he said unsteadily i see that i have been duped but i have duped nobody  you have no reason to be troubled then you need but to explain  explain that was precisely what he could not do besides what was the nature of the explanation demanded of him whilst he stood stricken there it was the queen who solved this question  if indeed you have been duped she said scornfully her colour high her eyes like points of steel you have been selfduped but even then it is beyond belief that selfdeception could have urged you to the lengths of passing yourself off as my intermediaryyou who should know yourself to be the last man in france i should employ you to whom i have not spoken once in eight years tears of anger glistened in her eyes her voice shrilled up and yet since you have not denied it since you put forward this pitiful plea that you have been duped we must believe the unbelievable  thus at a blow she shattered the fond hopes he had been cherishing ever since the night of gemsof gems forsoothin the grove of venus thus she laid his ambition in ruins about him and left the man himself half stunned  observing his disorder the ponderous but kindly monarch rose  come my cousin he said more gently collect yourself sit down here and write what you may have to say in answer  and with that he passed into the library beyond accompanied by the queen and the two ministers  alone rohan staggered forward and sank nervelessly into the chair he took up a pen pondered a moment and began to write but he did not yet see clear he could not yet grasp the extent to which he had been deceived could not yet believe that those treasured notes from marie antoinette were forgeries that it was not the queen who had met him in the grove of venus and given him the rose whose faded petals kept those letters company in a portfolio of red morocco but at least it was clear to him that for the sake of honourthe queens honourhe must assume it so and in that assumption he now penned his statement  when it was completed himself he bore it to the king in the library  louis read it with frowning brows then passed it to the queen  have you the necklace now he asked rohan  sir i left it in the hands of this woman valois  where is this woman  i do not know sire  and the letter of authority bearing the queens signature which the jewellers say you presented to themwhere is that  i have it sire i will place it before you it is only now that i realize that it is a forgery  only now exclaimed the queen in scorn  her majestys name has been compromised said the king sternly it must be cleared as king and as husband my duty is clear your eminence must submit to arrest  rohan fell back a step in stupefaction for disgrace and dismissal he was prepared but not for this  arrest he whispered ah wait sire the publicity the scandal think of that as for the necklace i will pay for it myself and so pay for my credulous folly i beseech you sire to let the matter end here i implore it for my own sake for the sake of the prince de soubise and the name of rohan which would be smirched unjustly and to no good purpose  he spoke with warmth and force and without adding more yet conveyed an impression that much more could be said for the course he urged  the king hesitated considering noting this the prudent farseeing miromesnil ventured to develop the arguments at which rohan had hinted laying stress upon the desirability of avoiding scandal  louis was nodding convinced when marie antoinette unable longer to contain her rancour broke into opposition of those prudent measures  this hideous affair must be disclosed she insisted it is due to me that it should publicly be set right the cardinal shall tell the world how he came to suppose that not having spoken to him for eight years i could have wished to make use of his services in the purchase of this necklace  she was in tears and her weak easily swayed husband accounted her justified in her demand and so to the great consternation of all the world prince louis de rohan was arrested like a common thief  a foolish indiscreet shortsighted woman had allowed her rancour to override all other considerationscareless of consequences careless of injustice so that her resentment glutted by her hatred of the cardinal should be gratified the ungenerous act was terribly to recoil upon her in tears and blood was she to expiate her lack of charity very soon she was to reap its bitter fruits  saintjust a very prominent counsellor of the parliament one of the most advanced apostles of the new ideas that were to find full fruition in the revolution expressed the popular feeling in the matter  great and joyful affair a cardinal and a queen implicated in a forgery and a swindle filth on the crosier and the sceptre what a triumph for the ideas of liberty  at the trial that followed before parliament madame de la motte a man named reteaux de villettewho had forged the queens hand and impersonated desclaux and a mademoiselle dolivawho had used her striking resemblance to marie antoinette to impersonate the queen in the grove of venus were found guilty and sentenced but the necklace was not recovered it had been broken up and some of the diamonds were already sold others were being sold in london by captain de la motte who had gone thither for the purpose and who prudently remained there  the cardinal was acquitted amid intense public joy and acclamation which must have been gall and wormwood to the queen his powerful family the clergy of france and the very people with whom he had ever been popular had all laboured strenuously to vindicate him and thus it befell that the one man the queen had aimed at crushing was the only person connected with the affair who came out of it unhurt the queens animus against the cardinal aroused against her the animus of his friends of all classes appalling libels of her were circulated throughout europe it was thought and argued that she was more deeply implicated in the swindle than had transpired that madame de la motte was a scapegoat that the queen should have stood her trial with the others and that she was saved only by the royalty that hedged her  conceive what a weapon this placed in the hands of the men of the new ideas of libertymen who were bent on proving the corruption of a system they sought to destroy  marie antoinette should have foreseen something of this she might have done so had not her hatred blinded her had she been less intent upon seizing the opportunity at all costs to make rohan pay for his barbed witticism upon her mother she might have been spared much had she but spared rohan when the chance was hers as it was the malevolent echoes of the affair and of saintjusts exultation were never out of her ears they followed her to her trial eight years later before the revolutionary tribunal they followed her to the very scaffold of which they had undoubtedly supplied a plank     viii the night of terrorthe drownings at nantes under carrier   the revolutionary committee of the city of nantes reinforced by some of the administrators of the district and a few members of the peoples society sat in the noble hall of the cour des comptes which still retained much of its prerepublican sumptuousness they sat expectantlygoullin the attorney president of the committee a frail elegant valetudinarian fierily eloquent grandmaison the fencingmaster who once had been a gentleman fierce of eye and inflamed of countenance minee the sometime bishop now departmental president pierre chaux the bankrupt merchant the sansculotte forget of the peoples society an unclean illkempt ruffian and some thirty others called like these from every walk of life  lamps were lighted and under their yellow glare the huddled companyfor the month was december and the air of the vast room was chill and danklooked anxious and ill at ease  suddenly the doors were thrown open by an usher and his voice rang loud in announcement  the citizen representative carrier  the great man came in stepping quickly of middle height very frail and delicate his claycolored face was long and thin with arched eyebrows a high nose and a loose coarse mouth his deeply sunken dark eyes glared fiercely and wisps of deadblack hair which had escaped the confining ribbon of his queue hung about his livid brow he was wrapped in a ridingcoat of bottlegreen heavily lined with fur the skirts reaching down to the tops of his hessian boots and the enormous turnedup collar almost touching the brim of his round hat under the coat his waist was girt with the tricolour of office and there were gold rings in his ears  such at the age of fiveandthirty was jean baptiste carrier representative of the convention with the army of the west the attorney who once had been intended by devout parents for the priesthood he had been a month in nantes sent thither to purge the body politic  he reached a chair placed in the focus of the gathering which sat in a semicircle standing by it one of his lean hands resting upon the back he surveyed them disgust in his glance a sneer curling his lip so terrible and brutal of aspect despite his frailness that more than one of those stout fellows quailed now before him  suddenly he broke into torrential speech his voice shrill and harsh  i do not know by what fatality it happens but happen it does that during the month that i have been in nantes you have never ceased to give me reason to complain of you i have summoned you to meet me here that you may justify yourselves if you can for your ineptitude and he flung himself into the chair drawing his furlined coat about him let me hear from you he snapped  minee the unfrocked bishop preserving still a certain episcopal portliness of figure a certain episcopal oiliness of speech respectfully implored the representative to be more precise  the invitation flung him into a passion his irascibility indeed deserved to become a byword  name of a name he shrilled his sunken eyes ablaze his face convulsed is there a thing i can mention in this filthy city of yours that is not wrong everything is wrong you have failed in your duty to provide adequately for the army of vendee angers has fallen and now the brigands are threatening nantes itself there is abject want in the city disease is rampant people are dying of hunger in the streets and of typhus in the prisons and sacre nomyou ask me to be precise ill be precise in telling you where lies the fault it lies in your lousy administration do you call yourselves administrators you he became unprintable i have come here to shake you out of your torpor and byill shake you out of it or ill have the blasted heads off the lot of you  they shivered with chill fear under the wild glare of his sunken eyes  well he barked after a long pause are you all dumb as well as idiots  it was the ruffian forget who had the courage to answer him  i have told the peoples society that if the machine works badly it is because the citizen carrier refuses to consult with the administration  you told them that did you youliar screeched carrier am i not here now to consult with you and should i not have come before had you suggested it instead you have waited until of my own accord i should come to tell you that your administration is ruining nantes  goullin the eloquent and elegant goullin rose to soothe him  citizen representative we admit the truth of all that you have said there has been a misunderstanding we could not take it upon ourselves to summon the august representative of the sacred people i we have awaited your own good pleasure and now that you have made this manifest there is no reason why the machine should not work effectively the evils of which you speak exist alas but they are not so deeply rooted that working under your guidance and advice we cannot uproot them rendering the soil fertile once more of good under the beneficent fertilizing showers of liberty  mollified carrier grunted approval  that is well said citizen goullin the fertilizer needed by the soil is bloodthe bad blood of aristocrats and federalists and i can promise you in the name of the august people that it shall be abundantly provided  the assembly broke into applause and his vanity melted to it he stood up expressed his gratification at being so completely understood opened his arms and invited the departmental president minee to come down and receive the kiss of brotherhood  thereafter they passed to the consideration of measures of improvement of measures to combat famine and disease in carriers view there was only one way of accomplishing thisthe number of mouths to be fed must be reduced the diseased must be eliminated it was the direct the radical the heroic method  that very day six prisoners in le bouffay had been sentenced to death for attempting to escape  how do we know he asked that those six include all the guilty how do we know that all in le bouffay do not share the guilt the prisoners are riddled with disease which spreads to the good patriots of nantes they eat bread which is scarce whilst good patriots starve we must have the heads off all those blasted swine he took fire at his own suggestion aye that would be a useful measure well deal with it at once let some one fetch the president of the revolutionary tribunal  he was fetcheda man of good family and a lawyer named francois phelippes  citizen president carrier greeted him the administration of nantes has been considering an important measure today you sentenced to death six prisoners in le bouffay for attempting to escape you are to postpone execution so as to include all the bouffay prisoners in the sentence  although an ardent revolutionary phelippes was a logically minded man with a lawyers reverence for the sacredness of legal form this command issued with such cynical coldness and repudiated by none of those present seemed to him as grotesque and ridiculous as it was horrible  but that is impossible citizen representative said he  impossible snarled carrier a fools word the administration desires you to understand that it is not impossible the sacred will of the august people  phelippes interrupted him without ceremony  there is no power in france that can countermand the execution of a sentence of the law  nono power  carriers loose mouth fell open he was too amazed to be angry  moreover phelippes pursued calmly there is the fact that all the other prisoners in le bouffay are innocent of the offence for which the six are to die  what has that to do with it roared carrier last year i rode a sheass that could argue better than you in the name of what has that to do with it  but there were members of the assembly who thought with phelippes and who whilst lacking the courage to express themselves yet found courage to support another who so boldly expressed them  carrier sprang up quivering with rage before that opposition it seems to me he snarled that there are more than the scoundrels in le bouffay who need to be shortened by a head for the good of the nation i tell you that you are slaying the commonweal by your slowness and circumspection let all the scoundrels perish  a handsome vicious youngster named robin made chorus  patriots are without bread it is fitting that the scoundrels should die and not eat the bread of starving patriots  carrier shook his fist at the assembly  you hear you i cannot pardon whom the law condemns  it was an unfortunate word and phelippes fastened on it  that is the truth citizen representative said phelippes and as for the prisoners in le bouffay you will wait until the law condemns them  and without staying to hear more he departed as firmly as he had come indifferent to the sudden uproar  when he had gone the representative flung himself into his chair again biting his lip  there goes a fellow who will find his way to the guillotine in time he growled  but he was glad to be rid of him and would not have him brought back he saw how the opposition of phelippes had stiffened the weaker opposition of some of those in the assembly if he was to have his way he would contrive better without the legalminded president of the revolutionary tribunal and his way he had in the end though not until he had stormed and cursed and reviled the few who dared to offer remonstrances to his plan of wholesale slaughter  when at last he took his departure it was agreed that the assembly should proceed to elect a jury which was to undertake the duty of drawing up immediately a list of those confined in the prisons of nantes this list they were to deliver when ready to the committee which would know how to proceed for carrier had made his meaning perfectly clear the first salutary measure necessary to combat the evils besetting the city was to wipe out at once the inmates of all the prisons in nantes  in the chill december dawn of the next day the committeewhich had sat all night under the presidency of goullin forwarded a list of some five hundred prisoners to general boivin the commandant of the city of nantes together with an order to collect them without a moments delay take them to leperonniere and there have them shot  but boivin was a soldier and a soldier is not a sansculotte he took the order to phelippes with the announcement that he had no intention of obeying it phelippes to boivins amazement agreed with him he sent the order back to the committee denouncing it as flagrantly illegal and reminding them that it was illegal to remove any prisoner no matter by whose order without such an order as might follow upon a decision of the tribunal  the committee intimidated by this firmness on the part of the president of the revolutionary tribunal dared not insist and there the matter remained  when carrier learnt of it the things he said were less than ever fit for publication he raved like a madman at the very thought that a quibbling lawyer should stand in the very path of him the august representative of the sacred people  it had happened that fiftythree priests who had been brought to nantes a few days before were waiting in the sheds of the entrepot for prison accommodation so that their names did not yet appear upon any of the prison registers as a solatium to his wounded feelings he ordered his friends of the marat company to get rid of them  lamberty the leader of the marats asked him how it should be done  how he croaked not so much mystery my friend fling the swine into the water and so lets be rid of them there will be plenty of their kind left in france  but he seems to have explained himself further and what precisely were his orders and how they were obeyed transpires from a letter which he wrote to the convention stating that those fiftythree wretched priests being confined in a boat on the loire were last night swallowed up by the river and he added the apostrophe what a revolutionary torrent is the loire  the convention had no illusions as to his real meaning and when carrier heard that his letter had been applauded by the national assembly he felt himself encouraged to break down all barriers of mere legality that might obstruct his path and after all what the revolutionary committee as a bodyintimidated by phelippesdared not do could be done by his faithful and less punctilious friends of the marat company  this marat company the police of the revolutionary committee enrolled from the scourings of nantes sansculottism and captained by a ruffian named fleury had been called into being by carrier himself with the assistance of goullin  on the night of the 24th frimaire of the year iii december 14 1793 old style which was a saturday fleury mustered some thirty of his men and took them to the cour des comptes where they were awaited by goullin bachelier grandmaison and some other members of the committee entirely devoted to carrier from these the marats received their formal instructions  plague goullin informed them is raging in the gaols and its ravages must be arrested you will therefore proceed this evening to the prison of le bouffay in order to take over the prisoners whom you will march up to the quay la fosse whence they will be shipped to belle isle   in a cell of that sordid old building known as le bouffay lay a cocassier an egg and poultry dealer arrested some three years before upon a charge of having stolen a horse and since forgotten his own version was that a person of whom he knew very little had entrusted him with the sale of the stolen animal in possession of which he was discovered  the story sounds familiar it is the sort of story that must have done duty many times and it is probable that the cocassier was no better than he should have been nevertheless fate selected him to be one of her unconscious instruments his name was leroy and we have his own word for it that he was a staunch patriot the horse business was certainly in the best vein of sansculottism  leroy was awakened about ten oclock that night by sounds that were very unusual in that sombre sepulchral prison they were sounds of unbridled revelrysnatches of ribald song bursts of coarse reverberating laughter and they proceeded as it seemed to him from the courtyard and the porters lodge  he crawled from the dank straw which served him for a bed and approached the door to listen clearly the porter laqueze was entertaining friends and making unusually merry it was also to be gathered that laquezes friends were getting very drunk what the devil did it mean  his curiosity was soon to be very fully gratified came heavy steps up the stone staircase the clatter of sabots the clank of weapons and through the grille of his door an increasing light began to beat  some one was singing the carmagnole in drunken discordant tones keys rattled bolts were drawn doors were being flung open the noise increased above the general din he heard the detestable voice of the turnkey  come and see my birds in their cages come and see my pretty birds  leroy began to have an uneasy premonition that the merrymaking portended sinister things  get up all of you bawled the turnkey up and pack your traps youre to go on a voyage no laggards now up with you  the door of leroys cell was thrown open in its turn and he found himself confronting a group of drunken ruffians one of thesea redcapped giant with long black mustaches and a bundle of ropes over one arm suddenly pounced upon him the cocassier was an active vigorous young man but actuated by fear and discretion he permitted himself tamely to be led away  along the stoneflagged corridor he went and on every hand beheld his fellowprisoners in the same plight being similarly dragged from their cells and similarly hurried below at the head of the stairs one fellow perfectly drunk was holding a list hiccupping over names which he garbled ludicrously as he called them out he was lighted in his task by a candle held by another who was no less drunk the swaying pair seemed to intersupport one another grotesquely  leroy suffered himself to be led down the stairs and so came to the porters lodge where he beheld a halfdozen marats assembled round a table with bumpers of wine before them bawling singing cursing and cracking lewd jests at the expense of each prisoner as he entered the place was in a litter a lamp had been smashed and there was a puddle of wine on the floor from a bottle that had been knocked over on a bench against the wall were ranged a number of prisoners others lay huddled on the floor and all of them were pinioned  two or three of the marats lurched up to leroy and ran their hands over him turning out his pockets and cursing him foully for their emptiness he saw the same office performed upon others and saw them stripped of money pocketbooks watches rings buckles and whatever else of value they happened to possess one man a priest was even deprived of his shoes by a ruffian who was in want of footgear  as they were pinioning his wrists leroy looked up he confesses that he was scared  what is this for he asked does it mean death  with an oath he was bidden to ask no questions  if i die he assured them you will be killing a good republican  a tall man with an inflamed countenance and fierce black eyes that were somewhat vitreous now leered down upon him  you babbling fool its not your life its your property we want  this was grandmaison the fencingmaster who once had been a gentleman he had been supping with carrier and he had only just arrived at le bouffay accompanied by goullin he found the work behind time and told them so  leave that fellow now jolly hes fast enough up and fetch the rest its time to be going time to be going  flung aside now that he was pinioned leroy sat down on the floor and looked about him near him an elderly man was begging for a cup of water they greeted the prayer with jeering laughter  water by sainte guillotine he asks for water the drunken sansculottes were intensely amused patience my friendpatience and you shall drink your fill you shall drink from the great cup  soon the porters lodge was crowded with prisoners and they were overflowing into the passage  came grandmaison cursing and swearing at the sluggishness of the marats reminding themas he had been reminding them for the last hourthat it was time to be off that the tide was on the ebb  stimulated by him jollythe redcapped giant with the black mustachesand some others of the marat company set themselves to tie the prisoners into chains of twenty further to ensure against possible evasion they were driven into the chilly courtyard and there grandmaison followed by a fellow with a lantern passed along the ranks counting them  the result infuriated him  a hundred and five he roared and swore horribly you have been here nearly five hours and in all that time you have managed to truss up only a hundred and five are we never to get through with it i tell you the tide is ebbing it is time to be off  laqueze the porter of le bouffay with whose food and wine those myrmidons of the committee had made so disgracefully free came to assure him that he had all who were in the prison  all cried grandmaison aghast but according to the list there should have been nearer two hundred and he raised his voice to call goullin hola goullin where the devil is goullin  the list laqueze told him was drawn up from the register but you have not noted that many have died since they camewe have had the fever hereand that a few are now in hospital  in hospital bah go up some of you and fetch them we are taking them somewhere where they will be cured and then he hailed the elegant goullin who came up wrapped in a cloak heres a fine bathingparty he grumbled a rare hundred of these swine  goullin turned to laqueze  what have you done with the fifteen brigands i sent you this evening  but they only reached nantes today said laqueze who understood nothing of these extraordinary proceedings they have not yet been registered not even examined  i asked you what you have done with them snapped goullin  they are upstairs  then fetch them they are as good as any others  with these and a dozen or so dragged from sickbeds the total was made up to about a hundred and thirty  the marats further reinforced now by half a company of national guards set out from the prison towards five oclock in the morning urging their victims along with blows and curses  our cocassier found himself bound wrist to wrist with a young capuchin brother who stumbled along in patient resignation his head bowed his lips moving as if he were in prayer  can you guess what they are going to do with us murmured leroy  he caught the faint gleam of the capuchins eyes in the gloom  i do not know brother commend yourself to god and so be prepared for whatever may befall  the answer was not very comforting to a man of leroys temperament he stumbled on and they came now upon the place du bouffay where the red guillotine loomed in ghostly outline and headed towards the quai tourville thence they were marched by the river the whole length of the quai la fosse fear spreading amongst them some clamours were raised to be instantly silenced by blows and assurances that they were to be shipped to belle isle where they were to be set to work to build a fort  the cocassier thought this likely enough and found it more comforting than saying his prayersa trick which he had long since lost  as they defiled along the quays an occasional window was thrown up and an inquisitive head protruded to be almost instantly withdrawn again  on the cale robin at last they were herded into a shed which opened on to the water here they found a large lighter alongside and they beheld in the lanternlight the silhouettes of a halfdozen shipwrights busily at work upon it whilst the place rang with the blows of hammers and the scream of saws  some of those nearest the barge saw what was being done two great ports were being opened in the vessels side and over one of these thus opened the shipwrights were nailing planks they observed that these ports which remained above the waterline now that the barge was empty would be well below it once she were laden and conceiving that they perceived at last the inhuman fate awaiting them their terror rose again they remembered snatches of conversation and grim jests uttered by the marats in le bouffay which suddenly became clear and the alarm spreading amongst them they writhed and clamoured screamed for mercy cursed and raved  blows were showered upon them in vain was it sought to quiet them again with that fable of a fort to be constructed on belle isle one of them in a frenzy of despair tore himself free of his bonds profited by a moment of confusion and vanished so thoroughly that grandmaison and his men lost a quarter of an hour seeking him in vain and would have so spent the remainder of the night but for a sharp word from a man in a greatcoat and a round hat who stood looking on in conversation with goullin  get on man never mind that one well have him later it will be daylight soon youve wasted time enough already  it was carrier  he had come in person to see the execution of his orders and at his command grandmaison now proceeded to the loading a ladder was set against the side of the lighter by which the prisoners were to descend the cords binding them in chains were now severed and they were left pinioned only by the wrists they were ordered to embark but as they were slow to obey and as some indeed hung back wailing and interceding he and jolly took them by their collars thrust them to the edge and bundled them neck and crop down into the hold recking nothing of broken limbs finding this method of embarkation more expeditious the use of the ladder was neglected thenceforth  among the last to be thus flung aboard was our cocassier leroy he fell soft upon a heaving writhing mass of humanity which only gradually shook down and sorted itself out on the bottom of the lighter when the hatches overhead were being nailed down yet by an odd chance the young capuchin and leroy who had been companions in the chain were not separated even now amid the human welter in that agitated place of darkness the cries and wails that rang around him leroy recognized the voice of the young friar exhorting them to prayer  they were in the stern of the vessel against one of the sides and leroy who still kept a grip on the wits by which he had lived bade the capuchin hold up his wrists then he went nosing like a dog until at last he found them and his strong teeth fastened upon the cord that bound them and began with infinite patience to gnaw it through  meanwhile that floating coffin had left its moorings and was gliding with the stream on the hatches sat grandmaison with jolly and two other marats howling the carmagnole to drown the cries of the wretches underneath and beating time with their feet upon the deck  leroys teeth worked on like a rats until at last the cord was severed then lest they should be parted in the general heaving and shifting of that human mass those teeth of his fastened upon the capuchins sleeve  take hold of me he commanded as distinctly as he could and the capuchin gratefully obeyed now untie my wrists  the capuchins hands slid along leroys arms until they found his hands and there his fingers grew busy groping at the knots it was no easy matter to untie them in the dark guided by sense of touch alone but the friar was persistent and patient and in the end the last knot ran loose and our cocassier was unpinioned  it comforted him out of all proportion to the advantage at least his hands were free for any emergency that might offer that he depended in such a situation and with no illusions as to what was to happen upon emergency shows how tenacious he was of hope  he had been released not a moment too soon overhead grandmaison and his men were no longer singing they were moving about something bumped against the side of the vessel near the bow obviously a boat and voices came up from below the level of the deck then the lighter shuddered under a great blow upon the planks of the forecastle port the cries in the hold redoubled panting cursing wailing men hurtled against leroy and almost crushed him for a moment under their weight as the vessel heaved to starboard came a succession of blows not only on the port in the bow but also on that astern there was a cracking and rending of timbers and the water rushed in  then the happenings in that black darkness became indescribably horrible in their frenzy not a few had torn themselves free of their bonds these hurled themselves towards the open ports through which the water was pouring they tore at the planks with desperate lacerated hands some got their arms through seeking convulsively to widen the openings and so to gain an egress but outside in the shipwrights boat stood grandmaison the fencingmaster brandishing a butchers sword  with derision and foul objurgations he slashed at protruding arms and hands thrust his sword again and again through the port into that closepacked weltering mass until at last the shipwrights backed away the boat to escape the suction of the sinking lighter  the vessel with its doomed freight of a hundred and thirty human lives settled down slowly by the head and the wailing and cursing was suddenly silenced as the icy waters of the loire eddied over it and raced on  caught in the swirl of water leroy had been carried up against the deck of the lighter instinctively he had clutched at a crossbeam the water raced over his head and then to his surprise receded beat up once or twice as the lighter grounded and finally settled on a level with his shoulders  he was quick to realize what had happened the lighter had gone down by the head on a shallow her stern remained slightly protruding so that in that part of her between the level of the water and the deck there was a clear space of perhaps a foot or a foot and a half yet of the hundred and thirty doomed wretches on board he was the only one who had profited by this extraordinary chance  leroy hung on there and thereafter for two hours to use his own expression he floated upon corpses a man of less vigorous mettle moral and physical could never have withstood the ordeal of a two hours immersion in the icecold water of that december morning leroy clung on and hoped i have said that he was tenacious of hope and soon after daybreak he was justified of his confidence in his luck as the first livid gleams of light began to suffuse the water in which he floated a creaking of rowlocks and a sound of voices reached his ears a boat was passing down the river  leroy shouted and his voice rang hollow and sepulchral on the morning stillness the creak of oars ceased abruptly he shouted again and was answered the oars worked now at twice their former speed the boat was alongside blows of a grapnel tore at the planking of the deck until there was a hole big enough to admit the passage of his body  he looked through the faint mist which he had feared never to see again heaved himself up with what remained him of strength until his breast was on a level with the deck and beheld two men in a boat  but exhausted by the effort his numbed limbs refused to support him he sank back and went overhead fearing now indeed that help had arrived too late but as he struggled to the surface the bight of a rope smacked the water within the hold convulsively he clutched it wound it about one arm and bade them haul  thus they dragged him out and aboard their own craft and put him ashore at the nearest point willing out of humanity to do so much but daring to do no more when he had told them how he came where they had found him  half naked numbed through and through with chattering teeth and failing limbs leroy staggered into the guardhouse at chantenay soldiers of the blues stripped him of his sodden rags wrapped him in a blanket thawed him outwardly before a fire and inwardly with gruel and then invited him to give an account of himself  the story of the horse will have led you to suppose him a ready liar he drew now upon that gift of his represented himself as a mariner from montoir and told a harrowing tale of shipwreck unfortunately he overdid it there was present a fellow who knew something of the sea and something of montoir to whom leroys tale did not ring quite true to rid themselves of responsibility the soldiers carried him before the revolutionary committee of nantes  even here all might have gone well with him since there was no member of that body with seacraft to penetrate his imposture but as illchance would have it one of the members sitting that day was the blackmustached sansculotte jolly the very man who had dragged leroy out of his cell last night and tied him up  at sight of him jollys eyes bulged in his head  where the devil have you come from he greeted him thunderously  leroy quailed jollys associates stared but jolly explained to them  he was of last nights bathing party and he has the impudence to come before us like this take him away and shove him back into the water  but bachelier a man who next to the president goullin exerted the greatest influence in the committee was gifted with a sense of humour worthy of the revolution he went off into peals of laughter as he surveyed the crestfallen cocassier and perhaps because leroys situation amused him he was disposed to be humane  no no he said take him back to le bouffay for the present let the tribunal deal with him  so back to le bouffay went leroy back to his dungeon his fetid straw and his bread and water there to be forgotten again as he had been forgotten before until fate should need him  it is to him that we owe most of the materials from which we are able to reconstruct in detail that first of carriers drownings on a grand scale conceived as an expeditious means of ridding the city of useless mouths of easing the straitened circumstances resulting from misgovernment  very soon it was followed by others and custom increasing carriers audacity these drowningsthere were in all some twentythree noyadesceased to be conducted in the secrecy of the night or to be confined to men they were made presently to include womenof whom at one drowning alone in novose three hundred perished under the most revolting circumstancesand even little children carrier himself admitted that during the three months of his rule some three thousand victims visited the national bathingplace whilst other and no doubt more veracious accounts treble that number of those who received the national baptism  soon these wholesale drownings had become an institution a sort of national spectacle that carrier and his committee felt themselves in duty bound to provide  but at length a point was reached beyond which it seemed difficult to continue them so expeditious was the measure that soon the obvious material was exhausted the prisons were empty yet habits once contracted are not easily relinquished carrier would be looking elsewhere for material and there was no saying where he might look or who would be safe soon the committee heard a rumour that the representative intended to depose it and to appoint a new one whereupon many of its members who were conscious of lukewarmness began to grow uneasy  uneasy too became the members of the peoples society they had sent a deputation to carrier with suggestions for the better conduct of the protracted campaign of la vendee this was a sore point with the representative he received the patriots with the foulest abuse and had them flung downstairs by his secretaries  into this atmosphere of general mistrust and apprehension came the most ridiculous deus ex machina that ever was in the person of the very young and very rash marc antoine jullien his father the deputy jullien was an intimate of robespierres by whose influence marc antoine was appointed to the office of agent of the committee of public safety and sent on a tour of inspection to report upon public feeling and the conduct of the conventions representatives  arriving in nantes at the end of january of 94 one of marc antoines first visits happened to be to the peoples society which was still quivering with rage at the indignities offered by carrier to its deputation  marc antoine was shocked by what he heard so shocked that instead of going to visit the representative on the morrow he spent the morning inditing a letter to robespierre in which he set forth in detail the abuses of which carrier was guilty and the deplorable state of misery in which he found the city of nantes  that night as marc antoine was sinking into the peaceful slumber of the man with duty done he was rudely aroused by an officer and a couple of men of the national guard who announced to him that he was under arrest and bade him rise and dress  marc antoine flounced out of bed in a temper and flaunted his credentials the officer remained unmoved he was acting upon orders from the citizen representative  still in a temper marc antoine hurriedly dressed himself he would soon show this representative that it is not safe to trifle with agents of the public safety the citizen representative should hear from him the officer still unimpressed bundled him into a waiting carriage and bore him away to the maison villetreux on the island where carrier had his residence  carrier had gone to bed but he was awake and he sat up promptly when the young muscadin from paris was roughly thrust into his room by the soldiers the mere sight of the representative sufficed to evaporate marc antoines anger and with it his courage  carriers pallor was of a greygreen from the rage that possessed him his black eyes smouldered like those of an animal seen in the gloom and his tumbled black hair fluttering about his moist brow increased the terrific aspect of his countenance marc antoine shrank and was dumb  so said carrier regarding him steadily terribly you are the thing that dares to denounce me to the safety that ventures to find fault with my work from under his pillow he drew marc antoines letter to robespierre is this yours  at the sight of this violation of his correspondence with the incorruptible marc antoines indignation awoke and revived his courage  it is mine he answered by what right have you intercepted it  by what right carrier put a leg out of bed so you question my right do you you have so imposed yourself upon folk that you are given powers and you come here to air them by  you shall answer to the citizen robespierre for your conduct marc antoine threatened him  aha carrier revealed his teeth in a smile of ineffable wickedness he slipped from the bed and crouching slightly as if about to spring he pointed a lean finger at his captive  you are of those with whom it is dangerous to deal publicly and you presume upon that but you can be dealt with privily and you shall i have you and by you shall not escape me you  marc antoine looked into the representatives face and saw there the wickedness of his intent he stiffened nature had endowed him with wits and he used them now  citizen carrier he said i understand i am to be murdered tonight in the gloom and the silence but you shall perish after me in daylight and amid the execrations of the people you may have intercepted my letters to my father and to robespierre but if i do not leave nantes my father will come to ask an account of you and you will end your life on the scaffold like the miserable assassin that you are  of all that tirade but one sentence had remained as if corroded into the mind of carrier my letters to my father and to robespierre the astute marc antoine had said and marc antoine saw the representatives mouth loosen saw a glint of fear replace the ferocity in his dark eyes  what marc antoine intended to suggest had instantly leapt to carriers mindthat there had been a second letter which his agents had missed they should pay for that but meanwhile if it were true he dare not for his necks sake go further in this matter he may have suspected that it was not true but he had no means of testing that suspicion marc antoine you see was subtle  your father growled the representative who is your father  the deputy jullien  what carrier straightened himself affecting an immense astonishment you are the son of the deputy julien he burst into a laugh he came forward holding out both his hands he could be subtle too you see my friend why did you not say so sooner see in what a ghastly mistake you have let me flounder i imagined youof course it was foolish of meto be a proscribed rascal from angers of the same name  he had fallen upon marc antoines neck and was embracing him  forgive me my friend he besought him come and dine with me tomorrow and we will laugh over it together  but marc antoine had no mind to dine with carrier although he promised to do so readily enough back at his inn scarce believing that he had got away alive still sweating with terror at the very thought of his near escape he packed his valise and by virtue of his commission obtained posthorses at once  on the morrow from angers safe beyond the reach of carrier he wrote again to robespierre and this time also to his father  in nantes he wrote i found the old regime in its worst form he knew the jargon of liberty the tune that set the patriots adancing carriers insolent secretaries emulate the intolerable haughtiness of a cidevant ministers lackeys carrier himself lives surrounded by luxury pampered by women and parasites keeping a harem and a court he tramples justice in the mud he has had all those who filled the prisons flung untried into the loire the city of nantes he concluded needs saving the vendean revolt must be suppressed and carrier the slayer of liberty recalled  the letter had its effect and carrier was recalled to paris but not in disgrace failing health was urged as the solicitous reason for his retirement from the arduous duties of governing nantes  in the convention his return made little stir and even when early in the following july he learnt that bourbotte his successor at nantes had ordered the arrest of goullin bachelier grandmaison and his other friends of the committee on the score of the drownings and the appropriation of national property confiscated from emigres he remained calm satisfied that his own position was unassailable  but the members of the committee of nantes were sent to paris for trial and their arrival there took place on that most memorable date in the annals of the revolution the 10th thermidor july 29 1794 os the day on which robespierre fell and the floodgates of vengeance upon the terrorists were flung open  you have seen in the case of marc antoine jullien how quick carrier could be to take a cue in a coach he followed the tumbril that bore robespierre to execution radiant of countenance and shouting with the loudest death to the traitor on the morrow from the rostrum of the convention he passionately represented himself as a victim of the fallen tyrant cleverly turning to his own credit the marc antoine affair reminding the convention how he had himself been denounced to robespierre he was greeted with applause in that atmosphere of thermidorean reaction  but nemesis was stalking him relentlessly if silently  among a batch of prisoners whom a chain of curious chances had brought from nantes to paris was our old friend leroy the cocassier required now as a witness against the members of the committee  having acquainted the court with the grounds of his arrest and the fact that for three years he had lain forgotten and without trial in the pestilential prison of le bouffay leroy passed on to a recital of his sufferings on that night of terror when he had gone down the loire in the doomed lighter he told his tale with an artlessness that rendered it the more moving and convincing the audience crowding the chamber of justice shuddered with horror and sobbed over the details of his torments wept for joy over his miraculous preservation at the close he was applauded on all sides which bewildered him a little for he had never known anything but abuse in all his chequered life  and then at the promptings of that spirit of reaction that was abroad in those days when france was awakening from the nightmare of terror some one made there and then a collection on his behalf and came to thrust into his hands a great bundle of assignats and bank bills which to the humble cocassier represented almost a fortune it was his turn to weep  then the crowd in the court which had heard his story shouted for the head of carrier the demand was taken up by the whole of paris and finally his associates of the convention handed him over to the revolutionary tribunal  he came before it on november 25th and he could not find counsel to defend him six advocates named in succession by the president refused to plead the cause of so inhuman a monster in a rage at last carrier announced that he would defend himself he did  he took the line that his business in nantes had been chiefly concerned with provisioning the army of the west that he had had little to do with the policing of nantes which he left entirely to the revolutionary committee and that he had no knowledge of the things said to have taken place but goullin bachelier and the others were there to fling back the accusation in their endeavours to save their own necks at the expense of his  he was sentenced on the very anniversary of that terrible night on which the men of the marat company broke into the prison of le bouffay and he was accompanied in the tumbril by grandmaison the pitiless who was now filled with selfpity to such an extent that he wept bitterly  the crowd which had hooted and insulted him from the conciergerie to the place de greve fell suddenly silent as he mounted the scaffold his step firm but his shoulders bowed and his eyes upon the ground  suddenly upon the silence grotesquely horribly merry broke the sound of a clarinet playing the ca ira  jerking himself erect carrier turned and flung the last of his terrible glances at the musician  a moment later the knife fell with a thud and a bleeding head rolled into the basket the eyes still staring but powerless now to inspire terror  upon the general silence broke an echo of the stroke  vlan cried a voice and theres a fine end to a great drowner  it was leroy the cocassier the crowd took up the cry     ix the night of nuptialscharles the bold and sapphira danvelt   when philip the good succumbed at bruges of an apoplexy in the early part of the year 1467 the occasion was represented to the stout folk of flanders as a favourable one to break the burgundian yoke under which they laboured it was so represented by the agents of that astute king louis xi who ever preferred guile to the direct and costly exertion of force  charles surnamed the bold le temeraire the new duke of burgundy was of all the french kings enemies by far the most formidable and menacing just then and the wily king who knew better than to measure himself with a foe that was formidable conceived a way to embarrass the duke and cripple his resources at the very outset of his reign to this end did he send his agents into the dukes flemish dominions there to intrigue with the powerful and to stir up the spirit of sedition that never did more than slumber in the hearts of those turbulent burghers  it was from the belfry tower of the populous wealthy city of ghentthen one of the most populous and wealthy cities of europethat the call to arms first rang out summoning the citys forty thousand weavers to quit their looms and take up weaponsthe sword the pike and that arm so peculiarly flemish known as the goedendag from ghent the fierce flame of revolt spread rapidly to the valley of the meuse and the scarcely less important city of liege where the powerful guilds of armourers and leather workers proved as ready for battle as the weavers of ghent  they made a brave enough show until charles the bold came face to face with them at sainttrond and smashed the mutinous burgher army into shards leaving them in their slaughtered thousands upon the stricken field  the duke was very angry he felt that the flemings had sought to take a base advantage of him at a moment when it was supposed he would not be equal to protecting his interests and he intended to brand it for all time upon their minds that it was not safe to take such liberties with their liege lord thus when a dozen of the most important burghers of liege came out to him very humbly in their shirts with halters round their necks to kneel in the dust at his feet and offer him the keys of the city he spurned the offer with angry disdain  you shall be taught he told them how little i require your keys and i hope that you will remember the lesson for your own good  on the morrow his pioneers began to smash a breach twenty fathoms wide in one of the walls of the city rolling the rubble into the ditch to fill it up at the spot when the operation was complete charles rode through the gap as a conqueror with vizor lowered and lance on thigh at the head of his burgundians into his city of liege whose fortifications he commanded should be permanently demolished  that was the end of the flemish rising of 1467 against duke charles the bold of burgundy the weavers returned to their looms the armourers to their forges and the glovemakers and leather workers to their shears peace was restored and to see that it was kept charles appointed military governors of his confidence where he deemed them necessary  one of these was claudius von rhynsault who had followed the dukes fortunes for some years now a born leader of men a fellow of infinite address at arms and resource in battle and of a bold reckless courage that nothing could ever daunt it was perhaps this last quality that rendered him so esteemed of charles himself named the bold whose view of courage was that it was a virtue so lofty that in the nature of its possessor there could perforce be nothing mean  so now to mark his esteem of this stalwart german the duke made him governor of the province of zeeland and dispatched him thither to stamp out there any lingering sparks of revolt and to rule it in his name as ducal lieutenant  thus upon a fair may morning came claud of ryhnsault and his hardy riders to the town of middelburg the capital of zeeland to take up his residence at the gravenhof in the main square and thence to dispense justice throughout that land of dykes in his masters princely name this justice the german captain dispensed with merciless rigour conceiving that to be the proper way to uproot rebellious tendencies it was inevitable that he should follow such a course impelled to it by a remorseless cruelty in his nature of which the duke his master had seen no hint else he might have thought twice before making him governor of zeeland for charlesdespite his rigour when treachery was to be punishedwas a just and humane prince  now amongst those arrested and flung into middelburg gaol as a result of rhynsaults ruthless perquisitions and inquisitions was a wealthy young burgher named philip danvelt his arrest was occasioned by a letter signed philip danvelt found in the house of a marked rebel who had been first tortured and then hanged the letter of a date immediately preceding the late rising promised assistance in the shape of arms and money  brought before rhynsault for examination in a cheerless hall of the gravenhof danvelts defence was a denial upon oath that he had ever taken or offered to take any part in the rebellion told of the letter found and of the date it bore he laughed that letter made everything very simple and clear at the date it bore he had been away at flushing marrying a wife whom he had since brought thence to middelburg it was ludicrous he urged to suppose that in such a seasonof all seasons in a mans lifehe should have been concerned with rebellion or correspondence with rebels and urging this he laughed again  now the german captain did not like burghers who laughed in his presence it argued a lack of proper awe for the dignity of his office and the importance of his person from his high seat at the judgmentboard flanked by clerks and hedged about by menatarms he scowled upon the flaxenhaired freshcomplexioned young burgher who bore himself so very easily he was a big handsome man this rhynsault of perhaps some thirty years of age his thick hair was of a reddish brown and his beardless face was cast in bold lines and tanned by exposure to the colour of mahogany save where the pale line of a scar crossed his left cheek  yet i tell you the letter bears your signature he grumbled sourly  my name perhaps smiled the amiable danvelt but assuredly not my signature  herrgott swore the german captain is this a riddle what is the difference  feeling himself secure that very foolish burgher ventured to be mildly insolent  it is a riddle that the meanest of your clerks there can read for you said he  the governors blue eyes gleamed like steel as they fastened upon danvelt his heavy jaw seemed to thrust itself forward and a dull flush crept into his cheeks then he swore  beim blute gottes quoth he do you whet your traders wit upon me scum  and to the waiting menatarms  take him back to his dungeon he commanded that in its quiet he may study a proper carriage before he is next brought before us  danvelt was haled away to gaol again to repent him of his pertness and to reflect that under the governorship of claudius von rhynsault it was not only the guilty who had need to go warily  the governor sat back in his chair with a grunt his secretary on his immediate right leaned towards him  it were easy to test the truth of the mans assertion said he let his servants and his wife attend and be questioned as to when he was in flushing and when married  aye growled von rhynsault let it be done i dont doubt we shall discover that the dog was lying  but no such discovery was made when on the morrow danvelts household and his wife stood before the governor to answer his questions their replies most fully bore out the tale danvelt had told and appeared in other ways to place it beyond all doubt that he had taken no part in deed or even in thought in the rebellion against the duke of burgundy his wife protested it solemnly and piteously  to this i can swear my lord she concluded i am sure no evidence can be brought against him who was ever loyal and ever concerned with his affairs and with me at the time in question my lordshe held out her hands towards the grim german and her lovely eyes gleamed with unshed tears of supplicationi implore you to believe me and in default of witnesses against him to restore my husband to me  rhynsaults blue eyes kindled now as they considered her and his full red lips slowly parted in the faintest and most inscrutable of smiles she was very fair to look uponof middle height and most exquisite shape her gown of palest saffron edged with fur highwaisted according to the mode and fitted closely to the gently swelling bust was cut low to display the white perfection of her neck her softly rounded face looked absurdly childlike under the tallcrowned hennin from which a wispy veil floated behind her as she moved  in silence then for a spell the german mercenary pondered her with those slowly kindling eyes that slowly spreading indefinite smile then he stirred and to his secretary he muttered shortly  the woman lies in private i may snare the truth from her  he rosea tall massively imposing figure in a lowgirdled tunic of deep purple velvet open at the breast and goldlaced across a white silken undervest  there is some evidence he informed her gruffly come with me and you shall see it for yourself  he led the way from that cheerless hall by a dark corridor to a small snug room richly hung and carpeted where a servant waited he dismissed the fellow and in the same breath bade her enter watching her the while from under lowered brows one of her women had followed but admittance was denied her danvelts wife must enter his room alone  whilst she waited there with scared eyes and fluttering bosom he went to take from an oaken coffer the letter signed philip danvelt he folded the sheet so that the name only was to be read and came to thrust it under her eyes  what name is that he asked her gruffly  her answer was very prompt  it is my husbands but not the writingit is another hand some other philip danvelt there will be others in zeeland  he laughed softly looking at her ever with that odd intentness and under his gaze she shrank and cowered in terror it spoke to her of some nameless evil the tepid air of the luxurious room was stifling her  if i believed you your husband would be delivered from his prisonfrom all danger and he stands i swear to you in mortal peril  ah but you must believe me there are others who can bear witness  i care naught for others he broke in with harsh and arrogant contempt then he softened his voice to a lovers key but i might accept your word that this is not your husbands hand even though i did not believe you  she did not understand and so she could only stare at him with those round brown eyes of hers dilating her lovely cheeks blanching with horrid fear  why see he said at length with an easy gruff goodhumour i place the life of philip danvelt in those fair hands to do with as you please surely sweeting you will not be so unkind as to destroy it  and as he spoke his face bent nearer to her own his flaming eyes devoured her and his arm slipped softly snakelike round her to draw her to him but before it had closed its grip she had started away springing back in horror an outcry already on her pale lips  one word he admonished her sharply and it speaks your husbands doom  oh let me go let me go she cried in anguish  and leave your husband in the hangmans hands he asked  let me go let me go was all that she could answer him expressing the only thought of which in that dread moment her mind was capable  that and the loathing on her face wounded his vanity for this beast was vain his manner changed and the abysmal brute in him was revealed in the anger he displayed with foul imprecations he drove her out  next day a messenger from the governor waited upon her at her house with a brief note to inform her that her husband would be hanged upon the morrow incredulity was succeeded by a numb stony dryeyed grief in which she sat alone for hoursa woman entranced at last towards dusk she summoned a couple of her grooms to attend and light her and made her way ever in that odd somnambulistic state to the gaol of middelburg she announced herself to the head gaoler as the wife of philip danvelt lying under sentence of death and that she was come to take her last leave of him it was not a thing to be denied nor had the gaoler any orders to deny it  so she was ushered into the dank cell where philip waited for his doom and by the yellow wheel of light of the lantern that hung from the shallow vaulted ceiling she beheld the ghastly change that the news of impending death had wrought in him no longer was he the selfassured young burgher who conscious of his innocence and worldly importance had used a certain careless insolence with the governor of zeeland here she beheld a man of livid and distorted face wildeyed his hair and garments in disarray suggesting the physical convulsions to which he had yielded in his despair and rage  sapphira he cried at sight of her a sigh of anguish and he flung himself shuddering and sobbing upon her breast she put her arms about him soothed him gently and drew him back to the wooden chair from which he had leapt to greet her  he took his head in his hands and poured out the fierce anguish of his soul to die innocent as he was to be the victim of an arbitrary unjust power and to perish at his age  hearing him rave she shivered out of an agony of compassion and also of some terror for herself she would that he found it less hard to die and thinking this she thought further and uttered some of her thought aloud  i could have saved you my poor philip  he started up and showed her again that livid distorted face of his  what do you mean he asked hoarsely you could have saved me do you say thenthen why  ah but the price my dear she sobbed  price quoth he in sudden fierce contempt what price is too great to pay for life does this rhynsault want all our wealth then yield it to him yield it so that i may live  should i have hesitated had it been but that she interrupted  and then she told him whilst he sat there hunched and shuddering  the dog the foul german dog he muttered through clenched teeth  so that you see my dear she pursued brokenly it was too great a price yourself you could not have condoned it or done aught else but loathe me afterwards  but he was not as stoutmettled as she deemed him or else the allconsuming thirst of life youths stark horror of death made him a temporizing craven in that hour  who knows he answered certes i do not but a thing so done a thing in which the will and mind have no part resolves itself perhaps into a sacrifice  he broke off there perhaps from very shame after all he was a man and there are limits to what manhood will permit of one  but those words of his sank deeply into her soul they rang again and again in her ears as she took her anguished way home after the agony of their farewells and in the end they drove her out again that very night to seek the governor of zeeland  rhynsault was at supper when she came and without quitting the table bade them usher her into his presence he found her very white but singularly calm and purposeful in her bearing  well mistress  may i speak to you alone  her voice was as steady as her glance  he waved away the attendants drank a deep draught from the cup at his elbow wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and sat back in his tall chair to hear her  yesterday she said you made or seemed to make me a proposal  he looked up at first in surprise then with a faint smile on his coarse red mouth his glance had read her meaning clearly  look you mistress here i am lord of life and death yet in the case of your husband i yield up that power to you say but the word and i sign the order for his gaol delivery at dawn  i have come to say that word she informed him  a moment he looked up at her his smile broadening a flush mounting to his cheekbones then he rose and sent his chair crashing behind him to the ground  herrgott he grunted and he gathered her slim trembling body to his massive goldlaced breast   soon after sunrise on the morrow she was beating at the gates of middelburg gaol a paper clutched convulsively in her left hand  she was admitted and to the head gaoler she showed the paper that she carried  an order from the governor of zeeland for the gaol delivery of philip danvelt she announced almost hysterically  the gaoler scanned the paper then her face his lips tightened  come this way he said and led her down a gloomy corridor to the cell where yesterday she had seen her husband  he threw wide the door and sapphira sprang in  philip she cried and checked as suddenly  he lay supine and still upon the miserable pallet his hands folded upon his breast his face waxen his eyes staring glassily through halfclosed lids  she sped to his side in a sudden chill of terror she fell on her knees and touched him  dead she screamed and kneeling span round questioning to face the gaoler in the doorway dead  he was hanged at daybreak mistress said the gaoler gently  she rocked a moment moaning then fell suddenly forward across her husbands body in a swoon  that evening she was again at the gravenhof to see rhynsault and again she was admitteda haggard faced woman now in whom there was no trace of beauty left she came to stand before the governor considered him in silence a moment with a loathing unutterable in her glance then launched into fierce recriminations of his broken faith  he heard her out then shrugged and smiled indulgently  i performed no less than i promised said he i pledged my word to danvelts gaol delivery and was not my gaol delivery effective you could hardly suppose that i should allow it to be of such a fashion as to interfere with our future happy meetings  before his leering glance she fled in terror followed by the sound of his bestial laugh  for a week thereafter she kept her house and brooded then one day she sallied forth all dressed in deepest mourning and attended by a train of servants and embarking upon a flatbottomed barge was borne up the river scheldt towards antwerp bruges was her ultimate destination of which she left no word behind her and took the longest way round to reach it from antwerp her barge voyaged on to ghent and thence by canal drawn by four stout flemish horses at last to the magnificent city where the dukes of burgundy kept their court   under the june sunshine the opulent city of bruges hummed with activity like the great human hive it was for bruges at this date was the market of the world the very centre of the worlds commerce the cosmopolis of the age within its walls were established the agencies of a score of foreign great trading companies and the ambassadors of no less a number of foreign powers here on a day you might hear every language of civilization spoken in the broad thoroughfares under the shadow of such imposing buildings as you would not have found together in another city of europe to the harbour came the richly laden argosies from venice and genoa from germany and the baltic from constantinople and from england and in her thronged markets lombard and venetian levantine teuton and saxon stood jostling one another to buy and sell  it was past noon and the great belfry above the gothic cloth hall in the grande place was casting a lengthening shadow athwart the crowded square above the babel of voices sounded on a sudden the note of a horn and there was a cry of the duke the duke followed by a general scuttle of the multitude to leave a clear way down the middle of the great square  a gorgeous cavalcade some twoscore strong came into sight advancing at an amble a ducal hunting party returning to the palace a hush fell upon the burgher crowd as it pressed back respectfully to gaze and to the din of human voices succeeded now the clatter of hoofs upon the kidneystones of the square the jangle of hawkbells the baying of hounds and the occasional note of the horn that had first brought warning of the dukes approach  it was a splendid iridescent company flaunting in its apparel every colour of the prism there were great lords in silks and velvets of every hue their legs encased in the finest skins of spain there were great ladies in tall pointed hennins or bicorne headdresses and floating veils with embroidered gowns that swept down below the bellies of their richly harnessed palfreys and along the flanks of this cavalcade ran grooms and huntsmen in green and leather their jagged liripipes flung about their necks leading the leashed hounds  the burghers craned their necks and levantine merchant argued with lombard trader upon an estimate of the wealth paraded thus before them and then at last came the young duke himself in black as if to detach himself from the surrounding splendour he was of middle stature of a strong and supple build with a lean swarthy face and lively eyes beside him on a white horse rode a dazzling youth dressed from head to foot in flamecoloured silk a peaked bonnet of black velvet set upon his lovely golden head a hooded falcon perched upon his left wrist a tiny lute slung behind him by a black ribbon he laughed as he rode looking the very incarnation of youth and gaiety  the cavalcade passed slowly towards the prinssenhof the ducal residence it had all but crossed the square when suddenly a voicea womans voice high and tenserang out  justice my lord duke of burgundy justice lord duke for a womans wrongs  it startled the courtly riders and for a moment chilled their gaiety the scarlet youth at the dukes side swung round in his saddle to obtain a view of her who called so piteously and he beheld sapphira danvelt  she was all in black and black was the veil that hung from her steeple headdress throwing into greater relief her pallid loveliness which the youths glance was quick to appraise he saw too from her air and from the grooms attending her that she was a woman of some quality and the tragic appeal of her smote home in his gay poetic soul he put forth a hand and clutched the dukes arm and as if yielding to this the duke reined up  what is it that you seek charles asked her not unkindly his lively dark eyes playing over her  justice was all she answered him very piteously and yet with a certain fierceness of insistence  none asks it of me in vain i hope he answered gravely but i do not dispense it from the saddle in the public street follow us  and he rode on  she followed to the prinssenhof with her grooms and her woman catherine there she was made to wait in a great hall thronged with grooms and menatarms and huntsmen who were draining the measure sent them by the duke she stood apart wrapped in her tragic sorrow and none molested her at last a chamberlain came to summon her to the dukes presence  in a spacious sparsely furnished room she found the duke awaiting her wearing now a gown of black and gold that was trimmed with rich fur he sat in a tall chair of oak and leather and leaning on the back of it lounged gracefully the lovely scarlet youth who had ridden at his side  standing before him with drooping eyes and folded hands she told her shameful story darker and darker grew his brow as she proceeded with it but it was the gloom of doubt rather than of anger  rhynsault he cried when she had done rhynsault did this  there was incredulity in his voice and nothing else  the youth behind him laughed softly and shifted his attitude  you are surprised yet what else was to be looked for in that teuton swine me he never could deceive for all his  be silent arnault said the duke sharply and to the woman it is a grave grave charge he said against a man i trusted and have esteemed else i should not have placed him where he is what proof have you  she proffered him a strip of parchmentthe signed order for the gaol delivery of philip danvelt  the gaoler of middelburg will tell your grace that he was hanged already when i presented this my woman catherine whom i have with me can testify to part and there are some other servants who can bear witness to my husbands innocence captain von rhynsault had ceased to doubt it  he studied the parchment and fell very grave and thoughtful  where are you lodged he asked  she told him  wait there until i send for you again he bade her leave this order with me and depend upon it justice shall be done  that evening a messenger rode out to middelburg to summon von rhynsault to bruges and the arrogant german came promptly and confidently knowing nothing of the reason but conceiving naturally that fresh honours were to be conferred upon him by a master who loved stouthearted servants and that rhynsault was stouthearted he showed most of all when the duke taxed him without warning with the villainy he had wrought  if he was surprised he was not startled what was the life of a flemish burgher more or less what the honour of a flemish wife these were not considerations to daunt a soldier a valiant man of war and because such was his dull moodfor he was dull this rhynsault as dull as he was brutishhe considered his sin too venial to be denied and the duke who could be crafty perceiving that mood of his and simulating almost an approval of it drew the german captain into selfbetrayal  and so this philip danvelt may have been innocent  he must have been for we have since taken the guilty man of the same name said the german easily it was unfortunate but  unfortunate the dukes manner changed from silk to steel he heaved himself out of his chair and his dark eyes flamed unfortunate is that all you dog  i conceived him guilty when i ordered him to be hanged spluttered the captain greatly taken aback  then why this answer mewhy this  and under his nose the duke thrust the order of gaol delivery rhynsault had signed  the captain blenched and fear entered his glance the thing was becoming serious it seemed  is this the sort of justice you were sent to middelburg to administer in my name is this how you dishonour me if you conceived him guilty why did you sign this and upon what terms bah i know the terms and having made such foul terms why did you not keep your part of the bargain evil as it was  rhynsault had nothing to say he was afraid and he was angry too here was a most unreasonable bother all about nothing it seemed to him  ii sought to compromise between justice andand  and your own vile ends the duke concluded for him by heaven you german dog i think ill have you shortened by a head  my lord it was a cry of protest  there is the woman you have so foully wronged and so foully swindled said the duke watching him what reparation will you make to her what reparation can you make i can toss your filthy head into her lap but will that repair the wrong  the captain suddenly saw light and quite a pleasant light it was for he had found sapphira most delectable  why he said slowly and with all a fools audacity having made her a widow i can make her a wife again i never thought to wive myself but if your grace thinks such reparation adequate i will afford it her  the duke checked in the very act of replying again the expression of his countenance changed he strode away his head bowed in thought then slowly he returned  be it so he said it is not much but it is all that you can do and after a fashion it will mend the honour you have torn see that you wed her within the week should she not consent it will be the worse for you  she would not have consentedshe would have preferred death indeedbut for the insistence that the duke used in private with her and so half convinced that it would in some sort repair her honour the poor woman suffered herself to be led more dead than living to the altar in the dukes private chapel and there scarcely knowing what she did she became the wife of captain claudius von rhynsault the man she had most cause to loathe and hate in all the world  rhynsault had ordered a great banquet to celebrate his nuptials for on the whole he was well satisfied with the issue of this affair but as he left the altar his halfswooning bride upon his arm the duke in person tapped his shoulder  all is not yet done he said you are to come with me  the bridal pair were conducted to the great hall of the prinssenhof where there was a great gathering of the courtto do honour to his nuptials thought the german captain at the broad table sat two clerkly fellows with quills and parchments and by this table the duke took his stand arnault beside himin peacockblue todayand called for silence  captain von rhynsault he said gravely and quietly what you have done is well done but it does not suffice in the circumstances of this marriage and after the revelation we have had of your ways of thought and of honour it is necessary to make provision against the future it shall not be yours save at grave cost to repudiate the wife you have now taken  there is no such intent began rhynsault who misliked this homily  the duke waved him into silence  you are interrupting me he said sharply you are a wealthy man rhynsault thanks to the favours i have heaped upon you ever since the day when i picked you from your german kennel to set you where you stand here you will find a deed prepared it is in the form of a will whereby you bequeath everything of which you are today possessedand it is all set downto your wife on your death or on the day on which you put her from you your signature is required to that  the captain hesitated a moment this deed would fetter all his future the duke was unreasonable but under the steady compelling eyes of charles he moved forward to the table and accepted the quill the clerk was proffering there was no alternative he realized he was trapped well well he must make the best of it he stooped from his great height and signed in his great sprawling clumsy soldiers hand  the clerk dusted the document with pounce and handed it to the duke charles cast an eye upon the signature then taking the quill himself signed under it then bore the document to the halfswooning bride  keep this secure he bade her it is your marriagegift from me  rhynsaults eyes gleamed if his wife were to keep the deed the thing was none so desperate after all but the next moment he had other things to think of  give me your sword the duke requested  wondering the german unsheathed the weapon and proffered the hilt to his master charles took it and a stern smile played about his beardless mouth he grasped it hilt in one hand and point in the other suddenly he bent his right knee and bearing sharply downward with the flat of the weapon upon his thigh snapped in into two  so much for that dishonourable blade he said and cast the pieces from him then he flung out an arm to point to rhynsault take him out he commanded let him have a priest and half an hour in which to make his soul then set his head on a spear above the cloth hall that men may know the justice of charles of burgundy  with the roar of a goaded bull the german attempted to fling forward but menatarms in steel and leather who had come up quietly behind him seized him now impotent in their coiling arms he was borne away to his doom that thereby he might complete the reparation of his hideous offence and deliver sapphira from the bondage of a wedlock which charles of burgundy had never intended her to endure     x the night of stranglersgovanna of naples and andreas of hungary   charles duke of durazzo was one of your super chessplayers handling kings and queens knights and prelates of flesh and blood in the game that he played with destiny upon the dark board of neapolitan politics and he had no illusions on the score of the forfeit that would be claimed by his grim opponent in the event of his own defeat he knew that his head was the stake he set upon the board and he knew too that defeat must inevitably follow upon a single false move yet he played boldly and craftily as you shall judge  he made his first move in march of 1343 some three months after the death of robert of anjou king of jerusalem and sicily as ran the title of the ruler of naples he found his opportunity amid the appalling anarchy into which the kingdom was then plunged as a result of a wrong and an ill judged attempt to right it  good king robert the wise had wrested the crown of naples from his elder brother the king of hungary and had ruled as a usurper perhaps to quiet his conscience perhaps to ensure against future strife between his own and his brothers descendants he had attempted to right the wrong by a marriage between his brothers grandson andreas and his own granddaughter giovanna a marriage which had taken place ten years before when andreas was but seven years of age and giovanna five  the aim had been thus to weld into one the two branches of the house of anjou instead the rivalry was to be rendered more acute than ever and king roberts fear of some such result contributed to it not a little on his deathbed he summoned the princes of the bloodthe members of the houses of durazzo and tarantoand the chief nobles of the kingdom demanding of them an oath of allegiance to giovanna and himself appointing a council of regency to govern the kingdom during her minority  the consequence was that against all that had been intended when the marriage was contracted giovanna was now proclaimed queen in her own right and the government taken over in her name by the appointed council instantly the court of naples was divided into two camps the party of the queen including the neapolitan nobility and the party of andreas of hungary consisting of the hungarian nobles forming his train and a few malcontent neapolitan barons and guided by the sinister figure of andreass preceptor friar robert  this arrogant friar of whom petrarch has left us a vivid portrait a redfaced redbearded man with a fringe of red hair about his tonsure short and squat of figure dirty in his dress and habits yet imbued with the pride of lucifer despite his rags thrust himself violently into the council of regency demanding a voice in the name of his pupil andreas and the council feared him not only on the score of his overbearing personality but also because he was supported by the populace which had accepted his general filthiness as the outward sign of holiness his irruption occasioned so much trouble and confusion that in the end the pope intervened in his quality as lord paramountnaples being a fief of holy churchand appointed a legate to rule the kingdom during giovannas minority  the hungarians with andreass brother king ludwig of hungary at their head now appealed to the papal court of avignon for a bull commanding the joint coronation of andreas and giovanna which would be tantamount to placing the government in the hands of andreas the neapolitans headed by the princes of the bloodwho standing next in succession had also their own interests to consider clamoured that giovanna alone should be crowned  in this pass were the affairs of the kingdom when charles of durazzo who had stood watchful and aloof carefully weighing the chances resolved at last to play that dangerous game of his he began by the secret abduction of maria of anjou his own cousin and giovannas sister a child of fourteen he kept her concealed for a month in his palace what time he obtained from the pope through the good offices of his uncle the cardinal of perigord a dispensation to overcome the barrier of consanguinity that dispensation obtained charles married the girl publicly under the eyes of all naples and by the marriageto which the bride seemed nowise unwillingbecame by virtue of his wife next heir to the crown of naples  that was his opening move his next was to write to his obliging uncle the cardinal of perigord whose influence at avignon was very considerable urging him to prevail upon pope clement vi not to sign the bull in favour of andreas and the joint coronation  now the highhanded action of charles in marrying maria of anjou had very naturally disposed giovanna against him further it had disposed against him those princes of the blood who were next in the succession and upon whom he had stolen a march by this strengthening of his own claims it is inevitable to assume that he had counted precisely upon this to afford him the pretext that he soughthe a neapolitan princeto ally himself with the hungarian intruder  under any other circumstances his advances must have been viewed with suspicion by andreas and still more by the crafty friar robert but under the circumstances which his guile had created he was received with open arms by the hungarian party and his defection from the court of giovanna was counted a victory by the supporters of andreas he protested his goodwill towards andreas and proclaimed his hatred of giovannas partisans who poisoned her mind against her husband he hunted and drank with andreaswhose life seems to have been largely made up of hunting and drinkingand pandered generally to the rather gross tastes of this foreigner whom in his heart he despised for a barbarian  from being a boon companion charles very soon became a counsellor to the young prince and the poisonous advice that he gave seemed shrewd and good even to friar robert  meet hostility with hostility ride ruthlessly upon your own way showing yourself confident of the decision in your favour that the pope must ultimately give for bear ever in your mind that you are king of naples not by virtue of your marriage with giovanna but in your own right giovanna being but the offspring of the usurping branch  the pale bovine eyes of andreas would kindle into something like intelligence and a flush would warm his stolid countenance he was a fairhaired young giant whiteskinned and wellfeatured but dull looking with cold hard eyes suggesting the barbarian that he was considered by the cultured neapolitans and that he certainly looked by contrast with them friar robert supporting the duke of durazzos advice andreas did not hesitate to act upon it of his own authority he delivered prisoners from gaol showered honours upon his hungarian followers and upon such neapolitan barons as count altamura who was illviewed at court and generally set the queen at defiance the inevitable result upon which again the subtle charles had counted was to exasperate a group of her most prominent nobles into plotting the ruin of andreas  it was a good beginning and unfortunately giovannas own behaviour afforded charles the means of further speeding up his game  the young queen was under the governance of filippa the catanese an evil woman greedy of power this filippa once a washerwoman had in her youth been chosen for her splendid health to be the fostermother of giovannas father beloved of her fosterchild she had become perpetually installed at court married to a wealthy moor named cabane who was raised to the dignity of grand seneschal of the kingdom whereby the sometime washerwoman found herself elevated to the rank of one of the first ladies of naples she must have known how to adapt herself to her new circumstances otherwise she would hardly have been appointed as she was upon the death of her fosterson governess to his infant daughters later to ensure her hold upon the young queen and being utterly unscrupulous in her greed of power she had herself contrived that her son robert of cabane became giovannas lover  one of giovannas first acts upon her grandfathers death had been to create this robert count of evoli and this notwithstanding that in the mean time he had been succeeded in her favour by the handsome young bertrand dartois this was the groupthe catanese her son and bertrandthat with the princes of the blood governed the queens party  with what eyes andreas may have looked upon all this we have no means of determining possibly engrossed as he was with his hawks and his hounds he may have been stupidly blind to his own dishonour at least as far as bertrand was concerned another than charles might have chosen the crude course of opening his eyes to it but charles was too farseeing precipitancy was not one of his faults his next move must be dictated by the decision of avignon regarding the coronation  this decision came in july of 1345 and it fell like a thunderbolt upon the court the pope had pronounced in favour of andreas by granting the bull for the joint coronation of andreas and giovanna  this was check to charles his uncle the cardinal of perigord had done his utmost to oppose the measure but he had been overborne in the end by ludwig of hungary who had settled the matter by the powerful argument that he was himself the rightful heir to the crown of naples and that he relinquished his claim in favour of his younger brother he had backed the argument by the payment to the pope of the enormous sum for those days of one hundred thousand gold crowns and the issue obscure hitherto had immediately become clear to the papal court  it was check to charles as i have said but charles braced himself and considered the countermove that should give him the advantage he went to congratulate andreas and found him swollen with pride and arrogance in his triumph  be welcome charles he hailed durazzo i am not the man to forget those who have stood my friends whilst my power was undecided  for your own sake said the smooth charles as he stepped back from that brotherly embrace i trust youll not forget those who have been your enemies and who being desperate now may take desperate means to avert your coronation  the pale eyes of the hungarian glittered  of whom do you speak  charles smoothed his black beard thoughtfully his dark eyes narrowed and pensive there must be a victim to strike fear into giovannas friends and stir them to charless purposes  why first and foremost i should place giovannas counsellor isernia that man of law whose evil counsels have hurt your rights as king next come  but here charles craftily paused and looked away a man at fault  next cried andreas who next speak out the duke shrugged  by the passion there is no lack of others you have enemies to spare among the queens friends  andreas paled under his faint tan he flung back his crimson robe as if he felt the heat and stood forth lithe as a wrestler in his closefitting cotehardie and hose of violet silk  no need indeed to name them he said fiercely  none charles agreed but the most dangerous is isernia whilst he lives you walk amid swords his death may spread a panic that will paralyze the others  he would say no more knowing that he had said enough to send andreas scowling and sinister to sow terror in hearts that guilt must render uneasy now amongst which hearts be sure that he counted giovannas own  andreas took counsel with friar robert touching isernia there was evidence and to spare that he was dangerous and so isernia fell on the morrow to an assassins sword as he was in the very act of leaving the castel nuovo and it was charles himself who bore word of it to the court and so plunged it into consternation  they walked in the cool of evening in the pleasant garden of the castel nuovo when charles came upon them and touched the stalwart shoulder of bertrand dartois bertrand the favourite eyed him askance mistrusting and disliking him for his association with andreas  the hungarian boar said charles is sharpening his tusks now that his authority is assured by the holy father  who cares sneered bertrand  should you care if i added that already he has blooded them  bertrand changed countenance the duke explained himself  he has made a beginning upon giacomo d isernia ten minutes ago he was stabbed to death within a stones throw of the castle so charles unburdened himself of his news a beginning no more  my god said bertrand d isernia heaven rest him and devoutly he crossed himself  heaven will rest some more of you if you suffer andreas of hungary to be its instrument said charles his lips grimly twisted  do you threaten  nay man be not so hot and foolish i warn i know his mood i know what he intends  you ever had his confidence said bertrand sneering  until this hour i had but theres an end to that i am a prince of naples and ill not bend the knee to a barbarian he was well enough to hunt with and drink with so long as he was duke of calabria with no prospect of being more but that he should become my king and that our lady giovanna should be no more than a queen consort he made a gesture of ineffable disgust  bertrands eyes kindled he gripped the others arm and drew him along under a trellis of vines that formed a green cloister about the walls  why here is great news for our queen he cried it will rejoice her my lord to know you are loyal to her  that is no matter he replied what matters is that you should be warnedyou yourself in particular and evoli no doubt there will be others too but the hungarians confidences went no further  bertrand had come to a standstill he stared at charles and slowly the colour left his face  me he said a finger on his heart  aye you you will be the next but not until the crown is firmly on his brow then he will settle his score with the nobles of naples who have withstood him listen and charless voice sank as if under the awful burden of his news a black banner of vengeance is to precede him to his coronation and your name stands at the head of the list of the proscribed does it surprise you after all he is a husband and he has some knowledge of what lies between the queen and you  stop  pish charles shrugged what need for silence upon what all naples knows when have you and the queen ever used discretion in your place i should not need a warning i should know what to expect from a husband become king  the queen must be told  indeed i think so too it will come best from you go tell her so that measures may be taken but go secretly and warily you are safe until he wears the crown and above allwhatever you may decidedo nothing here in naples  and on that he turned to depart whilst bertrand sped to giovanna on the threshold of the garden charles paused and looked back his eyes sought and found the queen a tall lissome girl of seventeen in a closefitting revealing gown of purple silk the high white gorget outlining an oval face of a surpassing loveliness crowned by a wealth of coppercoloured hair she was standing in a stricken attitude looking up into the face of her lover who was delivering himself of his news  charles departed satisfied  three days later a man of the queens household one melazzo who was in duke charless pay brought him word that the seed he had cast had fallen upon fertile soil a conspiracy to destroy the king had been laid by bertrand dartois robert of cabane count of evoli and the latters brothersinlaw terlizzi and morcone melazzo himself for his notorious affection for the queen had been included in this band and also a man named pace who was body servant to andreas and who like melazzo was in charless pay  charles of durazzo smiled gently to himself the game went excellently well  the court he said goes to aversa for a month before the coronation that would be a favourable season to their plan advise it so  the date appointed for the coronation was september 20th a month beforeon august 20ththe court removed itself from the heat and reek of naples to the cooler air of aversa there to spend the time of waiting they were housed in the monastery of saint peter which had been converted as far as possible into a royal residence for the occasion  on the night of their arrival there the refectory of the monastery was transfigured to accommodate the numerous noble and very jovial company assembled there to sup the long stoneflagged room lofty and with windows set very high normally so bare and austere was hung now with tapestries and the floor strewn with rushes that were mingled with lemon verbena and other aromatic herbs along the lateral walls and across the end of the room that faced the double doors were set the stone tables of the spartan monks on a shallow dais that raised them above the level of the floor these tables were gay now with the gleam of crystal and the glitter of gold and silver plate along one side of them their backs to the walls sat the ladies and nobles of the court the vaulted ceiling was rudely frescoed to represent the open heavensthe work of a brother whose brush was more devout than cunningand there was the inevitable cenacolo above the abbots table at the upper end of the room  at this table sat the royal party the broadshouldered andreas of hungary slightly asprawl his golden mane somewhat tumbled now for he was drinking deeply in accordance with his barbarian habit ever and anon he would fling down a bone or a piece of meat to the livercoloured hounds that crouched expectant on the rushes of the floor  they had hunted that day in the neighbourhood of capua and andreas had acquitted himself well and was in high goodhumour giving now little thought to the sinister things that charles of durazzo had lately whispered laughing and jesting with the traitor morcone at his side behind him in close attendance stood his servant pace once a creature of durazzos the queen sat on his right making but poor pretence to eat her lovely young face was of a ghostly pallor her dark eyes were wide and staring among the guests were the blackbrowed evoli and his brotherinlaw terlizzi bertrand of artois and his father melazzo that other creature of charless and filippa the catanese handsome and arrogant but oddly silent tonight  but charles of durazzo was not of the company it is not for the player himself to become a piece upon the board  he had caught a whisper that the thing he had so slyly prompted to bertrand dartois was to be done here at aversa and so charles had remained at naples he had discovered very opportunely that his wife was ailing and he developed such concern for her that he could not bring himself to leave her side he had excused himself to andreas with a thousand regrets since what he most desired was to enjoy with him the cool clean air of aversa and the pleasures of the chase and he had presented the young king at parting with the best of all his falcons in earnest of affection and disappointment  the night wore on and at last at a sign from the queen the ladies rose and departed to their beds the men settled down again the cellarers redoubled their activities the flagons circulated more briskly and the noise they made must have disturbed the monks entrenched in their cells against these earthly vanities the laughter of andreas grew louder and more vacuous and when at last he heaved himself up at midnight and departed to bed that he might take some rest against the morrows hunt he staggered a little in his walk  but there were other hunters there whose impatience could not keep until the morrow whose game was to be run to death that very night they waitedbertrand dartois robert of cabane the counts of terlizzi and morcone melazzo and andreass body servant paceuntil all those who lay at aversa were deep in slumber then at two oclock in the morning they made their stealthy way to the loggia on the third floor a long colonnaded gallery above the abbots garden they paused a moment before the queens door which opened upon this gallery then crept on to that of the kings room at the other end it was pace who rapped sharply on the panels thrice before he was answered by a sleepy growl from the other side  it is ipacemy lord he announced a courier has arrived from naples from friar robert with instant messages  from within there was a noisy yawn a rustle the sound of an overturning stool and lastly the rasp of a bolt being withdrawn the door opened and in the faint light of the dawning day andreas appeared drawing a furlined robe about his body which was naked of all but a shirt  he saw no one but pace the others had drawn aside into the shadows unsuspecting he stepped forth  where is this messenger  the door through which he had come slammed suddenly behind him and he turned to see melazzo in the act of bolting it with a dagger to prevent any one from following that wayfor the room had another door opening upon the inner corridor  instead melazzo might have employed his dagger to stab andreas behind and so have made an instant end but it happened to be known that andreas wore an amuleta ring that his mother had given himwhich rendered him invulnerable to steel or poison and such was the credulity of his age such the blind faith of those men in the miraculous power of that charm that none of them so much as attempted to test it with a dagger it was for the same reason that no recourse was had to the still easier method of disposing of him by poison accepting the amulet at its legendary value the conspirators had resolved that he must be strangled  as he turned now they leapt upon him and taking him unawares bore him to the ground before he could realize what was happening here they grappled with him and he with them he was endowed with the strength of a young bull and he made full use of it he rose beating them off to be borne down again bellowing the while for help he smote out blindly and stretched morcone half senseless with a blow of his great fist  seeing how difficult he proved to strangle they must have cursed that amulet of his he struggled to his knees again then to his feet and at last with bleeding face leaving tufts of his fair hair in their murderous hands he broke through and went bounding down the loggia screaming as he ran until he came to his wifes door against that he hurled himself calling her  giovanna giovanna for the love of god crucified open open i am being murdered  from within came no answerutter silence  giovanna giovanna he beat frenziedly upon the door  still no answer which yet was answer enough  the stranglers momentarily discomfited scared too lest his cries should rouse the convent had stood hesitating after he broke from them but now bertrand dartois realizing that too much had been done already to admit of the business being left unfinished sprang upon him suddenly again locked in each others arms those wrestlers swayed and panted in the loggia for a moment then with a crash went down bertrand on top andreas striking his head against the stone floor as he fell the queens lover pinned him there kneeling upon his breast  the rope he panted to the others who came up  one of them threw him a coil of purple silk interwrought with gold thread in which a running noose had been tied bertrand slipped it over andreass head drew it taut and held it so despite the mans desperate convulsive struggles the others came to his assistance amongst them they lifted the writhing victim to the parapet of the loggia and flung him over whilst bertrand cabane and pace bore upon the rope arresting his fall and keeping him suspended there until he should be dead melazzo and morcone came to assist them and it was then that cabane observed that terlizzi held aloof as if filled with horror  peremptorily he called to him  hither and lend a hand the rope is long enough to afford you a grip we want accomplices not witnesses lord count  terlizzi obeyed and then the ensuing silence was broken suddenly by screams from the floor below the screams of a woman who slept in the room immediately underneath who had awakened to behold in the grey light of the breaking day the figure of a man kicking and writhing at a ropes end before her window  yet a moment the startled stranglers kept their grip of the rope until the struggles at the end of it had ceased then they loosed their hold and let the body go plunging down into the abbots garden thereafter they scattered and fled for people were stirring now in the convent aroused by the screams of the woman  thrice so the story runs came the monks to the queens door to knock and demand her orders for the disposal of the body of her husband without receiving any answer to their question it remained still unanswered when later in the day she departed from aversa in a closed litter and returned to naples escorted by a company of lances and for lack of instructions the monks left the body in the abbots garden where it had fallen until charles of durazzo came to remove it two days later  ostentatiously he bore to naples the murdered princewhose death he had so subtly inspiredand in the cathedral before the hungarians whom he had assembled and in the presence of a vast concourse of the people he solemnly swore over the body vengeance upon the murderers  having made a catspaw of giovannathrough the person of her lover bertrand dartois and his confederate assassinsand thus cleared away one of those who stood between himself and the throne he now sought to make a catspaw of justice to clear away the other meanwhile days grew into weeks and weeks into months and no attempt was made by the queen to hunt out the murderers of her husband no inquiry instituted bertrand dartois it is true had fled with his father to their stronghold of saint agatha for safety but the otherscabane terlizzi and morconecontinued unabashed about giovannas person at the castel nuovo  charles wrote to ludwig of hungary and to the pope demanding that justice should be done and pointing out the neglect of all attempt to perform it in the kingdom itself and inviting them to construe for themselves that neglect as a consequence clement vi issued on june 2d of the following year a bull whereby bertrand des baux the grand justiciary of naples was commanded to hunt down and punish the assassins against whomat the same timethe pope launched a second bull of excommunication but the holy father accompanied his commands to des baux by a private note wherein he straitly enjoined the grand justiciary for reasons of state to permit nothing to transpire that might reflect upon the queen  des baux set about his task at once and inspired no doubt by charles proceeded to the arrest of melazzo and the servant pace it was not for charles to accuse the queen or even any of her nobles whereby he might have aroused against himself the opposition of those who were her loyal partisans sufficient for him to point out the two meanest of the conspirators and depend upon the torture to wring from them confessions that must gradually pull down the rest and in the end giovanna herself  terlizzi alive to his danger when he heard of the arrest of those two made a bold and desperate attempt to avert it riding forth with a band of followers he attacked the escort that was bearing pace to prison the prisoner was seized but not to be rescued all that terlizzi wanted was his silence by his orders the wretched mans tongue was torn out whereupon he was abandoned once more to his guards and his fate  had terlizzi been able to carry out his intentions of performing the like operation upon melazzo charles might have been placed in a difficult position so much however did not happen and the horrible deed upon pace was in vain put to the question melazzo denounced terlizzi and together with him cabane morcone and the others further his confession incriminated filippa the catanese and her two daughters the wives of terlizzi and morcone of the queen however he said nothing because one of the lesser conspirators little more than a servant like pace he can have had no knowledge of the queens complicity  the arrest of the others followed instantly and sentenced to death they were publicly burned in the square of sant eligio after suffering all the brutal unspeakable horrors of fourteenthcentury torture which continued to the very scaffold with the alleged intention of inducing them to denounce any further accomplices but though they writhed and fainted under the pincers of the executioners they confessed nothing indeed they preserved a silence which left the people amazed for the people lacked the explanation the grand justiciary hugh des baux had seen to it that the popes injunctions should be obeyed lest the condemned should say too much he had taken the precaution of having their tongues fastened down with fishhooks  thus charles was momentarily baulked and he was further baulked by the fact that giovanna had taken a second husband in her cousin louis of taranto unless matters were to remain there and the game end in a stalemate bold measures were required and those measures charles adopted he wrote to the king of hungary now openly accusing giovanna of the murder and pointing out the circumstances that in themselves afforded corroboration of his charge  those circumstances ludwig embodied in a fulminating letter which he wrote to giovanna in answer to her defence against the charge of inaction in the matter of her late husbands murderers giovanna thy antecedent disorderly life thy retention of the exclusive power in the kingdom thy neglect of vengeance upon the murderers of thy husband thy having taken another husband and thy very excuses abundantly prove thy complicity in thy husbands death  so far this was all as charles of durazzo could have desired it but there was more ludwig was advancing now in arms to take possession of the kingdom of which under all the circumstances he might consider himself the lawful heir and the princes of italy were affording him unhindered passage through their states this was not at all to charless liking indeed unless he bestirred himself it might prove to be checkmate from an altogether unexpected quarter rendering vain all the masterly play with which he had conducted the game so far  it flustered him a little and in his haste to counter it he blundered  giovanna alarmed at the rapid advance of ludwig summoned her barons to her aid and in that summons she included charles realizing that at all costs he must be brought over to her side he went listened and finally sold himself for a good price the title of duke of calabria which made him heir to the kingdom he raised a powerful troop of lances and marched upon aquila which had already hoisted the hungarian banner  there it was that he discovered and soon his move to have been a bad one news was brought to him that the queen taken with panic had fled to provence seeking sanctuary at avignon  charles set about correcting his error without delay and marched out of aquila to go and meet ludwig that he might protest his loyalty and range himself under the invaders banner  at foligno the king of hungary was met by a papal legate who in the name of pope clement forbade him under pain of excommunication to invade a fief of holy church  when i am master of naples answered ludwig firmly i shall count myself a feudatory of the holy see until then i render account to none but god and my conscience and he pushed on preceded by a black banner of death scattering in true hungarian fashion murder rape pillage and arson through the smiling countryside exacting upon the whole land a terrible vengeance for the murder of his brother  thus he came to aversa and there quartered himself and his hungarians upon that convent of saint peter where andreas had been strangled a year ago and it was here that he was joined by charles who came protesting loyalty and whom the king received with open arms and a glad welcome as was to be expected from a man who had been andreass one true friend in that land of enemies of charless indiscreet escapade in the matter of aquila nothing was said as charles had fully expected it was condoned upon the score both of the past and the present  that night there was high feasting in that same refectory where andreas had feasted on the night when the stranglers watched him waiting and charles was the guest of honour in the morning ludwig was to pursue his march upon the city of naples and all were astir betimes  on the point of setting out ludwig turned to charles  before i go he said i have a mind to visit the spot where my brother died  to charles no doubt this seemed a morbid notion to be discouraged but ludwig was insistent  take me there he bade the duke  indeed i scarce knowi was not here remember charles answered him rendered faintly uneasy perhaps by a certain grimness in the gaunt kings face perhaps by the mutterings of his own conscience  i know that you were not but surely you must know the place it will be known to all the world in these parts besides was it not yourself recovered the body conduct me thither then  perforce then charles must do his will arminarm they mounted the stairs to that sinister loggia a halfdozen of ludwigs escorting officers following  they stepped along the tessellated floor above the abbots garden flooded now with sunshine which drew the perfume from the roses blooming there  here the king slept said charles and yonder the queen somewhere here between the thing was done and thence they hanged him  ludwig tall and grim stood considering chin in hand suddenly he wheeled upon the duke who stood at his elbow his face had undergone a change and his lip curled so that he displayed his strong teeth as a dog displays them when he snarls  traitor he rasped it is youyou who come smiling and fawning upon me and spurring me on to vengeancewho are to blame for what happened here  i charles fell back changing colour his legs trembling under him  you the king answered him furiously his death would never have come about but for your intrigues to keep him out of the royal power to hinder his coronation  it is false cried charles false i swear it before god  perjured dog do you deny that you sought the aid of your precious uncle the cardinal of perigord to restrain the pope from granting the bull required  i do deny it the facts deny it the bull was forthcoming  then your denial but proves your guilt the king answered him and from the leather pouch hanging from his belt he pulled out a parchment and held it under the dukes staring eyes it was the letter he had written to the cardinal of perigord enjoining him to prevent the pope from signing the bull sanctioning andreass coronation  the king smiled terribly into that white twitching face  deny it now he mocked him deny too that bribed by the title of duke of calabria you turned to the service of the queen to abandon it again for ours when you perceived your danger you think to use us traitor as a steppingstone to help you to mount the throneas you sought to use my brother even to the extent of encompassing his murder  no no i had no hand in that i was his friend  liar ludwig struck him across the mouth  on the instant the officers of ludwig laid hands upon the duke fearing that the indignity might spur him to retaliation  you are very opportune said ludwig and added coldly dispatch him  charles screamed a moment even as andreas had screamed on that same spot when he found himself staring into the fearful face of death then the scream became a cough as a hungarian sword went through him from side to side  they picked up his body from the tessellated floor of the loggia carried it to the parapet as andreass had been carried and flung it down into the abbots garden as andreass had been flung it lay in a rosebush dyeing the abbots roses a deeper red  never was justice more poetic     xi the night of hatethe murder of the duke of gandia   the cardinal vicechancellor took the packet proffered him by the fairhaired scarletliveried page and turned it over considering it the gentle finely featured almost ascetic face very thoughtful  it was brought my lord by a man in a mask who will give no name he waits below said the scarlet stripling  a man in a mask eh what mystery  the thoughtful brown eyes smiled the fine hands broke the fragment of wax a gold ring fell out and rolled some little way along the black and purple eastern rug the boy dived after it and presented it to his lordship  the ring bore an escutcheon and the cardinal found graven upon this escutcheon his own arms the sforza lion and the flower of the quince instantly those dark thoughtful eyes of his grew keen as they flashed upon the page  did you see the device he asked a hint of steel under the silkiness of his voice  i saw nothing my lorda ring no more i did not even look  the cardinal continued to ponder him for a long moment very searchingly  gobring this man he said at last and the boy departed soon to reappear holding aside the tapestry that masked the door to give passage to a man of middle height wrapped in a black cloak his face under a shower of golden hair covered from chin to brow by a black visor  at a sign from the cardinal the page departed then the man coming forward let fall his cloak revealing a rich dress of closefitting violet silk sword and dagger hanging from his jewelled girdle he plucked away the mask and disclosed the handsome weak face of giovanni sforza lord of pesaro and cotignola the discarded husband of madonna lucrezia pope alexanders daughter  the cardinal considered his nephew gravely without surprise he had expected at first no more than a messenger from the owner of that ring but at sight of his figure and long fair hair he had recognized giovanni before the latter had removed his mask  i have always accounted you something mad said the cardinal softly but never mad enough for this what brings you to rome  necessity my lord replied the young tyrant the need to defend my honour which is about to be destroyed  and your life wondered his uncle has that ceased to be of value  without honour it is nothing  a noble sentiment taught in every school but for practical purposes the cardinal shrugged  giovanni however paid no heed  did you think my lord that i should tamely submit to be a derided outcast husband that i should take no vengeance upon that villainous pope for having made me a thing of scorn a byword throughout italy livid hate writhed in his fair young face did you think i should indeed remain in pesaro whither i fled before their threats to my life and present no reckoning  what is the reckoning you have in mind inquired his uncle faintly ironical youll not be intending to kill the holy father  kill him giovanni laughed shortly scornfully do the dead suffer  in hell sometimes said the cardinal  perhaps but i want to be sure i want sufferings that i can witness sufferings that i can employ as balsam for my own wounded honour i shall strike even as he has stricken meat his soul not at his body i shall wound him where he is most sensitive  ascanio sforza towering tall and slender in his scarlet robes shook his head slowly  all this is madnessmadness you were best away best in pesaro indeed you cannot safely show your face in rome  that is why i go masked that is why i come to you my lord for shelter here until  here the cardinal was instantly alert then you think i am as mad as yourself why man if so much as a whisper of your presence in rome got abroad this is the first place where they would look nor you if you will have your way if you are so set on the avenging of past wrongs and the preventing of future ones it is not for me your kinsman to withstand you but here in my palace you cannot stay for your own safetys sake that page who brought you now i would not swear he did not see the arms upon your ring i pray that he did not but if he did your presence is known here already  giovanni was perturbed  but if not here where then in rome should i be safe  nowhere i think answered the ironical ascanio though perhaps you might count yourself safe with pico your common hate of the holy father should be a stout bond between you  fate prompted the suggestion fate drove the lord of pesaro to act upon it and to seek out antonio maria pico count of mirandola in his palace by the river where pico as ascanio had foreseen gave him a cordial welcome  there he abode almost in hiding until the end of may seldom issuing forth and never without his maska matter this which excited no comment for masked faces were common in the streets of rome in the evening of the fifteenth century in talk with pico he set forth his intent elaborating what already he had told the cardinal vicechancellor  he is a fatherthis father of fathers he said once a tender loving father whose life is in his children who lives through them and for them deprive him of them and his life would become empty worthless a living death there is giovanni who is as the apple of his eye whom he has created duke of gandia duke of benevento prince of sessa lord of teano and more besides there is the cardinal of valencia there is giuffredo prince of squillace and there is my wife lucrezia of whom he has robbed me there is you see an ample heel to our achilles the question is where shall we begin  and also how pico reminded him  fate was to answer both those questions and that soon  they went on june 1stthe lord of pesaro with his host and his hosts daughter antoniato spend the day at picos vineyard in trastevere at the moment of setting out to return to rome in the evening the count was detained by his steward newly returned from a journey with matters to communicate to him  he bade his guest with his daughter and their attendants to ride on saying that he himself would follow and overtake them but the steward detained him longer than he had expected so that although the company proceeded leisurely towards the city pico had not come up with them when they reached the river in the narrow street beyond the bridge the little escort found itself suddenly confronted and thrust aside by a magnificent cavalcade of ladies and gallants hawk on wrist and followed by a pack of hounds  giovanni had eyes for one only in that gay companya tall splendidly handsome man in green a plumed bonnet on his auburn head and a roguish jovial eye which in its turn saw nobody in that moment but madonna antonia reclining in her litter the leather curtains of which she had drawn back that she might converse with giovanni as they rode  the lord of pesaro beheld the sudden kindling of his brotherinlaws glance for that handsome gallant was the duke of gandia the popes eldest son the very apple of the holy fathers eye he saw the dukes almost unconscious check upon his reins saw him turn in the saddle to stare boldly at madonna antonia until grown conscious of his regard she crimsoned under it and when at last the litter had moved on he saw over his shoulder a mounted servant detach from the dukes side to follow them this fellow dogged their heels all the way to the parione quarter obviously with intent to discover for his master where the beautiful lady of the litter might be housed  giovanni said naught of this to pico when he returned a little later he was quick to perceive the opportunity that offered but far from sure that pico would suffer his daughter to be used as a decoy far indeed from sure that he dared himself so employ her but on the morrow chancing to look from a window out of idle curiosity to see what horse it was that was pacing in the street below he beheld a man in a rich cloak in whom at once he recognized the duke and he accounted that the dice of destiny had fallen  himself unseen by that horseman giovanni drew back quickly on the spur of the moment he acted with a subtlety worthy of long premeditation antonia and he were by an odd fatality alone together in that chamber of the mezzanine he turned to her  an odd fellow rides below here tarrying as if expectant i wonder should you know who he is  obeying his suggestion she rosea tall slim child of some eighteen years of a delicate pale beauty with dark thoughtful eyes and long black tresses interwoven with jewelled strands of gold thread she rustled to the window and looked down upon that cavalier and as she looked scanning him intently the duke raised his head their eyes met and she drew back with a little cry  what is it exclaimed giovanni  it is that insolent fellow who stared at me last evening in the street i would you had not bidden me look  now whilst she had been gazing from the window giovanni moving softly behind her had espied a bowl of roses on the ebony table in the rooms middle swiftly and silently he had plucked a blossom which he now held behind his back as she turned from him again he sent it flying through the window and whilst in his heart he laughed with bitter hate and scorn as he thought of gandia snatching up that rose and treasuring it in his bosom aloud he laughed at her fears derided them as idle  that night in his room giovanni practised penmanship assiduously armed with a model with which antonia had innocently equipped him he went to bed well pleased reflecting that as a man lives so does he die giovanni borgia duke of gandia had been ever an amiable profligate a heedless voluptuary obeying no spur but that of his own pleasure which should drive him now to his destruction giovanni borgia he considered further was as he had expressed it the very apple of his fathers eye and since of his own accord the duke had come to thrust his foolish head into the noose the lord of pesaro would make a sweet beginning to the avenging of his wrongs by drawing it taut  next morning saw him at the vatican greatly daring to deliver in person his forgery to the duke suspicious of his mask they asked him who he was and whence he came  say one who desires to remain unknown with a letter for the duke of gandia which his magnificence will welcome  reluctantly a chamberlain departed with his message anon he was conducted above to the magnificent apartments which gandia occupied during his sojourn there  he found the duke newly risen and with him his brother the auburnheaded young cardinal of valencia dressed in a closefitting suit of black that displayed his lithe and gracefully athletic proportions and a cloak of scarlet silk to give a suggestion of his ecclesiastical rank  giovanni bowed low and thickening his voice that it might not be recognized announced himself and his mission in one  from the lady of the rose said he proffering the letter  valencia stared a moment then went off into a burst of laughter gandias face flamed and his eyes sparkled he snatched the letter broke its seal and consumed its contents then he flung away to a table took up a pen and sat down to write the tall valencia watching him with amused scorn a while then crossing to his side and setting a hand upon his shoulder  you will never learn said the more subtle cesare you must forever be leaving traces where traces are not to be desired  gandia looked up into that keen handsome young face  you are right he said and crumpled the letter in his hand  then he looked at the messenger and hesitated  i am in madonnas confidence said the man in the mask  gandia rose then saysay that her letter has carried me to heaven that i but await her commands to come in person to declare myself but bid her hasten for within two weeks from now i go to naples and thence i may return straight to spain  the opportunity shall be found magnificent myself i shall bring you word of it  the duke loaded him with thanks and in his excessive gratitude pressed upon him at parting a purse of fifty ducats which giovanni flung into the tiber some ten minutes later as he was crossing the bridge of sant angelo on his homeward way  the lord of pesaro proceeded without haste delay and silence he knew would make gandia the more sharpset and your sharpset impatient fellow is seldom cautious meanwhile antonia had mentioned to her father that princely stranger who had stared so offendingly one evening and who for an hour on the following morning had haunted the street beneath her window pico mentioned it to giovanni whereupon giovanni told him frankly who it was  it was that libertine brotherinlaw of mine the duke of gandia he said had he persisted i should have bidden you look to your daughter as it is no doubt he has other things to think of he is preparing for his journey to naples to accompany his brother cesare who goes as papal legate to crown federigo of aragon  there he left the matter and no more was heard of it until the night of june 14th the very eve of the departure of the borgia princes upon that mission  cloaked and masked giovanni took his way to the vatican at dusk that evening and desired to have himself announced to the duke but he was met with the answer that the duke was absent that he had gone to take leave of his mother and to sup at her villa in trastevere his return was not expected until late  at first giovanni feared that in leaving the consummation of his plot until the eleventh hour he had left it too late in his anxiety he at once set out on foot as he was for the villa of madonna giovanna de catanei he reached it towards ten oclock that night to be informed that gandia was there at supper the servant went to bear word to the duke that a man in a mask was asking to see him a message which instantly flung gandia into agitation excitedly he commanded that the man be brought to him at once  the lord of pesaro was conducted through the house and out into the garden to an arbour of vine where a rich table was spread in the evening cool lighted by alabaster lamps about this table giovanni found a noble company of his own relations by marriage there was gandia who rose hurriedly at his approach and came to meet him there was cesare cardinal of valencia who was to go to naples tomorrow as papal legate yet dressed tonight in cloth of gold with no trace of his churchly dignity about him there was their younger brother giuffredo prince of squillace a handsome stripling flanked by his wife the freeandeasy donna sancia of aragon swarthy coarsefeatured and fleshy despite her youth there was giovannis sometime wife the lovely goldenheaded lucrezia the innocent cause of all this hate that festered in the lord of pesaros soul there was their mother the nobly handsome giovanozza de catanei from whom the borgias derived their auburn heads and there was their cousin giovanni borgia cardinal of monreale portly and scarlet at madonnas side  all turned to glance at this masked intruder who had the power so oddly to excite their beloved gandia  from the lady of the rose giovanni announced himself softly to the duke  yes yes came the answer feverishly impatient well what is your message  tonight her father is from home she will expect your magnificence at midnight  gandia drew a deep breath  by the host you are no more than in time i had almost despaired my friend my best of friends tonight he pronounced the word ecstatically wait you here yourself you shall conduct me meanwhile go sup  and beating his hands he summoned attendants  came the steward and a couple of moorish slaves in green turbans to whose care the duke commanded his masked visitor but giovanni neither required nor desired their ministrations he would not eat nor drink but contented himself with the patience of hatred to sit for two long hours awaiting the pleasure of his foolish victim  they left at last a little before midnight the duke his brother cesare his cousin monreale and a numerous attendance his own retinue and those of the two cardinals thus they rode back to rome the borgias very gay the man in the mask plodding along beside them  they came to the rione de ponte where their ways were to separate and there opposite the palace of the cardinal vicechancellor gandia drew rein he announced to the others that he went no farther with them summoned a single groom to attend him and bade the remainder return to the vatican and await him there  there was a last jest and a laugh from cesare as the cavalcade went on towards the papal palace then gandia turned to the man in the mask bade him get up on the crupper of his horse and so rode slowly off in the direction of the giudecca the single attendant he had retained trotting beside his stirrup  giovanni directed his brotherinlaw not to the main entrance of the house but to the garden gate which opened upon a narrow alley here they dismounted flinging the reins to the groom who was bidden to wait giovanni produced a key unlocked the door and ushered the duke into the gloom of the garden a stone staircase ran up to the loggia on the mezzanine and by this way was gandia now conducted treading softly his guide went ahead he had provided himself with yet another key and so unlocked the door from the loggia which opened upon the anteroom of madonna antonia he held the door for the duke who hesitated seeing all in darkness  in giovanni bade him tread softly madonna waits for you  recklessly then that unsuspecting fellow stepped into the trap  giovanni followed closed the door and locked it the duke standing with quickened pulses in that impenetrable blackness found himself suddenly embraced not at all after the fond fashion he was expecting a wrestlers arms enlaced his body a sinewy leg coiled itself snakewise about one of his own pulling it from under him as he crashed down under the weight of his unseen opponent a great voice boomed out  lord of mirandola to me help thieves  suddenly a door opened light flooded the gloom and the writhing duke beheld a white vision of the girl whose beauty had been the lure that had drawn him into this peril which as yet he scarcely understood but looking up into the face of the man who grappled with him the man who held him there supine under his weight he began at last to understand or at least to suspect for the face he saw unmasked now leering at him with hate unspeakable through the cloud of golden hair that half met across it was the face of giovanni sforza lord of pesaro whom his family had so cruelly wronged giovanni sforzas was the voice that now fiercely announced his doom  you and yours have made me a thing of scorn and laughter yourself have laughed at me go laugh in hell  a blade flashed up in giovannis hand gandia threw up an arm to fend his breast and the blade buried itself in the muscles he screamed with pain and terror the other laughed with hate and triumph and stabbed again this time in the shoulder  antonia from the threshold watching in bewilderment and panic sent a piercing scream to ring through the house and then the voice of giovanni fierce yet exultant called aloud  pico pico lord of mirandola look to your daughter  came steps and voice more light flooding now the chamber and through the mists gathering before his eyes the firstborn of the house of borgia beheld hurrying men half dressed with weapons in their hands but whether they came to kill or to save they came too late ten times giovannis blade had stabbed the duke yet hindered by the dukes struggles and by the effort of holding him there he had been unable to find his heart wherefore as those others entered now he slashed his victim across the throat and so made an end  he rose covered with blood so ghastly and terrific that pico thinking him wounded ran to him but giovanni reassured him with a laugh and pointed with his dripping dagger  the blood is hisfoul borgia blood  at the name pico started and there was a movement as of fear from the three grooms who followed him the count looked down at that splendid bloodspattered figure lying there so still its sightless eyes staring up at the frescoed ceiling so brave and so pitiful in his goldbroidered suit of white satin with the richly jewelled girdle carrying gloves and purse and a jewelled dagger that had been so useless in that extremity  gandia he cried and looked at giovanni with round eyes of fear and amazement how came he here  how  with bloody hand giovanni pointed to the open door of antonias chamber  that was the lure my lord taking the air outside i saw him slinking hither and took him for a thief as indeed he wasa thief of honour like all his kind i followed andthere he lies  my god cried pico and then hoarsely asked and antonia  giovanni dismissed the question abruptly  she saw yet she knows nothing  and then on another note  up now pico he cried arouse the city and let all men know how gandia died the death of a thief let all men know this borgia brood for what it is  are you mad cried pico will i put my neck under the knife  you took him here in the night and yours was the right to kill you exercised it  pico looked long and searchingly into the others face true all the appearances bore out the tale as did too what had gone before and had been the cause of antonias complaint to him yet knowing what lay between sforza and borgia it may have seemed to pico too extraordinary a coincidence that giovanni should have been so ready at hand to defend the honour of the house of mirandola but he asked no questions he was content in his philosophy to accept the event and be thankful for it on every count but as for giovannis suggestion that he should proclaim through rome how he had exercised his right to slay this tarquin the lord of mirandola had no mind to adopt it  what is done is done he said shortly in a tone that conveyed much let it suffice us all it but remains now to be rid of this  you will keep silent cried giovanni plainly vexed  i am not a fool said pico gently  giovanni understood and these your men  ate very faithful friends who will aid you now to efface all traces  and upon that he moved away calling his daughter whose absence was intriguing him receiving no answer he entered her room to find her in a swoon across her bed she had fainted from sheer horror at what she had seen  followed by the three servants bearing the body giovanni went down across the garden very gently approaching the gate he bade them wait saying that he went to see that the coast was clear then going forward alone he opened the gate and called softly to the waiting groom  hither to me  promptly the man surged before him in the gloom and as promptly giovanni sank his dagger in the fellows breast he deplored the necessity for the deed but it was unavoidable and your cinquecentist never shrank from anything that necessity imposed upon him to let the lackey live would be to have the bargelli in the house by morning  the man sank with a halfuttered cry and lay still  giovanni dragged him aside under the shelter of the wall where the others would not see him then called softly to them to follow  when the grooms emerged from picos garden the lord of pesaro was astride of the fine white horse on which gandia had ridden to his death  put him across the crupper he bade them  and they so placed the body the head dangling on one side the legs on the other and giovanni reflected grimly how he had reversed the order in which gandia and he had ridden that same horse an hour ago  at a walk they proceeded down the lane towards the river a groom on each side to see that the burden on the crupper did not jolt off another going ahead to scout at the alleys mouth giovanni drew rein and let the man emerge upon the riverbank and look to right and left to make sure that there was no one about  he saw no one yet one there was who saw them giorgio the timber merchant who lay aboard his boat moored to the schiavoni and who three days later testified to what he saw you know his testimony it has been repeated oftenhow he saw the man emerge from the alley and look up and down then retire to emerge again accompanied now by the horseman with his burden and the other two how he saw them take the body from the crupper of the horse and with a one two and three fling it into the river how he heard the horseman ask them had they thrown it well into the middle and their answer of yes my lord and finally when asked why he had not come earlier to report the matter how he had answered that he had thought nothing of it having in his time seen more than a hundred bodies flung into the tiber at night  returned to the garden gate giovanni bade the men go in without him there was something yet that he must do when they had gone he dismounted and went to the body of the groom which he had left under the wall he must remove that too he cut one of the stirrupleathers from the saddle and attaching one end of it to the dead mans arm mounted again and dragged him thusready to leave the body and ride off at the first alarmsome little way until he came to the piazza della giudecca here in the very heart of the jewish quarters he left the body and his movements hereafter are a little obscure perhaps he set out to return to pico della mirandolas house but becoming as was natural uneasy on the way fearing lest all traces should after all not have been effaced lest the duke should be traced to that house and himself if found there dealt with summarily upon suspicion he turned about and went off to seek sanctuary with his uncle the vicechancellor  the dukes horse which he had ridden he turned loose in the streets where it was found some hours later and first gave occasion to rumours of foul play the rumours growing with the discovery of the body of gandias groom and searchparties of armed bargelli scouring rome and the giudecca in particular in the course of the next two days forth at last came giorgio that boatman of the schiavoni with the tale of what he had seen when the stricken pope heard it he ordered the bed of the river to be dragged foot by foot with the result that the illstarred duke of gandia was brought up in one of the nets whereupon the heartless sanazzaro coined his terrible epigram concerning that successor of saint peter that fisherman of men  the people looking about for him who had the greatest motive for that deed were quick to fasten the guilt upon giovanni sforza who by that time was far from rome riding hard for the shelter of his tyranny of pesaro and the cardinal ascanio sforza who was also mentioned and who feared to be implicated apprehensive ever lest his page should have seen the betraying arms upon the ring of his masked visitorfled also nor could be induced to return save under a safeconduct from the holy father expressing conviction of his innocence  later public rumour accused others indeed they accused in turn every man who could have been a possible perpetrator attributing to some of them the most fantastic and incredible motives once prompted no doubt by their knowledge of the libertine pleasureloving nature of the dead duke rumour hit upon the actual circumstances of the murder so closely indeed that the count of mirandolas house was visited by the bargelli and subjected to an examination at which pico violently rebelled appealing boldly to the pope against insinuations that reflected upon the honour of his daughter  the mystery remained impenetrable and the culprit was never brought to justice we know that in slaying gandia giovanni sforza vented a hatred whose object was not gandia but gandias father his aim was to deal pope alexander the cruellest and most lingering of wounds and if he lacked the avengers satisfaction of disclosing himself at least he did not lack assurance that his blow had stricken home he heardas all italy heardfrom that wayfarer on the bridge of sant angelo how the pope in a paroxysm of grief at sight of his sons body fished from the tiber had bellowed in his agony like a tortured bull so that his cries within the castle were heard upon the bridge he learnt how the handsome vigorous pope staggered into the consistory of the 19th of that same month with the mien and gait of a palsied old man and in a voice broken with sobs proclaimed his bitter lament  had we seven papacies we would give them all to restore the duke to life  he might have been content but he was not that deep hate of his against those who had made him a thing of scorn was not so easily to be slaked he waited spying his opportunity for further hurt it came a year later when gandias brother the ambitious cesare borgia divested himself of his cardinalitial robes and rank exchanging them for temporal dignities and the title of duke of valentinois then it was that he took up the deadly weapon of calumny putting it secretly about that cesare was the murderer of his brother spurred to it by worldly ambition and by other motives which involved the principal members of the family  men do not mount to borgia heights without making enemies the evil tale was taken up in all its foul trappings and upon no better authority than the public voice it was enshrined in chronicles by every scribbler of the day and for four hundred years that lie has held its place in history the very cornerstone of all the execration that has been heaped upon the name of borgia never was vengeance more terrible farreaching and abiding it is only in this twentieth century of ours that dispassionate historians have nailed upon the counter of truth the base coin of that accusation     xii the night of escapecasanovas escape from the piombi   patrician influence from without had procured casanovas removal in august of that year 1756 from the loathsome cell he had occupied for thirteen months in the piombiso called from the leaded roof immediately above those prisons which are simply the garrets of the doges palace  that cell had been no better than a kennel seldom reached by the light of day and so shallow that it was impossible for a man of his fine height to stand upright in it but his present prison was comparatively spacious and it was airy and welllighted by a barred window whence he could see the lido  yet he was desperately chagrined at the change for he had almost completed his arrangements to break out of his former cell the only ray of hope in his present despair came from the fact that the implement to which he trusted was still in his possession safely concealed in the upholstery of the armchair that had been moved with him into his present quarters that implement he had fashioned for himself with infinite pains out of a doorbolt some twenty inches long which he had found discarded in a rubbishheap in a corner of the attic where he had been allowed to take his brief daily exercise using as a whetstone a small slab of black marble similarly acquired he had shaped that bolt into a sharp octagonalpointed chisel or spontoon  it remained in his possession but he saw no chance of using it now for the suspicions of lorenzo the gaoler were aroused and daily a couple of archers came to sound the floors and walls true they did not sound the ceiling which was low and within reach but it was obviously impossible to cut through the ceiling in such a manner as to leave the progress of the work unseen  hence his despair of breaking out of a prison where he had spent over a year without trial or prospect of a trial and where he seemed likely to spend the remainder of his days he did not even know precisely why he had been arrested all that giacomo casanova knew was that he was accounted a disturber of the public peace he was notoriously a libertine a gamester and heavily in debt alsoand this was more serioushe was accused of practising magic as indeed he had done as a means of exploiting to his own profit the credulity of simpletons of all degrees he would have explained to the inquisitors of state of the most serene republic that the books of magic found by their apparitors in his possessionthe clavicula of solomon the zecorben and other kindred workshad been collected by him as curious instances of human aberration but the inquisitors of state would not have believed him for the inquisitors were among those who took magic seriously and anyhow they had never asked him to explain but had left him as if forgotten in that abominable verminous cell under the leads until his patrician friend had obtained him the mercy of this transfer to better quarters  this casanova was a man of iron nerve and iron constitution tall and wellmade he was boldly handsome with fine dark eyes and dark brown hair in age he was barely one and twenty but he looked older as well he might for in his adventurers way he had already gathered more experience of life than most men gain in half a century  the same influence that had obtained him his change of cell had also gained him latterly the privilegeand he esteemed it beyond all elseof procuring himself books desiring the works of maffai he bade his gaoler purchase them out of the allowance made him by the inquisitors in accordance with the venetian custom this allowance was graduated to the social status of each prisoner but the books being costly and any monthly surplus from his monthly expenditure being usually the gaolers perquisite lorenzo was reluctant to indulge him he mentioned that there was a prisoner above who was well equipped with books and who no doubt would be glad to lend in exchange  yielding to the suggestion casanova handed lorenzo a copy of peteaus rationarium and received next morning in exchange the first volume of wolf within he found a sheet bearing in six verses a paraphrase of senecas epigram calamitosus est animus futuri anxius immediately he perceived he had stumbled upon a means of corresponding with one who might be disposed to assist him to break prison  in reply being a scholarly rascal he had been educated for the priesthood he wrote six verses himself having no pen he cut the long nail of his little finger to a point and splitting it supplied the want for ink he used the juice of mulberries in addition to the verses he wrote a list of the books in his possession which he placed at the disposal of his fellowcaptive he concealed the written sheet in the spine of that vellumbound volume and on the titlepage in warning of this he wrote the single latin word latet next morning he handed the book to lorenzo telling him that he had read it and requesting the second volume  that second volume came on the next day and in the spine of it a long letter some sheets of paper pens and a pencil the writer announced himself as one marino balbi a patrician and a monk who had been four years in that prison where he had since been given a companion in misfortune count andrea asquino  thus began a regular and very full correspondence between the prisoners and soon casanovawho had not lived on his wits for nothingwas able to form a shrewd estimate of balbis character the monks letters revealed it as compounded of sensuality stupidity ingratitude and indiscretion  in the world says casanova i should have had no commerce with a fellow of his nature but in the piombi i was obliged to make capital out of everything that came under my hands  the capital he desired to make in this instance was to ascertain whether balbi would be disposed to do for him what he could not do for himself he wrote inquiring and proposing flight  balbi replied that he and his companion would do anything possible to make their escape from that abominable prison but his lack of resource made him add that he was convinced that nothing was possible  all that you have to do wrote casanova in answer is to break through the ceiling of my cell and get me out of this then trust to me to get you out of the piombi if you are disposed to make the attempt i will supply you with the means and show you the way  it was a characteristically bold reply revealing to us the utter gamester that he was in all things  he knew that balbis cell was situated immediately under the leads and he hoped that once in it he should be able readily to find a way through the roof that cell of balbis communicated with a narrow corridor no more than a shaft for light and air which was immediately above casanovas prison and no sooner had balbi written consenting than casanova explained what was to do balbi must break through the wall of his cell into the little corridor and there cut a round hole in the floor precisely as casanova had done in his former celluntil nothing but a shell of ceiling remaineda shell that could be broken down by half a dozen blows when the moment to escape should have arrived  to begin with he ordered balbi to purchase himself two or three dozen pictures of saints with which to paper his walls using as many as might be necessary for a screen to hide the hole he would be cutting  when balbi wrote that his walls were hung with pictures of saints it became a question of conveying the spontoon to him this was difficult and the monks fatuous suggestions merely served further to reveal his stupidity finally casanovas wits found the way he bade lorenzo buy him an infolio edition of the bible which had just been published and it was into the spine of this enormous tome that he packed the precious spontoon and thus conveyed it to balbi who immediately got to work  this was at the commencement of october on the 8th of that month balbi wrote to casanova that a whole night devoted to labour had resulted merely in the displacing of a single brick which so discouraged the fainthearted monk that he was for abandoning an attempt whose only result must be to increase in the future the rigour of their confinement  without hesitation casanova replied that he was assured of successalthough he was far from having any grounds for any such assurance he enjoined the monk to believe him and to persevere confident that as he advanced he would find progress easier this proved indeed to be the case for soon balbi found the brickwork yielding so rapidly to his efforts that one morning a week later casanova heard three light taps above his headthe preconcerted signal by which they were to assure themselves that their notions of the topography of the prison were correct  all that day he heard balbi at work immediately above him and again on the morrow when balbi wrote that as the floor was of the thickness of only two boards he counted upon completing the job on the next day without piercing the ceiling  but it would seem as if fortune were intent upon making a mock of casanova luring him to heights of hope merely to cast him down again into the depths of despair just as upon the eve of breaking out of his former cell mischance had thwarted him so now when again he deemed himself upon the very threshold of liberty came mischance again to thwart him  early in the afternoon the sound of bolts being drawn outside froze his very blood and checked his breathing yet he had the presence of mind to give the double knock that was the agreed alarm signal whereupon balbi instantly desisted from his labours overhead  came lorenzo with two archers leading an ugly lean little man of between forty and fifty years of age shabbily dressed and wearing a round black wig whom the tribunal had ordered should share casanovas prison for the present with apologies for leaving such a scoundrel in casanovas company lorenzo departed and the newcomer went down upon his knees drew forth a chaplet and began to tell his beads  casanova surveyed this intruder at once with disgust and despair presently his disgust was increased when the fellow whose name was soradici frankly avowed himself a spy in the service of the council of ten a calling which he warmly defended from the contempt universallybut unjustly according to himselfmeted out to it he had been imprisoned for having failed in his duty on one occasion through succumbing to a bribe  conceive casanovas frame of mindhis uncertainty as to how long this monster as he calls him might be left in his company his curbed impatience to regain his liberty and his consciousness of the horrible risk of discovery which delay entailed he wrote to balbi that night while the spy slept and for the present their operations were suspended but not for very long soon casanovas wits resolved how to turn to account the weakness which he discovered in soradici  the spy was devout to the point of bigoted credulous superstition he spent long hours in prayer and he talked freely of his special devotion to the blessed virgin and his ardent faith in miracles  casanovathe archhumbug who had worked magic to delude the credulousdetermined there and then to work a miracle for soradici assuming an inspired air he solemnly informed the spy one morning that it had been revealed to him in a dream that soradicis devotion to the rosary was about to be rewarded that an angel was to be sent from heaven to deliver him from prison and that casanova himself would accompany him in his flight  if soradici doubted conviction was soon to follow for casanova foretold the very hour at which the angel would come to break into the prison and at that hour preciselycasanova having warned balbithe noise made by the angel overhead flung soradici into an ecstasy of terror  but when at the end of four hours the angel desisted from his labours soradici was beset by doubts casanova explained to him that since angels invariably put on the garb of human flesh when descending upon earth they labour under human difficulties he added the prophecy that the angel would return on the last day of the month the eve of all saintstwo days laterand that he would then conduct them out of captivity  by this means casanova ensured that no betrayal should be feared from the thoroughly duped soradici who now spent the time in praying weeping and talking of his sins and of the inexhaustibility of divine grace to make doubly sure casanova added the most terrible oath that if by a word to the gaoler soradici should presume to frustrate the divine intentions he would immediately strangle him with his own hands  on october 31st lorenzo paid his usual daily visit early in the morning after his departure they waited some hours soradici in expectant terror casanova in sheer impatience to be at work promptly at noon fell heavy blows overhead and then in a cloud of plaster and broken laths the heavenly messenger descended clumsily into casanovas arms  soradici found this tall gaunt bearded figure clad in a dirty shirt and a pair of leather breeches of a singularly unangelic appearance indeed he looked far more like a devil  when he produced a pair of scissors so that the spy might cut casanovas beard which like the angels had grown in captivity soradici ceased to have any illusions on the score of balbis celestial nature although still intriguedsince he could not guess at the secret correspondence that had passed between casanova and balbihe perceived quite clearly that he had been fooled  leaving soradici in the monks care casanova hoisted himself through the broken ceiling and gained balbis cell where the sight of count asquino dismayed him he found a middleaged man of a corpulence which must render it impossible for him to face the athletic difficulties that lay before them of this the count himself seemed already persuaded  if you think was his greeting as he shook casanovas hand to break through the roof and find a way down from the leads i dont see how you are to succeed without wings i have not the courage to accompany you he added i shall remain and pray for you  attempting no persuasions where they must have been idle casanova passed out of the cell again and approaching as nearly as possible to the edge of the attic he sat down where he could touch the roof as it sloped immediately above his head with his spontoon he tested the timbers and found them so decayed that they almost crumbled at the touch assured thereby that the cutting of a hole would be an easy matter he at once returned to his cell and there he spent the ensuing four hours in preparing ropes he cut up sheets blankets coverlets and the very cover of his mattress knotting the strips together with the utmost care in the end he found himself equipped with some two hundred yards of rope which should be ample for any purpose  having made a bundle of the fine taffeta suit in which he had been arrested his gay cloak of floss silk some stockings shirts and handkerchiefs he and balbi passed up to the other cell compelling soradici to go with them leaving the monk to make a parcel of his belongings casanova went to tackle the roof by dusk he had made a hole twice as large as was necessary and had laid bare the lead sheeting with which the roof was covered unable singlehanded to raise one of the sheets he called balbi to his aid and between them assisted by the spontoon which casanova inserted between the edge of the sheet and the gutter they at last succeeded in tearing away the rivets then by putting their shoulders to the lead they bent it upwards until there was room to emerge and a view of the sky flooded by the vivid light of the crescent moon  not daring in that light to venture upon the roof where they would be seen they must wait with what patience they could until midnight when the moon would have set so they returned to the cell where they had left soradici with count asquino  from balbi casanova had learnt that asquino though well supplied with money was of an avaricious nature nevertheless since money would be necessary casanova asked the count for the loan of thirty gold sequins asquino answered him gently that in the first place they would not need money to escape that in the second he had a numerous family that in the third if casanova perished the money would be lost and that in the fourth he had no money  my reply writes casanova lasted half an hour  let me remind you he said in concluding his exhortation of your promise to pray for us and let me ask you what sense there can be in praying for the success of an enterprise to which you refuse to contribute the most necessary means  the old man was so far conquered by casanovas eloquence that he offered him two sequins which casanova accepted since he was not in case to refuse anything  thereafter as they sat waiting for the moon to set casanova found his earlier estimate of the monks character confirmed balbi now broke into abusive reproaches he found that casanova had acted in bad faith by assuring him that he had formed a complete plan of escape had he suspected that this was a mere gamblers throw on casanovas part he would never have laboured to get him out of his cell the count added his advice that they should abandon an attempt foredoomed to failure and being concerned for the two sequins with which he had so reluctantly parted he argued the case at great length stifling his disgust casanova assured them that although it was impossible for him to afford them details of how he intended to proceed he was perfectly confident of success  at halfpast ten he sent soradiciwho had remained silent throughoutto report upon the night the spy brought word that in another hour or so the moon would have set but that a thick mist was rising which must render the leads very dangerous  so long as the mist isnt made of oil i am content said casanova come make a bundle of your cloak it is time we were moving  but at this soradici fell on his knees in the dark seized casanovas hands and begged to be left behind to pray for their safety since he would be sure to meet his death if he attempted to go with them  casanova assented readily delighted to be rid of the fellow then in the dark he wrote as best he could a quite characteristic letter to the inquisitors of state in which he took his leave of them telling them that since he had been fetched into the prison without his wishes being consulted they could not complain that he should depart without consulting theirs  the bundle containing balbis clothes and another made up of half the rope he slung from the monks neck thereafter doing the same in his own case then in their shirtsleeves their hats on their heads the pair of them started on their perilous journey leaving count asquino and soradici to pray for them  casanova went first on all fours and thrusting the point of his spontoon between the joints of the lead sheeting so as to obtain a hold he crawled slowly upwards to follow balbi took a grip of casanovas belt with his right hand so that in addition to making his own way casanova was compelled to drag the weight of his companion after him and this up the sharp gradient of a roof rendered slippery by the mist  midway in that laborious ascent the monk called to him to stop he had dropped the bundle containing the clothes and he hoped that it had not rolled beyond the gutter though he did not mention which of them should retrieve it after the unreasonableness already endured from this man casanovas exasperation was such in that moment that he confesses he was tempted to kick him after this bundle controlling himself however he answered patiently that the matter could not now be helped and kept steadily amain  at last the apex of the roof was reached and they got astride of it to breathe and to take a survey of their surroundings they faced the several cupolas of the church of saint mark which is connected with the ducal palace being in fact no more than the private chapel of the doge  they set down their bundles and of course in the act of doing so the wretched balbi must lose his hat and send it rolling down the roof after the bundle he had already lost he cried out that it was an evil omen  on the contrary casanova assured him patiently it is a sign of divine protection for if your bundle or your hat had happened to roll to the left instead of the right it would have fallen into the courtyard where it would be seen by the guards who must conclude that some one is moving on the roof and so no doubt would have discovered us as it is your hat has followed your bundle into the canal where it can do no harm  thereupon bidding the monk await his return casanova set off alone on a voyage of discovery keeping for the present astride of the roof in his progress he spent a full hour wandering along the vast roof going to right and to left in his quest but failing completely to make any helpful discovery or to find anything to which he could attach a rope in the end it began to look as if after all he must choose between returning to prison and flinging himself from the roof into the canal he was almost in despair when in his wanderings his attention was caught by a dormer window on the canal side about twothirds of the way down the slope of the roof with infinite precaution he lowered himself down the steep slippery incline until he was astride of the little dormer roof leaning well forward he discovered that a slender grating barred the leaded panes of the window itself and for a moment this grating gave him pause  midnight boomed just then from the church of saint mark like a reminder that but seven hours remained in which to conquer this and further difficulties that might confront him and in which to win clear of that place or else submit to a resumption of his imprisonment under conditions no doubt a hundredfold more rigorous  lying flat on his stomach and hanging far over so as to see what he was doing he worked one point of his spontoon into the sash of the grating and levering outwards he strained until at last it came away completely in his hands after that it was an easy matter to shatter the little latticed window  having accomplished so much he turned and using his spontoon as before he crawled back to the summit of the roof and made his way rapidly along this to the spot where he had left balbi the monk reduced by now to a state of blending despair terror and rage greeted casanova in terms of the grossest abuse for having left him there so long  i was waiting only for daylight he concluded to return to prison  what did you think had become of me asked casanova  i imagined that you had tumbled off the roof  and is this abuse the expression of your joy at finding yourself mistaken  where have you been all this time the monk counterquestioned sullenly  come with me and you shall see  and taking up his bundle again casanova led his companion forward until they were in line with the dormer there casanova showed him what he had done and consulted him as to the means to be adopted to enter the attic it would be too risky for them to allow themselves to drop from the sill since the height of the window from the floor was unknown to them and might be considerable it would be easy for one of them to lower the other by means of the rope but it was not apparent how hereafter the other was to follow thus reasoned casanova  you had better lower me anyhow said balbi without hesitation for no doubt he was very tired of that slippery roof on which a single false step might have sent him to his account once i am inside you can consider ways of following me  that coldblooded expression of the fellows egoism put casanova in a rage for the second time since they had left their prison but as before he conquered it and without uttering a word he proceeded to unfasten the coil of rope making one end of it secure under balbis arms he bade the monk lie prone upon the roof his feet pointing downwards and then paying out rope he lowered him to the dormer he then bade him get through the window as far as the level of his waist and wait thus hanging over and supporting himself upon the sill when he had obeyed casanova followed sliding carefully down to the roof of the dormer planting himself firmly and taking the rope once more he bade balbi to let himself go without fear and so lowered him to the floora height from the window as it proved of some fifty feet this extinguished all casanovas hopes of being able to follow by allowing himself to drop from the sill he was dismayed but the monk happy to find himself at last off that accursed roof and out of all danger of breaking his neck called foolishly to casanova to throw him the rope so that he might take care of it  as may be imagined says casanova i was careful not to take this idiotic advice  not knowing now what was to become of him unless he could discover some other means than those at his command he climbed back again to the summit of the roof and started off desperately upon another voyage of discovery this time he succeeded better than before he found about a cupola a terrace which he had not earlier noticed and on this terrace a hod of plaster a trowel and a ladder some seventy feet long he saw his difficulties solved he passed an end of rope about one of the rungs laid the ladder flat along the slope of the roof and then still astride of the apex he worked his way back dragging the ladder with him until he was once more on a level with the dormer  but now the difficulty was how to get the ladder through the window and he had cause to repent having so hastily deprived himself of his companions assistance he had got the ladder into position and lowered it until one of its ends rested upon the dormer whilst the other projected some twenty feet beyond the edge of the roof he slid down to the dormer and placing the ladder beside him drew it up so that he could reach the eighth rung to this rung he made fast his rope then lowered the ladder again until the upper end of it was in line with the window through which he sought to introduce it but he found it impossible to do so beyond the fifth rung for at this point the end of the ladder came in contact with the roof inside and could be pushed no farther until it was inclined downward now the only possible way to accomplish this was by raising the other end  it occurred to him that he might by so attaching the rope as to bring the ladder across the window frame lower himself hand over hand to the floor of the attic but in so doing he must have left the ladder there to show their pursuers in the morning not merely the way they had gone but for all he knew at this stage the place where they might then be still in hiding having come so far at so much risk and labour he was determined to leave nothing to chance to accomplish his object then he made his way down to the very edge of the roof sliding carefully on his stomach until his feet found support against the marble gutter the ladder meanwhile remaining hooked by one of its rungs to the sill of the dormer  in that perilous position he lifted his end of the ladder a few inches and so contrived to thrust it another foot or so through the window whereby its weight was considerably diminished if he could but get it another couple of feet farther in he was sure that by returning to the dormer he would have been able to complete the job in his anxiety to do this and to obtain the necessary elevation he raised himself upon his knees  but in the very act of making the thrust he slipped and clutching wildly as he went he shot over the edge of the roof he found himself hanging there suspended above that terrific abyss by his hands and his elbows which had convulsively hooked themselves on to the edge of the gutter so that he had it on a level with his breast  it was a moment of dread the like of which he was never likely to endure again in a life that was to know many perils and many hairbreadth escapes he could not write of it nearly half a century later without shuddering and growing sick with horror  a moment he hung there gasping then almost mechanically guided by the sheer instinct of selfpreservation he not merely attempted but actually succeeded in raising himself so as to bring his side against the gutter then continuing gradually to raise himself until his waist was on a level with the edge he threw the weight of his trunk forward upon the roof and slowly brought his right leg up until he had obtained with his knee a further grip of the gutter the rest was easy and you may conceive him as he lay there on the roofs edge panting and shuddering for a moment to regain his breath and nerve  meanwhile the ladder driven forward by the thrust that had so nearly cost him his life had penetrated another three feet through the window and hung there immovable recovered he took up his spontoon which he had placed in the gutter and assisted by it he climbed back to the dormer almost without further difficulty he succeeded now in introducing the ladder until of its own weight it swung down into position  a moment later he had joined balbi in the attic and together they groped about in it the dark until finding presently a door they passed into another chamber where they discovered furniture by hurtling against it guided by a faint glimmer of light casanova made his way to one of the windows and opened it he looked out upon a black abyss and having no knowledge of the locality and no inclination to adventure himself into unknown regions he immediately abandoned all idea of attempting to climb down he closed the window again and going back to the other room he lay down on the floor with the bundle of ropes for a pillow to wait for dawn  and so exhausted was he not only by the efforts of the past hours and the terrible experience in which they had culminated but also because in the last two days he had scarcely eaten or slept that straightway and greatly to balbis indignation and disgust he fell into a profound sleep  he was aroused three and a half hours later by the clamours and shakings of the exasperated monk protesting that such a sleep at such a time was a thing inconceivable balbi informed him that it had just struck five  it was still dark but already there was a dim grey glimmer of dawn by which objects could be faintly discerned searching casanova found another door opposite that of the chamber which they had entered earlier it was locked but the lock was a poor one that yielded to half a dozen blows of the spontoon and they passed into a little room beyond which by an open door they came into a long gallery lined with pigeonholes stuffed with parchments which they conceived to be the archives at the end of this gallery they found a short flight of stairs and below that yet another which brought them to a glass door opening this they entered a room which casanova immediately identified as the ducal chancellery descent from one of its windows would have been easy but they would have found themselves in the labyrinth of courts and alleys behind saint marks which would not have suited them at all  on a table casanova found a stout bodkin with a long wooden handle the implement used by the secretaries for piercing parchments that were to be joined by a cord bearing the leaden seals of the republic he opened a desk and rummaging in it found a letter addressed to the proveditor of corfu advising a remittance of three thousand sequins for the repair of the fortress he rummaged further seeking the three thousand sequins which he would have appropriated without the least scruple unfortunately they were not there  quitting the desk he crossed to the door not merely to find it locked but to discover that it was not the kind of lock that would yield to blows there was no way out but by battering away one of the panels and to this he addressed himself without hesitation assisted by balbi who had armed himself with the bodkin but who trembled fearfully at the noise of casanovas blows there was danger in this but the danger must be braved for time was slipping away in half an hour they had broken down all the panel it was possible to remove without the help of a saw the opening they had made was at a height of five feet from the ground and the splintered woodwork armed it with a fearful array of jagged teeth  they dragged a couple of stools to the door and getting on to these casanova bade balbi go first the long lean monk folded his arms and thrust head and shoulders through the hole then casanova lifted him first by the waist then by the legs and so helped him through into the room beyond casanova threw their bundles after him and then placing a third stool on top of the other two climbed on to it and being almost on a level with the opening was able to get through as far as his waist when balbi took him in his arms and proceeded to drag him out but it was done at the cost of torn breeches and lacerated legs and when he stood up in the room beyond he was bleeding freely from the wounds which the jagged edges of the wood had dealt him  after that they went down two staircases and came out at last in the gallery leading to the great doors at the head of that magnificent flight of steps known as the giants staircase but these doorsthe main entrance of the palacewere locked and at a glance casanova saw that nothing short of a hatchet would serve to open them there was no more to be done  with a resignation that seemed to balbi entirely cynical casanova sat down on the floor  my task is ended he announced it is now for heaven or chance to do the rest i dont know whether the palace cleaners will come here today as it is all saints or tomorrow which will be all souls should any one come i shall run for it the moment the door is opened and you had best follow me if no one comes i shall not move from here and if i die of hunger so much the worse  it was a speech that flung the monk into a passion in burning terms he reviled casanova calling him a madman a seducer a deceiver a liar casanova let him rave it was just striking six precisely an hour had elapsed since they had left the attic  balbi in his red flannel waistcoat and his pucecoloured leather breeches might have passed for a peasant but casanova in torn garments that were soaked in blood presented an appearance that was terrifying and suspicious this he proceeded to repair tearing a handkerchief he made shift to bandage his wounds and then from his bundle he took his fine taffeta summer suit which on a winters day must render him ridiculous  he dressed his thick dark brown hair as best he could drew on a pair of white stockings and donned three lace shirts one over another his fine cloak of floss silk he gave to balbi who looked for all the world as if he had stolen it  thus dressed his fine hat laced with point of spain on his head casanova opened a window and looked out at once he was seen by some idlers in the courtyard who amazed at his appearance there and conceiving that he must have been locked in by mistake on the previous day went off at once to advise the porter meanwhile casanova vexed at having shown himself where he had not expected any one and little guessing how excellently this was to serve his ends left the window and went to sit beside the angry friar who greeted him with fresh revilings  a sound of steps and a rattle of keys stemmed balbis reproaches in full flow the lock groaned  not a word said casanova to the monk but follow me  holding his spontoon ready but concealed under his coat he stepped to the side of the door it opened and the porter who had come alone and bareheaded stared in stupefaction at the strange apparition of casanova  casanova took advantage of that paralyzing amazement without uttering a word he stepped quickly across the threshold and with balbi close upon his heels he went down the giants staircase in a flash crossed the little square reached the canal bundled balbi into the first gondola he found there and jumped in after him  i want to go to fusine and quickly he announced call another oarsman  all was ready and in a moment the gondola was skimming the canal dressed in his unseasonable suit and accompanied by the still more ridiculous figure of balbi in his gaudy cloak and without a hat he imagined he would be taken for a charlatan or an astrologer  the gondola slipped past the customhouse and took the canal of the giudecca halfway down this casanova put his head out of the little cabin to address the gondolier in the poop  do you think we shall reach mestre in an hour  mestre quoth the gondolier but you said fusine  no no i said mestreat least i intended to say mestre  and so the gondola was headed for mestre by a gondolier who professed himself ready to convey his excellency to england if he desired it  the sun was rising and the water assumed an opalescent hue it was a delicious morning casanova tells us and i suspect that never had any morning seemed to that audacious amiable rascal as delicious as this upon which he regained his liberty which no man ever valued more highly  in spirit he was already safely over the frontiers of the most serene republic impatient to transfer his body thither as he shortly did through vicissitudes that are a narrative in themselves and no part of this story of his escape from the piombi and the venetian inquisitors of state     xiii the night of masqueradethe assassination of gustavus iii of sweden   baron bjelke sprang from his carriage almost before it had come to a standstill and without waiting for the footman to let down the steps with a haste entirely foreign to a person of his station and importance he swept into the great vestibule of the palace and in a quivering voice flung a question at the first lackey he encountered  has his majesty started yet  not yet my lord  the answer lessened his haste but not his agitation he cast off the heavy wolfskin pelisse in which he had been wrapped and leaving it in the hands of the servant went briskly up the grand staircase a tall youthful figure very graceful in the suit of black he wore  as he passed through a succession of anterooms on his way to the private apartments of the king those present observed the pallor of his cleancut face under the auburn tiewig he affected and the feverish glow of eyes that took account of no one they could not guess that baron bjelke the kings secretary and favourite carried in his hands the life of his royal master or its equivalent in the shape of the secret of the plot to assassinate him  in many ways bjelke was no better than the other profligate minions of the profligate gustavus of sweden but he had this advantage over them that his intellect was above their average he had detected the first signs of the approach of that storm which the king himself had so heedlessly provoked he knew as much by reason as by intuition that in these days when the neighbouring state of france writhed in the throes of a terrific revolution against monarchic and aristocratic tyranny it was not safe for a king to persist in the abuse of his parasitic power new ideas of socialism were in the air they were spreading through europe and it was not only in france that men accounted it an infamous anachronism that the great mass of a community should toil and sweat and suffer for the benefit of an insolent minority  already had there been trouble with the peasantry in sweden and bjelke had endangered his position as a royal favourite by presuming to warn his master gustavus iii desired amusement not wisdom from those about him he could not be brought to realize the responsibilities which kingship imposes upon a man it has been pretended that he was endowed with great gifts of mind he may have been though the thing has been pretended of so many princes that one may be sceptical where evidence is lacking if he possessed those gifts he succeeded wonderfully in concealing them under a nature that was frivolously gay dissolute and extravagant  his extravagance forced him into monstrous extortions when only a madman would have wasted in profligacy the wealth so cruelly wrung from longsuffering subjects from extortion he was driven by his desperate need of money into flagrant dishonesty at a stroke of the pen he had reduced the value of the paper currency by onethirda reduction so violent and sudden that whilst it impoverished many it involved some in absolute ruinand this that he might gratify his appetite for magnificence and enrich the rapacious favourites who shared his profligacy  the unrest in the kingdom spread it was no longer a question of the resentment of a more or less docile peasantry whose first stirrings of revolt were easily quelled the lesser nobility of sweden were angered by a measurefollowing upon so many othersthat bore peculiarly heavily upon themselves and out of that anger fanned by one manjohn jacob ankarstromwho had felt the vindictive spirit of royal injustice flamed in secret the conspiracy against the kings life which bjelke had discovered  he had discovered it by the perilous course of joining the conspirators he had won their confidence and they recognized that his collaboration was rendered invaluable by the position he held so near the king and in his subtle wisdom at considerable danger to himself bjelke had kept his counsel he had waited until now until the moment when the blow was about to fall before making the disclosure which should not only save gustavus but enable him to cast a net in which all the plotters must be caught and he hoped that when gustavus perceived the narrowness of his escape and the reality of the dangers amid which he walked he would consider the wisdom of taking another course in future  he had reached the door of the last antechamber when a detaining hand was laid upon his arm he found himself accosted by a pagethe offspring of one of the noblest families in sweden and the son of one of bjelkes closest friends a fairhaired impudent boy to whom the secretary permitted a certain familiarity  are you on your way to the king baron the lad inquired  i am carl what is it  a letter for his majestya note fragrant as a midsummer rosewhich a servant has just delivered to me will you take it  give it to me impudence said bjelke the ghost of a smile lighting for a moment his white face  he took the letter and passed on into the last antechamber which was empty of all but a single chamberlaininwaiting this chamberlain bowed respectfully to the baron  his majesty said bjelke  he is dressing shall i announce your excellency  pray do  the chamberlain vanished and bjelke was left alone waiting he stood there idly fingering the scented note he had received from the page as he turned it in his fingers the superscription came uppermost and he turned it no more his eyes lost their absorbed look their glance quickened into attention a frown shaped itself between them like a scar his breathing suspended a moment was renewed with a gasp he stepped aside to a table bearing a score of candles clustered in a massive silver branch and held the note so that the light fell full upon the writing  standing thus he passed a hand over his eyes and stared again two hectic spots burning now in his white cheeks abruptly disregarding the superscription his trembling fingers snapped the blank seal and unfolded the letter addressed to his royal master he was still reading when the chamberlain returned to announce that the king was pleased to see the baron at once he did not seem to hear the announcement his attention was all upon the letter his lips drawn back from his teeth in a grin and beads of perspiration glistening upon his brow  his majesty the chamberlain was beginning to repeat when he broke off suddenly your excellency is ill  ill  bjelke stared at him with glassy eyes he crumpled the letter in his hand and stuffed one and the other into the pocket of his black satin coat he attempted to laugh to reassure the startled chamberlain and achieved a ghastly grimace  i must not keep his majesty waiting he said thickly and stumbled on leaving in the chamberlains mind a suspicion that his majestys secretary was not quite sober  but bjelke so far conquered his emotion that he was almost his usual imperturbable self when he reached the royal dressingroom indeed he no longer displayed even the agitation that had possessed him when first he entered the palace  gustavus a slight handsome man of a good height was standing before a chevalglass when bjelke came in francois the priceless valet his majesty had brought back from his last pleasureseeking visit to prerevolutionary paris some five years ago was standing back judicially to consider the domino he had just placed upon the royal shoulders baron armfelt whom the conspirators accused of wielding the most sinister of all the sinister influences that perverted the kings minddressed from head to foot in shimmering white satin lounged on a divan with all the easy familiarity permitted to this most intimate of courtiers the associate of all royal follies  gustavus looked over his shoulder as he entered  why bjelke he exclaimed i thought you had gone into the country  i am at a loss replied bjelke to imagine what should have given your majesty so mistaken an impression and he might have smiled inwardly to observe how his words seemed to put gustavus out of countenance  the king laughed nevertheless with an affectation of ease  i inferred it from your absence from court on such a night what has been keeping you but without waiting for an answer he fired another question what do you say to my domino bjelke  it was a garment embroidered upon a black satin ground with tongues of flame so cunningly wrought in mingling threads of scarlet and gold that as he turned about now they flashed in the candlelight and seemed to leap like tongues of living fire  your majesty will have a great success said bjelke and to himself relished the full grimness of his joke for a terrible joke it was seeing that he no longer intended to discharge the errand which had brought him in such haste to the palace  faith i deserve it was the flippant answer and he turned again to the mirror to adjust a patch on the left side of his chin there is genius in this domino and it is not the genius of francois for the scheme of flames is my very own the fruit of a deal of thought and study  there gustavus uttered his whole character as a master of the revels or an opera impresario this royal rake would have been a complete success in life the pity of it was that the accident of birth should have robed him in the royal purple like many another prince who has come to a violent end he was born to the wrong metier  i derived the notion he continued from a sanbenito in a goya picture  an ominous garb said bjelke smiling curiously the garment of the sinner on his way to penitential doom  armfelt cried out in a protest of mock horror but gustavus laughed cynically  oh i confess that it would be most apt i had not thought of it  his fingers sought a pomatum box and in doing so displaced a toiletcase of red morocco an oblong paper package fell from the top of this and arrested the kings attention  why what is this he took it upa letter bearing the superscription       to his majesty the king      secret and important  what is this francois the royal voice was suddenly sharp  the valet glided forward whilst armfelt rose from the divan and like bjelke attracted by the sudden change in the kings tone and manner drew near his master  how comes this letter here  the valets face expressed complete amazement it must have been placed there in his absence an hour ago after he had made all preparations for the royal toilette it was certainly not there at the time or he must have seen it  with impatient fingers gustavus snapped the seal and unfolded the letter awhile he stood reading very still his brows knit  then with a contemptuous poof he handed it to his secretary  at a glance bjelke recognized the hand for that of colonel lillehorn one of the conspirators whose courage had evidently failed him in the eleventh hour he read  siredeign to heed the warning of one who not being in your service nor solicitous of your favours flatters not your crimes and yet desires to avert the danger threatening you there is a plot to assassinate you which would by now have been executed but for the countermanding of the ball at the opera last week what was not done then will certainly be done tonight if you afford the opportunity remain at home and avoid balls and public gatherings for the rest of the year thus the fanaticism which aims at your life will evaporate  do you know the writing gustavus asked  bjelke shrugged the hand will be disguised no doubt he evaded  but you will heed the warning sire exclaimed armfelt who had read over the secretarys shoulder and whose face had paled in reading  gustavus laughed contemptuously faith if i were to heed every scaremonger i should get but little amusement out of life  yet he was angry as his shifting colour showed the disrespectful tone of the anonymous communication moved him more deeply than its actual message he toyed a moment with a hairribbon his nether lip thrust out in thought at last he rapped out an oath of vexation and proffered the ribbon to his valet  my hair francois said he and then we will be going  going  it was an ejaculation of horror from armfelt whose face was now as white as the ivorycoloured suit he wore  what else am i to be intimidated out of my pleasures yet that his heart was less stout than his words his very next question showed apropos bjelke what was the reason why you countermanded the ball last week  the councillors from gefle claimed your majestys immediate attention bjelke reminded him  so you said at the time but the business seemed none so urgent when we came to it there was no other reason in your mindno suspicion  his keen dark blue eyes were fixed upon the pale masklike face of the secretary  that grave almost stern countenance relaxed into a smile  i suspected no more than i suspect now was his easy equivocation and all that i suspect now is that some petty enemy is attempting to scare your majesty  to scare me gustavus flushed to the temples am i a man to be scared  ah but consider sire and you bjelke armfelt was bleating this may be a friendly warning in all humility sire let me suggest that you incur no risk that you countermand the masquerade  and permit the insolent writer to boast that he frightened the king sneered bjelke  faith baron you are right the thing is written with intent to make a mock of me  but if it were not so sire persisted the distressed armfelt and volubly he argued now to impose caution reminding the king of his enemies who might indeed be tempted to go the lengths of which the anonymous writer spoke gustavus listened and was impressed  if i took heed of every admonition he said i might as well become a monk at once and yet he took his chin in his hand and stood thoughtful obviously hesitating his head bowed his straight graceful figure motionless  thus until bjelke who now desired above all else the very thing he had come hotfoot to avert broke the silence to undo what armfelt had done  sire he said you may avoid both mockery and danger and yet attend the masquerade be sure if there is indeed a plot the assassins will be informed of the disguise you are to wear give me your flamestudded domino and take a plain black one for yourself  armfelt gasped at the audacity of the proposal but gustavus gave no sign that he had heard he continued standing in that tense attitude his eyes vague and dreamy and as if to show along what roads of thought his mind was travelling he uttered a single word a namein a questioning voice scarce louder than a whisper  ankarstrom  later again he was to think of ankarstrom to make inquiries concerning him which justifies us here in attempting to follow those thoughts of his they took the road down which his conscience pointed above all swedes he had cause to fear john jacobi ankarstrom for foully as he had wronged many men in his time he had wronged none more deeply than that proud highminded nobleman he hated ankarstrom as we must always hate those whom we have wronged and he hated him the more because he knew himself despised by ankarstrom with a cold and deadly contempt that at every turn proclaimed itself  that hatred was more than twenty years old it dated back to the time when gustavus had been a vicious youth and ankarstrom himself a boy they were much of an age gustavus had put upon his young companion an infamous insult which had been answered by a blow his youth and the admitted provocation alone had saved ankarstrom from the dread consequence of striking a prince of the royal blood but they had not saved him from the vindictiveness of gustavus he had kept his lust of vengeance warm and very patiently had he watched and waited for his opportunity to destroy the man who had struck him  that chance had come four years agoin 1788during the war with russia ankarstrom commanded the forces defending the island of gothland these forces were inadequate for the task nor was the island in a proper state of defence being destitute of forts to have persevered in resistance might have been heroic but it would have been worse than futile for not only would it have entailed the massacre of the garrison but it must have further subjected the inhabitants to all the horrors of sack and pillage  in the circumstances ankarstrom had conceived it his duty to surrender to the superior force of russia thereby securing immunity for the persons and property of the inhabitants in this the king perceived his chance to indulge his hatred he caused ankarstrom to be arrested and accused of high treason it being alleged against him that he had advised the people of gothland not to take up arms against the russians the royal agents found witnesses to bear false evidence against ankarstrom with the result that he was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment in a fortress but the sentence was never carried out gustavus had gone too far as he was soon made aware the feelings against him which hitherto had smouldered flamed out at this crowning act of injustice and to repair his error gustavus made haste not indeed to exonerate ankarstrom from the charges brought against him but to pardon him for his alleged offences  when the swedish nobleman was brought to court to receive this pardon he used it as a weapon against the king whom he despised  my unjust judges he announced in a ringing voice the echoes of which were carried to the ends of sweden have never doubted in their hearts my innocence of the charges brought against me and established by means of false witnesses the judgment pronounced against me was unrighteous this exemption from it is my proper due yet i would rather perish through the enmity of the king than live dishonoured by his clemency  gustavus had set his teeth in rage when those fierce words were reported to him and his rage had been increased when he was informed of the cordial reception which everywhere awaited ankarstrom on his release he perceived how far he had overshot his mark and how in seeking treacherously to hurt ankarstrom he had succeeded only in hurting himself nor had he appeased the general indignation by his pardon true the flame of revolt had been quelled but he had no lack of evidence that the fire continued to burn steadily in secret and to eat its way further and further into the ranks of noble and simple alike  it is little wonder then that in this moment with that warning lying there before him the name of ankarstrom should be on his lips the thought of ankarstrom the fear of ankarstrom looming big in his mind it was big enough to make him heed the warning he dropped into a chair  i will not go he said and bjelke saw that his face was white his hands shaking  but when the secretary had repeated the proposal which had earlier gone unheard gustavus caught at it with sudden avidity and with but little concern for the danger that bjelke might be running he sprang up applauding it if a conspiracy there was the conspirators would thus be trapped if there were no conspiracy then this attempt to frighten him should come to nothing thus he would be as safe from the mockery of his enemies as from their knives nor did armfelt protest or make further attempts to dissuade him from going in the circumstances proposed by bjelke the risk would be bjelkes a matter which troubled armfelt not at all indeed he had no cause to love bjelke in whom he beheld a formidable rival and it would be to him no cause for tears if the knife intended for the royal vitals should find its way into bjelkes instead  so baron bjelke arrayed in the domino copied from the penitential sack departed for the opera house leaving gustavus to follow yet despite the measure of precaution no sooner had the masked king himself entered the crowded theatre leaning upon the arm of the count of essen than he conceived that he beheld confirmation of the warning and regretted that he had not heeded it to the extent of remaining absent for one of the first faces he beheld one of the few unmasked faces in that brilliantly lit salon was the face of ankarstrom and ankarstrom appeared to be watching the entrance  gustavus checked in his stride a tremor ran through him and he stiffened in his sudden apprehension for the sight of the tall figure and haughty resolute face of the nobleman he had wronged was of more significance than at first might seem ever since his infamous trial ankarstrom had been at pains to seize every occasion of marking his contempt for his prince never did he fail upon the kings appearance in any gathering of which he was a member to withdraw immediately and never once had he been known deliberately to attend any function which was to be graced by the presence of gustavus how then came he here to this ball given by the kings own command unless he came for the fell purpose of which the letter had given warning  the kings impulse was to withdraw immediately he was taken by a curious an almost unreasoning fear that was quite foreign to him who for all his faults had never yet lacked courage but even as he hesitated a figure swept past him in a domino flecked with flames surrounded by revellers of both sexes and he remembered that if ankarstrom were bent on evil his attention would be held by that figure before which the crowd fell back and opened out respectfully believing it to be the kings yet none the less it was gustavus himself that ankarstrom continued to regard in such a ay that the king had a feeling that his mask was made of glass  and then quite suddenly even as he was on the point of turning another wave of revellers swept frantically up and in a moment gustavus and the count of essen were surrounded another moment and the buffeting crowd had separated him from his grand equerry he found himself alone in the centre of this knot of wild fellows who seeming to mistake him for one of themselves forced him onward with them in their career for a moment he attempted to resist but as well might he have resisted a torrent their rush was not to be stemmed it almost swept him from his feet and to save himself he must perforce abandon himself to the impetus thus he was swirled away across the floor of the amphitheatre helpless as a swimmer in strong waters and with the fear of the drowning clutching now at his heart  he had an impulse to unmask proclaim himself and compel the respect that was his due but to do so might be to expose himself to the very danger of whose presence he was now convinced his only hope must lie in allowing himself to be borne passively along until a chance opening allowed him to escape from these madmen  the stage had been connected with the floor of the theatre by a broad flight of wooden steps up this flight he was carried by that human wave but on the stage itself he found an anchorage at last against one of the wings breathing hard he set his back to it waiting for the wave to sweep on and leave him instead it paused and came to rest with him and in that moment some one touched him on the shoulder he turned his head and looked into the set face of ankarstrom who was close behind him then a burning rending pain took him in his side and he grew sick and dizzy the uproar of voices became muffled the lights were merged into a luminous billow that swelled and shrank and then went out altogether  the report of the pistol had been lost in the general din to all but those who stood near the spot where it had been fired and these found themselves suddenly borne backwards by the little crowd of maskers that fell away from the figure lying prone and bleeding on the stage  voices were raised shouting fire fire thus the conspirators sought to create confusion that they might disperse and lose themselves in the general crowd that confusion however was very brief it was stemmed almost immediately by the count of essen who leapt up the steps to the stage with a premonition of what had happened he stooped to rip away the mask from the face of the victim and beholding as he had feared the livid countenance of his king he stood up himself almost as pale  murder has been done he roared let the doors be closed and guarded and let no one leave the theatre instantly was his bidding done by the officers of the guard  those of the kings household who were in attendance came forward now to raise gustavus and help to bear him to a couch there presently he recovered consciousness whilst a physician was seeing to his hurt and as soon as he realized his condition his manner became so calm that himself he took command of the situation he issued orders that the gates of the city should be closed against everybody whilst himself apologizing to the prussian minister who was near him for issuing that inconvenient but necessary order  the gates shall remain closed for three days sir he announced during that time you will not be able to correspond with your court but your intelligence when it goes will be more certain since by that time it should be known whether i can survive or not  his next order delivered in a voice that was broken by his intense suffering was to the chamberlain benzelstjerna commanding that all present should unmask and sign their names in a book before being suffered to depart that done he bade them bear him home on the couch on which he had been placed that he might be spared the agony of more movement than was necessary  thus his grenadiers bore him on their shoulders lighted by torches through the streets that were now thronged for the rumour had now gone forth that the king was dead and troops had been called out to keep order beside him walked armfelt in his suit of shimmering white satin weeping at once for his king and for himself for he knew that he was of those who must fall with gustavus and knowing this there was bitter rage in his heart against the men who had wrought this havoc a rage that sharpened his wits to an unusual acuteness  at last the king was once more in his apartments awaiting the physicians who were to pronounce his fate and armfelt kept him company among others revolving in his mind the terrible suspicion he had formed  presently came duke charles the kings brother and benzelstjerna with the list of those who had been present at the ball  tell me he asked before the list was read to him is the name of ankarstrom included in it  he was the last to sign sire replied the chamberlain  the king smiled grimly tell lillesparre to have him arrested and questioned  armfelt flung forward there is another who should be arrested too he cried fiercely and added bjelke  bjelke  the king echoed the name almost in anger at the imputation armfelt spoke torrentially it was he persuaded you to go against your own judgment when you had the warning and at last induced you to it by offering to assume your own domino if the assassins sought the king how came they to pass over one who wore the kings domino and to penetrate your own disguise that was like a dozen others because they were informed of the change but by whomby whom who was it knew  my god groaned the unfortunate king who had in his time broken faith with so many and was now to suffer the knowledge of this broken faith in one whom he had trusted above all others  baron bjelke was arrested an hour later arrested in the very act of entering his own home the men of lillesparres police had preceded him thither to await his return he was quite calm when they surged suddenly about him laid hands upon him and formally pronounced him their prisoner  i suppose he said it was to have been inferred allow me to take my leave of the baroness and i shall be at your disposal  my orders baron are explicit he was answered by the officer in charge i am not to suffer you out of my sight  how am i to be denied so ordinary a boon his voice quivered with sudden anger and something else  such are my orders baron  bjelke pleaded for five minutes grace for that leavetaking but the officer had his orders he was no more than a machine the baron raised his clenched hands in mute protest to the heavens then let them fall heavily  very well he said and suffered them to thrust him back into his carriage and carry him away to the waiting lillesparre  he found armfelt in the office of the chief of the police haranguing ankarstrom who was already there under arrest the favourite broke off as bjelke was brought in  you were privy to this infamy bjelke he cried if the king does not recover  he will not recover it was the cold passionless voice of ankarstrom that spoke my pistol was loaded with rusty nails i intended to make quite sure of ridding my country of that perjured tyrant  armfelt stared at the prisoner a moment with furious bloodshot eyes then he broke into imprecations stemmed only when lillesparre ordered ankarstrom to be removed when he was gone the chief of police turned to bjelke  it grieves me baron that we should meet thus and it is with difficulty that i can believe what is alleged against you baron armfelt is perhaps rendered hasty by his grief and righteous anger but i hope that you will be able to explainat least to deny your concern in this horrible deed  very tense and white stood bjelke  i have an explanation that should satisfy you as a man of honour he said quietly but not as chief of the police i joined this conspiracy that i might master its scope and learn the intentions of the plotters it was a desperate thing i did out of love and loyalty to the king and i succeeded i came tonight to the palace with information which should not only have saved the kings life but would have enabled him to smother the conspiracy for all time on the threshold of his room this letter for the king was delivered into my hands read it lillesparre that you may know precisely what manner of master you serve that you may understand how gustavus of sweden recompenses love and loyalty read it and tell me how you would have acted in my place  and he flung the letter on to the writingtable at which sat lillesparre  the chief of police took it up began to read turned back to the superscription then resumed his reading a dull flush overspreading his face over his shoulder armfelt too was reading but bjelke cared not let all the world behold that advertisement of royal infamy that incriminating loveletter from bjelkes wife to the king who had dishonoured him  lillesparre was stricken dumb he dared not raise his eyes to meet the glance of the prisoner but the shameless armfelt sucked in a breath of understanding  you admit your guilt then he snarled  that i sent the monster to the masquerade knowing that there the blessed hand of ankarstrom would give him his passport out of a world he had befouledyes  the rack shall make you yield the name of every one of the conspirators  the rack bjelke smiled disdainfully and shrugged your men lillesparre were very prompt and very obdurate they would not allow me to take leave of the baroness so that she has escaped me but i am not sure that it is not a fitter vengeance to let her live and remember that letter may now be delivered to the king for whom it is intended its fond messages may lighten the misery of his remaining hours  his face was contorted with rage thought armfelt who watched him but in reality with pain caused by the poison that was corroding his vitals he had drained a little phial just before stepping into the presence of lillesparre as they discovered upon inquiries made after he had collapsed dead at their feet  this caused them to bring back ankarstrom that he might be searched lest he too should take some similar way of escaping them when he search was done having discovered nothing lillesparre commanded that he should not have knife or fork or metal comb or anything with which he might take his life  you need not fear that i shall seek to evade the sacrifice he assured them his demeanour haughty his eyes aglow with fanatic zeal it is the price i pay for having rid nature of a monster and my country of a false perjured tyrant and i pay it gladly as he ceased he smiled and drew from the gold lace of his sleeve a surgeons lancet this was supplied me against my need to open a vein but the laws of god and man may require my death upon the scaffold  and smiling he placed the lancet on lillesparres table  upon his conviction execution followed and it lasted three daysfrom april 19th to 21 stbeing attended by all the horrible and gradual torturings reserved for regicides yet possibly he did not suffer more than his victim whose agony had lasted for thirteen days and who perished miserably in the consciousness that he deserved his fate whilst ankarstrom was uplifted and fortified by his fanaticism  the scaffold was erected on the stora torget facing the opera house of stockholm where the assassination had taken place thence the dismembered remains of ankarstrom were conveyed to the ordinary gallows in the suburb of sodermalm to be exhibited the right hand being nailed below the head under this hand on the morrow was found a tablet bearing the legend      blessed the hand     that saved the fatherland
