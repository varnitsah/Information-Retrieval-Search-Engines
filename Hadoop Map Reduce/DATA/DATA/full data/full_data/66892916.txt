                jane taylor   it is come felix it is come  so cried shouted shrieked a chorus as a street door was torn open to admit four boys with their leathern straps of books over their shoulders they set up a responsive yell of jolly jolly which being caught up and reechoed by at least five voices within caused a considerable volume of sound in the narrow entry and narrower staircase up which might be seen a sort of pyramid of children  where is it asked the tallest of the four arrivals as he soberly hung up his hat  mamma has got it in the drawingroom and papa has been in ever since dinner was the universal cry from two finecomplexioned handsome girls from a much smaller girl and boy and from a creature rolling on the stairs whose sex and speech seemed as yet uncertain  and wheres cherry was the further question is she there too  yes but as he laid his hand on the door dont open the letter there get cherry and well settle what to do with it  o felix ive a stunning notion  felix promise to do what i want  felix do pray buy me some turkish delight  felix i do want the big spotty horse  such shouts and insinuations all deserving the epithet of the first pursued felix as he entered a room small and with all the contents faded and worn but with an air of having been once tasteful and still made the best of contents we say advisedly meaning not merely the furniture but the inmates namely the pale wan fragile mother working but with the baby on her knee and looking as if care and toil had brought her to skin and bone though still with sweet eyes and a lovely smile the father tall and picturesque with straight handsome features but with a hectic colour wasted cheek and lustrous eye that were sad earnests of the future he was still under forty his wife some years less and elder than either in its expression of wasted suffering was the countenance of the little girl of thirteen years old who lay on the sofa with pencil paper and book her face with her mothers features exaggerated into a look at once keen and patient all three forming a sad contrast to the solid exuberant health on the other side the door  truly the boy who entered was a picture of sturdy english vigour stoutlimbed rosyfaced clear eyed open and straightforward looking perhaps a little clumsy with the clumsiness of sixteen especially when conscience required tearing spirits to be subdued to the endurance of the feeble it was however a bright congratulating look that met him from the trio the little girl started up your sovereigns come felix  the father showed his transparentlooking white teeth in a merry laugh here are the galleons you boy named in a lucky hour how many times have you spent them in fancy  the mother held up the letter addressed to master felix chester underwood no 8 st oswalds buildings bexley and smiled as she said is it all right my boy  they want me to open it outside mammacome whiteheart we want you at the council  and putting his arm round his little sister geraldines waist while she took up her small crutch felix disappeared with her the mother looking wistfully after them the father giving something between a laugh and a sigh  then you decide against speaking to him said mrs underwood  poor children yes a little happiness will do them a great deal more good than the pound would do to us the drops that will fill their little cup will but be lost in our sea  yes i like what comes from vale leston to be still a festive matter said mrs underwood and at least we are sure the dear boy will never spend it selfishly it only struck me whether he would not enjoy finding himself able to throw something into the common stock  he would honest lad said mr underwood but mamma you are very hardhearted towards the rabble even if this one pound would provide all the shoes and port wine that are pressing on the maternal mind the stimulus of a days treat would be much more wholesome  but not for you said his wife  yes for me if the boy includes us old folks in his festivity it will be as good as a weeks port wine you doubt my sweet enid has not our long honeymoon at vale leston helped us all this time her name was mary but having once declared her to be a woman made of the same stuff as enid he had made it his pet title for her  mrs underwoods thoughts went far away into the long ago of vale leston she could hardly believe that nine years only had passed since that sevenyears honeymoon she was a woman of the fewest possible words and her husband generally answered her face instead of her voice  vale leston had promised to be an ample provision when edward underwood had resigned his fellowship to marry the rectors niece and adopted daughter his own distant cousin with the assurance of being presented to the living hereafter and acting in the meantime as curate it was a family living always held conjointly with a tolerably good estate enough to qualify the owner for the dangerous position of squarson as no doubt many a clerical underwood had been ever since their branch had grown out from the stem of the elder line which had now disappeared these comfortable quarters had seemed a matter of certainty until the uncle died suddenly and with a flaw in his will so that the undesirable nephew and heiratlaw whom he had desired to exclude a rich dissipated man son to a brother older than the father of the favourite niece had stepped in and differing in toto from edward underwood had made his own son take orders for the sake of the living and it had been the effort of the young wife ever since not to disobey her husband by showing that it had been to her the being driven out of paradise   assistant curacya priest of catholic opinions is needed at a town parish resident rector and three curates daily prayers choral service on sundays and holydays weekly communionapply to      p c b st oswalds rectory bexley   every one knows the sort of advertisement which had brought mr underwood to bexley as a place which would accord with the doctrines and practices dear to him indeed apart from the advertisement bexley had a fame a great rubrical war had there been fought out by the rector of st oswalds and when he had become a colonial bishop his successor was reported to have carried on his work and the beauty of the restored church and the exquisite services were so generally talked of that mr underwood thought himself fortunate in obtaining the appointment mr bevan too the rector was an exceedingly courteous kindlymannered man talking in a soft low voice in the most affectionate and considerate manner and with good taste and judgment that exceedingly struck and pleased the new curate it was the more surprise to him to find the congregations thin and a general languor and indifference about the people who attended the church there was also a good deal of opposition in the parish some old sullen seceders who went to a neighbouring proprietary chapel many more of erratic tastes haunted the places of worship of the numerous sects who swarmed in the town and many more were living in a state of town heathenism  it was not long before the perception of the cause began to grow upon mr underwood the machinery was perfect but the spring was failing the salt was there but where was the savour the discourses he heard from his rector were in one point of view faultless but the old scottish word fushionless would rise into his thoughts whenever they ended and something of effect and point was sure to fail they were bodies without souls and might well satisfy a certain excellent solicitor who always praised them as just the right medium sober moderate and unexciting  in the first pleasure of a strong active and enterprising man at finding his plans unopposed by authority mr underwood had been delighted with his rectory ready consent to whatever he undertook and was the last person to perceive that mr bevan though objecting to nothing let all the rough and tough work lapse upon his curates and took nothing but the graceful representative part even then mr underwood had something to say in his defence mr bevan was valetudinarian in his habits and besideshe was in the midst of a courtshipafter his marriage he would give his mind to his parish  for mr bevan hitherto a confirmed and rather precise and luxurious bachelor to the general surprise married a certain lady price the young widow of an old admiral and with her began a new regime  my lady as every one called her since she retained her title and name was by no means desirous of altering the ornamental arrangements in church which she regarded with pride but she was doubly anxious to guard her husbands health and she also had the sharpest eye to the main chance hitherto whatever had been the disappointments and shortcomings at the rectory there had been free handed expenditure and no stint either in charity or the expenses connected with the service but lady price had no notion of taking on her uncalledfor outlay the parish must do its part and it was called on to do so in modes that did not add to the rectors popularity moreover the arrangements were on the principle of getting as much as possible out of everybody and no official failed to feel the pinch the rector was as bland gentle and obliging as ever but he seldom transacted any affairs that he could help and in the six years that had elapsed since the marriage every person connected with the church had changed except mr underwood  yet perhaps as senior curate he had felt the alteration most heavily he had to be or to refuse to be my ladys instrument in her various appeals he came in for her indignation at wastefulness and at the unauthorised demands on the rector he had to feel what it was to have no longer unlimited resources of broth and wine to fall back upon at the rectory he had to supply the shortcomings of the new staff brought in on lower termsand all this moreover when his own health and vigour were beginning to fail  lady price did not like him or his family they were poor and she distrusted the poor and what was worse she knew they were better born and better bred than herself and had higher aims gentle mrs underwood absorbed in household cares no more thought of rivalry with her than with the queen but the soft movement the low voice the quiet sweep of the worn garments were a constant vexation to my lady who having once pronounced the curates wife affected held to her opinion with mr underwood she had had a fight or two and had not conquered and now they were on terms of perfect respect and civility on his side and of distance and politeness on hers she might talk of him half contemptuously but she never durst show herself otherwise than civil though she was always longing to bring in some more deferential person in his place and whenever illness interfered with his duties she spoke largely to her friends of the impropriety of a mans undertaking what he could not perform  one of her reductions had been the economising the third curate while making the second be always a neophyte who received his title for orders and remained his two years upon a small stipend  the change last easter which had substituted a deacon for a priest had fallen heavily on mr underwood and would have been heavier still but that the new comer charles audley had attached himself warmly to him the young man was the son of a family of rank and connection and lady prices vanity was flattered by obtaining his assistance but her vexation was proportionably excited by his preference for the underwood household where in truthwith all its povertyhe found the only atmosphere thoroughly congenial to him in all the parish of st oswalds  speedily comprehending the state of things he put his vigorous young shoulder to the wheel and full of affectionate love and admiration for mr underwood spared himself nothing in the hope of saving him fatigue or exertion quietly gave up his own holidays was always at his post and had hitherto so far lightened mr underwoods toil that he was undoubtedly getting through this summer better than the last for his bodily frame had long been affected by the increased amount of toil in an ungenial atmosphere and every access of cold weather had told on him in throat and chest attacks which with characteristic buoyancy he would not believe serious he never deemed himself aught but better and the invalid habits that crept on him by stealth always seemed to his brave spirit consequent on a days extra fatigue or the last attention to a departing cough alas when every days fatigue was extra the cough always departing never departed  yet though it had become a standing order in the house that for an hour after papa came in from his rounds no one of the children should be in the drawingroom except poor little lame geraldine who was permanently established there and that afterwards even on strong compulsion they should only come in one by one as quietly as possible he never ceased to apologise to them for their banishment when he felt it needful and when he was at ease would renew the merriment that sometimes cost him dear  the children had for the most part inherited that precious heirloom of contentment and elasticity and were as happy in nooks and corners in bedroom nursery staircase or kitchen as they could have been in extensive playrooms and gardens  see them in full council upon the expenditure of the annual gift that an old admiral at vale leston who was godfather to felix was wont to send the boy on his birthdaythat third of july which had seemed so bright when birthdays had begun in the family that no name save felix could adequately express his parents feelings  mr and mrs underwood had fancies as to nomenclature and that staircaseful of children rejoiced in eccentric appellations to begin at the bottomhere sat on a hassock her back against the wall her sharp old fairys face uplifted little geraldine otherwise cherry a title that had suited her round rosiness well till after the first winter at bexley when the miseries of a diseased anclejoint had set in and paled her into the tender aliases of whiteheart or sweet heart she was as might be plainly seen in her grey eyes a clever child and teaching her was a great delight to her father and often interested him when he was unequal to anything else her dark eyebrows frowned with anxiety as she lifted up her little pointed chin to watch sturdy frankfaced felix who with elaborate slowness dealt with the envelope tasting slowly of the excitement it created and edging away from the baluster on which causing it to contribute frightful creaks to the general babel were perched numbers 4 6 7 and 8 to wit edgar clement fulbert and lancelot all three handsome blueeyed fairfaced lads indeed edgar was remarkable even among this decidedly finelooking family he had a peculiarly delicate contour of feature and complexion though perfectly healthy and there was something of the same expression half keen half dreamy as in geraldine his junior by one year while the grace of all the attitudes of his slender lissome figure showed to advantage beside felixs more sturdy form and deliberate or downright movements while clement was paler slighter and with rather infantine features and shining wavy brown hair that nothing ever seemed to ruffle looked so much as if he ought to have been a girl that tina short for clementina was his school name fulbert stout square fatcheeked and permanently rough and dusty looked as if he hardly belonged to the rest  the four eldest were dayscholars at the city grammarschool but lancelot a brightfaced little fellow in knickerbockers was a pupil of whoever would or could teach him at home as was the little girl who was clinging to his leg and whose name of robina seemed to have moulded her into some curious likeness to a robinredbreast with her brown soft hair rosy cheeks bright merry eyes plump form and quick loving audacity above her sat a girl of fifteen with the family features in their prettiest developmentthe chiseled straight profile the clear white roseately tinted skin the large wellopened azure eyes the profuse glossy hair the long slender graceful limbs and that pretty head leant against the knees of her own very counterpart for these were wilmet and alda the twin girls who had succeeded felix and whose beauty had been the marvel of vale leston their shabby dress the scorn of the day school at bexley and forming the apex of the pyramid perched astride on the very shoulders of muchenduring wilmet was three years old angelababy bernard being quiescent in a cradle near mamma nbmrs underwood though her girls had such masculine names had made so strong a protest against their being called by boyish abbreviations that only in one case had nature been too strong for her and robina had turned into bobbie wilmets second name being ursula she was apt to be known as ww  make haste felix you intolerable boy dont be so slow cried alda  is there a letter inquired wilmet  yes mores the pity said felix now i shall have to answer it  ill do that if youll give me whats inside said edgar  is it there exclaimed cherry in a tone of doubt that sent an electric thrill of dismay through the audience lance nearly toppling over to the horror of the adjacent sisters and the grave rebuke of clement  if it should be a sell gasped fulbert  suppose it were said felix gravely  then said edgar you can disown the old rogue chester  what stuff interposed clement  id cut him out of my will on the spot persisted edgar  but it is all right said cherry looking with quiet certainty into her brothers face and he nodded and coloured at the same time  but it is not a pretty one said little robina last year it was green and before that red and this is nasty stupid black and white and all thin crackling paper  felix laughed and held up the document  what cried fulbert five why tisnt only five shillings the horrid old cheat  its a fivepound note screamed cherry i saw one when papa went to the bank o felix felix  a fivepound note it seemed to take away the breath of those who knew what it meant and then an exulting shout broke forth  well said edgar solemnly old chester is a brick three cheers for him  which cheers having been perpetrated with due vociferation the cry began o felix what will you do with it  buy a pony cried fulbert  a rockinghorse chirped robina  punch every week shouted lance  a knife apiece said fulbert  how can you all be so selfish pronounced clement now a harmonium would be good to us all  then get some cotton for our ears into the bargain if tina is to play on it said edgar  i shall take the note to mother said the owner  oh screamed all but wilmet and cherry thats as bad as not having it at all  maybe felix thought so for it was with a certain gravity and solemnity of demeanour that he entered the drawingroom causing his father to exclaim how now  no slip between cup and lip not infelix felix  no papa but its this and i thought i ought to bring it  the dew at once was in the mothers eyes as she sprang up and kissed the boys brow saying felix dear dont show it to me you were meant to be happy with it go and be so  stay said mr underwood felix will really enjoy helping us to this extent more than any private expenditure is it not so my boy well then i propose that the sovereign of old prescriptive right should go to his menus plaisirs and the rest to something needful but he shall say to what said i well old fellow  oh thank you thank you cried felix ardently  thank me for permission to do as you will with your own smiled mr underwood  you will choose then felix said his mother wistfully her desires divided between port wine for papa and pale ale for geraldine  yes mamma was the prompt answer then please let wilmet and alda be rigged out fresh for sundays  wilmet and alda exclaimed mamma  yes i should like that better than anything please said the boy all our fellows say they would be the prettiest girls in all bexley if they were properly dressed and those horrid girls at miss pearsons lead them a life about those old black hats  poor dears i have found alda crying when she was dressing for church mused mrs underwood and though i have scolded her i could have cried too to think how unlike their girlhood is to mine  and if you went to fetch them home from school you would know how bad it is mamma said felix wilmet does not mind it but alda cries and the sneaking girls do it the more and they are girls so one cant lick them and they have not all got brothers  to be licked instead said mr underwood unable to help being amused  well yes papa and so you see it would be no end of a comfort to make them look like the rest  by all means felix the ladies can tell how far your benefaction will go but as far as it can accomplish the twins shall be resplendent now then back to your anxious clients only tell me first how my kind old friend the admiral is  heres his letter father i quite forgot to read it  some day i hope you will know him enough to care for him personally now you may be offnay enid love your daughters could not have lived much longer without clothes to their backs  oh yes it must have been done sighed the poor mother but i fancied felix would have thought of you first  he thought of troubles much more felt than any of mine poor children the hard apprenticeship will serve them all their lives  meantime felix returned with the words hurrah we are to have the sovereign just as usual and all the rest is to go to turn out wilmet and alda like respectable young femaleshollo now  for alda had precipitated herself downstairs to throttle him with her embraces while cherry cried out thats right oh do get those dear white hats you told me about but the public even there a manyheaded monster thing was less content  what all in girls trumpery thats the stupidest sell i ever heard of oh i did so want a pony were the cries of the boys  even robina was so far infected as to cry i wanted a ride  and wilmet reproachfully exclaimed o felix you should have got something for papa dont you know mr rugg said he ought to have a respirator it is a great shame  i dont think he would have let me wilmet said felix looking up and i never thought of it besides i cant have those girls making asses of themselves at you  oh no dont listen to wilmet cried alda you are the very best brother in all the world now we shall be fit to be seen at the break up i dont think i could have played my piece if i knew every one was looking at my horrid old alpaca  and therell be hats for cherry and bobbie too entreated wilmet  oh dont put it into their heads gasped alda  no ill have you two fit to be seen first said felix  well its a horrid shame grumbled fulbert we have always all gone shares in felixs birthday tip  so you do now said felix theres the pound all the same as usual  that pound was always being spent in imagination and the voices broke out again  oh then papa can have the respirator  felix the rockinghorse  felix do get us three little cannon to make a jolly row every birthday  felix do you know that charlie froggatt says he would sell that big newfoundland for a pound and that would be among us all  nonsense fulbert a big dog is always eating but there is a concertina at lakes  tinatinaconcertina but i say fee theres whiteheart been wishing her heart out all the time for a real good paintbox  oh never mind that ed no one would care for one but you and me and the little ones would spoil all the paints  yes resumed wilmet from her throneit would be the worry of ones life to keep the little ones off them and baby would be poisoned to a dead certainty  now the respirator  now the concertina  now punch  now the dog  now the rockinghorse  now the cannon  ill tell you what said felix ive settled how it is to be well get john harpers van and all go out to the castle with a jolly cold dinneryes you cherry and all ed and i will carry youand dine on the grass and  a chorus of shouts interrupted him all ecstatic and rendered more emphatic by the stamping of feet  and angela will go added wilmet  and papa entreated cherry  and mamma too if she will said felix  and mr audley pronounced robina echoed by clement and angela mr audley must go  mr audley grunted felix i want nobody but ourselves  yes and if he went we could not stay jolly late my lady would make no end of a row if both curates cut the evening prayers  for shame edgar cried the three elder girls  while wilmet added we could not stay late because of papa and the little ones but i dont want mr audley either  no no papa and he will talk to each other and be of no use said geraldine oh how delicious will the wildroses be out when shall it be felix  well the first fine day after school breaks up i should say  hurrah hurrah  and there was another dance in the midst of which mr underwood opened the door to ask what honourable member was receiving such deafening cheers  here here he is papa cried alda he is going to take us all out to a picnic in the castle woods and wont you come papa  o papa you will come said felix and the whole staircase bawled in accordance  come to be sure i will said his father and only too glad to be asked i trust we shall prove to have found the way to get the maximum of pleasure out of admiral chesters gift  if mamma will go said felix i wonder what the van will cost and what will be left for the dinner  oh let us two cook the whole dinner entreated the twins  wait now said felix i didnt know it was so late father  and he carefully helped his father on with his coat and as a church bell made itself heard set forth with him  when the service was musical felix and his two next brothers both formed part of the choir and though this was not the case on this evening felix knew that his mother was easier when he or wilmet could watch over papas wraps  and mamma herself with one at least of the twins was busy enough in giving the lesser ones their supper and disposing of them in bed so that the discreet alone might remain to the later teadrinking  and sibby must be made a sharer of the good news in her lower region though she was sure to disbelieve in alda and wilmets amateur cookery  sibby was wilmets fostermother poor thing mr underwood had found her in dire need in the workhouse a child herself of seventeen with a newborn babe fresh from the discovery that the soldierhusband as she thought and who had at least gone before the praste with her and brought her from her kilkenny home was previously husband to another woman  she was tenderly cared for by mr underwoods mother who was then alive and keeping house for the whole party at the rectory and having come into the vale leston nursery she never left it her own child died in teething and she clung so passionately to her nursling that mrs underwood had no heart to separate them roman catholic though she was and difficult to dispose of she was not the usual talking merry irishwoman if ever she had been such her heart was broken and she was always meek quiet subdued and attentive forgetful sometimes but tender and trustworthy to the last degree with the children  she had held fast to the family in their reverses and no more thought of not sharing their lot than one of their children indeed it would not have been much more possible to send her out to shift for herself in england and her own people seemed to have vanished in the famine for her letters with her savings came back from the deadletter office she put her shoulder to the burthen and with one small scrub under her got through an amazing amount of work and though her great deep liquid brown eyes looked as pathetic as ever she certainly was in far better spirits than when she sat in the nursery to be sure she was a much better nurse than she was a cook but as both could not be had mrs underwood was content and thankful to have a servant so entirely one with themselves in interests and affections and who had the further perfection of never wanting any society but the childrens shrinking from english gossips and never showing a weakness save for irish tramps  moreover she was a prodigious knitter and it was her boast that not one of the six young gentlemen had yet worn stocking or sock but what came from her needles and had been refooted by her to the last extremity of wear  meantime felix and clement walked with their father to the church there it was that handsome church the evening sun in slanting beams coming through the gorgeous west window to the illuminated walls and the rich inlaid marble and alabaster of the chancel mellowed by the pure evening light the east window done before glasspainting had improved was tame and illexecuted and there was even aesthetically a strange unsatisfactory feeling in looking at the heavy though handsome incrustations and arcades of dark marble that formed the reredos it was all very correct but it wanted life  mr bevan was not there he had gone out to dinner and the congregation consisted of some young ladies old men and three little children mr audley read all save the absolution and the lessons and the responses sounded low and feeble in the great church though there was one voice among them glad and hearty in dedicating and entrusting the new year of his life with its unknown burthen  felix had heard sayings and seen looks which boldly as his sanguine spirit resisted them would hang in a heavy boding cloud over his mind and were already casting a grave shadow there  and if the thought of his fivefold gift swelled the fervour of his amen to the general thanksgiving there was another deep heartfelt amen which breathed forth earnest gratitude for the possession of such a firstborn son  that is a very good boy the father could not help saying to mr audley as on quitting the churchyard felix exclaiming papa may i just get it changed and ask about the van darted across the street with clement into a large grocers shop nearly opposite where a brisk evening traffic was going on in the long daylight of hot july and he could not but tell of the birthdaygift and how it was to be spent res angusta domi he said with a smile is a thing to be thankful for when it has such effects upon a lad  you must add a small taste of example to the prescription said mr audley is this all the birthday present felix has had  well i believe cherry gave him one of her original designs but birthdays are too numerous for us to stand presents  the other curate halfsighed he was a great contrasta much smaller man than his senior slight slim and pale but with no look of ill health about him brown eyed and haired and with the indefinable look about all his appointments and dress that showed he had lived in unconscious luxury and refinement all his days his thoughts went back to a home where the only perplexity was how to deal with an absolute glut of presents and to his own actual doubts what to send that youngest sister who would feel slighted if charlie sent nothing but really could not want anything a book she would not read a jewel could seldom get a turn of being worn a trinket would only be fresh lumber for her room then he revolved the possibilities of making felix a present without silencing his fathers confidences and felt that it could not be done in any direct manner at present nay that it could hardly add to the radiant happiness of the boy who rushed across the road almost under the nose of the railwayomnibus horses and exclaimed  he will let us have it for nothing father he says it would be hiring it out and he cant do that but he would esteem it a great favour if we would go in it and not pay anything except just a shilling to harris for a pint of beer wont it be jolly father  spicy would be more appropriate said mr underwood laughing as the vehicle in question drew up at the shop door with mr harpers name and all his groceries inscribed in gold letters upon the awning  im so glad i thought of harpers continued felix i asked him instead of buff because i knew mamma would want it to be covered now theres lots of room and we boys will walk up all the hills  i hope there is room for me felix suggested mr audley  or suggested mr underwood you might like john gilpin ride on horseback after we  felix looks noncontent said mr audley i am afraid i was not in his programme speak outlet us have it  why said felix looking down our little ones all wanted to have you but then we thought we should all be obliged to come home too soon unless you took the service for papa  he certainly ought not to go to church after it said mr audley but i can settle that by riding home in good time whats the day  the day after the girls breakup if you please said felix still not perfectly happy but unable to help himself and manifesting quite enough reluctance to make his father ask as soon as they had parted what made him so ungracious  only papa said felix frankly that we know that you and he will get into some church talk and then youll be of no use and we wanted to have it all to ourselves  take care felix said mr underwood large families are apt to get into a state of savage exclusiveness  felix had to bear the drawback and the groans it caused from wilmet edgar and fulbert the rest decidedly rejoiced and mr underwood privately confided the objection to his friend observing merrily that they would bind themselves by a promise not to talk shop throughout the expedition  it was a brilliantly happy week pretty hats bound with dark blue velvet and fresh black silk jackets were squeezed out of the four pounds with the help of a few shillings out of the intended hire of the van and were the glory of the whole family both of those who were to wear them and those who were not  on saturday evening just as the four elder young people were about to sally forth to do the marketing for their picnic a great hamper made its appearance in the passage addressed to f c underwood esq and with nothing to pay only there was a note fastened to the side saying dear felix pray let the spicy van find room for my contribution to your picnic i told my mother to send me what was proper from homec s a  mrs underwood was dragged out to superintend the unpacking which she greatly advised should be merely a surface investigation that was quite enough however to assure her that for felix to lay in any provision except the tea and the bread she had already promised would be entirely superfluous the girls were disappointed of their cookery but derived consolation from the long walk with the brothers in which a cake of good carmine and a lump of gamboge were purchased for cherry and two penny dolls for robina and angela what would become of the rest of the pound  on sunday the offertory was as usual on ordinary occasions rather scanty but there was one halfsovereign and mr underwood was convinced that it had come from under the one white surplice that had still remained on the choir boys bench  he stayed in the vestry after the others to count and take care of the offerings and as he took up the gold he could not but look at his son who was waiting for him and who flushed all over as he met his eye yes papa i wanted to tell youi did grudge it at first he said hoarsely i knew it was the tithe but it seemed so much away from them all i settled that two shillings was the tenth of my own share and i would give that today and then came mr harpers kindness about the van and next when i was thinking how i could save the tenth part without stinting everybody came all mr audleys hamper it is very strange and happy papa and i have still something left  i believe said mr underwood that you will find the considering the tithe as not your own is the safest way of keeping poverty from grinding you or wealth from spoiling you  and very affectionately he leant on his sons shoulder all the way home while mr audley was at luncheon at the rectory with my lady and her twelve years old daughter  mamma said miss price did you see the underwoods in new hats  of course i did my dear they were quite conspicuous enough but when people make a great deal of their poverty they always do break out in the most unexpected ways  they are pretty girls said the rector rather dreamily and i suppose they must have new clothes sometimes  you will always find proceeded lady price without regard that people of that sort have a wonderful eye to the becomingnothing economical for them i am sorry for mr underwood his wife is bringing up a set of fine ladies who will trust to their pretty looks and be quite above doing anything for themselves  do you think wilmet and alda underwood so very pretty mr audley inquired miss price turning her precocious eyes upon him  remarkably so mr audley replied with a courteous settingdown tone that was the only thing that ever approached to subduing miss price and which set her pouting without an answer  it is a great misfortune to girls in that station of life to have that painteddoll sort of beauty added my lady and what was it i heard about a picnic party  no party my dear replied the rector only a little fresh air for the familya day in centry park felix spends his birthday present from his godfather in taking them  ah i always was sure they had rich friends though they keep it so close never let me hear of their poverty after this  answers only rendered it worse so my lady had it her own way and not being known to the public in st oswalds buildings did not trouble them much yet there was a certain deference to public opinion there when alda was heard pouting felix why did you go to that horrid harper just fancy miss price seeing us  who cares for a stuckup thing like miss price growled felix  i dont care for her said edgar but it is just as well to have some notion of things and felix hasnt a grain why all the fellows will be asking which of us is pepper and which souchong i wouldnt have froggatt or bruce see me in it at no price  very well stay at home then said felix  you could have had the waggonet from the fortinbras arms said alda  ayfor all my money and not for love  for shame alda said her twin sister how can you be so ridiculous  you know yourself wilmet it is quite true if any of the girls see us we shall be labelled the groceries  get inside far enough and they will not see you  ay but therell be that disgusting little bobbie and lance sitting in the front making no end of row said edgar and the whole place will know that mr underwood and his family are going out for a spree in old harpers van pah i shall walk  so shall i said alda at least till we are out of the town but that wont do any good if those children will make themselves so horridly conspicuous could not we have the thing to meet us somewhere out of town felix  and how would you get cherry there or mamma or babyno no if you are too genteel for the van you may walk     chapter ii  the picnic    there on a slope of orchard francis laid  a damask napkin wrought with horse and hound  brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home  and halfcut down a pasty costly made  where quail and pigeon lark and leveret lay  like fossils of the rock with golden yolks  imbedded and injellied last with these  a flask of cider from his fathers vats  prime which i knewand so we sat and ate                                               tennyson   no 8 st oswalds buildings was a roomy house which owed its cheapness to its situation this being neither in the genteel nor the busy part of bexley it was tall and red and possessed a good many rooms and it looked out into a narrow street the opposite side of which consisted of the long wall of a brewery which was joined farther on to that of the stableyard of the fortinbras arms the principal hotel which had been much frequented in old posting days and therefore had offices on a large scale only their side however was presented to st oswalds buildings the front with its arched porte cochere being in the high street as it was still called though it was a good deal outshone by the newer part of the town  the nextdoor neighbours of no 8 were on the one hand a carpenters yard the view of which was charming to the children and the noises not too obnoxious to their parents and on the other the rectory garden which separated them from the churchyard now of course disused it had no entrance towards their lane and to reach the church it was necessary to turn the corner of the wall and go in through the south porch which opened close upon the high street  in this old street lay the two buildings that chiefly concerned the young underwoods ie the two schools that for boys was an old foundation which had fallen into decay and had been reformed and revivified in nineteenthcentury fashion to suit the requirements of the town the place though in the south of england had become noted as a pottery owing partly to the possession of large fields of a peculiar clay which was so bad for vegetable growth as to proclaim its destiny to become pots and pans partly to its convenient neighbourhood to the rising seaport of dearport which was only an hour from it by railway the old st oswalds school had been moulded under the influence of newcomers who had upset the rules of the founder and arranged the terms on the broadest principles of liberality bringing instead of the drowsy old clerical master a very brisk and lively young layman who had a knack of conveying instruction of multifarious kinds such as had never occurred to his predecessor  mr underwood had a certain liking for the man and when tolerably well enjoyed the breaking a lance with him over his many crude heterodoxies but he did not love the school and as long as he was able had taught his boys himself and likewise taken a few daypupils of the upper ranks who were preparing for public schools but when his failure of health rendered this impracticable the positive evil of idleness was he felt greater than any possible ones that might arise from either the teaching or the associations of the town school and he trusted to home influence to counteract any such dangers or perhaps more truly he dreaded lest his own reluctance might partly come from prejudice in favour of gentlemen and public schools and that where a course seemed of absolute necessity providence became a guard in its seeming perils indeed that which he disapproved in mr ryders school was more of omission than commission it was that secularity was the system rather than the substance of that secularity  so felix and edgar went to school and were in due time followed by clement and fulbert and their bright wits and the educated atmosphere of their home made their career brilliant and successful mr ryder was greatly pleased to have got the sons of a man whom he could not but admire and respect and was anxious that the boys should be the means of conquering the antiquated prejudices in favour of exclusiveness at school  felix and edgar were neck and neck carrying off all the prizes of the highest form but onefelix those that depended on industry and accuracy edgar those that could be gained by readiness and dexterity both were to be promoted to the upper form and mr ryder called upon their father in great enjoyment of their triumph and likewise to communicate his confident certainty that they would do him and bexley credit by obtaining the most notable scholarships of the university mr underwood was not a little delighted grateful for the cordial sympathy and he fully agreed that his own lads had benefited by the clear vigorous teaching they had received but though he smiled and allowed that they had taken no harm he said goodhumouredly that of course he must consider that as the proof of his own powers of counteraction  exactly so said the schoolmaster all we wish is that each home should exercise its powers of counteraction we do the teaching you form the opinions  oh are we parents still to be allowed to form the opinions  if you will your house is your castle and the dungeons there may be what you will  well i cannot have a quarrel with you today ryder as long as i can show up my boys as tokens of gods blessing on their home you are welcome to them as instances of wits well sharpened by thorough good instruction  mrs underwood had likewise had a congratulatory visit that was very gratifying the girls school a big old red house standing back from the road at the quietest end of the town was kept by two daughters of a former clergyman well educated and conscientious women whom she esteemed highly and who gave a real good grounding to all who came under their hands going on the opposite principle to mr ryders and trying to supply that which the homes lacked  and they did often succeed in supplying it though their scholars came from a class where there was much to subdue and just at present their difficulties had been much increased by their having been honoured by the education of miss price seven governesses in succession had proved incapable of bearing with lady price and the young lady had in consequence been sent to miss pearsons not without an endeavour on her mothers part to obtain an abatement in terms in honour of the eclat of her rank  there her airs proved so infectious that as miss pearson said the only assistance she had in lessening their evil influence was the perfect ladylikeness of the underwood twins and the warm affection that wilmet inspired alda headed a sort of counter party against caroline price which went on the principle of requiting scorn with scorn but wilmets motherly nature made her the centre of attraction to all the weak and young and her uprightness bore many besides herself through the temptation to little arts both sisters had prizes aldas the first and best and miss pearson further offered to let wilmet pay for her own studies and those of a sister by becoming teacher to the youngest class and supervisor during the midday recreation herself and her sister dining at school  it was a handsome offer for such a young beginner and the mothers eyes filled with tears of pleasure and yet there was a but  not come home to dinner cried the children cant it be alda instead of wilmet we do always want wilmet so and alda would do just as well at school  alda too was surprised for was not she more regular and more forward than her twin sister who was always the one to be kept at home when any little emergency made mamma want the aid of an elder daughter and the mother would almost have asked that alda might be the chosen governess pupil if mr underwood had not said no my dear miss pearson must have her own choice it is a great kindness and must be accepted as such i suppose robina must be the new scholar my little pupil will not leave me  geraldine only heard of the alternative to say ill be nobodys pupil but yours papa  while robina was proportionably exalted by her preferment and took to teasing every one in the house to hear her spelling and her tables that she might not fulfil edgars prediction by going down to the bottom of the babyclass and up and down the stairs she ran chanting in a singsong measure             twenty pence are one and eightpence            thirty pence are two and sixpence   and so on till her father said smiling compensations again mother the less you teach them the more they are willing to learn the mother shook her head and said the theory was more comfortable than safe and that she did not find lancelot an instance of it  but there was a general sense of having earned the holiday when the grocery van came to the door on a morning of glorious sunshine edgar and alda true to their promise had walked on so far ahead as to avoid being seen in the town in connection with it and fulbert had started with them to exhale his impatience but then had turned back halfway that he might not lose the delicious spectacle of the packing of the vehicle a grand pack it was first the precious hamper then a long sofa cushion laid along the bottom then geraldine lifted in by sibby and felix and folded up with shawls and propped with cushions by mamma whose imagination foresaw more shaking than did the more youthful anticipation then mamma herself not with little baby but with angela on her lap and angelas feet in all manner of unexpected places then a roll of umbrellas and wraps then wilmet fulbert lance and robinanowhere in particular and lastly papa making room for clement between himself and the goodhumoured lad of a driver who had not long ago been a member of the choir while felix whom nothing could tire on that day dived rapidly down a complication of alleys declaring he should be up with the walkers long before they were overtaken by the van  next appeared mr audley with his pretty chestnut horse offering in the plenitude of his goodnature to give lance a ride whereupon vociferous me toos resounded from within the curtains and the matter was compounded on ride and tie principles in which the underwood juniors got all the ride and mr audley all the tieif that consisted in walking and holding the bridle  by the time the very long and dull suburbs of bexley were passed with their interminable villas and rows of little tenpound houses the childrens daily country walk poor things the two elder boys and their sister were overtaken the latter now very glad to condescend to the van  oh how nice to get beyond our tiresome old tether she said arranging herself a peephole between the curtains i am so sick of all those dusty black beeches and formal evergreens how can you stare at them so cherry  but geraldine was in a quiet trance of delight she had never spoken a word since she had first found a chink in the awning but had watched with avid eyes the moving panorama of houses gardens trees flowers carriages horses passengers nursemaids perambulators and children it was all a perfect feast to the longimprisoned eyes and the more charming from the dreamy silence in which she gazed when felix came up to the slit through which the bright eyes gleamed and asked whether she were comfortable and liked it her answer was a longdrawn gasp from the wells of infinite satisfaction such as set him calculating how many drives in a bathchair the remnant of his birthday gift would yet produce  but there were greater delights cornfields touched with amber woods sloping up hills deep lanes edged with luxuriant ferns greenery that drove the young folk half mad with delight and made them scream to be let out and gathergather to their hearts content only mamma recommended not tiring themselves but trusting that centry park would afford even superior flowers to those they passed  they reached the lodge gate at last they were known for the castle had been long untenanted and they like other inhabitants of bexley had from time to time enjoyed themselves in the park but today there was a shadow of demur the gentleman who was going to buy the place was looking over itbut surely  horror began to spread over the inmates of the van  but did you come by appointment sir added the gatekeepers wife coming out the gentlemans name is mr underwood  mr underwood was obliged to disclaim any appointment but he looked round at the childrens blank faces and saw lips quivering and eyes gazing wistfully into the paradise of green shade and added if the gentleman has not actually bought it he could not object we do not wish to go near the house  maybe mr audley who was standing near the gate added another more substantial argument for oh certainly sir at once followed and the van was allowed to turn down a gravelled road which skirted an extensive plantation  every one now left it except mrs underwood cherry and angela and the children began to rush and roll in wild delight on the grassy slope and to fill their hands with the heather and ling shrieking with delight wilmet had enough to do to watch over angela in her toddling tumbling felicity while felix weighted with robina on his back edgar fulbert clement and lance ran in and out among the turf and alda demurely walking by her papa opined that it was very odd that the gentlemans name should be underwood  less odd than if it was upperwood said her father as if to throw aside the subject and then after a few moments thought and an odd little smile as if at some thought within himself he began to hand in flowers to cherry and to play with little angela mr audley had gone to put up his horse at the village inn and did not join the party again till they had reached what the children called picnic hollowa spot where a bank suddenly rose above a bright dimpling stream with a bed of rock the wood opening an exquisite vista under its beech trees beyond and a keepers lodge standing conveniently for the boiling of kettles  here the van was disposed of the horses taken out and provided with food cherry carried to a mossy throne under a glorious beech tree and the hampers unpacked by mamma and wilmet among much capering and dancing of the rest of the family and numerous rejected volunteers of assistance felix and alda were allowed to spread the tablecloth and place the dishes but edgar was only entreated to keep the rest out of the way  meanwhile geraldine sat under the silvery bole of her beech tree looking up through its delicate light green leaves to the blue sky not even wanting to speak lest anything should break that perfection of enjoyment her father watched the little pale absorbed countenance and as mr audley came up touched him to direct his attention to the childs expression but the outcry of welcome with which the rest greeted the newcomer was too much for even cherrys trance and she was a merry child at once hungry with unwonted appetite and so relishing her share of the magnificent standingpie that mrs underwood reproved herself for thinking what the poor child would be if she had such fare and such air daily instead of ill dressed mutton in the oppressive smokeladen atmosphere  and meantime lance was crowing like a cock and the other boys were laughing at robina for her utter ignorance of the whitefleshed biped she was eating  no clem chickens have got feathers and wings and their long necks hang down this cant be one of them  perhaps it is a robinredbreast said felix  no nobody kills robinredbreasts because they covered the poor little children with leaves  will you cover me with leaves if i am lost bobbie said mr audley but as soon as she found that his attention was gained she returned to the charge  please did it come from your own home and what is it really  why bobbie i am hardly prepared to say whether it is a hamburg or a houdan or a more unambitious dorking cannot you eat in comfort without being certified  the species will be enough for her without the varieties said her father you have given us a new experience you see audley and we may make a curious study of contrastsnot of audley and myself mother dear but of the two underwoods who seem to be in this place together today  who is it was of course the cry and the inquiry was in mrs underwoods eyes though it did not pass her quiet lips it was to her that he answered yes my deartom i have little doubt that it is he he was a very rich man when last i heard of him  is that the man at vale leston whispered alda to felix  oh i hope he is not coming here to insult us  bosh said felix that mans name is fulbert listen if you want to hear  twenty years ago continued mr underwood i thought myself a prodigiously fine fellowwith my arms full of prizes at harrow and my trinity scholarshipand could just in the plenitude of my presumption extend a little conceited patronage to that unlucky dunce tom underwood the lag of every form and thankful for a high stool at old kedges and now my children view a cold fowl as an unprecedented monster while his might i imagine revel in pates de foie gras  o papa but we like you so much better as you are cried geraldine  eh cherry said mr underwood what say you shouldnt you like me better if i were buying that king beech tree and all the rest of it  cherry edged nearer mastered his hand and looked up in his face with a whole soul of negation in her wistful eyes no no nojust as you are she whispered  some mood of curiosity had come over him and he turned an interrogative look elsewhere  alda spoke of course it would be horrid not to be a clergyman but it is a great shame  no said wilmet it cant be a shame for this cousin tom to have earned a fortune fairlyif he has butand she pressed her hands tightly together as she looked at the thin worn faces of her parents one cant help wishing why do things always go hard and wrong and the tears dimmed her bright eyes  becausethey dont said her father with a halfserious quaintness that vexed her and forced her to turn away to let the tear drop  clement said in his calm voice how can you be all so repining and foolish  and mr underwood almost in lazy mischief pursued his experiment eh felix you are the party most concernedwhat say you  most concerned felix looked up surprised then recollected himself i dont care he said with an appearance of gruff sullenness but his father could not content himself without continuing in a semiteazing tone dont careeh why this centry underwood once belonged to our familythats the reason tom is after it if i had not scouted old kedge you would be prancing about here a harrovian counting the partridges  dont broke in felix with a growl  never fear fee cried edgar with his hand on his brothers shoulder if one man got on in life another may if one only was grown up and had the start and his blue eyes sparkled  i did not know cares clutch had been so tight sighed mr underwood half to himself half to his wife it is not safe my gentle enid to try such experiments eh rousing himself whats that have the mob there a right to any sentiments  only cried clement shouting with laughter lance thought you were wanted to hold a high stool for jack ketch  for a green goose shouted lance indignantly  oh cried robina in the tone of one who had made a scientific discovery did the goose have a high stool to lay the golden eggs  a most pertinent question bobbie and much more reasonable than mine said mr underwood while his colleague gravely answered yes bobbie golden eggs are almost always laid by geese on high stools  ive got a picture of one it has got a long neck and long legs quoth bobbie  it is only a flamingo you little goose yourself cried clement  here is the golden egg of the present said mr underwood replenishing the boys plate with that delicious pie whats that beverage wilmet any horrible brew of your own  no it is out of mr audleys hamper  the universal hamper it is like the fairy gifts that produced unlimited eatables i dreaded cowslip wine or periwinkle broth  no no papa sighed alda we only once made cowslip tea at vale leston  vale leston is prohibited for the daymaster felix chester underwood your good health and the same to the new underwood of centry underwood  shall we see him papa asked alda  if either party desires the gratification no doubt it will come about  shall not you call on him papa  certainly not before he comes mother some of the wonderful bottle ay you covetous miser of a woman or ill make a libation of it all audley it must have wrung your fathers butlers heart to have thrown away this port on a picnic what did you tell him to delude him  only what was truethat i was to meet a gentleman who was a judge of the article  for shame he answered laughing what right had you to know that i knew the taste of cape from roriz  but his evident enjoyment of the good creature was no small pleasure to the provider though it was almost choking to meet the glistening glance of mrs underwoods grateful eyes knowing as she did that there were three more such bottles in the straw at the bottom of the hamper and when baby angela had clasped her fat hands and as youngest at the board inclined the head and pronounced the solemn word her father added gratias deo and grazie a lei we must renew our childhoods training dear marymake our bow and curtesy and say thank you for our good dinner  thank felix for our pleasant day said mr audley come boys have a swing theres a branch too good not to be used and ful has already hung himself up like a twotoed sloth  then began the real festivitythe swinging the flower and fern hunting the drawing the racing and shouting the merry calls and exchange of gay foolish talk and raillery  mr underwood lay back on a slope of moss with a plaid beneath him and a cushion under his head and said that the elysian fields must have been a prevision of this beechwood mrs underwood with felix and wilmet tied up the plates knives and forks and then the mother taking angela with her went to negotiate kettleboiling at the cottage geraldine would fain have sketched but the glory and the beauty and the very lassitude of delight and novelty made her eyes swim with a delicious mist and edgar who had begun when she did threw down his pencil as soon as he saw felix at liberty and the two boys rushed away into the wood for a good tearing scramble and climb like creatures intoxicated with the freedom of the greenwood  after a time they came back dropping armfuls of loosestrife meadowsweet blue vetch and honeysuckle over delighted cherry and falling down by her side coats off all gasp and laughter and breathless narrative of exploits and adventures which somehow died away into the sleepiness due to their previous fivemile walk felix went quite off lying flat on his back with his head on cherrys little spreading lilac cotton frock and his mouth wide open much tempting edgar to pop in a pebble and this being prevented by tender cherry in vehement dumb show edgar consoled himself by a decidedly uncomplimentary caricature of him as giant blunderbore a name derived from fee fa fum gaping for hasty pudding  thats a horrid shame remonstrated geraldine dear old fee when the whole treat is owing to him  it is a tidy little lark for a blunderbore to have thought of said edgar tis a good sort of giant after all poor fellow  poor said cherry indignantly oh you mean what papa saidthat he is the greatest loser of us all i wonder what made him talk in that way he never did before  i am sorry for him said edgar indicating his brother he is famous stuff for a landlord and member of parliamentplenty of wits and brainsonly he wants to be put on a shelf to be got at wherever he is hell go on there now a start is all i want give me my one stepand theno gerald some day ill lift you all up  whats that said felix waking as the enthusiastic voice was raised edgar lifting us all what a bounce we should an come down with  we were talking of what papa said at dinner explained cherry what did you think about it fee  i didnt think at all i wished he hadnt said felix stretching himself  why not said cherry a little ruffled at even felix wishing papa had not  theres no use having things put into ones head  o felix you dont want to change cried cherry  no he said but it was a no in a tone she did not understand the change he saw that hardship was working was that from which he recoiled  thats like you blunderbore said edgar now the very reason i am glad not to be born a great swell but only a poor gentleman is that so much is open to one and if one does anything great it is all the greater and more credit  yes said felix sitting up when you have once got a scholarship there will be the whole world before you  papa got a scholarship said cherry  oh yes said edgar but every one knows what happens to a man that takes orders and marries young and he had the most extraordinary illluck besides now as ryder says any man with brains can shine and i am only doubting whether to take to scholarship or art i love art more than anything and it is the speediest  the conversation was broken for just then wilmet was seen peering about with an anxious careful eye  what is it my deputy partlet asked her father which of your brood are you looking for  i cant see robina said wilmet anxiously she was swinging just now but neither she nor lance is with the big boys  flown up higher said mr underwood pretending to spy among the branches flapsy come down bobbie where are you  a voice answered him and in another moment robina and lance stood in the glade and with them a girl newly come to her teens whom they pulled forward crying she says shes our cousin  indeed said mr underwood i am sure you are very much obliged to her  i am mary alda underwood said the girl abruptly and im sure there must be a very naughty boy here he had put these poor little things up a tree and run away  no no he only put us up because tina bothered about it screamed lance and robina at once he wasnt naughty we were being monkeys  black spidermonkeys added robina  and i swung about like a real one father said lance and was trying to get bobbie down only she grew afraid  it was ten feet from the ground said mary alda impressively and they had lost their way but they told me who they were im come down with my father to see the place  mr underwood heartily shook hands with her thanked her and asked where her father was  gone out with the man to see a farm two miles off she said he told me i might stay in the house or roam where i liked and i saw you all looking so happy ive been watching you this long time  indeed said mr underwood till you captured two of us well we are obliged for the introduction especially if you are to be our neighbour  and my cousins will be friends with me continued mary alda im all alone you know  no i did not know said mr underwood are you the only child  yes she said looking wistfully at the groups around her and it is very horridoh dear who is that pretty one no theres another of them  mr underwood laughed heartily i suppose you mean wilmet and alda he said come girls and see your new cousinmary did you say your name backward alda mary  mary she repeated papa calls me mary but mamma wants it to be marilda all in one word because she says it is more distinguished but i like a sensible name like other people  mr underwood was much amused he felt he had found a character in his newlydiscovered cousin she was underwood all over in his eyes used to the characteristic family features although entirely devoid of that delicacy and refinement of form and complexion that was so remarkable in himself and in most of his children who were all except poor little cherry a good deal alike and most of them handsome there was a sort of clumsiness in the shape of every outline and a coarseness in the colouring that made her like a bad drawing of one of his own girls the eyes were larger the red of the cheeks was redder the lips were thicker the teeth were irregular the figure instead of being what the french call elance was short highshouldered and thickset and the head looked too large she was overdressed too with a smart hat and spangled feather a womanly silk mantle and muchtrimmed skirt from which a heavy quilling had detached itself and was trailing on the ground her hands were ungloved and showed red stumpy fingers but her face had a bright open honest heartiness of expression and a sort of resolute straightforwardness that attracted and pleased him and moreover there was something in the family likeness grotesque as it was that could not but arouse a fellowfeeling in his warm and open heart which neither neglect nor misfortune had ever chilled  i think i should have known you he said smiling here let me introduce you here is our little lame whitehearted cherry and the twins as like as two peas wilmet aldahere  shall i mend your frock was wilmets first greeting as she put her hand in her pocket and produced a little housewife  oh thank you youve got a needle and thread what fun  the little ones are very apt to tear themselves so i like to have it ready  how delicious and you mend for them i wish i had any one to mend for please show me and let me do it i tried to tear the nasty thing off but it would not come i wish mamma would let me wear sensible print like yours  are you laughing at us said wilmet rather bluntly  no indeed not a bit said marilda or mary alda eagerly if you only knew how tiresome it all is  what is  why being finehaving a governess and talking french and learning to dance and coming down into the drawingroom then grandmamma kedge tells me how she used to run about in pattens and feed the chickens and scrub the floor and i do so wish i was her can you scrub and do those nice things  not a floor said wilmet and we live in the town  so have we done till now but papa is going to get this place because he says it is family property and i hope he will for they will never be able to screw me up here as they do at home i say which is fulbert wont your father punish him  oh no you should not have told marilda we never tell papa of little tricks of the boys  but the little darling might have broken her neck  oh life in a large family is made up of might haves said alda  why i do declare theres a smaller still what a little duck and she pounced upon angela  we have a smaller than that said wilmetbernard only we left him at home  tell me all your names cried marilda delighted  she was perfectly happy and chattered on in great delight in her downright voice as much at ease as if she had known them all her life she shared their tea and wanted mr underwood to come and see her father at the house but as she could not promise his early return and it was necessary to get the van under weigh before five this could not be  however she would not leave them till they were all packed into the van and then only parted with repeated kisses and auguries of many future meetings so that the children looked down a vista of unlimited enjoyment of gentry park edgar little gentleman as he was saw her as far back on the way as he could venture     chapter iii  fortunatus purse    out base mechanical churlshakespeare   weeks went on and nothing more was heard of marilda except the wishes and wonderings of the children alda decided that she was one of the heartless fine ladies one heard of in booksand no wonder when her father was in trade and she looked so vulgar while wilmet contended against her finery and cherry transferred the heartlessness to her cruel father and mother and robina never ceased to watch for her from the window even when felix and edgar for very weariness had prohibited the subject from being ever mentioned and further checked it by declaring that marilda looked like a cow  there was plenty besides to think of and the late summer and early autumn rolled cheerily away the wonderful remnant of felixs birthday gift was partly applied to the hire of a chair for geraldine upon every favourable evening and as the boys themselves were always ready to act as horses they obtained it on moderate terms which made the sum hold out in a marvellous manner and not only were these drives delight unimaginable to the little maid but the frequent breaths of pure air seemed to give her vigour she ate more smiled more and moved with less pain and difficulty so that the thought of a partial recovery began to seem far less impossible  the children trooping about her she used to be drawn to the nearest bit of greensward tree or copse and there would occupy herself with the attempt to sketch often in company with edgar and with a few hints from her father would be busied for days after with the finishing them or sometimes the idealising them and filling them with the personages she had read of in books of history or fiction she was a sensitive little body who found it hard not to be fretful when told that it was very illnatured to object to having her paints daubed over her drawings by lance robina and angelan accusation often brought against her by rough kindly sibby and sometimes even by wilmet in an extremity while mammas subdued entreaty that she would do something to please the little ones if it could be without mischief to herself always humiliated her more than anything else and made her ready to leave all to their mercy save for deference to edgar and gratitude to felix robina would look on soberly enough in admiration but lances notions of art were comic and fulberts were arbitrary and both were imperiously carried out with due contempt for the inferior sex and were sure to infect both the little sisters  then of course so many holiday boys were hard to keep in order clement had a strong propensity in that direction he was a grave quiet boy without much sense of the absurd and was generally the victim of edgars wit but on the other hand he was much in the habit of objecting to anything edgar or fulbert proposed and thereby giving forbidden or doubtful amusements double zest he was never in mischief and yet he was never an element of peace  all this however was mitigated when the holidays ended and lance was allowed to follow his brothers to school while bobbie importantly trotted in the wake of her sisters mamma and cherry felt it no small comfort to have no one at home who did not sleep away two or three of the morning hours and the lessons that the little girl delighted to prepare for her father went on in peacethe arithmetic the french the latin and even the verses of greek testament that he always said rested him  and he was quite well he said himself and though his wife never confirmed this reply he was everywhere as usualin church in schools of all kinds in parish meetings by sickbeds or in cottages as bright and as popular as ever perhaps the more so that he was more transparently thin and every stranger started at the sound of his cough though the bexley people had grown weary of repeating the same augury for four or five years and began like my lady to call it constitutional  so came the autumn ember week and mr audley had to go to receive priests orders and afterwards to spend the next fortnight with his parents who complained that they had not seen him once since he had settled at bexley the last week was the breakup of summer weather and mr bevan caught cold and was rheumatic there were two funerals on wet and windy days and when mr audley on lady prices entreating summons wrenched himself from a murmuring home and starting by an early train arrived half through the st michaels day service it was to see mr underwood looking indeed like some ethereal ascetic saint with his bright eyes and wasted features and to hear him preach in extemporeas was his customa sermon on the blessedness of angel helps which in its intense fervour almost rapture was to many as if it came from a whitewinged angel himself mr audley glided into his own place and met felixs look of relief the sermon was finished and the blessing given but before he could descend the steps the cough had come on and with it severe haemorrhage they had to send one startled boy for mrs underwood and another for the doctor and it was an hour before he could be taken home in a chair no one ever forgot that sermon for it was the last he ever preached he was very ill indeed for several days but still hopeful and cheerful and as the weather mended and the calm brightness of october set in he rallied and came downstairs again not looking many degrees more wan and hectic than before with a mind as alert as usual and his kind heart much gratified by the many attentions of his parishioners during his illness  during the worst mrs underwood had been obliged to keep one of the elder girls at homewilmet at first both by her own desire and that of alda but it was soon made a special matter of entreaty by miss pearson that the substitution might not take place the little class was always naughty under alda and something the same effect seemed to be produced on angela and bernard they made so much less disturbance when entrusted to cherry that the mother often sent alda to sit by papa even though she knew he liked nothing so well as to have his little pupils soft voice repeating to him the latin hymns she loved to learn on purpose alda read or sang to him very prettily and they were very happy together but then wilmet could do that as well and also mind the babies or do invalid cookery and supplement sibbys defects and set the mother free for the one occupation she cared for mostthe constant watching of that wasted countenance  but all was better he had been able to collect his children for their evenings bible lesson and sunday catechism and to resume the preparation of edgar and geraldine for their confirmation though it was at least a year distant and even had spoken of sending for others of his catechumens wilmet and alda were both at school the two babies out with sibby mamma at work papa dreaming over a comment on the epistle to the philippians which was very near his heart and he always called his holiday work and geraldine reading on her little couch when there was a sharp ring at the bell and after an interval the girl who daily came in to help announced lady price  even my lady had been startled and softened by the reality of mr underwoods illness and remorseful for having coddled her husband at his expense she had sent many enquiries some dainties and a good many recipes and she had made no objection to mr bevans frequent and affectionate visits nor even to his making it obvious that however little his senior curate might do that winter he would not accept his resignation for the present  it was enough to make mr underwood feel absolutely warm and grateful to his old tormentor as he rose not without some effort held out his hand to her and cheerily answered her inquiries for his cough she even discussed the berries in the hedges and the prospects of a mild winter in a friendly hesitating tone and actually commended mr underwoods last pupilteacher before she begani am afraid i am come upon a disagreeable business  mr underwood expected to hear of his own inefficiency or perhaps that mr audley had adopted some habit my lady disapproved or that the schoolmaster was misbehaving or that some christmas dole was to be curtailed and that he would have to announce it because mr bevan would not he was not prepared to hear are you aware thatin shortperhaps you can explain it but has not your son felix been spending a good deal of moneyfor him i meanlately  felix had a present from his godfather said mr underwood not at all moved so secure was he that this must be an exaggeration  last summer i heard of that it was laid out on a picnic said lady price severely  it was intended to be so spent said the curate but people were so goodnatured that very little actually went that way and the remainder was left in his own hands  yes mr underwood but i am afraid that remainder has been made to cover a good deal of which you do not know  mrs underwood flushed and would have started forward her husband looked at her with a reassuring smile my lady evidently angered at their blindness went on it is a painful duty mr underwood especially in your present state but i think it due to you as the father of a family to state what i have learned  thank you what is it  have you reckoned the number of times the chair has been hired and as he shook his head that alone would amount to more than a pound besides which your daughters have been provided with books and musicfruit has been boughtall amiable ways of spending money no doubt but the question is how was it procured  indeed said mr underwood still pausing  and added the lady the means can i am afraid be hardly doubted though possibly the boy may have done it in ignorance indeed one of his sisters allowed as much  what did she allow lady price  thatthat it was won at play mr underwood you know mr froggatt gives his boy an absurd amount of pocketmoney and when she was taxed with this your daughteralda is her name i believeallowed that  papa papa breathlessly broke out cherry who had been forgotten on her little sofa all this time but now dashed forward stumping impetuously with her crutchpapa its all alda how can she be so horrid  what is it my dear said mr underwood you can explain it i see tell lady price what you mean geraldine he added gravely to compose the child who was sobbing with excitement and indignation  o lady price she cried facing about with her hair over her face he earned ithe earned every bit of it how could any one think he did not  earned it what does that mean little girl said lady price still severely if he did the boys exercises for him  no no no interrupted geraldine it was old mr froggatt he asked felix to look over the papers he had to print for the boys work at the grammar school because it is all latin and greek and charles froggatt is so careless and inaccurate that he cant be trusted  the faces of the father and mother had entirely cleared but lady price coughed drily saying and you did not know of this arrangement  geraldines eyes began to twinkle with tears i dont know what felix will say to me for telling now she said  it must have come to light some time though concealment is always a proof of shame began lady price in a consoling tone that filled the little lame girl with a fresh passion drawing up her head  shame nobodys ashamed only mamma and felix and wilmet never will bear that papa should know how terribly we do want things sometimes  and geraldine overpowered by her own unguarded words ran into her mothers arms and hid her face on her shoulder  thank you lady price said mr underwood gravely i am glad my little girl has been able to satisfy you that felix has honestly earned whatever he may have spent  if you are satisfied returned the lady it is not my affair but i must say i should like to know of such transactions among my children  sometimes one is glad to have a boy to be perfectly trusted said mr underwood  but you will speak to him  certainly i shall  lady price felt that she must go and rose up with an endeavour to retract well it is a relief to mr bevan and me to find your son not consciously in fault for it would have been a most serious thing and in such a matter as this of course you can do as you please  to this mr underwood made no reply as none was necessary but only saw her out to the door in that extremely polite manner that always made her feel smallest and then he dropped into his chair again with a curl of the lip and the murmur not consciously  o papa papa cried cherry  dear felix said the mother with tears in her eyes but what can alda have been saying  cherry was about to speak again but her father gently put her aside a little quietness now if you please my dear and send felix to me when he comes in let me have him alone but dont say anything to him  there was no need to send felix to his father for he came in of his own accord radiant with a paper containing a report of a public meeting on church matters that his father had been wishing to see  thanks my boy said mr underwood where does this come from  from froggatts father it was only fourpence  but felix repeated fourpences must exhaust even that fortunatus purse of admiral chesters  felix coloured yes papa i wanted to tell you but i waited till you were better  you will hardly find a better time than the present said mr underwood  it is only this said felix with a little hesitation you know theres a good deal of printing to be done for the school sometimes the questions in latin and greek and algebra and even when mr ryder does have the proofs it wants some one who really understands to see that the corrections are properly done old smith used to do it by real force of chinese accuracy but he has been ill for some time and mr froggatt cant see to do it himself and charlie wont and cant be trusted either so one day when i was reading in the shop mr froggatt asked me to see if a thing was right and it went on he asked me after a time to take anything i liked and i did get some school books we all wanted but after that just when you were ill i could not help telling him i had rather have the money o father cried the boy struck by a certain look of distress did i do wrong  not in the least my boy go on what does he give you  exactly at the rate he gave smith for doing the same work said felix it always was an extra for being so troublesome it was seven shillings last weekgenerally it comes to three or four and sixpence  and when do you do it  i run in after i come out of school for half an hour last saturday i corrected a sheet of the pursuivant because mr froggatt had to go out and that made it more and father mr froggatt says that poor old smith will never be fit for work again  then i suppose these welcome earnings of yours will end when he has a successor  felix came nearer papa he said mr froggatt told me that if charlie would only have taken to the work he would have done without another man in smiths place and got him gradually into editing the paper too he said he wished i was not a gentlemans son for if i had not been so i should have suited him exactly and should be worth a guinea a week even now and father do not you really think i had better take it  you felix mr underwood was exceedingly startled for the moment  you see said felix rather grimly leaning his head on the mantelshelf and looking into the fire any other way i can only be an expense for years upon years even if i did get a scholarship  his face was crimson and his teeth set mr underwood lay back in his chair for some seconds then said in a low voice i see you know all about it felix and that i am going to leave you as heavy a burthen as ever lad took on willing shoulders  felix knew well enough but his father had never uttered a word of despondency to him before and he could only go on gazing steadfastly into the fire with an inarticulate moan  mr underwood opened the first leaf of a volume of st augustine beside him a relic of former days the family shield and motto withinnamely a cross potent or crutchshaped and the old english motto under wode under rode  under wood under rood he repeated it was once but singsong to me now what a sermon the load is the cross bear thy cross and thy cross will bear thee like little geraldines cross potentrod and rood cross and crutchall the same etymologically and veritably  dont call them a burthen pray said felix with a sense both of deprecation and of being unable to turn to the point  my boy i am afraid i was thinking more of myself than of you i am an ungrateful fool and when a crutch is offered to me i take hold of it as a log instead of a rood i did not know how much pride there was left in me till i found what a bitter pill this is  felix was more crimson than ever ought i not he began  the ought is not on your side felix it is not all folly i hope but i had thought you would have been a better parson than your father  there were tears in the boys eyes now there are the others i may be able to help them  and added mr underwood i know that to be a really poor priest there should be no one dependent on one or it becomes put me into one of the priests offices that i may eat a piece of bread it is lowering yes you are right  even suppose you could be educated by the time you were ordained you would still have half these poor children on your hands and it would only be my own story over again and beginning younger you are right felix but i never saw the possibility so fully before i am glad some inward doubt held me back from the impulse to dedicate my firstborn  it shall be one of the others instead said felix in his throat  mr underwood smiled a little and put his finger on the verse in his beloved epistlelook not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others  you really wish this do you consider what it involves he said  i think i do said felix in a stifled voice  this is not as if it were a great publisher continued mr underwood with whom there would be no loss of position or real society but a little bookseller in a country town is a mere tradesman and though a man like audley may take you up from time to time it will never be on an absolute equality and it will be more and more forgotten who you were you will have to live in yourself and your home depending on no one else  i can stand that said felix smiling father indeed i thought of all that of course i dont like it but i dont see how it is to be helped  sit down felix let us go over it again i suppose you dont know what our subsistence is at present  i know you have 250 pounds a year from mr bevan  yes i had 200 pounds at first and he added the 50 pounds when the third curate was given up that goes with me of course if not before on the other hand my poor good uncle the wisest thing he ever did made me insure my life for 5000 pounds so there will be 150 pounds a year to depend on besides what we had of our own only 2350 pounds left of it now i have had to break into it for the doctors bills but at least there are no debts thank god we have been saved from debt i think he continued that probably it will have to be brought down to twentytwo hundred before you have done with me on the whole then there will be about 180 pounds a year for you all to live upon are you understanding felix  for the boys anxious look had gone out of his face and given place to a stunned expression which was only dispelled with a sudden start by his fathers inquiry yes yes he said recalling himself  i have left it all absolutely to your mother said mr underwood she will depend more and more on you felix and i have made up my mind to expect that no help will come to you but from yourselves except that i hope some of you may be educated by clergy orphan schools but you are too old for that now felix i believe it may be right but it is very sore to break off your education  i shall try to keep it up said felix in case anything should ever turn up  a guinea a week said mr underwood thoughtfully it would make you all not much worse off than you are now when i am out of the way and yet a violent cough came on we must wait felix he said when he had recovered himself i must have time to think i will speak to you tomorrow  felix left him very grave and subdued he buried himself in his tasks for the next day hardly looked up or smiled at little bernards most earnest attempts at a game of play and had not a word for even cherry only when wilmet begged anxiously to know if he thought papa worse he answered that he believed not particularly so  alda was sent to carry some tea to her father that evening as she set it down on the table before him he said gently my dear i want to know what has been passing among you and your schoolfellows about felix  oh nothing papa said alda rather hastily some nonsense or other is always going on  very true no doubt nor do i wish to be informed of general nonsense but of that which concerns you what have you been saying or hearing said about felix  oh its nonsense papa some of the girls will say anything disagreeable  you need not have any scruples on felixs account alda i know exactly what he has done i want you to tell me what is being said or you have allowed to be saidabout it  that horrible miss price was all the answer be got  he sat uprightlaid on aldas wrist a long bony burning hand whose clasp she did not forget for weeks and forcing her to look at him said did you allow it to be believed that your brother felix was a gambler  papa i never said so cried alda beginning to sob  command yourself alda i am not fit for a scene and i may not be able to speak to you many times again  these wordsfar more new and startling to alda than to her brother appalled her into quietness  what did you say alda or was it the deceit of silence  she hung her head but spoke at last  i only said boys had ways and means they did tease and plague so i do believe carry price counts every grape that goes into this house and they would know how i got my new musicand little robina would telland then came something about mr froggatt and if they knew  if they knew what  papa you have no idea how nasty some of them are  my poor child i am afraid i have some idea by seeing how nasty they are making you gambling more creditable than honest labour  alda had it on the tip of her tongue to say winning things was not gambling but she knew that argument would be choked down and she also knew that though she had spoken truth as to her words she had allowed remarks to pass without protest on the luck and licence that the model boy allowed himself and she was bitterly displeased with the treachery of miss price  these old rags of folly dont look pretty on other folk he sighed pleasantly alda listen to me what i have heard today gives me more fears for you than for any one of my children  did you ever hear that false shame leads to true shame never shuffle again remember nothing is mean that is not sin and an acted falsehood like this is sin and shame bothwhile your brothers deed is an honour  alda was obliged to go away murmuring within herself thats all true it is very good of felix and i should not have equivocated i know but those stupid girls how is one to live with them  felix was not quite dressed the next morning when his mother came to the door of the attic that he shared with edgar and fulbert  he wants to speak to you before church felix it has been a very bad night and the sooner this is settled the better  o mother i am very sorry  it cant be helped my dear boy i think it will really be a great relief to him  and you mother do you mind  dear felix all minding except to have you all well and fed and clothed was worn out of me years ago i cant feel anything in it but that it will keep you by me my dear good helpful boy  felixs heart leapt up as it had not done for many a long day but it soon sank again the children had never been admitted to their fathers room in the early morning and felix thought he must be suddenly worse when he saw him in bed propped by pillows pale and wearied but the usual bright smile made him like himself  all right old fellow he said brightly dont come up to me im incog till im up and dressed are you in the same mind  yes father  then ask mr froggatt to do me the favour of coming to speak to me any time after eleven oclock that may suit him  i must understand what he offers you the nonsense is conquered felix more shame for me that it has followed me so far but the sense remains i must try to be sure that this sacrifice of yours is a right one to be accepted any way my boy i thank and bless you for it and god will bless such a beginning theres the bell be off he concluded  and papa blurted out felix suddenly would you please be photographed i have the money for it  pray  mr underwood smiled very well felix that is if i am ever capable of getting up all the stairs to colemans skyparlour  oh thank you and felix ran away  mr froggatt came in due time he was an elderly portly man well shaven and smoothfaced intensely respectable having been brought up to inherit an old hereditary business as bookseller stationer and publisher of a weekly local paper long before bexley had broken out into its present burning fever of furnaces he was a very good religious man as mr underwood well knew having been his great comforter through several family troubles which had left him and his wife alone with one surviving and woefully spoilt son who hated the trade and had set his heart upon being a farmerchiefly with a view to hunting mr froggatt was conscious of having been too indulgent but the mother and son were against him and the superior tone of education that the son had received at the reformed grammar school had only set him above the business instead of as had been intended rendering him more useful in it  good mr froggatt an oldfashioned tradesman with a profound feeling for a real gentleman was a good deal shocked at receiving mr underwoods message he kept a readingroom and was on terms of a certain intimacy with its frequenters such as had quite warranted his first requests for felixs goodnatured help and it had been really as a sort of jesting compliment that he had told the young gentleman that he wished he would take smiths place little expecting to see how earnestly the words were caught up how the boy asked whether he really meant it and when on further consideration he allowed that it might be possible begging him to wait till his father could be spoken to  poor as he was mr underwood had never lost general respect something there was in his fine presence and gentlemanly demeanour and still more in his showing no false shame making no pretensions and never having a debt doctors bills had pressed him heavily but he had sacrificed part of his small capital rather than not pay his way and thus no one guessed at the straits of the household mr froggatt had never supposed he would entertain for a moment the idea of letting his eldest son a fine clever and studious lad undertake a little country business and yet the old bookseller had come to wish it very much on his own account as he explained to mr underwood he loved his old business and knew that with more education he should have been able to make more of it his elder son had died just as intelligence and energy were opening up plans that would have made both the shop and the newspaper valuable and beneficial while charless desertion left them decline with his fathers declining years and in danger of being supplanted by some brisk new light felix underwood was indeed very young but he had already proved his power of usefulness and a very few years would make him capable of being a right hand to the old man and he might in time make a position for himself mr froggatt would otherwise ere long be forced by his own infirmity to dispose of the business at a disadvantage and this would he confessed go to his heart mr underwood felt greatly reconciled to the project there was real usefulness in the work great means of influencing men for good and though there would be much of mechanical employment for which it was a pity to give up the boys education yet it was a stepping stone to something better and it gave present and increasing means of maintenance there was less temptation in this way of life than in almost any that could be devised and it would give mrs underwood the comfort of a home with him the great difficulty for the future was that felix was never likely to have capital enough to purchase or become partner in the business but mr froggatt explained that if he gained experience in the editing of the pursuivant he would be always able to obtain profitable employment and that it was possible that he might eventually take the business and pay an annual sum out of the profits to the froggatt family unless indeed something should turn up which would keep him in his natural station such was the hope lurking in the fathers heart even while he thankfully closed with the offer and felix was put in the way of studying book keeping till the new year when he was to enter upon his duties and his salary  mr audley was greatly troubled it was with incredulous vivacity that he inquired of mr underwood if it were indeed true that felix had accepted such prospects  quite true said mr underwood you need not argue it with me audley my own mind has said all you could say seven times over  i should not venture on interference but could you not let me try to dosomething  and welcome my dear fellow there are so many to be done for that it is well one can do for himself  but felixfelix out of them all  as the voice i want to silence has said a thousand times no felix seems capable of this and it is not right to withhold him and throw his education upon the kind friends who might be helping the other boysboys whom i could not trust to fend for themselves and others as i can that dear lad  what he might be  who knows whether he may not be a greater blessing in this work than in that which we should have chosen for him he may be a leaven for goodamong the men we have never been able to reach my dear audley dont be a greater ass about it than i was at first  for the young curate really could not speak at first for a rush of emotion  it is not only for felixs sake said he smiling at last but the way you take it  and now i am going to ask you to do something for me added mr underwood i have left this magnificent estate of mine entirely to my wife appointing her sole guardian to my children but i have begun to think how much has been taken out of her by that shock of leaving vale leston and by that wonderful resolute patience that that i shall never be able to thank her for i scarcely dare to let her know that i see it and when i look on to the winter that is before her he added much less calmly i think she may not be long after me i must add a guardian once we had many good friends we have them still i hope but i cannot lay this on them our cousin tom underwood does not seem disposed to notice us and his care might not be of the right kind our only other relation is fulbert underwood  who drove you from vale leston  who did what he had every right to do with his own said mr underwood but he is not the style of man to be asked even if i could saddle him with the charge probably twelve children to bring up on seven thousand poundsa problem never put before us at cambridge  do you honour me by asked the younger man much agitated  not by asking you to solve that problem  but let me add your name what i want is a guardian who will not violently break up the home and disperse the children i believe felix will be a competent young head if he is allowed and i want you to be an elder brother to him and let him act  you cannot give me greater comfort  only audley this must be on one condition never let this guardianship interfere with any higher work that you may be called to if i thought it would bind you down to bexley or even to england i should refrain from this request as a temptation mind you are only asked to act in case the children should lose their mother and then only to enable felix to be what i believe he can and will be or as it may be right to add if he should fail them you will know what to do  i do not think he will  nor i but there are ways of failing besides the worst however i do not greatly fear this illness of mine taking root in them it has not been in the family before and i am nearly sure that i know when i took the infection four or five years ago from a poor man in smokejack alley who would let no one lift him but me they are healthy young things all but dear little cherry and i hope they have spirits to keep care from making them otherwise you will say a kind word to my little cherry sometimes audley poor little woman i am afraid it may fall sorely on her she is of rather too highly strung a composition and perhaps i have not acted so much for her good as my own pleasure in the companionship we have had together  so the will was altered though without the knowledge of anyone but mrs underwood and the witnesses and mr audley felt himself bound to remonstrate no further against felixs fate however much he might deplore it  nobody was so unhappy about it as edgar the boy was incredulous at first then hotly indignant then he got a burnt stick and after shutting himself up in his attic for an hour was found lying on the floor before an awful outline on the whitewash  what is it old fellow asked felix what a horrid mess  i see said lance it is friday grinning at the savages  or a scarecrow on the back of a ditch said felix come ed tell us what it is meant for  edgar was impenetrable but having watched the others out of the house he dragged geraldine up to seesomething  oh she cried youve done it  to be sure you know it  it is achilles on the rampart shouting at the trojans o edgarhow brave he lookshow his hair flies some day you will get him in his godlike beauty  do you think he has not got any of it cherry said edgar gazing wistfully i did see it all but it didnt come outand now  i see what you mean said cherry screwing up her eyes it is in him to be gloriousa kind of lightning look  yes yes thats what i meant all majesty and wrath but no strain o cherryto have such things in my head and not get them out dont you know what it is as he rolled and flung himself about  oh yes said cherry from her heart oh i should so like to do one touch to his face but hes so big you did him on a chair and i could not stand on one  ill lift you up ill hold you cried edgar  the passion for drawing must have been very strong in the two children for geraldine was most perilously and not without pain raised to a chair where with edgars arms round her waist she actually worked for ten minutes at achilles face but his arm she declined it is not right eddy lookthat muscle in his elbow can never be so  i cant see the back of mine but you can said edgar lifting her down and proceeding to take off his coat and roll up his shirt sleeve  thats the way oh but it is not such an angle as that  achilles muscles must have stood out more than mine you know ill get a look at blunderbores o cherry if i were but olderi know i couldid save felix from this horrible thing i feel to want to roar at old froggy like this fellow at the trojans  perhaps some day you will save him  yes but then he will have done it just fancy gerald if that picture was as it ought to beas you and i see it  it would be as grand as the world ever saw said the little girl gazing through her eyelashes at the dim strokes in the twilight o edgar many a great man has begun in a garret  if it would not be so long hence oh must you go down  i heard some one calling you will be a great artist i know edgar  it was pleasanter than the other criticism at bedtime  hollo man friday does not look quite so frightful said felix  im sure i wont have him over my bed said fulbert proceeding to rub him out and though for the moment achilles was saved by violent measures of edgars yet before the end of the next day fulbert and lance had made him black from head to foot all but the whites of his eyes and his teeth robina and angela had peeped in and emulated the terror of the trojans or the savages and sibby had fallen on the young gentleman for being so bold as to draw a frightful phooka upon their walls just to frighten the darlints indeed it was long before angela could be got past the door at night without shuddering although achilles had been obliterated by every possible method that felix clement or sibby could devise and some silent tears of cherry had bewailed the conclusion of this effort of high art the outline of which in more moderate proportions was cherished in that portfolio of hers  another work of artthe photographwas safely accomplished the photographer caught at the idea declaring that he had been so often asked for mr underwoods carte that he had often thought of begging to take it gratis and he not only insisted on so doing but he came down from his studio and took mr underwood in his own chair under his own windowproducing a likeness which at first sight shocked every one by its faithful record of the ravages of disease unlightened by the fair colouring and lustrous beaming eyes but which byandby grew upon the gazer as full of a certain majesty of unearthly beauty of countenance  the autumn was mild and mr underwood rallied in some measure so as sometimes even to get to church at midday services on warm days  it was on st andrews day that he was slowly walking home leaning on felixs arm with the two elder girls close behind him when alda suddenly touched wilmets arm exclaiming theres marilda underwood  there indeed was the apparition of centry park riding a pretty pony beside a large and heavilybearded personage the recognition was instantaneous marilda was speaking to her companion and at the same moment he drew up and exclaiming edward bless me was off his horse in a moment and was wringing those unsubstantial fingers in a crushing grasp there was not much to be seen of mr underwood for he was muffled up in a scarf to the very eyes but they looked out of their hollow caves clear blue and bright and smiling as ever and something like an answer came out of the middle of the folds  these yours  how dye dohow dye domary you dont get off till we come to the dooryes ill come in with you bless me bless me mary has been at me ever so many times about you but weve been had abroad for masters and trash and i left it till we were settled here  it was not many steps to the door and there wilmet flew on prepare her mother and the room while alda stood by as her cousin was assisted from her horse by the groom and the newcomer followed in silence while felix helped his father up the steps and unwound his wraps after which he turned round and with his own sunny look held out his hand saying how are you tom im glad to see youhow dye do mary alda we are old friendscall your mother one of you  the mother was at hand and they entered the drawingroom where as the clergyman sank back into his armchair the merchant gazed with increasing consternation at his wasted figure and features  how long has this been going on he asked pointing to him and turning to mrs underwood but as usual her husband answered for her  how long have i been on the sick list only since the end of september and i am better now than a month ago  better have you had advice  enough to know how useless it is  some trumpery union doctor ill have williams down before you are a day older  stay tom thank you most warmly but you see yourself the best advice in the world could tell us no more than we know already are you really master of old centry underwood i congratulate you  ay im glad the place should come back to the old name mrs underwood and myself both felt it a kind of duty otherwise it went against the grain with her and im afraid shell never take to the place twas that kept us abroad so long though not from want of wishes from mary and myself the girl fell in love with yours at first sight  to be sure i did said the young lady do let me see the little ones and your baby  take your cousin to see them in the diningroom alda said the mother the order that alda had been apprehending for the dining room was by many degrees more shabby than the drawingroom however she could only obey explaining by the way that little bernard being nearly two years old was hardly regarded as a baby now  wilmet was in effect making him and angela presentable as to the hands face hair and pinafore and appeared carrying the one and leading the other who never having closely inspected any one in a ridinghabit before hung back whispering to know whether that man was a woman  marilda was in raptures loving nothing so well as small children and very seldom enjoying such an opportunity as the present and the two babies had almost the whole of the conversation adapted to them till alda made an effort  so you have been on the continent  oh yes it was such a horrid bore mamma would go she said i must have french masters and more polish but i dont like french polish i hope im just as english as i was before  that is undeniable said felix laughing  didnt you care for it oh i should like it so much cried alda  like it what to hear french people chattering and gabbling all round one and be always scolded for not being like them there was a poor dog at the hotel that had been left behind by some english people and could not bear the french voices always snarled at them i was just like him and i got papa to buy him and bring him home and i always call him john bull  but wasnt it nice seeing places and churches and pictures asked geraldine  that was the most disgusting of all to be bothered with staring at the stupid things mamma with her murray standing still at them all and making me read it out just like a lesson and write it after which was worse and then the great bare shiny rooms with nothing to do the only thing i liked was looking at a jolly little old woman that sold hot chestnuts out in the street below such dear little children in round caps came to her just like thatendeavouring to convert her pockethandkerchief into the like headgear for robina  i have always so wanted to come here she continued only i am afraid mamma wont like the place she says its dull and theres no good society is there  i am sure we dont know said wilmet  lots of people are coming to stay with us for christmas added marilda and you must all of you come and have all the fun with us  oh thank you how charming cried alda if papa will but be well enough he is so much better now  he must come for change of air said marilda you cant think how pleased my father was to hear i had met you he talked all the way home of how clever your father was and how wickedly cousin fulbert at vale leston had served him and he promised me when i came here i should have you with me very often i would have written to tell you only i do so hate writing this is much better  marilda seemed to have perfectly established herself among them before the summons came to her and as the children herded to the door her father turned round and looked at the boys inquiringly there said mr underwood this is felix and this is edgar sixteen and fourteen  bless me what a number and as much alike as a flock of sheep again exclaimed the cousin one or two more or less would not make much oddseh edwardmary what kissing all rounddye know them allill look in tomorrow or next day and youll give me your answer edward  they were off and at mr underwoods sign felix followed him into the sittingroom to the great excitement of the exterior population who unanimously accepted aldas view that one of them was going to be adopted their notion was not so much out as such speculations generally are for mr underwood was no sooner alone with felix and his mother than he said you are in request felix heres another offer for one of youthe very thing i once missed what say you to a clerkship at kedge brothers  for one of us did you say father  yes the answer i am to give tomorrow is as to which you have the first choice  do you wish me to take it father  i wish you to think perhaps this is the last time i shall have any decision to make for you and i had rather you should make your own choice nor indeed am i sure of my own wishes  then said felix decidedly i am sure i had better not edgar would not and must not go to my work there would be nothing coming in for ever so long and it would be a shame to throw old froggy over  i rather expected this felix i told tom you were in a manner provided for but when he found you had a turn for business he was the more anxious to get you  ive got no turn that i know of said felix rather gloomily but we cant all of us set up for gentlemen and edgar is the one of us all that ought to have the very best such a fellow as he is he is sure of the prize this time you know i only dont think this good enough for him he ought to go to the university and maybe when mr underwood sees  not impossible said the sanguine father smiling and at any rate to get put in the way of prosperity early may make his talents available it is odd that his first name should be thomas besides i do not think your mother could get on without you and felix he lowered his voice i believe that this is providential not only as securing his maintenance but as taking him from ryder some things have turned up lately when he has been reading with me that have dismayed me do you know what i mean  a little said felix gravely  i know ryder would be too honourable consciously to meddle with a boys faith but the worst of it is he does not know what is meddling and he likes edgar and talks eagerly to him and the boy enjoys it  he does said felix but he knows enough to be on his guard there cant be any harm done  not yet not but what can be counteracted iffelix you cannot guess how much easier it makes it to me to go that edgar will not be left in ryders hands as to the younger ones such things do not come down to the lower forms and they will be eligible for clergy orphans audley spoke of a choristership for clement in the clergy house at whittingtonia was there ever such a raising up of friends and helpers i am glad to have seen tom underwood hearty kindly sure to be always a good friend to you all what did you think of the girl felix  she is a jolly sort of girl said felix not like ours you know father but not half a bad fellow  mr underwood smiled thoughtfully and asked have you seen enough of her to judge how she is brought up  it was treating his son so much more as a friend than as a boy that felix looked up surprised i should think her mother wanted to make her no end of a swell he said and that it would not take  mr underwood lent back thoughtfully in truth his cousin had in his outburst of affection and remorse at long unconscious neglect declared his intention of taking home one of the girls to be as a sister to his mary and then evidently bethinking himself of some influence at home had half taken back his words and talked of doing something bringing his wife to see about it etc  and when mr and mrs underwood were again alone they discussed the probabilities and considered whether if the offer were made they would accept it mr underwood had only seen his cousins wife once in his prosperous days when he had been at the wedding and his impression was not that of perfect refinement there was reason to think from the words of her husband and daughter that there was a good deal of the nouveau riche about her and mrs underwood did not know how to think of trusting a daughter in a worldly perhaps irreligious household but mr underwood was a good deal touched by his cousins warmth and regret he believed that the family kept up religious habits he thought that providence had brought him friends in this last hour and his affectionate sanguine spirit would not hesitate in accepting the kindness that provided for another of the children he was leaving she trusted him as sure to know best and after her usual mode said no more except wilmet would be safest there  you could spare her least  yes indeed it would be losing my right hand but poor alda  poor alda but consider if there is not worse evil in keeping her among girls who hurt her if they do not wilmet beauty and wounded vanity are dangerous in a place like this  dangerous anywhere  less so in a great house with that good honest mary alda and tom who will look after her in the main than here or as a governess with an inferior education  it may be so i know i can spare her better than her sister  wilmet is doing something for herself tooas alda cannot it seems justice settles the point dearest as it did between the boysthat is if we have the offer  perhaps the mother still had a lurking hope that the offer would not be made her instinct was to keep all her brood round her but silent and deferential woman that she was she said nothing and resolved to be thankful for what so eased her husbands mind  the handsome carriage tore up to the door and violet velvet and feathers descended mary alda sprang after and then came her father and hampers on hampers of game wine and fruits ensued while marilda seized on alda and turned of herself into the diningroom bearing a box of sweets where are the little ones little bobbie here and all the rest  not many calls were needful to bring a flock to share the feast with cries of joy but marilda was not yet satisfied  wheres the other of you she said to alda i dont know you well apart yet  wilmets in the kitchen thrust in lancelot ironing the collars for sunday  lance uttered alda indignantly  oh what fun i do let me go down and see i should so like to iron  but marildayour mamma  oh nonsense come along show me the way thats right robins only your hands are so sticky what down hereoh wilmet how dye do what delicious work do you always do it  generally if sibby is busy  do let me try  and she did try for ten minutes at the end of which the mothers voice was heard calling for edgar who turning crimson went upstairs leaving the others standing about the tidy kitchen fresh sanded for saturday  what not you said marilda pausing in her smoothing operations and looking at felix  no said he i have got my work  oh dont talk of it said alda i cant bear it i didnt think he was in earnest or that papa would let him  marilda turned full round what you wont go and be my fathers clerk and be one of kedge and underwood and make a fortune  felix shook his head  and what is your work instead  printing said felix stoutly it gives present payment and we cant do without it  both marildas hands seized on his i like you she said i wish i were you  they all laughed and felix coloured more abashed than pleased lanceto make up for his ignominious rescue at their last meeting performed a wonderful progress holding on by his fingers and toes along the ledge of the dresser and marilda setting her back a broad one against the ironingboard went on talking  and do you know what besides looking round and seeing they did not one of you girls is to come and live with me and be my sister i wanted to have this little darling angela to pet but mamma wouldnt have her and i did so beg for geraldine to let her have a sofa and a pony carriage i do want something to nurse but mamma wont hear of anybody but one of you two great ones to learn and do everything with me and thats not half the use  but is it really cried alda  yes indeed youll be had up for her to choose fromthat is if she can how exactly alike you are  she wont choose me said wilmet hark theres edgar coming down  edgar ran in with orders to the twins to go into the drawingroom wilmet hung back i will not be the one she said resolutely let alda go alone  no said felix it is what you are told that youve got to do now never mind about the rest let us all come out of this place and it was he who took off his sisters ironing apron as they went up to the diningroom together while marilda cried eagerly well edgar  well said edgar not in the enchanted voice she expected it is very good of your father and what must be must  dont you like it said marilda half hurt and edgar always a boy of ready courtesy answered yes yes im no end of grateful ill get rich and go abroad and buy pictures only i did hope to paint them  paint pictures cried marilda what rather than be a merchant do such stupid useless things only to bother people with having to stare at them when you could be making money  theres no reason one should not make money with pictures said edgar but id rather make delight but it cant be helped and i am very glad to have done with this stupid place  meantime wilmet and alda found themselves before a large florid muchdressed lady with a most goodnatured face who greeted them with good morning my dears just as marilda told me so much alike as to be quite romantic well no doubt it is a pity to separate between you but my marilda will be a true sister she has spoken of nothing else are you willing either of you my dears  ay chimed in mr thomas underwood well make you happy whichever it is you shall be in all respects like our own child mary would see to that if we didnt  as to choice said the lady theres none that i can seepretty genteel girls both that will do us credit unless it is their own fault excellent governess london mastersyou may be assured everything shall be done for her  shall we toss up which it shall be laughed her husband  no said mr underwood gently we think that this one laying his hand on aldas arm will value these advantages and is not quite such a homebird as her sister i hope you will find a grateful good child in alda mary and a kind sister to mary alda  the tears came into aldas eyes as her father seemed thus making her over a great rush of affection for all at home and contempt for mary alda in comparison with her own twin seemed to take away any elation as mr and mrs tom underwood kissed her and welcomed her and declared they should like to take her home at once  you shall have her soon said mr underwood let me keep her for christmas day  and for christmas day he did keep her though at the bottom of aldas heart there were strong hopes of invitations to join the festivities at centry underwood indeed such a party was insisted on by marilda one that was to include all the little ones and make them happier than ever they had been in their lives it was to be on twelfth day but mrs underwood hinted to the twins that they had better not talk to the younger ones about it for she scarcely believed they would go she had never before spoken out that conviction which had long crushed her down and wilmets whole soul seemed for the moment scared away by this fresh intimation of the condition in which their father stood while alda vehemently repeated the old declaration that he was better he said he was better alas such a better as it always was  how well you ought to be said mr audley one day at the reiteration better every day  yes and best of all at last was the reply with a sweet smile  for he was very happy the partial provision for the four eldest children two by their own exertions two through friends had evidently been received by him as an earnest of protection and aid for the rest even to the babe whom he scarcely expected ever to see in this world he said it would be ungrateful not to trust and he did trust with all his heart cheered as it was by the tardy cordiality of his cousin and the indefinable love of kindred that was thus gratified thomas underwood poured in good things of all kinds on the invalid and his house fulfilled his promise of calling in further advice and would have franked half the family to torquay nicemadeiraif the doctors had given the slightest encouragement it could be of little ultimate avail but the wine and soup did give support and refreshment bodily and produced much gratitude and thankfulness mentally besides lightening some of mrs underwoods present cares  no one was more anxious to help than mr ryder he had been assiduous in his inquiries and offers of service ever since the attack at michaelmas and it was evident that he really venerated the curate while he was a severe and contemptuous judge of the rector but when after a brilliant examination he became aware that he was to lose both the elder underwoods at once his mortification was great he came to call and mr underwood had again to undergo an expostulation on felixs prospects and an offer of keeping him free of expense the schoolfee was a mere trifle but mr ryder would willingly have boarded and lodged the boy himselffor the benefit of his authority as he said over younger boarders  i am afraid said mr underwood kind and grateful as usual that there are too many younger boarders here for felix to be spared no thank you i am sincerely obliged to you but the hard cash is a necessary consideration  and you can sacrifice such a boys prospects  bread and cheese must be earned even at the cost of prospects he cannot afford to wait to make his labour skilled  forgive me mr underwood but i cannot think it is right to throw away his abilities  you can allow that it is a less wrong than to leave the rest to debt or starvation  you should trust  i do trust but i can do so better when i humble what is nothing but pride and vanity in me after all i was foolish enough about it at first but i am quite content now that my boy should do his duty without being curious as to where it is to be done  you will tell me a schoolmasters vanity is concerned and i allow it is for i looked to your sons to raise the reputation of the school but perhaps it is only put off a little longer will you let me have clement or fulbert on the terms i proposed for felix  no ryder with many many thanks much feeling of your generous kindnessit cannot be  you do not trust me this was said with as much indignation as could be shown to a man in mr underwoods condition  no your very kindness would make the tone i regret in you more perilous do not think felix ungrateful ryder the desire is mine and remember it is that of a man who is dying and who really loves and values you greatly it is that the younger boys should as soon as may be go to schools where older systems prevail  mr ryder was exceedingly mortified and though he tried hard to conceal the full extent of his annoyance he could not help saying you know how i respect your motives but let me say that i doubt your finding any place where the ideas you deprecate are not to be found andpardon memay not the finding their progress obstructed by your scruples the more indispose your sons to them  i hope not said mr underwood calmly i hope it may show them how strong the approach of death makes that faithnay rather assurancewith which your party are tampering  you are not doing me justice mr underwood you know that my faith and hope are at the core the same as your own all our question is what outworks are untenable again he spoke hotly but mr underwoods gentleness seemed to silence him  and that there should be any such question provesalasthe utter difference between our belief ryder you are a young man and as i believe and trust verily in earnest and some day i think you will understand what faith is meantime your uncertainties are doing more mischief than you understandthey pervade all your teaching more than you know i dread what they may do to such as have not your moral sense to restrain them and bring them back as i prayi hope ever to prayit may be with you thank you for all your kindness actual and intended to my boys  then rising from his chair while mr ryder remained uncertain how to speak he signed to him to remain still while he sought in his bookcase and returned with a small old copy of jeremy taylors holy living and dying then sitting down again wrote the schoolmasters name in it above his own underwode underrode stamp keep it ryder i do not say that you will care for it now but some day i think you will and if i am allowed to know of it it will be joy  mr ryder could only wring the hand that held it out to him and with a great effort say thank you he saw that mr underwood was too much tired to prolong the conversation but he wrote a note of warm thanks that evening promising to do whatever lay in his power for the boys that their father would not think dangerous for them and he added that whatever he should for the future think or say such an example as he had now seen was a strong weight on its own side it was warmly and tenderly put and like everything that befell him gratified mr underwood  a very happy man he had been as he sincerely told those who would have grieved over him and not without some remorse  yes as he said to mr audley who watched him like a son it is indeed the lord who hath led me all my life through i never had a want or a care unfulfilled till nine years ago then just as i had become sluggish and mechanical in fixed habits of easy country work came this thorough change break and rousing i tell you i can never be thankful enough for the mercy not to leave them all provided for as the saying is would i go back to be such a priest as i was becoming happyyes i have been much happier here since no choice was left me but working up to my strength  and beyond it said mr audley sadly  if sowell so much the better he said it is a blessing to be allowed to be spent in that service and for the children i wish only for work and goodness for themand for that i may well trust my good master     chapter iv  twilight and dawn    two angels one of life and one of death  passed oer the village as the morning broke  the dawn was on their faces and beneath  the sombre houses capped with plumes of smoke                                          longfellow   dont ful  thats nothing to you clem  i say this wont do i must have some light  indeed ed we must not light a candle before five oclock  pish  oh please edgar dont stir the fire if you knew how few coals there are  stuff  no i wont have it done if wilmet says not and felix reared up in the gloom and struggled with his brother  felixedgaroh dont  hshsh now you girls are worse than all screaming in that way a few moments silence of shame it had been a weary long wet day a trial under any circumstances to eleven people under seventeen on the 4th of january and the more oppressive in st oswalds buildings because not only had their father been in a much more suffering state for some days past but their mother who had hoped to keep up for some weeks longer had for the last two days been quite unlike herself in the sickroom she was as tender and vigilant as ever in her silent way but towards her children a strange fretful impatience a jealousy of their coming near their father and an intolerance of the least interruption from them even for the most necessary cause moreover the one friend and helper who had never failed them before mr audley had not been seen since he had looked in before early service and altogether the wretchedness and perplexity of that day had been such that it was no wonder that even felix and wilmet had scarcely spirits or temper for the only task that seemed at present left them the hindering their juniors from making themselves obnoxious  wilmet do you think we shall go to the party at centry park reiterated fulbert  do hold your tongue about that i dont believe theres the least chance said alda fretfully  and i dont know how you can think of such a thing added cherry  i want to see cousin marildas christmas tree whined robina  do ask mamma again entreated another voice  i shall do no such thing said wilmet with absolute crossness in her tone  robina began to cry  come here bobbie said cherrys voice in the dark end of the room ill tell you a story  i know all cherrys stories and theyre rubbish said fulbert  this is quite a new one there was once a little matchgirl  bosh i know that little brute and i hate her broke in fulbert  hold your tongue said clement but  oh no dont let us have the matchgirl cried several voices  why cant you be good there was once an old giant that lived in a cave  i hate old giants said cherrys critical public and her voice grew melancholy  but this one had but one eye come do listen papa told me he was in an island but the voice grew mournful and was broken by a cry  oh fulbert hurt me  fulbert for shame what is it angel dear  i only laid hold of her pudding arm growled fulbert oh i say felix thats too bad  hold your row i say said felix after his application of fist law hollo whats that and he sprang to his feet with angela in his arms as the door was opened by a hand groping and mr audleys voice said darkness visible  there was a general scrambling up all over the floor and edgar rushed across to light a candle wilmet alone had not stirred as bernard lay asleep across her lap the flash of the match revealed a mass of light disordered heads and likewise a black figure in the doorway  here is a kind helper for you wilmet said mr audley from st faiths at dearport you must call her sister constance  wilmet did rise now in some consternation lifting her little brother whose hand was still in the locks the tangling of which had been his solace there was a sweet warm kiss on her brow and her lost net was picked up her hair coiled into it by a pair of ready tender hands but she faltered oh thank you does mamma know  she was there when i got a sort of consent from your father said mr audley  she has not said a word said alda half resentfully we have hardly been in all day except just to fetch and carry  never mind said the sister it is much better that she did not think about it now my dear dont i wont have anything done for me you dont know how we sisters sleep on nothing when we do sleep  but youll have some tea said alda the only smoothhaired one of the party  when you do perhaps thank you will you come to me my dear relieving felix from angela what is your name and the child though ordinarily very shy clung to her at once while she moving over to cherry found her in tears shook up her cushion arranged her rug and made her comfortable in a moment a sense came over them all that they had among them a head on whom they might rest their cares and as the black bonnet and veil were taken off and they saw a sweet fair motherly face beaming on them from the white plain bordered cap they gathered round with an outpouring of confidence small and great while mr audley went upstairs to announce what he had done he presently returned saying all right perhaps you had better come up at once  there they sat on either side of the hearth he pillowed up and in a dressinggown more entirely the sick man than he had ever before given up himself to be mrs underwood rose and with tears in her eyes mutely held out her hand while her husband at once recognised sister constance as lady herbert somerville the wife of the late rector of dearport he had last met her when some six or seven years before he had been invited to preach at festivals at dearport and had seen her the sunbeam of her house he knew that her husband who was a connection of mr audleys had since died of the same malady as his own and had left her a childless widow together with all else he had to leave to the sisterhood they had already founded in the seaport town but his greeting was this is very good in you but surely it must be too painful for you  the superior saw how much i wished it she said  you are like alexandrine de la ferronays he said remembering her love for tending a consumptive priest for her husbands sake  i am always wishing that i were she said  so they perfectly understood each other and poor mrs underwood who had in her new and extraordinary petulance fiercely resisted the doctors recommendation of a nurse found herself implicitly relying on and trusting sister constance with a wonderful sense of reliefa relief perhaps still greater to the patient himself who had silently endured more discomforts and made more exertions than she knew rather than tire her or vex her by employing even son or daughter and who was besides set free from some amount of anxiety  indeed the widow had too perfect a sympathy to interfere with the wifes only comfort when it could safely be done she left the two alone together and applied herself to winning the hearts and soothing the spirits of the poor children downstairs and suggesting and compounding new nourishing delicacies  she even persuaded mrs underwood to go to the next room for a nights rest while she sat up and learntwhat the silent wife had never told any onehow trying the nights were even to that spirit at first the patient liked to talk and drew out much of the hidden treasure of her spirit respecting her husband who though ailing for years had finally passed away with only the immediate warning of a weekthe final cause being harass from the difficulties from those above and below him that beset an earnest clergyman of his way of thinking  what struck her as it did all was mr underwoods perfect absence of all care and conviction that all the burthen was taken off his hands her own husband had as she could not help telling him found it hard to resign himself to leaving his plans half carried out to instruments which he had but half formed he had wished with all his might to live and though he had resigned himself dutifully it had been with a real struggle and a longing for continued service rather than rest a hope that he should more efficiently serve and much difficulty in refraining from laying all about him under injunctions for the future  mr underwood half smiled i am neither head nor principal he said plans have been over long ago i am only tired out too tired to think about what is to follow if i live three days longer i shall have just had my forty years in the wilderness and though it has blossomed like a rose i am glad to be near the rest  and then he asked for the midnight office and afterwards came fitful sleep half dreamy half broken by the wanderings of slight feverishness and great weakness but she thought her attendance would not be very brief and agreed mentally with what mr audley had told her that the doctor said that the end might yet be many weeks away when in the dark winters mornings the wife crept back again to her post and all that could be done in those early hours had been effected sister constance went to the halfpast seven oclock service with felix and clement imparting to them on the road that the superior of st faiths was expecting to receive some of the least of the children in the course of the day to remain there for the present  both boys declared it would be an infinite relief but they doubted exceedingly whether either father or mother would consent to lose sight of them since the former never failed to see each child and give it a smile and kiss if no more if they were to be sent felix supposed there was no one but himself to take them nobody with whom they would be happy could be spared nor did he show any repugnance to the notion of acting pere de famille to three babies on the railway  it was quickly settled mr underwood at once confessed the exceeding kindness and declared it to be much better for everybody do you not feel it so mother  she bent her head in assent as she did to all he said  having them back will be good for you he added persuasively and again she tried to give a look of response so they were brought robina angela and bernardand each stood for a moment on a chair at his bedside the two little ones he merely kissed and blessed but to robina he said a few more words about being good and minding mamma and felix  oh yes papa and theyll have a christmas tree and ill save all my bonbons to make your cough well  he watched wistfully as the bright heads passed out of sight and the long struggling cough and gasping that followed had all the pangs of parting to add to their burthen half the family escorted felix and his charge to the station and in the quiet that followed sister constance had a good sleep on wilmets bed as much she said as she ever required and she came from it all freshness and brightness making the dinnertime very charming to all the diminished party though wilmet felt greatly lost without the little ones and afterwards she earned the warmest gratitude from edgar and geraldine by looking over their drawings and giving them some valuable hints nay she even devised the new and delightful occupation of ship building for those three inconvenient subjects clement fulbert and lancelot upstairs or down all was gentle cheerfulness and patience wherever she went  felix came home about five oclock and his mother was persuaded to go to lie down while he amused his father with the account of the childrens exemplary behaviour and of their kind welcome at st faiths where he had been kept to dine feeling as he said uncommonly queer at first but at last deciding to the great diversion of his father that the sisters were a set of jolly old girls but not one equal to our sister constance then he had seen the church and was almost bewildered with the beauty of the decorations and mr underwood though saying little evidently much enjoyed his boys refreshment and pleasure he certainly seemed no worse and mr audley was allowed what he had often asked before to sit up with him  but there was much to render it a long anxious restless night of a sort of semiconsciousness and murmuring talk as if he fancied himself at vale leston again however when felix crept in about four oclock in the morning anxious at the sounds he heard he found him asleep and this lasted for two or three hours he woke refreshed and presently said epiphany put back the curtain that i may see the bright and morning star  the morning star was shining in the delicate dawn full in view and he looked at it with quiet pleasure mother he said then recollecting himself ah she is resting thank you audley  at that moment a little cry through the thin wall made him start and flush  is it so he murmured thank god that is well but his chest heaved grievously as he panted with anxiety and his two watchers hesitated what to do until the door was slightly opened and before the intended sign could be made to felix the breathless exclamation how what brought sibbys halfscared mournful countenance forward  how is she sibby dont fear to say he said more collectedly  nicely sir as well as can be expected but  the baby alivei heard  yes sir that iso sir it is two and it would be a mere mercy if they are taken as they look like to betwins and coming like this perhaps sibby was a little more lamentable because instead of looking shocked he clasped his hands in eager thanksgiving as he looked upwards  sister constance followed at the same moment saying in a far more encouraging voice she is doing very well  it is another great mercy he said much better than longer waiting on me will these twelfthday gifts live or do i take them with me at least let me baptize themnow at once he spoke earnestly my full twelve and one over and on twelfthday  sister constance had better hopes of the babes than sibby but this wish of his was one not to be withstood for a moment and she went to make ready while mr audley went down for the little parian font and felix and sibby arranged the pillows and coverings mr underwood looked very bright and thankful birthday gifts he said what are they you have not told me sibby  boy and girl sir she said poor little dears  jealous for your old twins sibby he said smiling  ah sir they came in a better time  better for them no doubt but this is the best for these he answered brightly see sibby cant you be thankful like me that your mistress is sheltered from what would try her i can bear it all better without her to see  sibbys only reply was a gush of tears and presently all was made ready geraldine was quietly helped into the room by edgar and placed in her usual station by the pillow and the boys stood against the wall while the two babes tiny and scarcely animate things were carried each by one of the elder pair and the father as whitely robed as if he had been in his surplice held out his hands and smiled with his kindly lips and clear shining blue eyes full of welcome  has your mother any wishes about names he asked wilmetwhat  no papa i think not but her eyes were brimming over with tears and it was plain that something was suppressed  my dear let me hear i am not to be hurt by such things  it isit is onlyshe did say when we came for them that we were the children of joythese are the children of sorrow murmured wilmet uttering the words with difficulty  i thought so he said then after a brief pause now audley  for mr audley said all the previous prayers though with a voice as hard to control as wilmets had been then wilmet held her charge close to her father for almost inappreciable as the weight was he could only venture to lay one arm round that grasshopper burthen as with his long thin fingers he dashed the water theodore benjamin i baptize thee alda brought the other stella eudora then the two hands were folded over his face and they all knelt round till he moved and smiled  give them to me again he said  it was for the fathers kiss and blessing now  they look lifelike he said you will keep them now mind me charge her never to think of them as children of sorrow but of joy she will remember how nearly you were called theodore felix take him as gods gift and minemay he be a son of your right hand to you  the boy did take the babe and with a deep resolve in his heart that his duty to these helpless ones should be his first thought on earth he did not speak it but his father saw the steadfast wistful gaze and it was enough  alda ventured to ask is eudora a gift too papa  yes a happy gift  for so she is let her be a little epiphany star to you all tell mother that i call them a double joy a double comfort poor little maid and he kissed her again will no one welcome her but the father who is leaving her  o papa you know how we will love them sobbed wilmet  i think i do my dear and he smoothed the glossy hair but with love comes joy you know  it is very hard now broke from the poor girl  very he said tenderly but it will if you make the burthen a blessingthe cross a crutcheh my cherry now a kiss and go i am tired  he was tired but not apparently worse  edgar and his three juniors started off directly after church in quest of ice where they might behold skating and practise sliding and wilmet with a view to quiet actually ventured on the extravagance of providing them with a shilling that they might forage for themselves instead of coming home to dinner  she regretted edgars absence however for when mr bevan came in to hold the epiphany feast in the sick chamber her father asked for edgar and geraldine and looked disappointed that the boy was gone but he murmured maybe it is best and when the little girl came in flushed and awestruck he took her hand and said may not i have this little onemy last pupilto share the feast with me willing and desirous he smiled as he held her and she coloured intensely with tears in her eyes  there could be no denial and his judgment at such a moment could only be accepted by the rector and the child herself durst not say one word of her alarm and awe papa knew and never could she forget that he held her hand all the time that she leantfor she could not kneelby his bed her elder brother and sisters were there too and he kissed and blessed each tenderly afterwards and sister constance too knelt and asked his blessing then he thanked mr bevan warmly and called it a most true day of brightness they heard him whispering to himself arise shine for thy light is come and the peaceful enjoyment seemed so to soothe him that he was not as usual eager to get up  it was only towards the early dusk that a restlessness came on and an increase of the distress and oppression of breath which he thought might be more bearable in his chair and mr audley who had just come in began with felix to dress him and prepare to move him but just as they were helping him towards the chair there was a sort of choke a gasping struggle his head fell on felixs shoulder the boy in terror managed to stretch out a hand and rang the bell but in that second felt that there was a strange convulsive shudder and  felix mr audleys low voice sounded strange and far away i do believe  the figure was entirely prone as they lifted it back to the bed they needed not the exclamation of sibby to reveal the truth it was only an exclamation it would have been a shriek if felix had not grasped her wrist with a peremptory grasp but that bell had been enough there had been a sound of dismay in the very tinkle and sister constance was in the doorway  felix she said understanding all you must go to her she heard she is calling you you cannot conceal it be as quick and quiet as you can she added as the stunned boy went past her only hearing and that as through a tempest the feeble voice calling his name he stood by the bedside his mother looked into his white face and held out her hands then as he bent down clasped both round his neck he trusted you she said  he sank on his knees as she relaxed her grasp and hid her head beneath the clothes a few holy words of commendation of the soul departed sounded from the other room then at sister constances touch of his hand he quitted the room  presently after felix was sitting in the large armchair in the diningroom with his sister geraldine on his lap his arms round her her arms tightly clasped round his neck her hair hanging loosely down over his shoulder her head against him his face over her as he rocked himself backwards and forwards with her each straining the other closer as though the mechanical action and motion could allay the pain the table was all over babythings which numerous neighbours had sent in on the first news of the twins that morning and which the girls had been inspecting but no one nothing else was to be seen when mr thomas underwood on his way from the station finding his knock unheard and the door ajar found his way to the room  what is this how is your father  felix raised his face still deeply flushed and rising placed his sister in the chair  what worse you dont say so said mr underwood advancing  he is gone said felix steadily but in an unnatural voice quite suddenly not very long ago he began but he felt unable to guess for what space of time he had been rocking cherry there  dead edward underwood bless me said mr underwood taking off his hat passing his hand over his forehead and standing horror struck i had no idea you never sent over to say he was worse  he was not it came on just now said felix holding by the mantelpiece  he groaned poor edward well and he was forced to put his handkerchief to his eyes he spoke more gently after that well this is a sudden thing but better than lingering on your poor mother would she like to see me  she was confined last night  bless me bless me what a state of things have you got any one to be with you  yes a lady from dearport said felix  humph which are you not my boy  no i am felix o poor edgar he added still bewildered  it was at this moment that trampling steps were heard making felix spring forward with an instinct to silence them but the threshold the sight of his face brought conviction to edgar and with a loud uncontrollable cry tired and hungry as he was he seemed to collapse into his brothers arms and fainted away  my poor boy exclaimed his cousin coming to felixs help and himself lifting edgar to the sofa of the other boys clement ran for water fulbert rushed out of sight and lancelot laid his head on a chair choking with tears  felix and clement were poor children used enough to illness to attend to their brother with a collectedness that amazed their cousin and without calling for help edgar came shuddering and trembling to himself and then burst into silent but agonising sobs very painful to witness he was alwaysboy as he wasthe most easily and entirely overthrown by anything that affected him strongly and mr thomas underwood was so much struck and touched by his exceeding grief especially now that he looked on him as his own property that after putting in some disjointed sentences of there thereyoull always have a father in medont my boyi tell you you are my son nowwhich to felixs mind made it more intolerable he said ill take him home nowit will be all the better for him and for every one poor lad so many  the three younger ones were sent to dearport yesterday said felix but edgar  to dearport eh to whom  the sisters said felix  a gruff sound followed come come my dear lad tis bad enough but ill do my best to make up to you it will be much the best way for you to come out of this he added glancing round the dreary fireless room which his entrance had reminded felix to darken  thank you began felix not in the least supposing edgar could go but now  it is not like a stranger added his relation be a sensible lad one out of the way is something under the circumstances staywhom can i see i will give orders for you he added  mr audley and sister constance are seeing about things thank you said felix ill fetch mr audley he added as another trying grunt at the other name fell on his ear and he put his arm round geraldine and helped her away  mr audley came having just parted with the doctor who had explained the sudden termination as what he had of late not thought improbable and further shown that it had been most merciful since there might otherwise have been weeks if not months of much severer suffering he had just looked in at the wife but she had hardly noticed him and he saw no dangerous symptoms about her except an almost torpid calmness  mr thomas underwood saw mr bevan and made it clearly understood that he made himself responsible for all expenses including mourning for the whole family he even offered to have the funeral at vale leston if it were only to shame fulbert underwood but the wife was in no state to be asked and the children shrank from the removal so it was decided that edward underwood should sleep among those for whom he had spent his life and where his childrens lot for the present would be cast  the cousin carried edgar back to centry with him the boy seemed too unhappy not to be restless and as if he were ready to do anything to leave his misery behind him  the others remained with their preparations and with such consolation as the exceeding sympathy and kindness of the whole town could afford them their mother remained in the same state except when roused by an effort and then there was an attention and presence of mind about her that gave anxiety lest excitement should be bringing feverishness but she always fell back into her usual state of silence such that it could be hardly told whether it were torpid or not  they looked out that halffinished comment on the epistle to the philippians it stopped at the wordsyea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all  mr audley took those words for his text on the sunday and not without breaking down more than once read as much of the comment as there was time for as the happyhearted message of the late pastor for whom indeed there were many tears shed it seemed to suit with that solemn peace and nobleness that seemed like the likeness of the resurrection face bringing back all the beauty of his countenance as he lay robed in his surplice with a thorny but brightfruited cross of holly on his breast when his children looked their last ere parting with what remained of that loved and loving father  poor little geraldine spent that worst hour of her life sitting by her mothers bed she had been helped by felix to that feast which had been spread for the mourners in the church in early morning but afterwards she was forced to remain at home while the whiterobed choir the brother clergy of all the neighbourhood and the greater part of the parish met their pastor for the last time in the church  there the first part of the service took place and thencherry could just fancy she could hear the dim echo of the dies irae as it was sung on the way to the cemetery it was a very aching heart poor child full of the dull agony of a longing that she knew could never be satisfied again the intense craving for her father  she missed him more really than any of them she had been so much his companion and she was the more solitary from the absence of edgar who had always been her chief partner in her pursuits his departure had seemed like a defection and yet she had reproached herself for so feeling it when he had run upstairs on arriving with mr underwood looking paler more scared and miserable than any of them and he was sobbing so much when he took his place in the procession that wilmet had made felix take alda that she might support him none of his mothers steady reserve and resolute stillness had descended to him he was all sensibility and nervousness and geraldine though without saying this to herself felt as if poor edgar might really have been nearly killed by the last few days of sadness he could bear depression so little she could hardly have gone through them but for sister constances kindness and that rocking process from felix which she and he called being his great baby and now when her mother looked up at her held out a hand and called her papas dear little cherry drawing her to lay her cheek by hers on the pillow there was much soothing in it though therewith the little girl felt a painful doubt and longing to know whether her mother knew what was passing and even while perfectly aware that she must not be talked to nor disturbed was half grieved half angry at her dropping off into a slumber and awakening only upon little stellas behalf those few words to geraldine had been the only sign that day of perception of any existence in the world save that of the twins  so the time went by and the little bustle of return was heard sister constance came in kissed geraldine and helped her down that she might be with edgar who was to return with the cousin whispering to her by the way that it had been very beautiful it was a day of bright sunshine high wind and scant sparkling feathery stars of snow that sat for a moment shining in their pure perfectness of regularity on the black and then vanished so like himself sister constance said  geraldine found her four elders and the three little boys all together in the diningroom and while wilmet anxiously asked after mother the others in a sort of sad elation told of the crowds present the number of clergymr ryder too came home from his holiday on purposethe sobbing people and the wreaths of camellias and of holly that loving hands had made and laid upon the coffin and then the last hymn had been so sweet and beautiful they all seemed refreshed and comforted except edgar who coming fresh back to the desolation of the house was in another paroxysm of grief  but edgar said alda timidly you like being there dont you  as if one could like anything now  well but eddy dear you know what i mean it is not bad being there  not so bad as being at home oh and a terrible fit of sobbing came on which made the other children stand round rather appalled while felix hesitating said  it is no good going on in this way edgar father would say it was not right and you are upsetting poor little cherry  it is worse for him because he has been away said cherry fondling him  yes said edgar between his sobs  it did not seem so there  and are they kind  oh yes marilda let me sit in the schoolroom and i had books and things to copy such an angel cherry ill bring it to you next timemy copy i mean  here there was a summons from the other room for felix  yes said edgar a good deal reinvigorated by having something to tell i suppose they are going to tell him what is settled mr underwood wrote to the man at vale leston and he wont do anything for us but they are going to try for the clergy orphan for one of you two little boys  oh there was a great gasp  and about me asked alda  you are to come when we all go to londonto meet us at the station theres a new governess coming and you will start both together with her and i think youll beat marilda for she knows nothing and wont learn  i hope she wont be jealous  i dont think it is in her shes very jolly  but i cant go till mamma is better  wilmet felt they were falling into a gossiping kind of way that jarred on her and was glad of a summons upstairs  mr thomas underwood saw alda before he returned home told her she was his other daughter and should join them on their way to london and he further made arrangements about the christening contingent of course on the mothers consent and on the possibility of taking the very small delicate babies to the church he made very extensive promises of patronage for the future with a full and open heart and looked as if he should like to adopt the whole family on the spot                                  for the

voice that to her reluctant ears as well as to those of sister constance who followed him sounded all the more vulgar because it was low wheedling and confidential you are always about the house you know everythingwhat accident has your mamma met with  cherrys face grew set  she has then said the doctor looking at sister constance i thought so now be a good child and tell us all about it  i cannot she said  come dont be silly and sulk no one will punish you we know it was an accident out with it  my dear said sister constance this is a pity much may depend on your speaking  cherry began to cry very piteously though still silently  yes yes we see you are sorry said mr rugg but theres nothing for it now but to let us hear the truth  she shook her head violently and brow and neck turned crimson  mr rugg grew angered and tried a sharper tone miss geraldine this is regular naughtiness let me hear directly  the flush became purple and something like i wont came from behind the handkerchief  leave her to me if you please said sister constance gently i think she will tell me what is right to be told  as you please lady somerville said mr rugg who since he had discovered her title was always barbarously misusing it but the thing must be told it is doing mrs underwood a serious injury to let childish naughtiness conceal the truth  constance put her arm round the little girl a tiny weight for thirteen years old and took her into the room where she had last seen her father  she was sobbing violently not without passion and the more distressingly because she carefully stifled every sound and the poor little frame seemed as if it would be rent to pieces cherry dear child dont said constance sitting down and gathering her into her arms do try and calm yourself and think  hehei wont tell him sobbed the child hes a bad manhe tells stories he said he would not hurt mewhen he knew he should most terribly papa said it was very wrong papa was quite angryhe called it deceiving he did i wont tell him  my dear child is there anything to tell dont think about him think about what is good for your mother  she told me not sobbed cherry but not with the anger there had been before no no dont ask me she told me not  your mother my dear little girl whatever it is you ought to say it your dear mother seems to be too ill and confused to recollect everything herself and if it is not known whether she has been hurt how can anything be done for her  cherry sat upon her friends lap and with a very heaving chest said if felix says i oughtthen i will papa said we should mind felix like him  i will call felix said sister constance  mr rugg looked very impatient of the delay but felix who had just come in to dinner was summoned he came at once and was soon standing by geraldines chair  yes geraldine i think you ought to tell he said as the loyal little thing gazed up at her new monarch what did happen  it was on the day after new years day said geraldine now speaking very fast you were all at church and she came out of this room with bernard in her armsand called to me that i might come and sit withhim because she was going down to the kitchen to make some beeftea and just then she put her foot into a loop of whipcord and fell she could not save herself at all because of bernard but she went backwardsagainst the steps  did she seem hurt at the time  i did not think so she pulled herself up by the baluster before i could get up to help her and she never let bernard go all the time he did not even scream she only said now mind cherry do not say one word of this to papa or anybody else and she told me she wasnt hurt oh was she really as the sister left the room  i wonder whose the string was said felix vindictively  oh never mind hell be so sorry oh i hope she wont be very much vexed at my telling  she will not mind now said felix it was only not to frighten papa  and felix had his little sister in that one position where she felt a sort of comfortlike a baby in his arms to be rockedwhen sister constance returned with the doctor he spoke without either the anger or the persuasive tone now and cherry could bear it better though she slipped off her brothers lap instantly and stood up in dignity  so your mamma told you to conceal this mishap that is some excuse now tell me how far did she fall  not more than four steps i am surei think three  and backwards  yes  do you think she struck her head  yes the back of it  ah and she spoke and moved at once not like one stunned  oh no not at all she got up and made the beeftea  the 2d of january that must have been about the time you began to observe that change of mannerthe irritability your sister remarked said the doctor turning to felix he nodded angry as he had been with alda for remarking it all that the doctor further said was that he must have another examination now that he knew a little more about the case and he went away with sister constance saying to her mrs underwood is a lady of wonderful fortitude and resolution and really they are the worst kind of patients  it was now more than a fortnight since that 6th of january which saw the birth of the twins and the death of their father and mrs underwood still lay quiet and almost torpid in her bed seldom speaking hardly ever originating anything and apparently taking no interest whatsoever in anything outside her room and yet there was no symptom unfavourable to her recovery to be detected within the last day or two they had tried to rouse her papers had been brought to her to sign and she did so obediently but she did not follow the subject she did not refuse but did not second any proposal for her beginning to sit up and this was the more remarkable as being a woman of much health and energy in her quiet way she had always recovered rapidly and filled her place in the family alarmingly soon the nurse had begun to suspect that besides the torpor of mind there was some weakness of limb and with the new lights acquired mr rugg had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that there was a slight concussion of the spine causing excitement at first and now more serious consequences and though he did not apprehend present danger he thought complete recovery very doubtful  so they are almost worse than orphans said sister constance when the curate went down from reading to the invalid and she could tell him the verdict  do they know  the fact there is no need to lay the future on the shoulders of the present  a very dark present i feel as if a great bright sun warming and invigorating had gone out of my life yet i knew him but two years  i can understand it though i knew him but two days  i hope he may have been the making of me sighed mr audley he ought to be  i think he has been said she smiling there is some difference between you and the boyish young deacon that came here two years ago  who thought life without shooting barely endurable by the help of croquet i trust so he was very patient and tolerantmade holidays for me that first summer which it cuts me to recollect  to live and share in a great sorrow does make a great step in life said constance thoughtfully looking at the much graver and more earnest brow of her husbands young cousin and you were a comfort to them all as no one else could be  must you go he said i wanted to consult you i am thinking of giving up my present lodgings to this mowbray smith who is coming as curate and coming here  here my dear charles  i thought i had heard legends of twelve foot square  not with thirteen children besides we were seasoned  stay you dont understand there are three rooms on this floor poor mrs underwood will hardly want to occupy these two just yet i take them and put in some furniturelive to myself but let them board and lodge me they may as well have what is to be made by it as any one else  but can they and forgive me charles are you prepared for the cookery here really some of those children have appetites so small that i cant bear to see them at dinner  thats the very point they all say the invaluable sibby is as good a nurse as she is bad as a cook now if they have no help wilmet must stay at home to look after her mother and the twins and that is not fit for such a young girl now my coming might enable them to get some one who knows the use of meat and fires and would send upstairs the only woman who would undertake such a charge as that must be  i dont like to say a word against it it seems excellent for them  i would not live with them but i should be there to help i could keep felix up in his latin and  only one suggestion more charles if you do not stay here long  wellif not every week i am here is so much tided over and just at this time the charge must be heaviest those boys may be disposed of after a time  i wish we could keep those two little girls at st faiths but there is no place yet for children of their class i am wanted there this day week and i cannot say but that i shall be glad to leave you here only i recollect your mothers feelings  mothers must draw in the horns of their feelings when their sons are ordained he said laughing i shall consult that notable person wilmet  wilmet started and blushed with pleasure it would be so much less dreary and poor girl she was feeling as if she were half rent asunder at the thought of aldas going so good for felix too only she must ask mamma and she did ask mamma and to her great pleasure mrs underwood listened and said it is very kind  and shall it be mamma  i shall like for you to have some one in the house yes my dear i think then she paused my dear you and sibby and sister constance had better talk it over i do not seem able to consider it but sister constance will tell you my dear wilmet i am afraid you must have a great deal laid on you  oh never mind mamma i like doing things besides you are so much better  ill try to help you more added mrs underwood wistfully which room did you say  and she listened and even made a few suggestions as wilmet explained how she thought of making a sittingroom upstairs and giving the two downstairs front ones to mr audley using the back room for the boys and children she was altogether so much more open to comprehension and ready to speak that wilmet was full of hope and assurance that she was really mending  when sister constance came in the readiness to converse continued she consulted her friend on the scheme and its expedience for mr audley saying that she feared he would be uncomfortable but she could not reject so great a help for her children she had even thought of the advantage of keeping sibby upstairs to attend on the babies and herselfwork not fit to rest entirely on wilmet though the good girl had fully counted on giving up her work at school  it was evident that the examination by the doctor and wilmets consultation had thoroughly roused her and she was as clearheaded as ever indeed it seemed to sister constance that she was a little excited and in that mood in which the most silent and reserved people suddenly become the most unreserved  she was asked at last what mr rugg thought of her and sister constance in reply asked whether she remembered her accident she thought a little whyyesi believe i did slip on the stairs but it did not hurt me and i forgot it does he think anything of it  i think he fears you gave yourself a shock  not unlikely she said in an indifferent tone and did not speak again for some minutes then said yes i see i am thankful it did not tell on me sooner and her look brought the tears into constances eyes  it told more than you did said constance endeavouring at a smile  not on the babies she said and he never knew it so there is no harm done thank god  she lay a little longer and constance thought her going into her usual state of torpor but she roused herself to say would you kindly look into that desk you will find a green book  yes  please tear out the leaves and burn it for me i would not have one of the children see it on any account  constance began to obey and saw that it was a diary are you sure it ought to be done she asked might it not be better to wait till you are better  i cannot tell that i shall be much less helpless i know how things like this go she said  constance was still reluctant and mrs underwood added i will tell you it is nothing good i assure you when we drove from the door at vale leston the home of all our lives he turned to me and said now mary that page is shut for ever let us never speak a word to make the children or ourselves feel turned out of paradise and i never did but oh i wrote it there are pages on pages of repinings therei could not let them see it  nay but you were resigned  resigned what of that i held my tongue it was all i could do i never knew things could be worse till i saw it was killing him and then all i could do was still to keep silence  there was an agony in her voice that constance had never heard there before  silence was no doubtas things werean exceeding kindness to him said constance and one that must have cost you much  onceonce so tenderly with tears in his eyes he did beg me as a favour not to complain or talk of fulbert underwood i did not but i never could be the companion i was before to him he was always happy he did believe me so but i could often only smile if i talked it could only have been of his health and our cares  you kept him happy by taking the weight so entirely to yourself  perhaps if he had only known how miserable it made me we might have moved to a healthier place but after that one time i never could vex him or trust myself to hear him console me and grieve for me was worst of all  constance began to see how the whole woman brought up to affluence had been suddenly crushed by the change and almost the more so for her husbands high and cheerful resolution which had forced back her feelings into herself her powers had barely sufficed for the cares of her household and her numerous family and her endurance had consisted in suffering and being still no murmur had escaped but only by force of silence she had not weakened his energies by word or look of repining but while his physical life was worn out by toil and hardship her mental life had almost been extinguished in care drudgery and selfcontrol and all his sweetness tenderness and cheerfulness had not been able to do more than just to enable her to hold out without manifesting her suffering enid had been a very suitable name for her though without a geraint in any respect to blame for what she underwent she had borne all in the same silent and almost hopeless spirit and with the same unfailing calm temper but outside her own house she had never loved nor taken real interest in anything since the day she drove from the door of vale leston she had merely forced herself to seem to do so rather than disappoint her eager husband and children  and now how much of her torpor had been collapse how much the effect of the accident could not be guessed she herself was greatly roused for the present dwelt on the necessity of trying to get up the next day and was altogether in a state excitable enough to make the sister anxious  other troubles too there were that evening which made all feel that even though mr audley was to live to himself his presence in the house would be no small comfort  fulbert never the most manageable of the party had procured a piece of wood from the goodnatured carpenter and was making a sparrow trap on an improved plan when wilmet impatient to have the room clear for mr audley to come for the final decisionas he was to do in the eveninganxious to clear away the intolerable litter and with more anxiety for fulberts holiday task than for the sparrows ordered him to bed ten minutes too early and in too peremptory a tone  fulbert did not stir  fulbert i say clear up that litter and go to bed  dont you hear fulbert said felix looking up from his book  fulbert gave a pull to the newspaper that was spread under his works on the table and sent all his chips and sawdust on the ground  o fulbert how naughty broke out alda  fulbert are you going to mind asked wilmet please remember  i shall go in proper time growled fulbert  that is not the way to speak to your sister interposed felix with authority  fulbert eyed him defiantly all over  felix rose up from his chair full of wrath and indignation there was quite difference enough in their size and strength to give him the complete mastery for fulbert was only ten years old but wilmet dreading nothing so much as a scuffle and outcry sprang up imploring o felix remember mamma is wide awake tonight let him alonepray let him alone  felix was thoroughly angry and kept his hands off with exceeding difficulty little sneak he said he chooses to take advantage  he always was a sneak his nose is the shape of it said edgar  as felix and wilmet had the sense to let this amiable observation drop edgar contented himself with making some physiognomical outlines of sneaks noses on a slate and silence prevailed till the church clock struck the halfhour when clement got up and taking the slate where he had been solacing himself with imitating edgars caricatures he was about to make it an impromptu dustpan and went down on his knees to sweep up fulberts malicious litter but was rewarded with a vicious kick on the cheek it was under the table out of sight and clement like a true son of his mother made no sign but went off to bed like a spartan  fulbert said lance rising to follow his example it is time now  he still sat on and felix in intolerable wrath and vexation found himself making such deep bites into a pencil that he threw it from him with shame just as mr audleys bell sounded and he ran down to let him in  now ful said wilmet coaxingly please goor mr audley will see  let him  mr audley was there in a moment and the next alda in all the ruffle of offended dignity was telling him that fulbert was in one of his tempers and would attend to nobody fulberts back looked it it evidently intended to remain in that obstinate curve till midnight  i am sorry said mr audley i thought no one would have added to the distress of the house what is it fulbert he added laying his hand on his shoulder and signing to alda to hold her peace  they bother said fulbert in the sulky tone but still as he regarded the newcomer as less of an enemy than the restid have gone at halfpast eight if they would let a fellow alone  then the fellow had better give them no right to bother said mr audley come fulbert no ship can sail unless the crew obey no mutiny heres your captain ready to shake hands and wish you good night  fulbert could not face mr audleys determined look but he was not conquered he took up his tools and his trap gave a final puff to spread his sawdust farther and marched off without a single good night  he has the worst temper of us all cried alda  you should be very cautious of provoking him said mr audley  i am afraid it was my fault sighed wilmet  nonsense said felix he is an obstinate little dog i wish i was licking him i hope he is not pitching into clem  clem is the biggest said alda  yes but he is much the meekest added wilmet  tinas meek sauce is aggravation itself observed edgar i should hope he was catching it  he is certainly not slow to put in his oar said mr audley did you hear of his performance in the vestry the other day  no i hope he did not make an unusual ass of himself said felix  he and mowbray smith had last tuesdays evensong nearly to themselves when master clem not only assisted smith in putting on his hood but expressed his doubts as to the correctness of it never of course having seen any bachelors but oxford or cambridge and further gave him some good advice as to his manner of intoning  i hope he wont go on in that way at st matthews exclaimed wilmet  it is lucky he is going so soon said mr audley i doubt if mowbray smith will ever get over it  regular snob that he is said edgar just one of my ladys sort what did he do go crying to her  o edgar remonstrated wilmet  well mettie if even our spiritual pastors will be snobs one must have the relief of expressing ones opinion now and then  i should say it was better to keep any such fact out of ones mind as much as might be said mr audley feeling himself unable to deny what had been so broadly expressed  and we at any rate had better drop talking of snobs said felix  hollo felix i am sure you for one would not be a snob if you had turned chimneysweeper and let tom underwood nail me to his office hell never make one of me  i trust so said felix but it is not the way to keep from it to throw about the word at other folks  whats that cried alda really that boy must be falling upon some of them  it was lance in great deshabille who opening a crack of the door called cautiously wilmet please come here  wilmet hastily obeyed saying anxiously as the door was shut never mind dear lance hes in a horrid mood but do bear it and not make felix more in a rage  bosh about ful said lance unceremoniously it is cherry she is crying so upstairs and clem and i cant get a word out of her  cherry though older than the boys had to precede them in vanishing for the night as her undressing was a long operation dependent upon sibby wilmet ran up in haste and did indeed find poor little geraldine with her face smothered under the clothes in an agony of weeping very serious for so frail a little creature  cherry cherry dear dont are you feeling solitary are you missing him oh dont yes dear tis so sad but we all do love you so  wilmet would have kissed and fondled her but the child almost thrust her away  not that oh not that i wish it was  my dear cherry you cant have been naughty  yes yes indeed i have and now  i cant thinko cherry if you would only tell me what you mean cried wilmet aghast  and with agonised sobs cherry whispered mr ruggo mettiesuch things as i said about him to sister constancei made sure i had forgivenlong agoand nownow after that  if wilmet had not known how deeply both geraldine and her father had resented what mr rugg had meant as a little friendly gloss to save terror before a painful operation she would have been utterly at a loss and now she found herself incapable by any argument or caress of soothing her sisters sense of heinous offence for that rite of which she had partaken with her father had required charity with all men and now she found she had been deceitfulshe hated mr rugg all the time oh what should she do how could she be so wicked  wilmet tried to tell her that she had not known how it was at the time but this seemed no comfort and it was plain that that days solemnity had lessened the inequality between the two girls so much that for wilmet to console her as a child was vain and indeed her invalid state and constant companionship with her father had rendered her religions feeling much more excitable and more developed than were as yet wilmets and meantime this piteous sobbing and weeping was doing great bodily harm  wilmet at last hearing a door open as if the nurse were taking sister constances place ran down to take counsel with that kind friend on the way she whispered her trouble on the stairs and the sister was soon kneeling over the little bed but her comfort was not persuading the child to think less of the fault but promising that she should tell all to mr audley tomorrow  nay seeing that even this was too long hence for the weary soul and burdened sore to look forward toindeed that the preparation for the interview would be sleepdestroyingshe said then you shall see him at once my dear  wilmet opened her eyes in dismay that little attic bare of all but beds was her thought but sister constance ever an effective woman had the little black frock the shoes and stockings on in no time and throwing a shawl over all actually gathered the small light frame up into her arms and carried her down to the fire in the room now vacated by the nurses and babies and there she fetched mr audley to her it will not do she whispered on the way to wilmet to treat her as a child now  he always made so much of her sighed wilmet  yes and now she is a communicant  they left her to mr audley and presently when the door opened again it was he who was carrying her upstairs again and when sister constance had taken possession of her she whispered yes thank you he says i may come on sunday and i think it is forgiven i shall say a prayer about charity always now and with a deep sigh the wornout little penitent lay down to her sleep  o mr audley it is plain we cannot do without you sighed wilmet as she came down not without tears in her eyes  and then came the conference upon ways and means rooms and attendance mr audley had parted with his horse and groom in the autumn observing that they ate their heads off and the terms he now proposed for lodging board and attendance were what felix and wilmet would have known to be wondrously liberal but for their inexperience especially as he meant to send in some at least of the furniture he was to have his meals at his own times in his sittingroom and sister constance had a person in her eye at dearport who was likely to do well in the kitchen and not quarrel with sibby  wilmet had made up her mind that she must remain at home all day and had even told miss pearson so but that good lady had refused to accept her resignation and had come to mr bevan about it and now both the sister and the curate united in telling her that she ought not as long as it was possible to give up this means of improving herself as well as lessening the family burthen to give up her education now would be to sink into a housewifely drudge who would hardly be able to maintain herself when the younger ones would be getting out into the world and as geraldine must stay at home to be a companion to her mother there was no need for her being also always in attendance while sibby was equal to the charge indeed mrs underwood herself had said something that showed her to contemplate wilmets remaining at school  you must said felix decidedly why you might as well turn nurserygirl at once  i should like it said wilmet i shall be miserable at school always thinking something is going wrong and cherry can never bear with the babies oh please dont tell me i must  i tell you to begin said sister constance you can always give it up if you feel that the need lies at home but i think the few hours change every dayfor dutys sake mindwill give you vigour not to be worn down by the home cares  but cherry will have them always she who cares for books and drawing so much more than i  yes but if you go on learning you can teach her said sister constance  oh cried wilmet cherry knows more than i do  little cherry is the cleverest of us all added felix  still said the sister the mere going over your work with you will give her change and interest i do feel strongly convinced dear wilmet that to shut yourself up with her without gathering anything from elsewhere would be very bad for both  we must see how mamma is and how cherry gets on was all that wilmet would say but the arrangement was made and was to take effect in ten days time when mr mowbray smith was coming to be second curate and sister constance must change places with the three absent children and alda would be gone to her adopted home  then mr audley took leave and as felix went to the front door with him he said forgive me felix but i am a younger brother myself and i do hope you do not mean to assert your authority by licking  felix coloured a little and though he spoke respectfully it was with some little annoyance there is nothing else that does with fulbert  stay felix i am not questioning that he may be the sort of boy for whom flogging may be good from some one  he is said felix he never will behave himself till he has felt his master it has been so at school and once even my father made himself quite ill for a week with having to flog fulbert for disobedience it settled him but he is not like the othersclem and lance are not any trouble buti know it will come to it sooner or later ful will never mind me or wilmet till i have done it once  and when his strength is equal to yours  then i hope he will have more sense  yes felix but what if by forcing him into dogged submission by your bodily strength you have lost his confidence and have no moral power over him things that can be borne from a father come very differently from a brother  felix was quite crimson now but what shall i do mr audley when he defies wilmet and teases cherry and the little ones  try all you can with his better sense but dont anger him by tones of authority what you think needful rule may seem to him domineering and if necessary call me my blows will not leave the after rankling that yours will even if they are necessary  felix sighed he was not desirous of beating his brother in the main but being unhappily master of the house he was unwilling not to be so entirely he wished mr audley goodnight not in his most perfectly cordial tone  however the next morning he had brought himself to thank mr audley  thank you felix said the curate it is a great relief to me i was afraid you thought you were going to bring a meddling fellow in upon you  felix coloured and with an effortfor which mr audley liked him the bettersaid i know i shall always deserve what advice you give me and i hope another time i may take it better than the last  soon after one train carried away four of the young underwoods to begin life elsewhere the thomas underwoods had desired that alda and edgar should meet them at the station and at felixs entreaty had also undertaken to convoy clement who thanks to mr audley was to be a chorister and live in the clergyhouse at st matthews whittingtonia it would have been fulbert only unluckily he had no ear and so he was left at home while lady price mrs thomas underwood and all the ladies they could enlist in their service canvassed desperately and made the cards of fulbert james and lancelot oswald sons of the rev edward fulbert underwood thirteen children a weariness to every friend of a subscriber to clergy orphan schools robina was not quite old enough to stand for the like election but sister constance had negotiated with a lady who had devoted herself to educating children of better birth than means and the little girl was to be dropped at the nearest station to her school at catsacre it had all been settled in a wonderfully short time by sister constance and mr audley with full though helpless acquiescence from mrs underwood they felt it well to lessen the crowd of children in the house and the responsibilities of the elder ones and acted at once  as to alda she was too miserable at home not to be ready to follow edgar though she had at first implored to stay and help wilmet till their mother was about again but the thomas underwoods were unwilling to consent to thisand after all alda was more apt to cry than to be of much real use sister constance saw that she was only another weight on her sisters hands and that terrible as the wrench would be between the twins wilmet would be freer when it was once over poor wilmet she had felt as if she could hardly have lived over these weeks save for fondling the younger twins and waiting on her mother she was almost passive and ran up and downstairs or prepared the wardrobes of the departing children just as she was bidden all in one quiet maze of grief the tears seemed to be always in her eyes very often dropping and yet they never hindered her and she never uttered a word of deprecation or complaint only she could not eat and a kiss would bring down a whole shower and at night the two sisters would hold each other tight and cry and kiss themselves to sleep  so had come the last daythe last for all four robina who had only just come back from st faiths was grave puzzled and awestruck clinging chiefly to lancelot and exchanging confidences in corners with him in which they were probably much less childish than they showed themselves to the outer world clement was very grave and unhappy but seemed to be most distressed at parting with harry lamb a favourite schoolfellow of his own quiet stamp with whom he spent all available time alda and wilmet were hand in hand at every possible moment and if possible cheek to cheekeach felt as if herself was cut in two  then edgar who had only come home for that farewell sunday had another of his paroxysms of sorrow at the changes at home which he contrived to forget when at centry all that was becoming in a manner usual to the others was a shock to him and he was so very miserable the whole day that he treated every attempt of the others to cheer him as a mere token of their hardness of heart he went in to see his mother and was so overcome at finding her no better that he rushed away and threw himself on a sofa as if he was going to faint and when at church he saw his fathers place filled up he fell into such a fit of sobbing that half a dozen smellingbottles were handed across the seats  however he had recovered himself on monday morning and made it his particular request that nobody would come bothering to the station to make them look like fulberts canvassingcard of the thirteen childrenand as the mention of it always affronted fulbert deeply it was plain that he would be no good company however felix had been allowed an hour from his business for that very purpose and he simply said nonsense edgar i shall take robin down wilmet submitted though with a great pang she had no assurance that she should not break down and a crying match at the stationoh no it might make bobbie roar all the way  so alda clung round her neck and geraldines in their own little parlour and wished her mother goodbye scarcely knowing whether it were with a full understanding how many were parted from the wing that now seemed unable to shelter them and then wilmet went up and quietly lay down by her mother on her bed feeling as if there was nothing she cared for in all life and as if youth hope and happiness were gone away from her for ever and she were as much widowed as her mother she was even past cryingshe could do nothing but lie still but then her mothers hand came out and stroked her and presently one of the babies cried and wilmet was walking up and down the room with it and all activity with her outward senses though her heart felt dead meantime the luggage went in the omnibus the four children walked up together only escorted by felix and were passed on their way by the prancing and thundering carriage from centry  but the sense of usefulness that came gave strength and energy to felix and wilmet underwood as the first excitement passed away and they better understood their tasks  of the absent ones they heard good accounts alda was altogether one with her cousins family and seemed to be completely on an equality with marilda and edgar had been sent by thomas underwood to acquire modern languages under the care of an englishman who took private pupils at louvaine whence edgar despatched most amusing letters and clever sketches clement was in great favour both musically and morally at st matthews and little robina was reported to have bewailed her home with floods of nightly tears but to have soon settled down into the bonnie little pet of the elder girls  except for the separation the cloud had hardly fallen on these but their departure had made a great hole in the hitherto unbroken family and while felix and wilmet by the loss of their contemporaries seemed placed at a point far away from the others geraldine was conscious of much loneliness the twins had always consorted together and regarded her as a mere child and her chief companions had been her father and edgar so that she seemed left at an equal distance both from the elder and younger party  then the world around her was so busy and she could do so little she slept in a little inner room beyond the large nursery where wilmet kept guard over angela and bernard and long before six oclock she always heard the call pass between the eldest brother and sister and knew that as soon as he was dressed felixit must outwas cleaning the family boots including those of the lodger who probably supposed that nature did it and never knew how much his young landlord had done before joining him in his early walk to st oswalds  meantime wilmet conducted the toilette of the two little children and gave the assistance that cherry needed as well as discharging some of the lighter tasks of the housemaid leaving the heavier ones to sibby and martha a stout willing strong young woman whom sister constance had happily found for them and who was disqualified by a loutish manner and horrible squint from the places to which her capabilities might have raised her  then wilmet helped her sister downstairs and a visit was paid to the mother and the twins who were sibbys charge for the night mrs underwood was still in the same state it was indeed possible to rouse her but at the expense of much suffering and excitement and in general she was merely tender placid and content mechanically busied about her babies and responding to what was said but entirely incapable of any exertion of body and as inactive in mind as in limb wilmet attended to her while sibby went to her breakfast returning with that of her mistress in time to send wilmet down to preside at the family meal a genuine irish dish of stiraboutfor which all had inherited a taste from their fathers irish mother only cherry was too delicate for such food and was rather ashamed of her cup of tea and slice of bread  however this was one of the few times when she could hope she was useful for when felix was gone to the printingoffice the boys to the grammarschool and wilmet first to the kitchen and then to miss pearsons she remained with bowl and cloth to wash up in her own peculiarly slow and dainty way never breaking but always dreaming while angela carried them one by one first to her then to the kitchen  now cherry  mr audleys door opened he would step forward and take the well worn books in one hand and hold the doors open with the other as cherry tardily hopped in and perched herself by the table her confirmation studies had been left in his charge and then followed a little greek some latin a page or two of french the revision of an exercise and some help in euclid and fractionsall studies begun with her father and both congenial and useful to her as the occupation that next to drawing best prevented her from feeling the dreary loneliness of her days for though he could seldom give her more than an hour the preparationafter he had helped her upstairs occupied her during the whole period of tranquillity while the younger children slept angela appeared first and did some small lessons catanddog readings and easy hymns then was generally content to sit on the floor in mammas room admiring or amusing the twins then cherry according to her sense of duty drew or worked there was a horrible neverending stillbeginning basket of mending in the family which wilmet replenished every saturday and though mrs underwoods instinct for piecing and darning had revived as soon as she was taken out of bed her work now always needed a certain revision to secure the boys from the catastrophe of which wilmet often dreamtappearing in public in ragged shirtsleeves geraldine knew that every stitch she left undone would have to be put in by her sister in late evening or early morning and therefore often wrenched herself from the pencil and paints that best beguiled her thoughts from the heartache for her father and the craving for edgar or the mere craving for light air liberty and usefulness her only excuse to her own conscience for allowing herself her chief pleasure was that it was her way of helping an old woman who kept a stall of small wares on market days and could sometimes dispose of little pictures on domestic and scriptural subjects if highly coloured glazed with gum and bound with bright paperpickings and stealings as felix called them gleaned from advertisements and packingboxes at mr froggatts but these did not allow much scope for the dreams of her fancy  nor had she much choice when bernard once awoke and came down in all the unreasoning tyranny of two years old when it was an even chance whether he would peaceably look at the old scrapbook play with angela or visit mamma or be uproarious and either coalesce with angela in daring mischief fight a battleroyal with her or be violent with and jealous of the twins  the urchin had found out that when once cherrys crutch was out of her reach she could not get at him and he had ridden off upon it so often before committing any of his worst misdemeanours that cherry always lay down on it to secure it after all he was a fine affectionate impetuous little fellow but with a very high proud unmanageable will and she was very fond and proud of him but never more so than when he slept till dinnertime  that was the hour which brought felix home to help sibby to carry his mother into the sittingroom pay a little court to the babies and enliven cherry with any chance scrap of news or occupation best of all were the proofs of that unfinished comment on the epistle to philippi which was being printed by subscription of the congregation and the clergy of the diocese it always did mrs underwood good to have these read aloud to her by her little daughter and she could sometimes find a clue to the understanding of sentences that had puzzled even mr audley  the two schoolboys never appeared till dinner was imminent and thenone unuttered wish of poor cherry was that mr audley could have dined with them but he kept to his own hours and they were late  whereby dinners on five days of the week were apt to be something on this fashion bellringingfelix helping geraldine to her seat angela trotting after a large dish of broth with meat and rice and another of mashed potato no sign of the boys angela lisping grace sibby waiting with a tray  felix filled a soupplate for his mother and a basin for bernard we must begin i suppose and he helped his sisters and himself  here angel push over your plate ill cut thathow did you get on today  very well the only mistake i made i found out before smith saw it i know all the stationery and steel pens apart now and havent made a mistake for a week yesterday bartlett junior came in he stood like a post before mr froggatt till he caught sight of me and then he shouted out o blunderbore you know what is it that collis wants  and did you  when he said it was a horrid sumbook all little as and bswhat have you been doing cherry  i have begun an abstract of the first punic  the door flew open with a bounce and two hot wildlocked boys dust everywhere except in their merry blue eyes burst in and tumbled on their chairs i sayisnt it a horrid sell we aint to have a holiday for squires weddingcome fee give us some grub  you have not said grace said cherry  lance abashed stood up and bowed fulbert looked grim and mumbled something  you have not washed your hands added felix  whats the good said fulbert  theyll be as jolly dirty again directly said lance  but you would be more decent company in the meantime said felix  at that moment there was a splash in his plate a skipjack made of the breastbone of a chicken had alighted there with a leap  theres felixs master come after him cried fulbert and lance went off into choking laughter  boys how can you broke out cherry  look at blunderbore fishing out his master was fulberts answer        the frog is in the bog       and felix is squeamish  chanted lance  bad rhyme lance said felix who could bear these things much better from the younger than the elder indeed he scarcely durst notice them in fulbert lest he should be betrayed into violence by letting out his temper  i say cried lance struck by a new idea what prime stuff it is for making a fort and he began to scrape the more solid parts of his plateful to one side  oh i say isnt it echoed fulbert but ive eaten up the best part of my castle and he grasped at the ladle  no i thank you said felix putting it on the other side while i am here you dont play tricks with that  fulbert swallowed a spoonful in a passion but a bright thought struck lance who always cared much more for fun than for food i say well empty it all into one and eat it down  you horrid boys plaintively exclaimed cherry almost cryingfor this return to savage life was perfect misery to her i cant bear it  i will not have cherry tormented said felix beginning to be very irate  we aint doing anything to cherry said lance amazed  dont you know it spoils cherrys appetite to see you so disgusting  then shell have the more next time said fulbert get along captainyouve splashed my face  hurrah the redhot shot the rice is the cannonballs wheres some bread  o lance entreated cherry no wastethink of wilmet and the bills  well eat it every bit up asseverated lance but fulbert growled if you bother any more i shall crumble the whole lot out at window  it is wicked to waste bread lisped angela and martha at that moment appeared to fetch the tureen for the kitchen dinner  cant you eat any more cherry  asked felix gloomily  not a bit thank you she said  weve not done shouted the boys seizing on her scarcelytasted and halfcold plate  you must finish after come cherry then as they left the room and she laid her head on his shoulderlittle ruffians he said under his breath  oh never mind felix i dontat least i ought not to mindthey dont mean it  lance does not but i think fulbert does hell make me thrash him within two inches of his life before he has done and then theres no one to take me in hand for it it is horridly bad for them too to live just like young bears  but he smoothed his brow as he came into the room where his mother was and amused her till his time was up  mr froggatt had explained to his father long ago that felixs work would not be that of a clerk in a great publishing house but veritably that belonging to the country bookseller and printer and that he must go through all the details so as to be thoroughly conversant with them the mornings work was at the printinghouse the afternoons at the shop the mechanical drudgery and intense accuracy needed in the first were wearisome enough and moreover he had to make his way with a crusty old foreman who was incredulous of any young gentlemans capabilities and hard of being convinced that he would or could be useful but old smiths contempt was far less disagreeable to him than the subdued dislike he met with from redstone the assistant in the shop a sharp halfeducated young man who had aspired to the very post of confidence for which felix was trainingand being far less aware of his own utter unfitness for it than was mr froggatt regarded the lad as an interloper and though he durst not treat him with incivility was anxious to expose any deficiency or failure on his part having a good deal of quickness and dexterity he could act as a reporter draw up articles of a certain description for the newspaper and had since the death of mr froggatts eldest son been absolutely necessary to him in carrying on the business and now it was a matter of delicate discretion on the masters part to avoid hurting the feelings of the assistant whom a little more would have made his tyrant and a dread of the appearance of favouritism made it needful to keep felix thoroughly in a subordinate post till real superiority of mind and education should assert itself over elder years and mere familiarity with detail this reserved illwill of redstones had much increased the natural discomfort of appearing behind the counter to former acquaintance and had rendered the learning the duties there doubly troublesome and confusing though in recalling the days doings there was some amusement in contrasting the behaviour of different people someof whom mr ryder was the typespeaking to him freely in his own person others leaving him as an unrecognised shopboy and a third favouring him with a horrid little furtive nod which he liked least of all but though awkward and embarrassed at first use soon hardened him and made the customers indifferent so that by the spring he had begun to be useful and to feel no particular excitement about it  the worst of his business was that it kept him so late that he had but a very short evening and no time for exercise he was on his feet most of the day but indoors and his recreation chiefly consisted in choirpractice twice a week not that he missed more positive amusement the cares of life and edgars departure seemed to have taken the boyish element of frolic out of him and left him gravely cheerful indeed but with no greater desire of entertainment than could find vent in home conversation or playing with the little ones  wilmet and the two boys were at liberty full two hours before him the latter generally stayed out as long as light and hunger permitted mr audley continually stumbled on them playing at marbles racing headlong in teams of packthread harness with their fellows upsetting the nerves of quiet folkstaring contentedly at such shows as required no outlay or discontentedly at the outside of those that demanded the pennies they never had they were thorough little streetboys and all that he could do for them was to enforce their coming in at reasonable hours and much to their sisters relief cause their daily lessons to be prepared in his room otherwise their places in their classes would have been much less creditable  wilmets return was always geraldines great relief for the afternoon of trying to amuse her mother and keep the peace between the children was almost more than she was equal to though on fine days sibby always took out the two elder babies with an alternate twin for an hours air and mr audley daily visited the invalid mr bevan did so twice a week with a gentle sympathising tone and manner that was more beneficial than lady prices occasional endeavours to make her rouse herself miss pearson and a few humbler friends now and then looked in but mrs underwood had been little known with so large a family and such straitened means the part of the active clergymans wife was impossible to her she had shrunk from society and most people knew nothing more of her than that the faded ladylike figure they used to see among her little flock at church was mrs underwood  wilmets coming home was always a comfort and though to her it was running from toil to care the change was life to her to have been either only the teacher or only the housewife might have weighed overheavily on her but the two tasks together seemed to lighten each other she had a real taste and talent for teaching and she and her little class were devoted to one another while the elder girls loved her much better since alda had been away the being with them and sharing their recreation in the middle of the day was no doubt the best thing to hinder her from becoming worn by the depressing atmosphere around her mother she always brought home spirits and vigour for whatever lay before her brightening her mothers face dispelling squabbles between angela and bernard and taking a load of care from geraldine  there was sure to be some anecdote to enliven the homekeepers or some question to ask cherry whose grammar and arithmetic stood on firmer foundations than any at miss pearsons and who was always pleased to help wilmet the evening hours were the happiest of the day only they always ended too soon for cherry who was ordered up by sibby as soon as her mother was put to bed and had in consequence a weary length of wakeful solitude and darknessonly enlivened by the reflection from the gas belowwhile felix and wilmet sat downstairs she with her mending and he either reading or talking to her  on saturday which she always spent at home and in very active employment in the capacities of nurse housemaid or even a slight taste of the cook and laundress the evening topic was always the accountsthe two young heads anxiously casting the balanceproud and pleased if there were even a shilling below the mark but serious and sad under such a communication as theres mutton gone up another halfpenny or wilmet i really am afraid those boots of mine cannot be mended again or again see what lance has managed to do to this jacket if one only could send boys to school in sacking  are not there a few pence to spare for the chair for cherry she will certainly get ill if she never goes out now spring is coming on  indeed felix i dont know how if there is a penny over it is wanted towards shoes for bernard and cherry begs me with tears in her eyes not to let her be an expense  poor geraldine the costing anything and the sense of uselessness were becoming by the help of her nightly wakefulness a most terrible oppression on her spirits her father was right his room had been a hotbed to a naturally sensitive and precocious character and the change that had come over her as time carried her farther and farther away from him affected her more and more  her brother and sister busy all day and scarcely ever at home hardly knew what was becoming a sore perplexity to mr audley  a young tutor not yet twentysix could not exactly tell what to do with a girl not fourteen who fell into floods of tears on the smallest excuse  no no cherrythat is not the nominative  the voice faltered struggled to go on and melted away behind the handkerchief theno mr audley i am so sorry  thats exactly what i dont want you to be cherry  oh but it was so careless and there was another flood  or dont you see cherry you should not have put the negative sign to that equation my dear cherry what have i said  oh ohnothing only i did think  we shall have you a perfect niobe if you go on at this rate cherry really we must not have these lessons if they excite you so much  oh that would be the worst punishment of all and the weeping became so piteously violent that the curate looked on in distressed helplessness  i know it is very tiresome of me i would help it if i could indeed i would and she cried the more because she had cried  or as he came in from the town he would hear ominous sounds that his kind heart would not let him neglect and would find cherry sitting on the landingplace in a paroxysm of weeping she always crept out of her mothers room on these occasions for the sight of tears distressed and excited mrs underwood and the poor child quite unable in her hysterical condition to drag herself alone up that steep stair had no alternative but to sit on what mr audley called her stool of repentance outside the door till she had sobbed herself into exhaustion and calmor till either sibby scolded her or he heard her confession  she had been so cross to bernard or to angelor once or twice even to mamma she had made an impatient answer when interrupted in her lessons or in a dream over a drawing she had been reluctant to exert herself when wanted she had scolded fretfullyor snatched things away angrily when the little ones were troublesome and every offence of this sort was bewailed with an anguish of tears that by weakening her spirits and temper really rendered the recurrence more frequent the one thing they trust to me i fail in  he was very kind to her he did not yield to the mannish loathing for girlish tears that began to seize on him after the first two or three occasions he thought and studiedtried comfort and fancied it relaxed hertried rebuke and that made it worse tried the showing her francois de sales admirable counsel to philothee to be doux envers soi and saw she appreciated and admired it but she was not an atom more douce envers soi when she had next spoken peevishly  at last he fairly set off by the train to lay the case before sister constance  what is to be done when a child never does anything but cry  sister constance listened to the symptoms and promptly answered give her a glass of port wine every day before you let her out of your room  if i can  tell her they are my orders does she eat  i imagine not i heard felix reproaching her with a ghouls dinner of a grain of rice  does she sleep  she has told me a great deal of midnight meditation on her own deficiencies  she must be taken out of doors somehow or other it is of no use to reason with her the tears are not temper or anything else poor charlie it is an odd capacity for you to come out in but i suppose no one else can attend to her  no poor child she is rather worse than motherless welli will find some excuse for taking her out for a drive now and then i dont know how to speak to the others about having the chair for her for they are barely scraping on  poor children well this year is probably the worst either they will get their heads above water or there will be a crisis but they do scrape  yes at ladyday there was great jubilation for the rent was paid the taxes were ready there was not a debt and there was sevenpence over with which felix wanted to give cherry a drive but wilmet who is horribly prudent insisted that it must go to mend fulberts broken window  wellpoor wilmet one cant blame her how does she treat cherrys tears  i dont think she has much pity for them felix does much better with cherry he rocks her and pets her though indeed she hardly ever breaks down when he is there but even his sundays are a good deal taken upand i always hunt him out for a walk on the sunday afternoons  is he still in the choir and teaching at the sunday school  yesthough it is not mowbray smiths fault  what is your colleague what you apprehended  my lady could not have found a curate more to her mind or more imbued with her dislike to all that bears the name of underwood i own it is hard to have ones predecessor flung constantly in ones teeth and by the very people who were the greatest thorns to dear underwood himself then clem who was a born prig though a very good boy gave some of his little interfering bits of advice before he went away and it has all been set down to felixs account one sunday smith made a complaint of felix having the biggest boys in the school it was the consequence of his having taken them whenever his father could not till it came to his having them entirely he always took great pains with them and there was a fellowfeeling between him and them that could hardly be with an older person i said all thistoo strongly most likelyand the rector put in a mild word as to his goodness in coming at all smith thought there was nothing wonderful in liking what ministered to his conceit and at last it came out that a bakers boy had met felix and smith consecutively in the street and only touched his hat to one and that the wrong one  i should have been only thankful that he touched his hat to anybody  that is the very remark by which i put my foot in it but my lady was horrified and the consequence was that it fell to me to advise felix to resign the class i never hated a piece of work so much in my life for he had worked the lads well and we both knew that there would be an end of them moreover felix has some of the true briton about him and he stood outwould give up the class if the rector ordered him but would relinquish sundayschool altogether in that case and the two girls were furious but after one sunday he came to me said that he found hostility poisoned his teaching gave up and accepted the younger ones  of course the boys deserted  which has not softened smith though it has made him tolerate felix in the choir his voice is of very little use at present but he is such an influence that we should be glad of him if he could not sing a note and he clings to it with all his heart i believe music is about the only pleasure he has and it excites his mother too much to have any at home we have little lance in the choir now with a voice like a thrush in a dewy morning  mr audley acted on the portwine prescription to the horror and dismay of cherry who only submitted with any shadow of philosophy on being told that the more she cried the more necessary she rendered it but on the saturday sister constance suddenly knocked at mr audleys door she had been talking the matter over with the superior and the result was that she had set off on a mission to see for herself and if she thought it expedient to bring geraldine back with her she had chosen saturday as the time for seeing wilmet and was prepared to overlook that the stairs were a lodore of soap this being sibbys cleaning day while wilmet kept guard over the mother and the twins  geraldine was in the sittingroom writing a latin exercise with a great pucker in her forehead whenever angela looked up from her wooden bricks to speak to her and though the sharp little pinched face was all one beam of joy as the visitor came in sister constance saw at once that the childs health had deteriorated in these last months she sat down and with angela on her lap questioned anxiously cherry had no complaintsshe always was like this in the spring how was her foot as usual a falter was it really well yes she thought so and then as the motherly eyes looked into hers there came a burst of the ready tears and oh please dont talk about itplease dont ask  i know what you are afraid of said sister constance remembering her horror of the bexley medical attendant but is it right to conceal this my dear child  i dont think i do said cherry pitifully you know sibby does it every night and it only aches a little more now and if they did find it out then they would have him and there would be a doctors bill and oh that would be dreadful  sister constance saw that the question of right or wrong would be infinitely too much for geraldine and drew off her mind from it to tell of the good accounts of robina from catsacre and clement from whittingtonia but when presently wilmet was so far free as to come in with only the boybaby in her arms and take the guest up to take off her bonnet it was the time for entering on the subject  cherry do you think her looking ill she always is poorly in the spring you know  i do not like what i hear of her appetite or her sleep or her spirits  oh but cherry is always fanciful you know please please dont put things in her head  what kind of things do you mean  fancying herself worse i mean or wanting things you know we must be so careful and mamma and the babies  my dear i know you have many to care for and it is hard to strike the balance but somehow your voice sounds to me as if geraldine were the one you most willingly set aside  wilmet did not like this and said a little bit hastily i am sure geraldine has everything we can give her if she complains it is very wrong of her  she has not said one word of complaint her grief and fear is only of being a burden on you what brought me here was that mr audley was anxious about her  wilmet was silent a little abashed  did you know that her ankle is painful again  sister constance said wilmet i dont think you or mr audley know how soon cherry fancies all sorts of things she does get into whiny states and is regularly tiresome and the more you notice her the worse she is i know mamma thought so  my dear a mother can venture on wholesome neglect when a sisters neglect is not wholesome i am not accusing you of neglect mind only you want experience and sympathy to judge of a thing with a frame like cherrys now i will tell you what i want to do i am come to take her back with me and get her treated by her kind doctor for a month or so and the sea air and rest will send her back most likely in a much more cheery state  indeed cried wilmet startled it is very good but how could we do without her mamma and the children if she could only wait till the holidays  let her only hear you say that wilmet and it will do her more good than anything  whatthat she is of use poor little thing she tries to be but if marilda could have had her way and taken her instead of alda it would have been much better for her and all ah theres felix may i call him in  felix dashing up to wash his hands smooth his hair and dress himself for the readingroom work instead of the printingoffice had much rather these operations had been performed before he was called to the consultation in the nursery but he agreed instantly and solicitously knowing much better than wilmet what the dinners were to cherry and talking of her much more tenderly  yes poor little dear she always breaks down more or less in the spring but i thought she would mend when we could get her out more he said do you think her really so unwell sister constance  oh no no cried wilmet fearfully  not very unwell but only so that i long to put her under our good doctor who comes to any one in our house and who is such a fatherly old gentleman that she would not go through the misery the thought of mr rugg seems to cause her  dr lee asked felix tom underwood sent him to see my father once i remember my father liked him but called it waste for himself only longed for his opinion on cherry thank you i am sure it is the greatest kindness  but felix how can she before the holidays cried wilmet  well mamma does not want her before dinner and as to the kids why cant you take angel to school with you oh yes miss pearson will let you then mr audley or mr bevan is always up in the afternoon and you come home by four  perhaps i could earlier on days when the girls go out walking said wilmet if it is to do cherry good i dont like to prevent it  wilmet had evidently got all her household into their niches and the disarrangement puzzled her a wonderful girl she was to contrive as she did and carry out her rule but sister constance feared that a little dryness might be growing on her in consequence and that like many maidens of fifteen or sixteen while she was devoted to the little she was impatient of the intermediate  so when they went down and cherry heard of the scheme and implored against it in nervous fear of leaving home and dread of new faces wilmet having made up her practical mind that the going was necessary only made light of that value at home which was cherrys one comfort and which made herself feel it so hard to part with her that this very want of tact was all unselfishness  felix was much more comfortable to cherry when he made playful faces at the beargarden that the diningroom would become without her and showed plainly that he at least would miss her dreadfully still she nourished a hope that mamma would say she should not go but mamma always submitted to the decrees of authority and wilmet and felix were her authorities now sister constance felt no misgiving lest wilmet were hardening when she heard the sweet discretion and cheerful tenderness with which she propounded the arrangement to the sick mother without giving her the worry of decision yet still deferentially enough to keep her in her place as the head of the family  yet it was with unnecessarily bracing severity that wilmet observed to geraldine now dont you go crying and asking questions and worrying mamma  i suppose no person can be everything at once far less a girl of fifteen thought sister constance as she drove up to the station in the omnibus with cherry who was too miserable and bewildered to cry now not that she was afraid of either the sister or the sisterhood but only because she had never left home in her life and felt exactly like a callow nestling shoved out on the ground with a broken wing  in two months more the omnibus was setting her down again much nearer plumpness with a brighter face and stronger spirits she had been very full of enjoyment at st faiths she had the visitors room with delightful sacred prints and photographs and a window looking out on the seaa sight enough to fascinate her for hours she had been out every fine day on the shore she had sat in the pleasant communityroom with the kind sisters who talked to her as a woman not a baby she had plenty of books one of the sisters had given her daily drawing lessons and another had read tasso with her she had been to the lovely oratory constantly and to the beautiful church on sunday and had helped to make the wreaths for the great may holidays she had made many new friends and among them the doctor who if he had hurt her had never deceived her and had really made her more comfortable than she had ever been for the last five years putting her in the way of such selfmanagement as might very possibly avert some of that dreadful liability to be cross  but with all this and all her gratitude geraldines longing had been for home she was very happy and it was doing her a great deal of good but mamma and felix and wilmet and sibby and the babies were tugging at her heart and would not let it go out from them she was always dreaming that felixs heels were coming through his stockings that mamma was calling and nobody coming or that bernard was cutting off the heads of the twins with the blunt scissors and when dr lees course of treatment was over and felix had a holiday to come and fetch her home it is not easy to say which was happiest for she was so glad to be at home amid the dear faces troubling and troublous as they often were and so comfortable in the old wheel ruts of care and toil that it really seemed as if a new epoch of joy had begun felix openly professed how sorely he had missed her and she clung to his arm with exulting mutual delight but it was almost more triumphant pleasure to be embraced by wilmet with the words dear dear cherry there you are at last you cant think how we have all wanted you i never knew how useful you are  i suppose said felix quaintly the world would rather miss its axis and yet that does not move  yes it does said cherry it wobbles i suppose wilmet says rotates just about as much as i am going to do now i have got back into my own dear sphere again     chapter vi  the cacique    devouring flames resistless glow  and blazing rafters downward go  and never halloo heads below  nor notice give at all                  rejected addresses   it was a warm night in september and wilmet had laid herself down in bed in her nursery with a careful but not an oppressed heart about many matters she was happier than before her mother had revived in some degree could walk from her bedroom to the sittingroom and took more interest in what was passing and this the hopeful spirits of the children interpreted into signs of recovery geraldines health and spirits had evidently taken a start for the better fulbert too was off her mindsafe gone to a clergyorphan foundation and though lancelot had not yet been elected owing mr audley imagined to lady prices talk about their fine friends wilmet could not be sorry he was such a little fellow and the house would be so dull without his unfailing merriment and oddities and though there had been sore disappointment that mrs thomas underwood had chosen to go to brighton instead of coming home there was the promise of a visit from alda before christmas to feed upon little robina had come home for the summer holidays well happy and improved and crying only in a satisfactory way on returning to school moreover wilmets finances had been pleasantly increased by an unexpected present of five pounds at the end of the half year from miss pearson and the promise of the like for the next increasing as her usefulness increased and she was also allowed to bring angela to school with her the balance of accounts at midsummer had been satisfactory and felix had proudly pronounced her to be a brick of a housekeeper and thus altogether wilmet did not feel that the weight of care was so heavy and hopeless as when it first descended upon her and she went to bed as usual feeling how true her fathers words of encouragement and hope had been how kind friends were how dear a brother felix was and above all how there is verily a father of the fatherless and so she fell fast asleep but was ere long waked by a voice from the inner room where cherry slept with the door open  wilmet wilmet what is it  then she saw that the room was aglow with red light from the window and heard a loud distant hubbub hurrying out of bed she flew to the window of cherrys room and drew up the blind o wilmet is it fire  yes low and awestruck said wilmet not here no theres nothing to be frightened at cherry it is outout there i think it must be the fortinbras arms oh what a sight  it is dreadful said cherry shrinking trembling to the foot of her little bed whence she could see the window how plain one can see everything in the room oh the terrible red glow in the windows i wonder if all the people are safe wilmet do call felix  i will said wilmet proceeding in search of her clothes but her hands shook so that she could hardly put them on they longed for felix as a protection and yet cherry could hardly bear to let her sister go out of sight  i only hope mamma does not hear said wilmet  how lucky her room looks out the other way but oh wilmet dont fires spread  felix and mr audley will see about us in time if there is any fear of that said wilmet trembling a good deal as she wrapped a shawl round cherry who sat in a heap on her bed gazing fascinated at the red sky and roofs felix slept at the back of the house her knock did not waken him but her entrance startled both him and lance  felix the fortinbras arms is on firehush lance take care the little ones and mamma o felix do come to our room  they followed her there in a few seconds but they had only glanced from the window before they simultaneously rushed away to the increased dismay of their sisters to whom their manly instinct of rushing into the fray had not occurred  ill go down ill try to catch them said wilmet and she too was gone before cherry could call to her she found that felix and mr audley were in the act of undoing the front door and this gave her just time to fly down with the entreaty that felix would not leave them it was a great deal more to ask of him than she knew  to the end of the street i must go wilmet he said  oh but cherry is so frightened and if mamma wakes she said gasping  it is all quiet in her room said felix  tell cherry there is no danger at all here now said mr audley but if it makes her happier you may dress her dont disturb your mother if needful we will carry her out in her bed but i do not think it will be  we can only see out in the street added felix opening the door as he spoke and that moment out flew lance before anybody had thought of stopping him and the necessity of pursuing the little fellow into the throng and keeping him out of danger made both felix and mr audley dash after him while wilmet abashed at the men hurrying by could not even gaze from the door but fled upstairs in terror lest the two little ones should be awake and crying at the appalling red light and the din which seemed to her one continuous roar of fire fire  to her great relief they were still asleep but cherry was in a chilled agony of trembling prayer for the poor people and the sisters crouched up together shivering in each others arms as they watched the rush of flames streaming up into the sky over the brew house opposite to them  presently wilmet heard feet again downstairs cherry dear i must go down they may want me indeed i dont think there is real danger as long as that brewhouse is safe  there was a scuffle of feet that frightened her very much she remembered it last michaelmas when her father was brought home from church and as she stood on the stairsone choking petition in her heart let it not be felix she saw that the figure whatever it was was carried by mr audley and a strange man and so great a horror came over her that regardless of her toilette and the hair that had fallen over the jacket on her shoulders she dropped at once among them as they were bearing the senseless form into mr audleys bedroom with a low but piteous cry felix felix oh what has happened  it is not felix my dear said mr audley he is safehe is gone for the doctor this poor boy has fallen from a window you can help us wilmet call martha and get some water made hot the fire is getting under  wilmet needed no second hint she was up reassuring cherry at one moment then breaking into marthas heavy slumbers impressing upon her the necessity of not shrieking then downstairs again reviving the dying kitchen fire and finding that as usual there was some water not yet cold for as she now saw it was not yet one oclock she durst not go to her mothers room where ready means of heating food were always to be found as she brought the jug to the door felix came in with mr rugg who living in a street out of sight and having ears for no sound but his own nightbell had been ready at once to obey the call felix told his sister the little he knew  it was a terrible sight just as we got to that one big windowa passage one i believe which looks out into this streetwe saw this poor boy and a black man up on the sill with all the glare of light behind them screaming out for help  but where was everybody  in the high street round the corner crowds there and here in our street only ourselves and a few men that hurried up after us mr audley shouted to them that we would get a ladder but whether they could not hold on any more or they thought we were going quite away o wilmet i didnt see but there was the most horrible thump and crash on the pavement  what down from that window  yes said felix leaning against the wall and looking very pale and there was that good black man he had got the boy in his arms as if he had wound himself round to keep him from harm  oh and he  killedquite killed dont ask me about it wilmet it is much too dreadful to hear of and he shuddered all over  but this boys head was safe at least and as there seemed no one to attend to anything mr audley said he would bring him here and i went for mr rugg  and wheres lance did he go with you  lance is not he in i never saw or thought of him i must go and seek for him exclaimed felix darting off in haste and alarm at the thought of little nineyearold lance alone among the midnight crowd just as mr audley opened the door to try to find a messenger to mr ruggs surgery he paused to tell wilmet that it was a lad about felixs age moaning some word that sounded like diego and with a broken leg and ribs and then as martha was in attendance she felt herself obliged to return to cherry whom indeed she could not leave again for though the fire had sunk and only thick clouds of smoke showed the play of the engines the effects of the terror were not so quickly over in the tender little frame which was in a quivering hysterical state so deadly cold that wilmet was frightened and went once more down to warm some flannel and get some hot drink for her she intended tea but meeting mr audley again he sent up a glass of wine even with this in hot water cherry could hardly be warmed again and wilmet lay down clasping her round and not daring to let her know of her own continued anxiety about the two brothers at last however when the red light had almost faded quite away the cautious steps were heard coming up the stairs and felix called into the room in a low voice  all right wilmet  oh come in the sisters called where did you find him fee is he safe  o cherry you never saw such a lark cried lance in a gusty whisper wouldnt fulbert have given his ears to have seen it to see the engines pouring down and the great hose twining about like jolly old seaserpents spouting  hush lance how can you how could you does mr audley know he is safe  yes said felix he opened the door and said he might have known lance was too much of a gamin to come to grief  whats a gamin said lance  a street ragamuffin at paris said wilmet but really lance it was a terrible thing to do  and where do you think i found him said felix in between little jacky brown and that big old coalheaver who was so impudent about the blanketclub hanging like a monkey upon the rails of the terrace and hallooing as loud as they  twas the coalheaver that helped me up said lance hes a jolly good fellow i can tell you he said you be one of parson underwoods little chaps baint you a rare honest gentleman of the right sort war hehe war and he pulled down another boy and put me up instead and told me all about the great fire at stubbss factory you cant think what fun it was roar roar up went the flame swish wish went the watersuch a bellowingsuch great clouds of smoke  was everybody saved whispered cherrys tremulous murmur  there was a silence then lance said werent they and cherry had another shuddering fit  who wilmet asked  poor mr joness youngest child and his nursemaid were in an attic room where nobody could get at them said felix in a hurried and awestruck voice causing cherry to renew that agony of trembling and sobbing so convulsive and painful that her elder brother and sister could only devote themselves to soothing her till at last she lay still again in wilmets arms with only a few long gasps coming quivering up through her frame then wilmet implored felix to go away and make lance go to bed and finding this the only means of reducing the little excited fellow to quiet he went and though all were sure they should not sleep they overslept themselves far into sunday morning except wilmet who was wakened by the clamours of the undisturbed angela and bernard and succeeded in dressing them without disturbing the other three  very tired and stiff and very anxious she felt but she was obliged to go down as soon as she was dressed since she always took charge of her mother before breakfast on sunday while sibby went to mass it was so late that she could only listen in vain at the top of the stairs before she went into the room where she found sibby very indignant at having missed all the excitement of the night past as if she could not have been trusted not to have wakened the mistress she believed they would have let her alone till they all were burnt in their beds  it was not till breakfast which took place unusually late that wilmet heard much felix and lance had just come downstairs rather ashamed of having overslept themselves and mr audley came in and begged for a cup of tea  he told them that the father and uncle of the boy had arrived they were american merchants or speculators of some kind he thought named travis and they had gone on business to dearport the day before meaning to dine there and return by the mail train in the night and leaving the boy with the black servant in the unfortunate hotel  on arriving at about three oclock not long after felix had brought lance home they had telegraphed to dearport for a doctor and nurse who were momentarily expected to arrive the patient was only half conscious and though he knew his father continued to murmur for diego martha was sitting with him whenever she could for his father did not seem to understand nursing and it would be a great relief when a properlytrained person arrived  she came and so did the doctor but not till close upon churchtime and little but stray reports from the sickroom reached the population upstairs all that day as mr audley whenever he was not at church was obliged to be in attendance on his strange guests all that reached the anxious and excited young people was the tidings of the patient being not unlikely to do well though he was in great pain and high fever and continually calling for the poor negro who had saved his life at the expense of his own  this was the last bulletin when the household parted to go their several ways on monday morning not to be all collected again and free to speak till seven oclock in the evening when they met round the table for tea  mamma looks cheery said felix coming into the little back room where wilmet was spreading bread and butter  yes said wilmet i think she has cared to hear about the fire so many people have come in and talked that it has enlivened her  and how is the boy  a little better martha heard but he keeps on talking of diego and seems not to care about any one else  no wonder his father must be an unmitigated brute said felix he came to the inquest and talked just as if it had been an old newfoundland dog i really think he cared rather less than if it had been  tell us about the inquest felix said lance i wish theyd have wanted me there  i dont see why lance said felix gravely it was a terrible thing to see poor mr jones hardly able to speak for grief and the mother of that poor young nurse went on sobbing as if her heart was breaking  nobody knows the cause of the fire do they asked cherry  lady price said it was the gas  no no one knows way the waiter saw a glare under the door of the great assemblyroom as he was going up very late to bed and the instant he opened the door the flame seemed to rush out at him i suppose a draught was all it wanted he saw this poor diego safe downstairs once but he must have gone back to save his young master and got cut off in coming back poor fellow he is a mexican negro belonging to an estate that came to mr traviss wife and he has always clung to her and her son just like a faithful dog  but he could not be a slave in england said cherry eagerly  no but as this travis said his one instinct was the boy he did not know how to get rid of him he said and i do believe he thinks it a lucky chance  i wish it had been he said lance  sibby has asked leave to go to the burial added wilmet  i hope you gave it said felix mr macnamara came and asked if he were not a roman catholic and those two travises laughed a little offensively and said they guessed he was so as much as a nigger was anything and the papists were welcome to his black carcase only they would not be charged for any flummery i wont be made a fool of about a nigger one said and then i was so glad mr audley begged to know when the funeral would be and said he would go anywhere to do honour to faithfulness unto death  well done mr audley cried lance wont we go too fee  it will be at nine tomorrow said felix at which lance made a face since of course he would be in school at the time  maybe i shall have to go added felix for only think as my good luck would have it redstone went on saturday night to see his mother or somebody and only came back this morning and mr froggatt himself was out at his box as he calls it so he told me this morning to write the account of the fire for the paper and he would pay me for it extra as he does redstone  well and have you done it  i was pretty much at sea at first till i recollected the letter i began to edgar yesterday night and by following that i made what i thought was a decent piece of business of it  oh did you put in the way they threw the things out at window at jessops without looking what they were cried lance and the jolly smash the jugs and basins made and when their house was never on fire at all and how the coalheaver said hold hard frail trade there  well said felix quaintly i put it in a different form you see i said the inhabitants of the adjacent houses hurled their furniture from the windows with more precipitation than attention to the fragility of the articles and after all that intolerable ass redstone has corrected fire every time into the devouring element and made the faithful black into the african of sable integument but heart of precious ore  now felix  bald sir bald he said with such a face yes mr underwood even good old froggy said when he saw me looking rather blue you and i may know what good taste and simplicity is but if we sent out the pursuivant with no mouthfilling words in it we should be cut out with some low paper in no time among the farmers and mechanics  is he so led by mr redstone asked wilmet  not exactly but i believe theres nothing he dreads more than redstones getting offended and saying that i am no use as he would any day if he could o mr audley are you coming to stay  will you have a cup of tea said wilmet  thank you yes ive got to dine with these fellows at the railway hotel at eight but i wanted to speak to you first wilmet said mr audley sitting down as if he were weary of his day  how is the boy  better he has been quite sensible ever since he woke at twelve oclock today only he was dreadfully upset about poor diegoabout whom his father told him very abruptlywithout the least notion he would feel it so much  i wish i had the kicking of that father observed felix driving the knife hard into the loaf  he is not altogether such a bad fellow said mr audley thoughtfully  not for an american perhaps  he is not an american at all he was born and bred in my own country and took me by surprise by calculating that i was one of the audleys of wrightstone court and wanting to know whether my father were sir robert or sir roberts son then he guessed that i might have heard of his father if i was not too young and byandby it dawned on me that whenever there is any complication about business matters or any one is in bad circumstances my father always vituperates one travis who it seems was a solicitor greatly trusted by all the country round till he died some twenty years ago and it appeared that he had ruined everybody himself included these men are his sons they went out to america and got up in the world they told me the whole story of how they had knocked about everywhere last evening but i was too sleepy to enter into it much though i daresay it was curious enough successful speculations and hairsbreadth escapes seemed to come very thick one upon another but all i am clear about is that this poor boy fernandos mother was a mexican heiress theyone of them i meanmanaged to marry her father english but her mother old spanish blood allied to the old caciques he says whether it is a boast i dont know but the boy looks like itsuch a handsome fellow delicate straight profile slender limbs beautifully made inkyblack hair and brows pure olive skinthe two doctors were both in raptures well they thought affairs in mexico insecure so they sold the poor womans estate and carried her off to texas no was it i really cant remember where but at any rate diego stuck to her wherever she went and when she died to her child nursed him like an old woman and in short it was that touching negro love that one sometimes hears of now they seem to have grown very richthe american viceconsul who came over this morning from dearport knew all about themand they came home partly on business and partly to leave fernando to be made into an english gentleman who mr travis says if he has money to spend does whip creation hes english enough for that still well they have got a telegram that makes them both want to sail by the next steamer  thats a blessing but the boy  he cannot be moved for weeks it is not only the fractures but the jar of the fall he may get quite over it but must lie quite still on his back so here he is a fixture by your leave my lady housekeeper  it is your room mr audley said wilmet but can his father really mean to leave him alone so very ill poor boy  well as his father truly says he is no good to him but rather the reverse and as the travis mind seems rather impressed by finding an audley here i am to be left in charge of him now and to find a tutor for him when he gets better so we are in for that  but what is to become of you asked wilmet the nurse has got the little back study  i have got a room at bollands to sleep in thank you he answered and i have been representing the inconvenience to the house of this long illness so that the travises who are liberal enough  i thought them horrid misers said felix  that was only the american conscience as to negroes in other matters they are ready to throw money about with both hands so i hope i have made a good bargain for you wilmet you are to have five guineas a week and provide for boy and nurse all but wine and beer ice and fruit  five guineas murmured wilmet quite overpowered at the munificent sum  i am afraid you will not find it go as far as you expect for he will want a good deal of dainty catering  and your room should be deducted said wilmet  not at all mrs bolland said she did not take lodgers but should esteem it a favour if i would sleep there while her son is away it is all safe i think he has given me orders on his london banker and they say here at the bank that they are all right it is a strange charge he added thoughtfully we little thought what we were taking on ourselves when we picked up that poor fellow felix and i cannot help thinking it will turn out well there was something so noble about the poor lads face as he lay insensible  it was about three weeks later that one sunday evening when mr audley came in from church felix followed him to his sittingroom and began with unusual formality i think i ought to speak to you sir  whats the matter  about lance and him in there i have had such a queer talk with him  as how  why he wanted us to stop from church asked me to let off the poor little coon and when i said we couldnt because we were in the choir wanted to know what we were paid then why we did it at all and so it turned out that he thinks churches only meant for women and psalmsinging niggers and methodists and has never been inside one in his life never saw the sense of it wanted to know why i went  what did you tell him  i dont know i was so taken aback i said something about our duty to god and its being all we had to get us through life but i know i made a dreadful mess of it and the bell rang and i got away but he seems a sheer heathen and theres lance in and out all day  yes felix i am afraid it is true that the poor lad has been brought up with no religion at alla blank sheet as his father called him  wasnt his father english  yes but he had lived a roving godless life i began when i found the boy must stay here by asking whether he were of his fathers or his mothers communion and in return heard a burst of exultation that he had never let a priest into his house his fatherinlaw had warned him against it and he had carried his wife out of their reach long before the childs birth he has not even been baptized but you see felix i could not act like abraham to the idolater in the talmud  felix did not speak but knocked one foot against the other in vexation feeling that it was his house after all and that mr audley should not have turned this young heathen loose into it to corrupt his brother without consulting him  i told travis continued the curate that if i undertook the charge as he wished it must be as a priest myself and i must try to put some religion into him and to my surprise he said he left it to me fernando was old enough to judge and if he were to be an english squire he must conform to oldcountry ways besides i was another sort of parson from yankee methodists and shakers or popish priestshe knew the english clergy well enough of the right sort  so he is to learn religion to make him a squire  i was thankful enough to find no obstruction  and have you begun asked felix moodily  whyno he has been too ill and too reserved i have attempted nothing but daily saying a short prayer for him in his hearing hoping he would remark on it but you know the pain is still very absorbing at times and it leaves him exhausted and besides i fancy he has a good deal of tropical languor about him and does not notice much nothing but lance has roused him at all  i would never have let lance in there by himself if i had known said felix he is quite bewitched  it would have been difficult to prevent it nor do i think that much harm can be done i believe i ought to have told you felix but i did not like denouncing my poor sick guest among the children or its getting round all the town and to my lady after all lance is a very little fellow it is not as if edgar or clem were at home  i suppose it cannot be helped sighed felix but my father and as he recollected the desire to take his brothers away from mr ryder he felt as if his chosen guardian had been false to his trust out of pity and enthusiasm  your father would have known how to treat him sighed mr audley at any rate felix we must not forget the duties of hospitality and kindness and i hope you will not roughly forbid lance to go near him without seeing whether the poor fellow is not really inoffensive  ill see about it was all that felix could get himself to say for much as he loved mr audley he could not easily brook interference with his brothers and little lance so loyal to himself and so droll without a grain of malice was very near to his heart a young pagan as he thought to himself teaching him all the blackguard tricks and words he has learnt at all the low schools in north or south and all the most objectionable scenes he had met with in american stories from uncle tom onwards began to rise before his eyes a pretty thing to do in a fit of beneficence ill order lance to keep away and if he dares disobey ill lick him well to show him who is master  so he felt as he swung himself upstairs and halted with some intention of pouring out his vexed spirit to wilmet because mr audley had no business to make it a secret but wilmet was putting her mother to bed and he went on upstairs there he found all the doors open and heard a murmuring sound of voices in geraldines room in a mood to be glad of any excuse for finding fault he strode across the nursery where angela and bernard slept and saw that lance who ought to have gone at once to bed on coming in was standing in his sisters window trying to read in the ray of gas light that came up from a lamp at the brewhouse door  go to bed lance he said if you have not learnt your lessons in proper time you must wake early or take the consequences i wont have it done on sunday night  lance started round angrily and cherry cried o felix it is no such thing only would you tell us where to find about the king and his priests that defeated the enemy by singing the mercy endureth for ever psalm  in the bible said felix as if sure it was a blunder theres no such story  indeed there is cried lance for papa the word low and reverently took out his blue polysomething bible and read it out in the sermon dont you remember fee a hot day in the summer when he preached all about those wild robbershorrid fellows with long spearscoming up in the desert to make a regular smash of the jews  lance cried cherry  well he did not say that of course but they wanted to and how the king sent out the priests without a fighting man only all in white praising god in the beauty of holiness and singing his mercy endureth for ever i saw him read that though he told us all the rest without book how all the enemy began to quarrel and all killed one another and the jews had nothing to do but to pick up the spoil and sing another psalm coming back  i remember now said felix in a very different tone it was jehoshaphat lancey boy ill find it for you in the book of chronicles did you want it for anything  lance made an uneasy movement  it was to show poor fernando travis wasnt it said cherry and as lance wriggled again she added he seems to have been taught nothing good  now cherry broke out lance i told you to say not a word  i know a little about it lance said felix sitting down on the windowseat and lifting lance on his knee as he said in a tone very unlike his intended expostulation you must not let him do you harm lance  he wouldnt but he does not know anything about anything said the little boy they never taught him to say his prayers nor sing hymns nor chant and he thinks it is only good for niggers so i told him that singing psalms once beat an army and he laughed and i thought cherry was sure to know where it wasbut girls will always tell  indeed you never told me not said cherry humbly  she has done no harm said felix mr audley has just been talking to me about that poor boy he really is as untaught as that little scamp at the potteries that we tried to teach  hes a stunning good fellow broke in lance he has seen an alligator and ridden mustangs  never mind that now lance i dare say he is very amusing but  dont hinder me from going to him broke in the younger boy vehemently  if said felix gravely you can be quite sure my father would not mind it  lance was nestling close up to him in the dark and he was surprised to find that round face wet with tears papa would not let him lie dull and moped all day long he said o fee i cant keep away i am so sorry for him when that terrible cramp comes it is of no use to say those sort of things to him  what sort of things  oh you know verses such as papa used to have said to him they werent a bit of good no not though i did get the book papa marked for cherry  you did gasped cherry who little thought that sacred possession of hers was even known to master lance  youd have done it yourself cherry said the little boy if you had only seen how bad he was he got quite white and had great drops on his forehead and panted so and would not let out a bit of a cry only now and then a groan and so i ran to get the verse papa used to say over and over to you when your foot was bad and im sure it was the right one butbutit did him no good for oh he didnt know who our saviour is and the little fellow clung to his brother in a passion of tears while felix felt a pang at the contrast  have you been telling him lancey he asked  i wanted him to ask mr audley but he said he was a parson and his father said that there would be no parsons if men were not fools now fee ive told you but dont keep me away  it would be hard on a poor sick fellow said felix thoroughly softened only lance you know i cant be with you will you promise to go away if ever you think papa would wish it  oh yes one has to do that you know when our own fellows get blackguardly said little lance freely whereat cherry shuddered somewhat and fee he added if you would only come and make him understand about things  mr audley must do that said felix i cant  you teach the boys in the sundayschool said lance and hed mind you blunderbore he says you are the grandest and most splendiferous fellow he ever did set eyes on and that he feels something like when youve just looked in and spoken to him  you little ass he was chaffing you  no no indeed he wasnt i told him all about it because he liked your face so much and he does care so very much when you look in oh do do fee he is so jolly and it is so lonely and horrid for him and i do so want papa for him and the child cried silently but felix felt the long deep sobs and as geraldine much moved said dear little lancey he carried him over to her as she sat up in bed and she kissed and fondled him and murmured in his ear dear lance im sure hell get good we will get mr audley to talk to him you know and we will say a prayer every day for him  lance beginning to recover put his arms round cherrys neck gave her a tremendous hug released himself from his brothers arms and ran off to bed  felix remained a few moments while cherry exclaimed oh the dear good little fellow  better than any of us said felix i was quite savage with mr audley when i found out about it i must go down and tell him i never thought all that was in the little chap im glad he came to you cherry goodnight  and you will try to teach this poor boy felix  i dont say that i dont in the least know how but i shall not dare to hinder lance now i see how he goes on  on his way down he heard voices in the sittingroom where in fact mr audley had joined wilmet to explain to her how vexed he was to have so much annoyed felix and perhaps also something of his own annoyance at the manner in which felix took it wilmet partly from her growing on the sunny side of the wall partly from her early authority was in some ways older than her brother and could see that there was in him a shade of boyish jealousy of his prerogative and as she sat in her pretty modest gravity with her fair hair and her sunday frock she was softly but earnestly telling mr audley that she was sure felix would not mind long and that he was very sorry for the poor boy really only he was so anxious about lance and he did like to be consulted both looked up startled as felix opened the door and they saw that his eyes were full of tears he came up to mr audley and said i beg your pardon sir id no business to grumble and that little fellow has been  beforehand with us asked mr audley as felix broke down the nurse has been just telling me how he sat on his bed saying bits of psalms and verses to him when he had that bad fit of cramp so pretty she said but i was afraid it must have been rather like a spell  felix told his story feeling it too much not to make it lame and with the tearfulness trembling in his voice and eyes all the time  our little gamin has the most of the good samaritan in him said mr audley tis not quite the end i should have begun at but perhaps it may work the better  dear little boy that he should have remembered that sermon exclaimed wilmet  i am afraid it is more than i do said felix all last summer the more i tried to listen the more i saw how he was changing do you remember it wilmet  yes the text was the joy of the lord is your strength and he said how praising god and going on thinking about his goodness and thankfulness was the way to make our adversaries dissolve before us and never trouble us at all just like the bands of the moabites and ammonites before jehoshaphat  i recollect it well and how i thought it such a likeness of himself said mr audley he was walking over his troubles scarcely seeing them as if they could not dim the shine of his armour while he went on looking up and being thankful i fancy little lance has a good deal of that kind of bright fearless way  he has said felix in a grave thoughtful tone that made the curate look at him and sigh to think how early care and grief had come to make that joyous buoyancy scarce possible to the elder boy little more than seventeen though he was  he is very idle though added wilmet such caricatures as there are all over his books edgars were bad enough but lance puts pig tails and cocked hats to all edgars  so lances visits to the sick stranger remained unobstructed he had no notion of teaching him but the foreign boy in his languor and helplessness curiously fascinated him perhaps from the very contrast of the passive indolent tropical nature with his own mercurial temperament the spaniard or perhaps the old mexican seemed to predominate in fernando as far as could be guessed in one so weak and helpless he seemed very quiet and inanimate seldom wanting or seeking diversion but content to lie still with halfclosed eyes his manner was reserved and with something of courteous dignity especially when lady price came to visit him and the yankeeisms that sometimes dropped from his tongue did not agree with the polish of the tone and still less with the imperious manner in which he sometimes addressed the nurse he seemed though not clever to be tolerably well cultivated he had been at the schools of whatever cities his father had resided in and his knowledge of languages was of course extensive  however he never talked freely to mr audley he had bitterly resented that gentlemans interference one day when he was peremptorily commanding the nurse to place him in a position that had been forbidden and the endeavour to control him had made him fearfully angry there was a stormy outbreak of violent language only checked by a severe rebuke for which he did not forgive the curate he was coldly civil and accepted the attentions he could not dispense with in a grave formal manner that would have been sulky in an english lad but had something of the dreary grandeur of the spanish don from that dark lordly visage and made mr audley half provoked half pitying speak of him always as his cacique he only expanded a little even to lance though the little boy waited on him assiduously chattering about school doings illustrating them on a slate singing to him acting blondin exhibiting whatever he could lay his hands on including the twins whom he bore down one after the other to the great wrath of sibby not to say of little stella herself while theodore took the exhibition with perfect serenity  as to felix he was as lance said the subject of the sick lads fervent admiration perhaps the open fair cheerful though grave countenance fresh complexion and strong steadfast upright bearing had something to do with the strange adoration that in his silent way fernando paid to the youth who looked in from time to time bringing a sort of air of refreshment with his goodnatured shy smile even when he least knew what to say or else it was little lances fervent affection for felix which had conduced to the erection of the elder brother into the idol of fernandos fancy and his briefest visit was the event of the long autumnal days spent in the uncurtained iron bed in the corner of the low room the worship silent though it was was manifest enough to become embarrassing and ridiculous to the subject of it whose sense of duty and compassion was always at war with his reluctance to expose himself to it not another word passed on any religious subject mr audley was not forgiven enough to venture on the attempt the rector was shy and frightened about it and could make no beginning and mr mowbray smith who found great fault with them for their neglect had been fairly stared down by the great black eyes which when the heavy lids were uplifted proved to be of an immense size and force and felix was so sure that it could not be his business while three clergymen were going in and out that he had never done more than describe the weather or retail any fresh bit of london news that had come down to the office  at last however one november day he found fernando sitting up in bed and lance perched on the table talking so earnestly as not to perceive his entrance until fernando broke upon his words there its no use  yes it is cried lance jumping down o fee i am glad you are come i want you to tell him the rights of it  the rights of what lance  tell him that it is all the devils doing and the men he has got on his side and that it was the very thing our saviour came for to set us free only everybody wont said lance clinging to his brothers hand and looking up in his face  thats about right lance said felix but i dont quite know what you are talking about  just this said fernando lance goes on about god being merciful and good and powerfulalmighty as he says but whatever women may tell a little chap like that nobody can think so that has seen the things i have down in the west with my own eyes  felix cried lance say it you know and believe just as i do as everybody good does men and all  yes indeed said felix with all his heart  then tell me how it can be said fernando  felix stood startled and perplexed feeling the awful magnitude and importance of the question but also feeling his own incompetence to deal with it and likewise that wilmet was keeping the tea waiting for him he much wished to say keep it for mr audley but he feared to choke the dawning of faith and he likewise feared the appearance of hesitation  nobody can really explain it he said but thats no wonder one cannot explain a thunderstorm but one knows that it is  thats electricity said fernando  and whats electricity  a fluid that  yes thats another word but you cant get any farther god made electricity or whatever it is and when you talk about explaining it you only get to something that is you know it is and you cant get any farther he repeated  well thats true though science goes beyond you in america  but no searching finds out all about god said felix reverently all we know is that he is so infinitely great and wise that of course we cannot understand why all he does is right any more than a private soldier understands his generals orders  and youyou said fernando are content to say you dont understand  why not said felix  there was a silence fernando seemed to be thinking lance gazed from one to the other as if disappointed that his brother was not more explicit  and how do you know it is true added fernando i mean what lance has been telling me what makes you sure of it if you are  if i am  cried felix startled into indignation to be sure i am  but how  i know it said felix  how  the bible gasped lance impatiently  ay so you have said for ever broke in fernando but what authenticates that  the whole course of history said felix there is a great chain of evidence i know but i never got it up i cant tell it you fernando i never wanted it never even tried to think about the proofs it is all too sure  but wouldnt a mahometan say that said fernando  if he did look at the life of our lord and of mahomet together and see which must be the true prophetthe way the life the truth  that one could do said fernando thoughtfully i say as felix made a movement as if he thought the subject concluded i want to know one thing more lance says it is believing all this that makes youany one i meangood  i dont know what else should said felix smiling a little the question seemed to him so absurd  is it really what makes you go and slave away at that old bosss of yours  why thats necessity and my duty said felix  and is it what makes this little coon come and spend all his play hours on a poor fellow with a broken leg ive been at many schools and never saw the fellow who would do that  oh you are such fun cried lance  all that is right comes from god first and last said felix gravely  and youyou that are no childyou believe all that lance tells me you do and think it makes you what you are  i believe it yes of course and believing it should make me much better than i am i hope it will in time  ah sighed fernando i never heard anything like it since my father said hed take the cowhide to poor old diego if he caught him teaching me niggercant  they left him  poor fellow sighed felix what have you been telling him lance  oh i dont know only why things were good and bad was lances lucid answer and he was then intent on detailing the stories he had heard from fernando he had been in the worst days of southern slavery ere its extinction on the skirts of the deadly warfare with the red indians and the poor lad had really known of horrors that curdled the blood of wilmet and geraldine and made the latter lie awake or dream dreadful dreams all night  but the next day mr audley was startled to hear the two friends in the midst of an altercation when lance had come in for his midday recreation fernando had produced five shillings desiring him to go and purchase a bible for him but lance who had conceived the idea that the scriptures ought not to be touched by an unchristened hand flatly refused offering however to read from his own now lances reading was at that peculiar schoolboy stage which seems calculated to combine the utmost possible noise with the least possible distinctness and though he had good gifts of ear and voice and his reciting and singing were both above the average the moment a book was before him he roared his sentences between his teeth in horrible monotony and as he began with the first chapter of st matthew and was not perfectly able to cope with all the names fernando could bear it no longer and insisted on having the book itself lance shook his head and refused and matters were in this stage when mr audley not liking the echoes of the voices opened the door what is it he asked anxiously  nothing replied fernando proudly trying to swallow his vexation  lance said mr audley rather severely but just then seeing what book the child was holding tight under his arm he decided to follow him out of the room and interrogate  what was it lance  he ought not to touch a biblehe shant have mine said lance resentfully  was he doing anything wrong with it  oh no but he ought not to have it before he is christened and i would have read to him  mr audley knew what lances reading was and smiled  was that all lance i like your guardianship of the bible my boy but it was not given only to those who are christians already or how could any one learn  he shant touch mine though said lance with an odd sturdiness stumping upstairs with his treasure a little brown sixpenny s p c k book but in which his father had written his name on his last birthday but one  mr audley only waited to take down a new testament and present himself at fernandos bedside observing gladly that there was much more wistfulness than offence about his expression  it was a scruple on the young mans part said mr audley smiling though full of anxiety he meant no unkindness  i know he did not said fernando quietly but gazing at the purple book in the clergymans hands  did you want this said mr audley or can i find anything in it for you  thank you and there was a pause the offended manner towards mr audley had been subsiding of late into friendliness under his constant attentions and fernandos desire for an answer prevailed at last felix told me to read the life of christ he said not irreverently and that it would show me he must be true  i hope and trust that so it may be said mr audley more moved than he could bear to show but with fervour in his voice far beyond his words  felix said fernando resting on the name felix does seem as if he must be right mr audley can it be really as he saysand lance that their belief makes them like what they are  most assuredly  and you dont say so only because you are a minister asked the boy distrustfully  i say so because i know it i knew that it is the christian faith that makes all goodness long before i was a minister  but i have seen plenty of christians that were not in the least like felix underwood  so have i but in proportion as they live up to their faith they have what is best in him  i should like to be like him mused fernando i never saw such a fellow he and little lance too seem to belong to something bright and strong that seems inside and outside and i cant lay hold of what it is  one day you will my dear boy said mr audley let me try to help you  fernando scarcely answered save by half a smile and a long sigh of relief but when mr audley put his hand over the long brown fingers they closed upon it     chapter vii  the chessplayers battle    dost thou believe he said that grace  itself can reach this grief  with a feeble voice and a woeful eye  lord i believe was the sinners reply  help thou mine unbelief                                southey   by the beginning of the christmas holidays fernando travis was able to lie on a couch in mr audleys sittingroom his recovery was even tardier than had been expected partly from the shock and partly from the want of vigour of the tropical constitution and he still seemed to be a great way from walking though there was no reason to fear that the power would not return his father wrote preparing for a journey to oregon and seemed perfectly satisfied and he was becoming very much at home with his host  he was much interested in that which he was learning from mr audley and imbibing from the young underwoods the wandering life he had hitherto led without any tenderness save from the poor old negro without time to make friends and often exposed to the perception of some of the darkest sides of human life in the terrible lawlessness of the mexican frontier had hitherto made him dull dreary and indifferent with little perception that there could be anything better but first the kindness and then the faith he saw at bexley had awakened new perceptions and sensations his whole soul was opening to perceive what the love of god and man might be and the sense of a great void and longing to have it satisfied seemed to fill him with a constant craving for the revelation of that inner world whose existence had just dawned upon him  after a little hesitation mr audley decided on reading with geraldine in his presence after he had come into the sittingroom explaining to her how he thought it might be helpful she did not much like it but acquiesced she used to hop in with her sweet smile shy greeting and hand extended to the invalid who used to lie looking at her through his long eyelashes and listening to her low voice reading or answering as if she were no earthly creature but the two were far too much in awe of one another to go any farther and he got on much better with wilmet when she looked in on him now and then with cheery voice and goodnatured care  then fulbert and robina came home and the former was half suspicious half jealous of lances preoccupation with what he chose to denominate a black yankee nigger he avoided the room himself and kept lance from it as much as was in his power and one day lance appeared with a black eye of which he concealed the cause so entirely that felix always afraid of his gamin tendencies entreated fulbert as a friend to ease his mind by telling him it was not given in a street row  i did it said fulbert he was so cocky about his yankee that i could not stand it  why shouldnt he be kind to a poor sick fellow  he has no business to be always bothering about fernando here fernando therefernando for ever i shall have him coming up to school a regular spoon and just not know what to do with him  well fulbert i think if you had a broken leg youd wish some one to speak to you at any rate i cant have lance bullied for his good nature i was very near doing it myself once but i was shamed out of it  were youwere you indeed cried fulbert delighted at this confession of human nature and felix could not help laughing and that laugh did much to bring him down from the don to the brother at any rate fulbert ceased his persecution in aught but word  robina always lances companion followed him devotedly and only hung about the stairs forlorn when he went to fernando without her or if admitted she was quite content to sit serenely happy in her beloved lances presence expecting neither notice nor amusement only watching their occupation of playing at draughts sometimes however lance would fall to playing with her and they would roll on the floor a tumbling mass of legs arms and laughter to the intense diversion of fernando to whom little girls were beings of an unknown order  so came on christmas with the anniversaries so sweet and so sad and the eve of hollydressing when a bundle of bright sprays was left by some kind friend at no 8 and lance and bobbie were vehement to introduce fernando to english holly and english decking  geraldine suggested that they had better wait for either mr audley or wilmet to come in but for this they had no patience and ran down with their arms full of the branches and their tongues going with the description of the nights carols singing them with their sweet young voices as they moved about the room fernando knew now what christmas meant but the joy and exhilaration of the two children seemed to him strange for such a bygone event he asked them if they would have any treat  oh no except perhaps mr audley said he should drink tea one day said robina and then she broke out again hark the herald angels like a little silver bell  suddenly there was a cry of dismay she had been standing on a chair over the mantelpiece sticking holly into the ornaments behind and under which in true mans fashion a good many papers and letters had accumulated one of these papersby some unlucky movementfell and by a sudden waft of air floated irrevocably into the hottest place in the fire  o dear oh dear wailed robina  thats a pretty go cried lancelot  that comes of your open fires observed fernando  what was it asked lance  i dont know i think it was a list of names oh how vexed hell be and wilmet for she told me never to get on a chair over the fender and i forgot bobbies round face was puckering for a cry  no no dont cry bob i told you to get up and ill say so said lance smothering her in his arms after the wont of consoling brothers  i dare say hell not miss it said fernando goodnaturedly he very seldom meddles with those things  bobbies great round gray eyes came out over lances shoulder and flashed amazement and wrath at him im not going to tell stories she said stoutly  no said lance equally scandalised i thought you had learnt better fernando  robina be it observed was ignorant of fernandos untaught state  i only said you could hold your tongue was of course fernandos rejoiner  thats just as bad was the little girls response  but lance you held your tongue about your black eye  thats my affair and nobody elses said lance flushing up and looking cross at the allusion  and fulbert told added robina  will they punish you asked fernando  i think wilmet will because it was disobedience i dont think shell let me have any butter at tea bobbie nearly sobbed mr audley wont punish but hell look and she quite cried now  and do you like that better than not telling said fernando still curious  she looked up amazed again i must i dont like it but i couldnt ever have a happy christmas if i didnt tell i wish they would come that i might have it over  the street door opened at the moment and mr audley and wilmet came in together from lady prices convocation of the parish staff fernando heard the sobbing confession in the passage and lances assurance that he had been art and part in the disobedience and wilmet gravely blaming the child and mr audley telling her not to think so much about the loss as the transgression and then the door was shut and he heard no more till mr audley came in examined the chimneypiece and performed the elegy of the list in a long low whistle  is much harm done fernando asked  not much only i must go and get another list made out and i am afraid i shall not be able to come in again before church  i hope they have not punished her  wilmet recommended not taking the prize prayerbook to church and she acquiesced with tears in her eyes a good childs repentance is a beautiful thing           o happy in repentance school           so early taught and tried   these last words were said to himself as he picked up his various goods and added i must get some tea at the rectory i am sorry to leave you but i hope one of them will come down  they did not except that they peeped in for a moment to wish him goodnight and regretted that they had not known him to be alone  as felix was going out to begin the christmas feast in the darkness of morning he looked in as he usually did since mr audley sleeping out of the house never came in till after early church the nurse who still slept in the room was gone to dress there was only a flickering nightlight and the room looked very desolate and forlorn still more so the voice that called out to him felix oh felix is that you  yes a happy christmas to you said felix  happy there was a sort of groan  why whats the matter have you had a bad night arent you so well  i dont know come here i must speak to you  felix was as usual in a great haste but the tone startled him  felix i cant stand this any longer i must let you know what a frightful intolerable wretch ive been i tried to teach lance to bet  fernando he was so choked with indignation he could not say more  he wouldnt do it not after he understood it it seems he tried it with another little boy at school and one of the bigger ones boxed his ears and rowed him  ay bruce promised me to look after him  so he refused he told me he was on his honour to you not to stay if i did anything your father would have disapproved he did leave me once when i would not leave off  but how could you  i was so boredso intolerably dulland it is the only thing on earth that one cares to do  but lance had nothing to stake  i could lend him ah you dont know what betting is why we all do itwomen boys and all his voice became excited and felix in consternation broke inwhen did you do this  oh weeks ago before i was out of bed when i found my dice in my purse but i have not tried it since with him  with whom then  whydont fall on himwith fulbert he knew what it meant now felix dont come on him for it come on me as much as you please ive been a traitor to you i see it now  anything but that sighed felix too much appalled for immediate forgiving dejected as was the voice that spoke to him  yes yes i know i see the worst thing i could do said fernando turning his face in on the pillow in so brokenhearted a manner that felixs kindness and generosity were roused  stay dont be so downcast he said theres no harm done with lance and you being so sorry will undo it with fulbert i do thank you for telling me really only it upset me at first  upset yes youll be more so when you hear the rest said fernando raising his head again do you know who set that inn on fire  nobody does  well i did  nonsense youve had a bad night you dont know what you are talking about said felix anxiously laying hold of one of the hot handsperceiving that his own christmas day must begin with mercy not sacrifice and beginning to hope the first selfaccusation was also delirious  tell me didnt the fire begin in the ballroom somebody told me so  yes the waiter saw it there  then i did it i threw the end of a cigar among the flummery in the grate cried fernando falling back from the attitude into which he had raised himself with a gesture of despair  nobody can blame you  stay it was after father and uncle had gone i was smoking at the window of our room and the landlord came in and ordered me not because some ladies in the next room objected he told me i might come down to the coffeeroom but i had never heard of such meddling and i jawed him well but he made me give in somehow only when i saw that big ballroom all along the side of the building i just took a turn in it with my cigar to spite him poor diego came up and begged me not but you know the way one does with a nigger oh  felix did not know but the voice broke down in such misery and horror that his soul seemed to sink within him have you had this on your mind all this time he asked kindly  no no it didnt come to me i think ive been a block or a stone the dear faithful fellow that loved me as no one ever did ive been feeling the kiss he gave me at the window all tonight and then ive been fallingfallingfalling in his black armsdowndown to hell itself not that he is there but i murdered him you knowand some one else besides wasnt there  this is like delirium really fernando said felix putting his arms round him to lay him down as he raised himself on his elbow i must call some one if you seem so ill  i wish it was illness said fernando with a shudder oh dont go dont let me goif you can bear to touch mewhen you know all  there cant be any worse to know you had better not talk  i must i must tell you all i really am though you will never let your brothers come near me or the little angelsyour sisters id not have dared look at them myself if i had known it but things never seemed so to me before  felix shivered at the thought of what he was to hear but he gave himself up to listen kindly and to his relief he gathered from the incoherent words that there was no great stain of crime as he had feared but that the boy had come to open his eyes to the evils of the life in which he had shared according to his age and saw them in their foulness and with an agonised sense of shame and pollution felix could not help asking whether this had long dwelt on his thoughts  no he said thats the wonder i thought myself a nice gentlemanly honourable fellow oh with a groan fancy that i never thought of recollecting these things or what they have made me only somehow when those children seemed so shocked at my advising them to hold their tongues about their bit of mischiefi thought first what fools you all were to be so scrupulous and then i recollected the lots of things i have concealed till i began to think is this honourwould it seem so to lanceor felix and then came down on me the thought of what you believe of god seeing it all and laying it up against one for judgment and i knowi know it is true and there came another heavy groan and the great eyes shone in the twilight in terror  if you know that is true said felix steadfastly and tenderly you know something else too you know whom he sent into the world for our pardon for these things  there was a tightening of the grasp as if in acquiescence and comfort but the nurse came back to tidy the room and still fernando clung to felix and would not let him go she opened the shutters and then both she and felix were dismayed to see how ill and spent her patient looked for she had slept soundly through his night of silent anguish and remorsemisery that as felix saw by his face was pressing on him still with intolerable weight  by the time the woman had finished mr audley came in and seeing at once that felixs absence was accounted for by fernandos appearance he stepped up at once to the bed full of solicitude felix hardly knew whether to reply or escape but fernandos heart was too full for his words not to come at once  no i am not worse but i see it all nowtell him felix i cannot say it again  fernando thinks felix found he could hardly speak the words eitherfernando is afraid that it was an accident of his own  dont say an accident it was passion and spite broke in fernando  that caused the fire at the fortinbras arms felix was obliged to finish  not on purpose exclaimed mr audley  almost as much as if it had been said fernando i smoked to spite the landlord for interfering and threw away the end too angry to heed where there he added grimly felix wont tell me how many i murdered besides my poor old black how many  do not speak in that way my poor boy said mr audley at least this is better than the weight you have had on your mind so long  how many repeated fernando  two more lives were lost said mr audley gently mr joness baby and its nurse but you must not use harder words than are just fernando it was a terrible result but consequences do not make the evil  he made a kind of murmur then turning round uneasily said that is not all i have seen myself mr audley  mr audley looked at felix who spoke with some difficulty and perplexity he has been very unhappy all night he thinks things wrong that he never thought about before  mr audley felt exceedingly hopeful at those words but he was alarmed at the physical effect on his patient and felt that the present excitement was mischievous i understand in part he said but it seems to me that he is too restless and uncomfortable to think or understand now it may be that he may yet see the joy of to day but no more talk now have you had your breakfast  he shook his head but felix had to go away and breakfast and dressing restored fernando to a more tranquil state he slept too wearied out when he was placed on his couch while felix was at christmas service singing as he had never sung before        peace on earth and mercy mild       god and sinners reconciled   oh was the poor young stranger seeing the way to that reconciliation and when lancelots sweet clear young notes rose up in all their purity and the rosy honest face looked upwards with an expression elevated by the music felix could not help thinking that the boy had verily sung those words of truth and hope into the poor dark lonely heart kindness steadfastness truth in that merry hearted child had been doing their work and when lance marched away with the other lesser choristers the elder brother felt as if the younger had been the more worthy to draw near in faith  fernando was more like himself when felix came in but he was a good deal shaken and listened to the conventional christmas greeting like mockery shrinking from the sisters when they looked in on him with what they thought a fresh access of shyness but which was a feeling of terrible shame beside the innocence he ascribed to them  i wish i could help that poor boy sighed wilmet he does look so very miserable  and geraldines eyes swam in tears as she thought of the loneliness of his christmas and without that christmas joy that even her mothers dulled spirit could feelthe joy that bore them through the recollections of this time last year  lances desire to cheer took the more material form of acting as fernandos special waiter at the consumption of the turkey which mr audley had insisted on having from home and eating in company with the rest to whom it was a new experience being only a faint remembrance even to felix and wilmet but fernando had no appetite and even the sight of his little friend gave him a pang  do you want any one to stay with you asked lance if cherry would dofor felix said he would take fulbert and me out for a jolly long walk to see the icicles at bolds hatch  no i want no one you are better without me  ill stay if you do want it said lance very reluctantly i dont like your not having one bit of christmas shall i sing you one christmas hymn before i go and lance broke into the herald angels again        mild he lays his glory by       born that man no more may die       born to raise the sons of earth       born to give them second birth   fernandos face was bathed in tears he held out his arms and to little lances great amazement somewhat to his vexation he held him fast and kissed him  what did you do that for he asked in a gruff astonished voice  never mind said fernando only i think i see what this day can be now go  presently mr audley came softly in the lads face was turned in to his cushion his handkerchief over it and as the young priest stood watching him what could be done but pray for the poor struggling soul at last he turned round and looked up  i saw it again he said with a sigh  saw what  what you all mean it touched me and seemed true and real when lance was singing what was itborn to save the sons of earth oh but such as i am and at my age too  and with a few words from mr audley there came such a disburthening of selfaccusation as before to felix it seemed as if the terrible effects of his wilfulness at the innhorrified as he was at them were less oppressive to his conscience than his treachery to his host in his endeavour to gamble with the little boys he had found a pair of dice in his purse when looking for the price of a bible and the sight had awakened the vehement hereditary mexican passion for betting the bane of his mothers race his father as a clever man of the world hated and prohibited the practice but fernando had what could easily become a frenzy for that excitement of the lazy south and even while he had seen it in its consequences the intense craving for the amusement had mastered him more than once when loathing the dulness and weariness of his confinement and shrinking from the doctrines he feared to accept he knew it was dishonourable yet he had given way and he felt like one utterly stained unpardonable hopeless but there was less exaggeration in his state of mind than in the early morning  and when mr audley dwelt on the hope of sinners his eyes glistened and brightened and at the further words that held out to him the assurance that all these sins might be washed away and he himself enabled to begin a new life his looks shone responsively but he shook his head soonit went away from him he said poor boy it was too great and good to be true  then mr audley put prayer before him as a means of clinging even blindly to the cross that he was barely beginning to grasp and the boy promised he would do anything they would could he but hope to be freed from the horrible weight of sense of hopeless pollution that had come upon him  for some days he did not seem able to read anything but the gospels and the baptismal service and at length after a long silence he said mr audley if your sermon is finished can you listen to me may i be baptized  then indeed the curates heart bounded but he had to keep himself restrained the fathers consent he had secured beforehand but he thought fernando ought to write to him and it was also needful to consult the rector as to the length of actual preparation and probation  then when the question came can i indeed be like felix and lancelot the reply had to be cautious you will be as entirely pardoned as entirely belonging to the holiness within and without as they but how far you will have the consciousness i cannot tell and it is very probable that your temptations may be harder guilt may be forgiven while habits retain their power and they have been guarded taught selfrestraint and had an example before them in their father such as very few have been blessed with  fernando sighed long and sadly and said then you do not think it will make much difference  the difference between life and death but you must expect to have to believe rather than feel but go on and it will all be clear  the rector was at first anxious to wait for definite sanction from the father but as mr audley was sure of the permission he had received and no letter could be had for several months he agreed to examine the lad and write to the bishopa new bishop who had been appointed within the last year and who was coming in the spring for a confirmation  mr bevan was really delighted with the catechumen and wrote warmly of him the reply was that if the baptism could take place the day before the confirmation which was to be in a months time the bishop himself would like to be present and the youth could be confirmed the next day there was much that was convenient in this for it gave time for fernando to make progress in moving about he had made a start within the last week or two was trying to use crutches and had been out on fine days in a chair and once or twice lady price had taken him for a drive though she had never thought of doing so by geraldine the doctor said that change of air would probably quite restore his health and he had only to wait to be a little less dependent before he was to go to a tutor an old friend of the audley family  everything promised well but one wet afternoon in the interim between the end of lances and that of fulberts holidays mr audley while coming down from a visit to mrs underwood fancied he heard an ominous rattle and opening the door suddenly found fernando and fulbert eagerly throwing the dice and with several shillings before them  both started violently as he entered and fulbert put his arm and hand round as if to hide the whole affair while fernando tried to look composed  all that the curate said in his surprise was one sharp sentence fernando travis if you are to renounce the devil you will have to begin by throwing those dice into the fire  fernandos eyes looked furious and he swept the dice and the money into his pocketall but three shillings fulbert stole out of the room quietly no doubt these were his winnings which he did not dare to touch  mr audley took up a book and waited fully expecting that sorrow would follow but fernando did not speak and when at length he did on some indifferent matter it was in his ordinary tone well there must be patience no doubt repentance would come at night no the evening passed on and fernando was ready for all their usual occupations perhaps it would come with felix or in the dawn after a troubled night alas no and moreover felix to whom it was necessary to speak was exceedingly angry and vexed and utterly incredulous of there being any good in the character that could be so fickle if not deceitful and hypocritical his own resolute temper had no power of comprehending the unmanliness of erring against the better will he was absolutely incapable of understanding the horrible lassitude and craving for excitement that must have tempted fernando and he was hard and even ashamed of himself for having ever believed in the lads sincerity  this anger too made him speak with such a threatening tone to fulbert as to rouse the doggedness of the boys nature all that could be got out of fulbert was that his going there was all felixs doing and he would not manifest any sign of regret such as would be any security against his introducing the practice among the clergy orphans or continuing it all his life he was not a boy given to confidences and neither wilmet nor cherry could get him beyond his glum declaration that it was felixs fault he only wanted to keep out of the fellows way they could only take comfort in believing that he was really ashamed and that he suffered enough within to be a warning against the vice itself  as to fernando he made no sign he went on as if nothing had happened and nothing was observable about him but that he showed himself intensely weary of his present mode of life put on at times the manners that were either those of the spanish don or of the indian cacique and seemed to shrink from the prospect of the english tutor yet he continued his preparation for baptism and mr bevan was satisfied with him but mr audley was perplexed and unhappy over the reserve that had sprung up between them and could not decide whether to make another attempt or leave the lad to himself  one afternoon only ten days from the time fixed for the bishops visit mr audley returned from a clerical meeting to find an unexpected visitor in the roomnamely alfred travis fernandos uncle a more americanised and rougher person than his brother he rose as he entered good morning mr audley you have taken good care of your charge he is fit to start with me tomorrow see a surgeon in townthen to liverpool  indeed mr audley caught a deprecating look from fernando do you come from his father  wellyes and no his father is still in the oregon but he and i have always been oneand opening the boys letters and finding him ready to move i thought as i had business in england id come and fetch him and just settle any claim the fellow at yonder hotel may have cheek enough to set up since fernan was green enough to let it out  may i ask if you have any authority from his father  authority bless you william will be glad to see his boy we dont go by authority between brothers  because continued mr audley i heard from your brother that he wished fernando to remain with me to receive an english education  all sentiment and stuff he knew better before we had sailed an english squire in this wretched old country forsooth when the new republic is before him no no mr audley ill be open with you i saw what you were up to when i got your letter and fernangot his lesson very well he had and when i came down a friend in london gave me another hint it wont do i can assure you that style of thing is all very well for you spruce parsons of good family as you call it in the old country but we are not going to have a rising young fellow like this with a prospect of what would buy out all your squires and baronets in the old country beslobbered and befooled with a lot of puseyite cant youve had your turn of him it is time he should come and be a man again  mr audley was dizzy with consternation fernando was no child he was full sixteen and he was so far recovered that his health formed no reason for detaining him if he chose to go with his uncle he must if notwhat then he looked at fernando who sat uneasily  you hear what your uncle says he asked  i told him said fernando i must wait for a fortnight he spoke with eyes cast down but not irresolutely  his uncle broke outhe knew what that meant it was only that he might be flattered by the bishop and all the ladies and made a greater fool of than ever no no he must be out again by may and he should just have time to take fernan to one of the gay boarding houses at saratoga and leave him there to enjoy himself  i have letters from my father said fernando looking up to mr audley before he went to oregon he said nothing  do you wish to stay said mr audley feeling that all depended on that and trying to hide the whirl of anxiety and disappointment he felt  the answer was not what he expected fernando sat upright in his chair looked up to him and then at his uncle and said low but resolutely i will stay  then you shall stay said mr audley  you have worked upon him i see sir with your oldworld prejudiced superstition said alfred travis evidently under the delusion that he was keeping his temper a proper fool my brother was to leave him to you but you do it at your peril i shall see if theres power even in this old country to keep a boy from his own relations youll see me again fernan you had better make ready  the words were not unaccompanied with expletives such as had never been personally uttered to charles audley before and that brought the hot colour to his cheek when he looked round fernandos face was covered with his hands oh mr audley he cried as his uncle hastily shut the door is he going to send for the police  i do not believe he can do any such thing said mr audley seeing that fernando was in great nervous agitation i have authority from your father he has none and you are old enough to make your own decision you really mean and wish to stay he added  i told him so from the first said fernando  then he has no power to force you away  fernando was silent then he said if i could have gone after my baptism  would you have wished that said mr audley somewhat disappointed  the tears were now on the long black lashes  oh dont think me ungrateful or but this english life does come over me as intolerably dull and slow no life nor go in it sometimes i feel sick of it and going back to books and all after what i have been used to if my uncle could wait for my baptism or more hesitating if i could be baptized at once men do lead christian lives out there i would try to keep from evil mr audley i see your face is this another temptation of the devil  i think it is an attempt of his said mr audley sadly even here you have not been able to abstain entirely from giving way to your old passion when you had little temptation and felt your honour bound what will it be when you have comparatively no restraint  i am resolved not to go unbaptized said fernando i said so from the first but he will not wait yet if my father sends for me i must go  then it will be your duty and you will have more right to look for help besides a summons from your father could not come for three or four months and in that time you would have had time to gain something in christian practice and training  oh there is the bell must you go mr audley he will come back  i wish i could stay but smith is gone to dearport and i do not know whether the rector is in besides this must be your own doing fernan not mine i shall pray for you that you well know pray for yourself for this is a real crisis of life god bless you my dear boy he laid his hand on the head and fernando looked up gratefully then said you never did that before may lance come to me if he has not gone  i will call him said mr audley seeing that he really dreaded being alone the little boy was on the stairs with something in his hand go in to fernan he was told he wants you what have you got there  this queer drawing cherry found it in an old portfolio and has been copying it  it was ketzschs outline of the chessplayer and it almost startled mr audley by its appropriateness he went out to evensong and never was more glad to get back to reinforce the feeble garrison  lance opened the front door to him im so glad you are come he said mr bruce is there  not the uncle  no only mr bruce  mr bruce was a lawyer and a very respectable man in whom mr audley felt confidence he rose at the clergymans entrance and asked to speak to him in another room so he was taken into the little back diningroom and beganthis is a very unpleasant business mr audley this gentleman is very much annoyed and persuaded that he has a right to carry off his nephew but as i told him it all turns upon the fathers expressions have you any written authority from him  mr audley had more than one letter thanking him and expressing full satisfaction in the proposed arrangements for fernando and this mr bruce thought was full justification together with the youths own decided wishes the words were likewise clear by which william travis had given consent to his sons baptism but there was no witness of them mr bruce explained that alfred travis who seemed to regard fernando as the common property of the brothers had come to him in what he gently termed a great state of excitement complaining of a puseyite plot he had evidently taken umbrage at the tone of the letters he had opened for his brother and had been further prejudiced by some dearport timber merchant he had met at liverpool who had told him how the parson had got hold of his nephew and related a farrago of gossip about st oswalds he was furious at the opposition and could not understand that law in the old country was powerless in this case because he was neither father nor guardian in fact he seemed to be master of his brother and mr bruce told mr audley that it was quite to be considered whether though law was on his side now the father might not be brought over to the brothers side be very angry at the detention of the boy and refuse the payment which while he was in america could not be forced from him of that mr audley could happily afford to run the risk and mr bruce said he had also set before the young gentleman that he might have to suffer much displeasure from his father for his present refusal although his right to make it was incontestable to this fernando had likewise made up his mind and mr bruce who had never seen him before thought he looked utterly unfit for a long journey and sea voyage so that the uncle had taken nothing by his application to the law  fernando was flushed and panting but more resolute for resentment at the attempt at force had come to back him up and rouse the spirit of resistance not half an hour had elapsed before there was another ring at the door the uncle and lawyer were come together now it was to make a last offer to fernando mr alfred travis offered to take him up to london the next day and there to have advice as to the safety of the voyage in the meantime letting him be baptized if nothing else would satisfy him but by some london clergymannot one of the bexley set whom the uncle regarded with such aversion  fernando drew himself up and stood leaning on the end of the sofa thank you uncle he said i cannot i am obeying my father now and i will not leave those to whom he trusted me  there followed a volley of abuse of his english obstinacy and spanish pride and canting conceit which made mr bruce stand aghast and fernando look up with burning cheeks and eyes glowing like hot coals but with the indian impassibility he did not speak till alfred travis had threatened him not only with his fathers displeasure but with being cast off by both and left to his english friends charity  my father will not said fernando if he sends for me i will come but there his strength suddenly collapsed and he was forced to sit down and lean back  well fernan said his uncle suddenly withdrawing his attempt when he found it vain you seem hardly in marching order so im off by the night train but if you change your mind in the next week write to me at peter brownsyou knowand ill run down i will save you the coming out by yourself goodbye  mr bruce tarried one moment to aver that he was unprepared for his clients violence and that he thought the nephew had done quite right  the door was shut and mr audley came back holding out his hand but fernando did not take it he was occupied in supporting himself by the furniture from the sofa to the fireplace where holding by the mantelpiece with one hand he took his dice from his pocket with the other and threw them into the reddest depth then he held the hand to mr audley who wrung it and said it has been a hard fight my boy  fernando laid his weary head on his shoulder and said if my father is not poisoned against me  do not fear that fernando you are where he left you you have given up something for the sake of your new lord and master you will have his armour another time  fernando let himself be helped to sit down and sighed he was thoroughly worn out and his victory was not such as to enliven his spirits he took up the drawing that lay on the table and gazed on it in a sort of dreamy fascination  you have checked him this time said mr audley  here or there i will never bet again said fernan solemnly  god help me to keep the resolution it is the one thing that i care for and i know i should have begun the first day i was away from you  i think that with those tastes you cannot make too strong a resolution against it said mr audley  their dinner was brought in but fernando had no appetite he soon returned to his chess player and seemed to be playing over the game but he was too much tired for talk and soon went to bed where after a short sleep feverishness set in bringing something approaching to delirium the nurse had gone a fortnight previously but as he was still too helpless to have no one within call felix slept on the bed in the corner of the room  when he came down the opening of the door was greeted by dont let him come is mr audley there  yes he is not gone  then he knew felix but soon began again to talk of the game at chess evidently mixing up his uncle with the personage with the long feather  he has been checked once ive taken one piece of his he is gone now will he come back after my baptism no i shall go to him  this lasted till past midnight when as they were deliberating whether to send for mr rugg he fell soundly asleep and awoke in the morning depressed but composed and peaceful and this state of things continued the encounter with his uncle and the deliberate choice had apparently given some shock to his nerves and whenever night recurred there came two or three hours of misery and apparently of temptation and terror it took different forms sometimes it was half in sleepthe acting over again of one or two horrible scenes that he had partly witnessed in the southern states when an emancipator had been hunted down and the slaves who had listened to him savagely punished in spite of his spanish blood the horror had been ineffaceable and his imagination connected it with the crowd of terrors that had revealed themselves to his awakened conscience he seemed to think that if he lost in the awful game of life he should be handed over to that terrible slavemaster and there were times when diegos fate and his own lapses so fastened on his mind as to make him despair of ever being allowed to quit that slavemasters dominions and that again joined with alarm lest his uncle should return and claim him  sometimes likewise the old wandering life with the flashes of rollicking mirth and excitement rather glimpsed at and looked forward to than really tasted would become so alluring a contrast to the flat and tastelessnay as it seemed to him tedious and toilsomefuture sketched out for him and the restraints and constant watchfulness of a christians life appeared so distressing a bondage that his soul seemed to revolt against it and he would talk of following his uncle at once to london while yet it was time and writing to him the next morning this state was sure to be followed by a passion of remorse and sheer delirious terror lest he should be given up to the enemy who seemed now to assume to his fancy the form of his uncle a great deal was no doubt delirious and this betrayed the struggles which he had been for weeks fighting out in silence and apparent impassiveness but it was impossible not to feel that therewith was manifested the wrestling with the prince of darkness ere his subject should escape from his territory and claim the ransom of his manumission mr audleyafter the second nightwould not let felix remain but took the watch entirely on himself and fought the battle with the foe by prayer and psalm sleep used to come before morning and by day fernando was himself again very subdued and quiet and in fact having lost a good deal of ground as to health  strange to say the greatest pleasure he had at this time was sitting in the upstairs parlour the custom had begun in consequence of his nervous shuddering at being left alone lest his uncle should return and felix and geraldine had then proposed taking him to their mother who was rather interested than annoyed by his presence and indeed all her gentle motherly instinct was drawn out by his feebleness and lameness she talked to him kindly and quite rationally and he was wonderfully impressed and soothed by her tenderness it was so utterly unlike anything he had ever even seen that he watched her with a sort of awe while cherry worked read aloud or drew and felt proud of being able to fetch what was beyond the capacity of her little errand boy bernard  the children too entertained him he was a little afraid of bernards roughness but delighted in watching him and he and little stella were intensely admiring friends she always knew him cooed at him and preferred the gold of his watchchain to all things in nature or art then when wilmet angela and lance came home and family chatter began the weary anxious brain rested and even in that room so sad to most eyes fernando began to realise what christian peace and cheerfulness could be     chapter viii  the home    within those walls each fluttering guest  is gently lured to one safe nest  without tis moaning and unrest                                keble   a great delight came to wilmet and geraldine the day of the bishops visit no other than aldas being able to spend a week with them miss pearson spared wilmet that whole afternoon that she might go up to meet her at the station whither she was escorted by a maid going down to centry  there she was in her pretty black silk with violet trimmings looking thoroughly the grown young lady but clinging tight to her twin in an overflow of confused happiness even while they stood together to get their first glance of the bishop who came down by the same train and was met by mr bevan with the carriage  im glad it is so nice and warm it is better for fernan and cherry can go said wilmet ready for joy about everything  nice and warm tis much colder than in london said alda with a shiver has cherry kept well this winter  quite well she walks much better and marilda  oh marilda is always well rude health her mother calls it what do you think she has sent you wilmet a darling little watch just like this one of mine  o alda you should not have let her it is too much fernan wanted to give lance a watch but felix would not let him  yes but he is not like uncle thomas and it makes you like me  that we shall never be quite again sighed wilmet  oh a little setting off and trimming up ive brought down lots of things aunt mary said i might what is this youth like wilmetis he a boy or a young man  i dont know said wilmet he is younger than felix if that helps you  well americans are old of their age i have met some at mr ropers oh and do you know mrs roper told aunt mary that these travises are quite millionaires and that this youths mother was a prodigious mexican heiress aunt mary wants to ask him to kensington palace gardens when he comes up to town im glad i am in time for the christening doesnt he have godfathers and godmothers  yes he would have nobody but felix and mr audley and lady price chose to be his godmother indeed there was nobody else  you could not well be certainly laughed alda oh and ive brought a dress down i thought some of us might be asked to the rectory in the evening  my dear alda as if such a thing ever happened  ah you see i have been so long away as to forget my ladys manners  mr audley is going and fernan was asked but he is not anything like well enough so when mamma and the little ones go to bed we are to come down and spend the evening with him  fancy wilmet i have quite been preparing marilda for her confirmation she had hardly been taught anything and never could have answered the questions if she had not come to me she is always asking me what papa said about this and that and it is quite awkward she will carry out everything so literally poor dear girl  she must be very good  oh to be sure she is but just fancy she keeps a tithe of her pocketmoney to give to the offertory so scrupulously she would really not buy something she wanted because it would have been just a shilling into her tenth im so glad she is confirmed i never knew what to do at church before i couldnt go home by myself and now a servant always waits for us oh how fast the poor hotel is building again it will brighten our street a little dear me i did not know how dingy it was  nothing could look dingy where two such fair bright faces were but aldas became awestruck and anxious as she went up to her mothers room indeed mrs underwood looked up at her rather confused and scarcely knowing the fashionable young lady and it was only when the plumed hat was laid aside and the two heads laid together their fair locks mingling that she knew she had her elder twins again and stroked their faces with quiet delight  there was scarcely more than time to kiss the little ones and contend with stellas shyness before first lance hurried in and then felix excused from his work two hours earlier he could only just run up and dress before he convoyed geraldine to church she having the first turn of the chair helped her to her seat near the font and then came back for fernando who was under his special charge  fernando sat looking very pale and with the set expression of the mouth that always made cherry think of indians at the stake his little new prayerbook was in his hand and he was grasping it nervously but he said nothing as felix helped him up and lance held his crutch for him it was his first entrance into a place of worship they had intended to have accustomed him a little to the sights and sounds but the weather and his ailment had prevented them he was drawn to the porch and there felix partly lifted him out and up the step while lance took his hat for him and as they were both wanted for the choir procession that was to usher the bishop into church they had to leave him in his place under geraldines protection  he had not in the least realised the effect of the interior of a church st oswalds was a very grand old building with a deep chancel a good deal raised seen along a vista of heavy columns and arched vaults lighted from the clerestory and with a magnificent chancelarch the season was lent and the colouring of the decorations was therefore grave but all the richer and the light coming strongly in from the west window immediately over the childrens heads made the contrast of the bright sunlight and of the soft depths of mystery more striking and to an eye to which everything ecclesiastical was absolutely new the effect was almost overwhelming that solemnity and sanctity of long centuries the peaceful hush the grave beauty and grandeur almost made him afraid to breathe and cherry sat by his side with her expressive face composed into the serious but happy look that accorded with the whole scene  he durst not move or speak his was a silent passive nature except when under strong stimulus and cherry respected his silence a great deal too much to break upon it by any information she was half sorry when the noise of steps showed that the congregation were beginning to drop in chiefly of the other young confirmation candidates then presently alda came and whispered to her that wilmet could not leave mamma and presently after lady price bustled in with her daughter looked severely at alda under the impression that she was wilmet very improperly tricked out and pressed fernandos hand before going on to her own place then came the low swell of the organ another new sensation to one who had only heard opera music then the approaching sound of the voices geraldine gave him the book open at the processional psalm and the whiteclad choir passed by one of the first pair of choristers being lance singing with all his might and that merry monkeyface full of a childs beautiful happy reverence and again could be recognised felix mr audley mr bevan all whom the poor sick stranger had come to love best all to his present perception glorified and beautiful they had told him it would be all faith and no sight but he seemed to find himself absolutely within that brighter better sphere to which they belonged to see them walking in it in their white robes to hear their songs of praise and to know whence came that atmosphere that they carried about with them and that he had felt when it was a riddle to him  and so the early parts of the service passed by him not so much attended to or understood as filling him with a kind of dreamy rapturous trance as the echoes of the new home to which he with all his heavy sense of past stain and present evil propensity was gaining admission and adoption for the first time he was really sensible of the happiness of his choice and felt the compensation for what he gave up  when the second lesson was ended and the clergy and the choir in their surplices moved down to encircle the font it was as if they came to gather him in among them felix came and helped him up he could stand now with one support and this was his young godfathers right arm to which he held tightly but without any nervous convulsivenesshe was too happy for that nowduring the prayers that entreated for his being safely gathered into the ark and the gospel of admission into the kingdom he had an impulse to loose his clasp and stand alone at the beginning of the vows but he could not he had not withdrawn his hand before he was forced again to lean his weight upon the steady arm beside him  nothing had been able to persuade lady price that she was not to make all the vows as for an infant but luckily nobody heard her except her husband and the other sponsors for it was a full clear steadfast voice that made reply i renounce them all and as the dark deep eyes gazed far away into the west window and felix felt the shudder through the whole frame he knew the force of that renunciation and how it gave up that one excitement that the lad really cared for and when that final and carefullyguarded vow of obedience was uttered the pressure on his arm seemed to show that the moral was felt of that moments endeavour to stand alone  the sound of prayer save in his own chamber was so entirely new that no doubt the force of the petitions was infinitely enhanced and the entreaty for the death of the old adam had a definite application to those old habits and tastes that at times exerted their force the right hand was ready and untrembling when the rector took it the stream of water glittered as it fell on the awestruck brow and jetty hair and the eyes shone out with a deep resolute lustre as ferdinand audley was baptized into the holy name and sworn a faithful soldier and servant  he had begged to be baptized by the english version of his name the spanish one had grown up by a sort of accident and had always been regretted by his father he had wished much to take the name of felix but they were so certain that this would not be approved that they had persuaded him out of it he was soon set down again by geraldines side and she put out her hand and squeezed his hard looking up into his face with tearful eyes of welcome  when the last sounds of the voluntary had died away and the congregation had gone she ventured again to look up at him and say i am so glad  why did you never tell me it was like this he said i should never have hung back one moment now nothing can touch me since i belong to this  nothing can really said geraldine softly above all when it is sealed to us tomorrow  then there came a movement from the vestry and the rector and mr audley were seen following the bishop who came down to where the two lame children still sat together and putting his hand upon ferdinands head with the hair still wet gave him his blessing before he spoke further it was only a word or two of congratulation but such as to go very deep and then seeing that the boy looked not excited but worn and wearied he added you are going home to rest i shall see you tomorrow after the confirmation and then he shook hands with him and with geraldine asking if she were the little girl of whom he had been told  she is very young said mr bevan strongly impressed with the littleness of the figure but she has been a communicant for more than a year and she isa very good child  i can believe so said the bishop smiling to her i have heard of your father my dear and of your brother  cherry coloured rosy red but was much too shy to speak and the rector and bishop went away leaving only mr audley  are you very much tired fernan  i dont know he half smiled  i think he is he is too happy to know it said geraldine  please let him go home first  so mr audley helped him out to the chair where felix alda and lance were waiting and he said thank you and held out his hand while lance eagerly shook it saying now it is right at last and heres aldaisnt she a stunner  i thought it was wilmet said fernan and alda went into church to keep cherry company thinking how curiously blind the male sex were not to distinguish between her dress and poor dear wilmets  mr audley was more than satisfied he was surprised and comforted he had prepared to meet either disappointment or excitement in his charge he found neitheronly a perfect placid content as of one who had found his home and was at rest the boy was too much tired after his many bad nights and the days exertion to say or think much all he did say was i shall mind nothing now that i know what it is to be one of you  mr audley tried to remember that there must be a reaction but he could not bring himself to fear or to warn or do anything but enjoy the happiest day of his three years ministry  he had to go to the rectory dinnerparty and leave his neophyte to the tendance of the underwoods felix sat with his friend in a great calm silence while the rest were taken up by the counterattraction upstairs where alda was unpacking an unrivalled store of presents from herself and marilda useful and ornamental such as seemed a perfect embarras de richesses to the homely scantilyendowed children that little gold watch was the prize and wonder of all it was the first in the family except that felix wore his fathers and alda knew how an elder girl was scorned at school if she had none but wilmet though very happy with hers smiled and would not agree to having met with disrespect for want of it then there were drawingbooks for cherry and a knife of endless blades for lance and toys for the little ones and dressesa suit for wilmet like aldas plainest sunday one and aldas last years silk for geraldine and some charming little cashmere pelissesaunt marys special present to the two babiesthings that would lengthen wilmets purse for many a day to come and a writingcase for felix and all the absent remembered too uncle thomas had given alda a fivepound note to buy presents and marilda had sent every one something besides mostly of such a matteroffact useful type that alda stood and laughed at them and mrs underwood was pleased with the exhibition and smiled and admired only her attention was tired out at last and she was taken early to her own room  the elder ones went down to sit round the fire in mr audleys room where ferdinand insisted on leaving his sofa to geraldine and betaking himself to the easychair where he leant back content and happy to watch the others through his eyelashes alda was a little on her company manners at the first but all the others were at perfect ease as they sat in the dim light felix on the floor by cherry who delighted in a chance of playing fondling tricks with his hair and fingers the twins in mr audleys big chair where they could lean against each other and lance crosslegged on the hearth rug roasting chestnuts of which a fellow chorister had given him a pocketful and feeding every one in turn  geraldine gave a sigh to the wish that poor dear edgar were there  he is very happy said alda  oh yes but i wish he had not missed being here tomorrow i wonder when he will come home  i cannot guess aunt mary wants to go down the rhine next summer only she is not quite sure it is not the rhone and if so i suppose he would join us there  it is a whole year since we have set eyes on him said felix  but i believe he writes more to cherry than anybody does not he  oh yes and sends me lovely photographs to copy such a beauty of himself have you seen it  i should think i had they have set it up in a little gold frame on the drawingroom table and everybody stands and says how handsome it is and aunt mary explains all about him till i am tired of hearing it  and clem  oh clem came to luncheon yesterday he is very much grown and looks uncommonly demure and as much disposed to set everybody to rights as ever  but alda did not enter much more into particulars she led away the conversation to the sights she had seen in their summer tour and as she had a good deal of descriptive power she made her narratives so interesting that time slipped quickly past and the young company was as much surprised as mr audley was when he came home and found them all there not yet gone to bed they were greatly ashamed and afraid they had done ferdinand harm and all were secretly very anxious about the night but though the wakeful habit and night feverishness were not at once to be broken through yet the last impression was the strongest and the longdrawn aisle the dim religious light and the white procession were now the recurring images all joyful all restful truly as if the bird had escaped out of the snare of the fowler real sleep came sooner than usual and fernan rose quite equal to the fatigue of the coming day the confirmation day when again geraldine had to sit beside himthis newly admitted to the universal brotherhood instead of being beside that dear edgar of her own for whom her whole heart craved as she thought how their preparation had begun together beside her fathers chair  their place was now as near the choir as possible and they were brought in as before very early so that fernan gazed with the same eager unsated eyes into the chancel and at the altar admitted as he was farther into his true home  the church was filled with candidates from the villages round as well as from the town and the litany preceded the rite which was to seal the young champions ere the strife the bishop came down to the two lame children and laid his hands on the two bent heads ere he gave his final brief address exhorting the young people to guard preciously and preserve by many a faithful eucharist that mark which had sealed them to the day of redemption through all this worlds long hot trial and conflict  there was holiday at both schools and felix had been spared to take his place in the choir but mr froggatt could not do without him afterwards as the presence of so many of the country clergy in the town was sure to fill the readingroom and shop and he was obliged to hurry off as soon as he came out of church now the bishop had the evening before asked lady price whether that son of poor mr underwoods were present among the numerous smart folk who thronged her drawingroom to which my lady had replied no he was a nice gentlemanly youth certainly but considering all things and how sadly he had lowered himself she thought it better not in fact some might not be so well pleased to meet him  the bishop took the opportunity of trying to learn from the next person he fell in with namely mr ryder how felix had lowered himself and received an answer that showed a good deal of the schoolmasters disappointment but certainly did not show any sense of felixs degradation and what he said was afterwards amplified by mr audley whom the bishop took apart and questioned him with much interest upon both ferdinand travis and the underwood family of whom he had only heard when immediately after his appointment his vote for the orphan school had been solicited for the two boys and he had been asked to subscribe to the comment on the philippians mr audley felt that he had a sympathising listener and was not slow to tell the whole story of the familywhat the father had been what felix now was and how his influence and that of little lancelot had told upon their young inmate the bishop listened with emotion and said i must see that boy is the mother in a state in which she would like a call from me but there an interruption had come and when the country clergy came in the morning mr audley had thought it fittest not to swell the numbers unnecessarily and had kept himself out of the way and tried to keep his fellowcurate  so he had seen no more of the bishop until some little time after he and fernan had lunched and were it must be confessed making up for their unrestful nights by having both dropped asleep one on his chair the other on the sofa there came a ring to the door and lance who had a strong turn for opening it found himself face to face with the same tall grayhaired gentleman at whom he had gazed in the rochet and lawnsleeves he stood gazing up openmouthed  i think i have seen you in the choir and heard you too said the bishop kindly taking lances paw which might have been cleaner had he known what awaited it mr audley lives here i think  lance was for once without a word to say for himself though his mouth remained open all he did was unceremoniously to throw wide mr audleys door and bolt upstairs leaving his lordship to usher himself in while mr audley started up and ferdinand would have done the same had he been able before he was forbidden  there was a kindly talk upon his health and plans how he was to remain at bexley till after easter and his first communion and then mr audley would take him up to london to be inspected by a first rate surgeon before going down to the tutors the tutor proved to be an old schoolfellow and great friend of the bishop and what fernan heard of him from both the friend and pupil would have much diminished his dread even if he had not been in full force of the feeling that whatever served to bind him more closely to the new world of blessing within the church must be good and comfortable  this visit over the bishop asked whether mrs underwood would like to be visited and mr audley went up to ascertain she was a woman who never was happy or at rest in an untidy room or in disordered garments and all was in as fair order as it could be with the old furniture that all wilmets mending could not preserve from the verge of rags her widows cap and soft shawl were as neat as possible and so were the little ones in their brownholland theodore sitting at her feet and stella on wilmets lap where she was being kept out of the way of the more advanced amusement of a feast of wooden teathings carried on in a corner between angela and bernard under lances somewhat embarrassing patronage  alda sprang up stared about in consternation at the utter unlikeness to the drawingroom in kensington palace gardens and exclaimed oh if sibby had only come to take the children out take them away lance  sibby will come presently or i will take them to her whispered wilmet i should like them just to have his blessing  so many sighed alda but meantime mr audley had seen that all was right at the first coup doeil had bent over mrs underwood told her that the bishop wished to call upon her and asked her leave to bring him up and she smiled looked pleased and said he is very kind that is for your papa my dears you must talk to him you know  the bishop came up almost immediately and the perfect tranquillity and absence of flutter fully showed poor mrs underwoods old high bred instinct she was really gratified when he sat down by her after greeting the three girls and held out his hands to make friends with the lesser ones whom their sisters led up angela submissive and pretty behaved bernard trying to hide his face and stella in wilmets arms staring to the widest extent of eyes the sisters had their wishthe fatherless babes received the pastoral blessing and the bishop said a few kind words of real sympathy that made mrs underwood look up at him affectionately and say indeed i have much to be thankful for my children are very good to me  i am sure they are said the bishop i cannot tell you how much i respect your eldest son  the colour rose in the pale face he is a very dear boy she said  i should like to see him before i go is he at home  lance shall run and call him said alda but the bishop had asked where he was and wilmet had not unblushingly for she was red with pleasure but shamelessly answered that he was at mr froggatts offering to send lance in search of him  i had rather he would show me the way said the bishop will you my boy  the way to mr froggatts was not very long but it was long enough to overcome lances never very large amount of bashfulness and he had made reply that he went to the grammar school and was in the second form that he liked singing in the choir better thanno not than anythinganything exceptexcept what oh a jolly good snow balling or a game at hockey did he like the school pretty well on the whole but he did not suppose he should stay there long his brother at the clergy orphan said there was such a lot of cads and that he was always grubbing his nose among them but now do you really think now that cads are always such bad fellows  his lordship was too much diverted to be easily able to speak but he observed that it depended on what was meant by a cad  thats just it exclaimed lance im sure some that he calls cads are as good fellows as any going  and what does your eldest brother say  felix oh he does not mind as long as one does not get into a real scrape  and then  oh then he minds so much that one cant do it you know  what does he punish you   nnohe never licks any of us nowbut he is so horridly sorry and it bothers him so said lance heres old froggatts he concluded stopping at the glass door my eyes what a sight of parsons lance had pretty well forgotten whom he was talking to there thats felixno no not that one serving mr burrowes thats redstone felix is out there getting out the sermon paper for that fat one and thats old froggy himself bowing away shall i go and call felix i suppose he will not mind this time  no thank you i will go in myself goodbye my little guide and thank you  and lance when his hand came out of the bishops found something in it which proved to be a tiny prayerbook and moreover a half sovereign he would have looked up and thanked but the bishop and that fat one were absorbed in conversation on the step and when he turned over the leaves of the little blue morocco book with its inlaid red cross he found full in his face in the first page the words lancelot underwood march 15th 1855 and then followed an initial and a name that utterly defeated lances powers so that perceiving the shop to be far too densely full of parsons for him to have a chance there he galloped off at full speed to cherry who happily could interpret the contracted latin by the name of the see and was not quite so much astonished as lance though even more gratified  meantime the bishop had made his way to the bowing mr froggatt and asked to speak with him in his private room where he mentioned his kindness to young underwood and was answered by a gratified disclaimer of having done anything that was not of great advantage to himself the good man seemed divided between desire to do justice to felix and not to stand in his light and alarm lest he should have to lose an assistant whom he had always known to be above his mark and who was growing more valuable every month and he was greatly relieved and delighted when the bishop only rejoiced at his character of felix and complimented the pursuivant by being glad that a paper of such good principles should be likely to have such a youth on its staff it had been well for the lad to meet with so good a friend mr froggatt could not be denied an eulogium on the father for whose sake he had first noticed the son and when the bishop had expressed his sorrow at never having known so bright a light as all described the late curate to have been he courteously regretted the interruption on a busy day but he begged just to see the young man he had little time himself but if he could be spared to walk up to the station  mr froggatt bustled out with great alacrity and taking the charge of the customer on himself announced for the benefit of all who might be within earshot mr underwood his lordship wishes to speak with you he wishes you to walk up to the station with him you had better go out by the private door  felix was red up to the ears his eight years seniority to lance were eight times eight more shyness and embarrassment but he could only obey and at his first greeting his hand was takenhoped to have seen you sooner the bishop said but you had always escaped me in the vestry  i had to go to help my sister my lord said felix  and your friend said the bishop that is a good work that has been done in your house  felix coloured more not knowing what to say  i wish to see you continued the bishop partly to tell you how much i honour you for the step you have taken i wish there were more who would understand the true uprightness and dutifulness of thinking no shame of an honest employment i am afraid you do sometimes meet with what may be trying he added no doubt remembering lady prices tone  i do not care now not much i did at first said felix  no one whose approval is worth having can consider yours really a loss of position you are in a profession every one respects and you seem to have great means of influence likely to be open to you  so my father said when he consented said felix  i shall always regret having just missed knowing your father some passages in that book of his struck me greatly but what i wished to say was to ask whether there is any way in which i can be useful to you in the education of any of the younger ones or  thank you my lord said felix i think you kindly voted for my brothers last year for the clergy orphan school only one got in and if you would vote again for little lancelot  my droll little companion who mr audley tells me did so much for that poor young american  indeed he did said felix i doubt if any of us would have got at him but for lance who did not mean anything but goodnature all the time  he is just the boy i want for our cathedral school and then he went on to explain that a great reformation was going on there was a foundationschool attached to the cathedral with exhibitions at the university to which the cathedral choristers had the first claim there had been of course a period of decay but an excellent precentor had been just appointed who would act as head master and the singingboys would be kept on free of expense after their voices became unavailable provided that by such time they had passed a certain examination such a voice as lances was sure to recommend him and besides the bishop said with a smile he wanted to raise the character of the school and he thought there was the stuff here that would do so  felix could only be thankful and rejoiced but it was a pang to think of lance being as entirely separated from home as was clement with no regular holidays and always most needed at his post at the great festivals there was something in his tone that made the bishop say you do not like to part with him  no my lord but i am glad it should be so my father was not happy aboutthings here and charged me to get my brothers away when i could  and as to holidays you are near at hand and most of the choir are of our own town i think he may generally be spared for a good term at each holiday time the organist is very considerate in giving leave of absence even if he should turn out to have a dangerously good voice for solos i will let you know when to send him up for examination which he will pass easily goodbye you must write to me if there is anything for me to do for you one month more and your father would have been one of my clergy remember  felix went back flushed with gratification and yet to a certain degree with confusion and not exactly liking the prospect of being interrogated as to what the bishop had said to him indeed he never told the whole of it to any one but cherry somehow though wilmet was his counsellor and mainstay geraldine was the sharer of all those confidences that came spontaneously out of the full but reserved heart  besides wilmet was at present in such a trance of enjoyment of her twin sister that she seemed scarcely able to enter into anything else she went through her duties as usual but with an effort to shake off her absorption in the thought of having alda at home and every moment she was not in sight of her darling seemed a cruel diminution of her one poor fortnight indeed it was teteatetes that her exclusive tenderness craved above all and she was often disappointed that alda should be willing to go and visit fernan travis when they might have had a quarter of an hour together alone how much more selfish she must have grown than alda in this last half year  aldas talk was indeed full of interest and gave a much better notion of her way of life than her letters did she seemed to have been fully adopted as a daughter of the house and to enjoy all the same privileges as marilda indeed she had a good deal more credit with all varieties of teachers since she learnt rapidly and eagerly and marilda while encouraging her successes without a shade of jealousy made no attempt to conquer her own clumsiness and tardiness even aunt mary as alda called mrs thomas underwood often had recourse to alda for sympathy in her endeavours to be tasteful and continually held her up as an example to marilda  and poor dear good woman said alda she has such a respect for underwood breeding and our education that i believe i could persuade her into anything by telling her it was what she calls comifo even when she was going to get the boudoir done with applegreen picked out with mauve enough to set ones teeth on edge and marilda would do nothing but laugh she let me persuade her into a lovely pale seagreen  is not seagreen too delicate for her asked cherry  why it was very wicked of edgar to be sure but he said that it was to suit the nymph reining in the porpoises he made a sketch and marilda was delighted with it she really is the most goodnatured creature in the world  she must be ejaculated wilmet but surely she ought not to like laughing at her mother  oh everybody laughs at aunt mary and she hardly ever finds it out and when she does she does not mind even old mrs kedge her mother does nothing but laugh at her for trying to be fine old granny is not a bit by way of being a lady you know she lives in a little house in the city with one maid and i believe she rubs her own tables i am sure she goes about in omnibuses though she has lots of money and marilda is so fond of her and so like her only not so clever and shrewd  but why does she live in such a small way  because she never was used to anything else and does not like it she hates grand servants and never will come to kensington palace gardens but she really is goodnatured she told clement to drop in on her whenever he likes and bring any of his friends and she always gives them a superb piece of plumcake and once she took them to the tower and once to the zoological gardens for she thinks that she cannot do enough to make up to them for being bred up to be little monks with cords and sandals and everything popish  you dont let her think so  well really when she has got a thing into her head nothing will uproot it and after all they do carry things very far there and clement goes on so that i dont wonder  goes on how  why just fancy the other day when uncle thomas fetched him in his brougham because i was coming home there he sat at luncheon and would not eat a scrap of meat  ah it was a wednesday in lent said cherry  only a wednesday you know and there with four or five strange people too one of them asked if he was a catholic and of course clement looked very wise and greatly pleased and said yes he was and that brought down aunt mary with her heavy artillery bless me clement you dont say so is mr fulmort really gone over yes said clem i know he did it on purpose he is gone over to preach at st peters and then one of the gentlemen asked if clem meant mr fulmort of st matthews whittingtonia and when he said yes he lived in the clergy house he began regularly to play him off asking the most absurd questions about fasts and feasts and vigils and decorations and clem answered them all in his prim little selfsufficient way just as if he thought he was on the high road to be st clement the martyr till i was ready to run away  couldnt you have given him a hint asked wilmet  my dear have you lived twelve years with clem without knowing that hints are lost on him  dear clem he is a very good steadyhearted little fellow said cherry it was very nice of him  well i only hope hell never come to luncheon again in lent there are times and seasons for everything and certainly not for display and to make it worse marilda is the most literalminded girl fasting was quite a new mind to her for she never realises what she does not see and she got clem into a corner where i heard him going on nothing loth about days of abstinence out of mr fulmorts last catechising i should think and ended by asking what cousin edward did so that i fully expected that i should find her eating nothing and that i should be called to account  and what did you tell her then  oh you know i could say quite truly that he did not  i dont think that was quite fair said wilmet gravely you know it was only because he really could not  you dont know how glad i was to have an answer that would hinder the horrid commotion we should have had if marilda had taken to fasting and after all you know papa would have said minding her mother was her first duty  why did not you tell her that  i have dozens of times but you know there are mothers and mothers and nobody can always mind aunt mary good soul marilda has just made herself with her own good rough plain sense i wish she was a man she would be a capital merchant like her father but it is hard to be a great heiress with nothing she really likes to do she is always longing to come down to centry and tramp about the lanes among the cottages  oh i wish they would  i dont think aunt mary will ever let them she hates the country and though she likes to have a place for the name of the thing she does not want to live there especially where there are so many of us and then felixs situation  for shame alda  well i did not say anything myself it is only aunt maryit is very foolish of people but you see they will as to marilda i believe she would like to stand behind the counter with him this minute  marilda is the oddest and best girl i ever heard of  you may say that and so ignorant she was she had a great velvet andgold church service and hardly guessed there was any bible or prayerbook besides i am sure felix cannot have had more work to teach that youth than i have had with marilda such a jumble as she had picked up she really had only little baby prayers to say till she saw my book  what a blessing you must be to her said wilmet fondly looking at her sister  well i do hope so you must know she was regularly struck with dear papa i am sure he is the first saint in her calendar and everything iswhat did cousin edward say and when once she has made up her mind that a thing is right she will blunder on through fire and water but she will do it  then said cherry she ought to try and learn and not to be awkward because of obedience  alda burst out laughing people can only do what they can marilda trying to be graceful would be worse than marilda floundering her own way but she really is the best and kindest girl living and she gets on much better for having me to keep her out of scrapes  wilmet went to bed that night thankful to have aldas head on the pillow beside her and most thankful for the tokens that she watched among her brothers and sisters which showed how much her fathers influence was extending beyond his short life     chapter ix  the thirteen    they closed around the fire  and all in turn essayed to paint  the rival merits of their saint  a theme that neer can tire  a holy maid for be it known  that their saints honour is their own                                      scott   the thirteen underwoods did not meet again in the same house for many a long day and when they did it was on a grey misty morning in the christmas week of the year following and the blinds were down and the notes of the knell clashing out overhead as the door was opened to edgar alda and clement as they arrived together having been summoned late on the previous night by a telegram with tidings that their mother had been struck by a paralysis they knew what to expect when felix with one of the little ones on his arm came quietly down the stairs and admitted them all they had to ask was when and how and to hear that the long living death had ended in peaceful insensibility at last then they followed him upstairs to the room where the others sat hushed over their pen or their books where wilmet her eyes gushing with quiet tears held alda in her embrace and geraldine after her first eager kiss gazed wistfully at edgar as though there must be comfort in the very sight of him if she could only feel it while the very little ones opened their puzzled eyes on the newcomers as strangers  and so they were clement had indeed been at home in september but alda not for a year and threequarters nor edgar since he first left it three years before the absence of the two latter was not by their own choice a doctor who had ordered mrs thomas underwood to spend the summer months year after year at spa was partly the cause and moreover during the autumn and winter of 1856 bexley had been a perfect field of epidemics measles and hoopingcough had run riot in the schools and lingered in the streets and alleys of the potteries fastening on many who thought themselves secured by former attacks and there had been a good many deaths in especial clements chief friend harry lamb nobody excepting the invalid mother throughout the underwood household had escaped one or other disorder and both fell to the lot of the four little ones and likewise of mr audley who was infinitely disgusted at himself and at the guarded childhood for which he thus paid the penalty pretty severely when matters were at the worst and felix was laid up and wilmet found herself succumbing she had written in desperation to sister constance whose presence in the house had made the next three weeks a time of very pleasant recollections finally she had carried off geraldine angela and bernard to the convalescent rooms at st faiths where their happiness had been such that the favourite sport of the little ones had ever since been the acting of sisters of mercy nursing sick dolls the quarantine had been indefinitely prolonged for the proteges of kensington palace gardens for the three at school though kept away till all infection was thought to be over had perversely caught the maladies as soon as they came home for the summer holidays and indeed the whole town and neighbouring villages were so full of contagion that mrs thomas underwood had not far to seek for a plea for avoiding centry  all this time from day to day the poor mother had been growing more feeble and it had been fully purposed that on edgars return at christmas on the completion of his studies at louvaine he and alda should make some stay at home but the brother and sister were both so useful and ornamental that their adopted home could not spare them until after a series of christmas entertainments and clement had been in like manner detained until the festival services at st matthews no longer required him indeed when he had been at home in the autumn he had been scarcely recognised  for the last week however mrs underwood had been much clearer in mind had enjoyed the presence of her holiday children and had for a short time even given hopes that her constitution might yet rally and her dormant faculties revive she had even talked to mr audley and geraldine at different times as though she had some such presentiment herself and had made some exertions which proved much increased activity of brain alas though their coming had thus been rendered very happy the brightening had been but the symptom and precursor of a sudden attack of paralysis whence there was no symptom of recovery and which in a few hours ended in death  for the present the hopes that had been entertained gave poignancy to the sudden disappointment and grief and the home children could not acquiesce in the dispensation with the same quiet reasonableness as those who had been so long separated from them as not to miss the gentle countenance or the sweet toils sweet cares for ever gone indeed wilmet was physically much exhausted by her long hours of anxiety and went about palecheeked and tearstained quietly attending to all that was needful but with the tears continually dropping while geraldine was fit for nothing but to lie still unable to think but feeling soothed as long as she could lay her hand upon edgar and feel that he was near  so the whole thirteen were together again and in the hush of the orphaned house there was a certain wonder and curiosity in their mutual examination and comparison with one another and with the beings with whom they had parted three years ago at the period of their first separation all were at a time of life when such an interval could not fail to make a vast alteration in externals even geraldine had gained in strength and though still white and with features too large for her face startlingly searching grey eyes and brows that looked strangely thick dark and straight in contrast with the pencilled arches belonging to all the rest she was less weird and elfinlike than when she had been three inches shorter and dressed more childishly as edgar said she was less riquet with a tuft than the good fairy godmother and her twin sisters might have been her princesswards so far did they tower above herstraight as firtrees oval faced regular featured fair skinned blue eyed and bright haired during those long dreary hours edgar often beguiled the time with sketches of them and the outlineswhether of chiselled profiles shapely heads or cupidsbow lipswere still almost exactly similar yet it had become impossible to mistake one twin for the other even when alda had dressed the tresses on wilmets passive head in perfect conformity with her own looking at their figures aldas air of fashion made her appear the eldest and wilmet might have been a girl in the schoolroom but comparing their faces wilmets placid recollected countenance and the soberness that sat so well on her white smooth forehead and steady blue eyes might have befitted many more years than eighteen there were not nearly so many lights and shades in her looks as in those of alda and geraldine the one had both more smiles and more frowns the other more gleams of joy and of pain each was more animated and sensitive but neither gave the same sense of confidence and repose  as usually happens when the parents are of the same family the inventory of the features of one of the progeny served for almost all the rest the differences were only in degree and the prime specimens were without doubt the two elder twins and edgar with like promise of little bernard and stella  edgar had grown very tall and had inherited his fathers advantages of grace and elegance of figure to which was added a certain distinguished ease of carriage and ready graciousness too simple to be called either conceit or presumption but which looked as if he were used to be admired and to confer favours athletics had been the fashion with him and his english companions and his complexion was embrowned by sun and wind his form upright and vigorous and by force of contrast it was now perceived that felix seemed to have almost ceased growing for the last three years and that his indoor occupations had given his broad square shoulders a kind of slouch and kept his colouring as pink and white as that of his sisters like wilmet he had something staid and responsible about him that even more than his fringe of light brown whiskers gave the appearance of fullgrown manhood so that the first impression of all the newcomers was how completely he had left the boy behind him making it an effort of memory to believe him only nineteen and a half but they all knew him for their head and leant themselves against him and in the meantime edgars appearance was a perfect feast of enjoyment not only to little loving geraldine but to sage felix they recreated themselves with gazing at him and when left alone together would discuss his charms in low confidential murmurs quite aware that wilmet would think them very silly but edgar was the great romance of both  edgar observed that clement had done all the growth for both himself and felix and was doing his best to be a light of the church by resembling nothing but an altartaper when they all repaired to the back of the cupboard door in mr audleys room to be measured his head was found far above edgars mark at fourteen and therewith he was lank and thin not yet accustomed to the length of his own legs and arms and seeming as if he was not meant to be seen undraped by his surplice his features and face were of the family type but a little smaller and with much less of the bright rosy tinting indeed when not excited he was decidedly pale and his eyes and hair were a little lighter than those of the rest it was a refined delicate thoughtful face pretty rather than handsome and its only fault was a certain melancholy superciliousness or benignant pity for every one who did not belong to the flock of st matthews  regular features are always what most easily lose individuality and become those of the owners class and if clement was all chorister fulbert and lancelot were all schoolboy the two little fellows were a long way apart in height though there were only two years between them for lance was on a much smaller scale but equally full of ruddy health and superabundant vigour and while fulbert was the more rough and independent his countenance had not the fun and sweetness that rendered lances so winning their looks were repeated in robina who was much too square and sturdy for any attempt at beauty and was comically like a boy and like her brothers but with much frank honesty and determination in her big grey darklylashed eyes angela was one of the most altered of all for her plump cherub cheeks had melted away under the glow of measles and the hooping process had lengthened and narrowed her small person into a demure little threadpaper of six years old omnivorous of books a pet and pickle at school and a romp at homethe sworn ally offensive and defensive of stout roughpated unruly bernard stella was the loveliest little bit of painted porcelain imaginable quite capable of being his companion and a perfect little fairy for beauty gracefulness and quickness of all kinds alda was delighted with her pretty caressing ways and admiration of the wonderful new sister she was of quieter more docile mood than these two though aspiring to their companionship for it was startling to see how far she had left theodore behind he was still in arms and speechless a little pale inanimate creature taking very little notice and making no sound except a sort of low musical cooing of pleasure and a sad whining moan of unhappiness which always recurred when he was not in the arms of sibby wilmet or felix it was only when felix held out his arms to take him that the sound of pleasure was heard and once on that firm knee with his shining head against that kind heart he was satisfied and felix had accustomed himself to all sorts of occupations with his little brother in his left arm even at night there was no rest for theodore unless felix took him into his room so often did the little fretting moan summon him that soon the crib took up his regular abode beside his bed but felix though of course spared from the shop could not be dispensed with from the printing house where he was subeditor and in his absence theodore was always less contented and his tearless moan went to his sisters heart for the poor little fellow had been wont to lie day and night in his mothers bosom and she had been as uneasy without him as he now was without her all her other babes had grown past her helpless instinctive tenderness and theodores continued passiveness had been hitherto an advantage which had always been called his goodness and affection  alda was the first to comment on the wonderful interval between the twins when wilmet accounted for it by theodores having been quite kept back for his mothers sake and likewise by his having been more reduced by measles and hoopingcough than stella had been but to fresh observers it was impossible to think that all was thus explained and edgar and alda discussed it in a low voice when they found themselves alone  the fact is plain said edgar but i suppose nothing can be done and i see no use in forcing it on poor wilmet  i dont understand such blindness  not real blindnesscertainly not on felixs part he knows that load is on his back for life heighho a stout old atlas we have in blunderbore i wonder how long i shall be in plucking the golden apples and taking a share  i thought it was atlas that gathered the apples  dont spoil a good simile with superfluous exactness alda it is base enough to compare the gardens of the hesperides to a merchants office i wonder how many years it will take to get out of the drudgery and have some power of enjoying life and relieving felix one could tear ones hair to see him tied down by this large family till all his best days are gone  some of the others may get off his hands and help  not they clem is too highly spiritualised to care for anything so material as his own flesh and blood and it is not their fault if little lance does not follow in his wake then if ful has any brains he is not come to the use of them he is only less obnoxious than tina in that he is a boy and not a church candle but boys are certainly a mistake  if ever the mature age of seventeen could be excused for so regarding boyhood it was under such circumstances all were too old for any outbreaks such as brought angela and bernard to disgrace and disturbed the hush of those four sad days but the actual loss had been so long previous that the pressure of present grief was not so crushing as to prevent want of employment and confinement in that small silent house from being other than most irksome and tedious  clement would have done very well alone he went to church read told angela stories and discoursed to cherry on the ways of st matthews but unfortunately there was something about him that always incited the other boys to sparring nor was he always guiltless of being the aggressor for there was no keeping him in mind that comparisons are odious  church music might seem a suitable subject but the london chorister could not abstain from criticising st oswalds and contemning the oldfashioned practices of the cathedral which of course lance considered himself bound to defend till the very names of gregorians and anglicans became terrible to cherry as the watchwords of a wrangling match fulbert meantime made no secret of his contempt for both brothers as mere choristers instead of schoolboys and exalted himself whenever he detected their ignorance of any choice morceau of slang while their superior knowledge on any other point was viewed as showing the newfangled girlish nonsense of their education  this lance did not mind but he was very sensitive as to the dignity of his cathedral and the perfections of his chosen friend one bill harewood and fulbert was not slow to use the latter engine for getting a rise out of him while clement as often though with less design offended by disparagement of his choir nor could edgar refuse himself the diversion of tormenting clement by ironical questions and remarks on his standard of perfection which mode of torture enchanted fulbert whenever he understood it thus these four brothers contrived to inflict a good amount of teasing on one another all the more wearing and worrying because deprived of its only tolerable seasoning mirth  clement had indeed a refuge in mr audleys room where he could find books and willing ears for mr fulmorts doings but he availed himself of it less than might have been expected whether from inclination to his brothers society desire to do them good or innate pugnacity he was generally in the thick of the conflict and before long he confided to felix that he was seriously uneasy about edgars opinions  he is only chaffing you said felix  chaff now said clement  well clem you know you are enough to provoke a saint you bore so intolerably about st matthews  the much disgusted clement retired into himself but felix was not satisfied at heart  one was lacking on the cold misty new years morning when even geraldine could not be withheld from the communion feast of the living and departed each felt the disappointment when they found themselves only six instead of seven but it was clement who as the boys were waiting for breakfast afterwards began  have not you been confirmed edgar  how should i  i am sure there are plenty of foreign confirmations i see them in the british catholic  foreign parts isnt all one said edgar and the younger boys sniggled  if one took any trouble persisted clement  yes but one dwelling with emphasis on the awkward impersonal one may have scruples about committing an act of schism by encouraging an intruding bishop performing episcopal functions in another mans diocese has not your spiritual father taught you that much tina  ii must find out about that said clement thoughtfully but at any rate the lent confirmations are coming on in london and if i were to speak to the vicar i have no doubt he would gladly prepare you  nor i answered edgar  then shall i eagerly asked clement  not at present thank you  clement stood blank and open mouthed and fulbert laughed secure that the joke whatever it might be was against him  of course burst out lance edgar does not want you to speak for him clem he has got a tongue of his own and a clergyman too i suppose  clement proceeded to a disquisition topographical and censorial upon the parish and district to which edgar might be relegated and finally exclaimed yes he is not much amiss he has some notions he dines with us sometimes you can go to him edgar and ill get the vicar to speak to him  thank you i had rather be excused  you cannot miss another confirmation  i cant say i am fond of pledges especially when no one can tell how much or how little they mean  whether this were in earnest or a mere thrust in return for clements pertinacity was undecided for wilmet came in looking so sad and depressed that the brothers felt rebuked for the tone in which they had been speaking  mr thomas underwood soon arrived having come to centry the night before and after a few words had passed between him and edgar the latter announced his intention of returning with him to london that evening  very well said felix much disappointed at this repetition of edgars willingness to hurry from the house of mourning but we have had very little of you clement must go on the day after twelfth day and we shall have more room it will be a great blow to cherry  poor little cherry ill come when i can see her in greater peace but i must buckle to with the beginning of the year fee  there was no further disputing the point but edgar was always a great loss to every one except clement he was so gentle and considerate that it was impossible not to think that the strange things reported of him were not first evoked and then exaggerated by the zeal of the model chorister and indeed he led geraldine to that inference when he went to her in the sittingroom where as before she had to remain at home  my cherry i find i must go back with old tom dont be vexed my whiteheart i am not going back to belgium you know i can often run down but my work ought to begin with the year  you cannot even stay over the epiphany  well i would have made an effort but i am really wanted and then if i am long with that light of the church tina he will get me into everybodys black books never mind old girl ill be for ever running down is any one going to stay with you  bernard is coming presently i must try to make him recollect something about it  you dont mean that child angel is going  she wishes it and it seems right  right to leave a black spot in her memory if children could but believe people were sublimated away  children can believe in the resurrection of the body as well as we said cherry reverently  better too by a long chalk he muttered then perceiving her dismayed expression he added no noim not talking to tina only he has put me in the humour in which there is nothing he could not make me disputeeven my cherry being the sweetest morsel in the world there goodbye for the present only dont afflict that poor little bernard and yourself into too great wretchedness out of a sense of duty  no i do not really grieve said cherry tears come for thankfulness the real sorrow came long ago we grew up in it and it is over now  right little one the mortal coil was very heavy and painful these last years and no one can help being relieved that the end has come it is the conventionalities that are needlessly distressing what earthly purpose can it serve save the amusement of the maids and children of bexley that nine of us should present ourselves a pitiful spectacle all the way up to the cemetery in veils and hatbands  dont talk so edgar you do not know how it jars though i know you mean no disrespect  well it must be a blessed thing to end by drowning or blowing up to save ones friends trouble  edgar indeed i cannot bear this recollect what a treasure that dear shattered earthen vessel has held what a wonderful life of patient silent resignation it was  indeed it was said edgar suddenly softened no lips could tell what the resolution must have been that carried her through those years never murmuring what must she not have spared my father such devotion is the true womans heritage  cherry was soothed as she saw the dew on his eyelashes but just then felix came in to fetch him and stooping down kissed her and said in his low and tender but strong voice we leave her with him dear child recollect        the heart may ache but may not burst        heaven will not leave thee nor forsake   much as geraldine had longed for edgar his words brought vague yearning and distress while felixs very tone gave support how could edgar say patient silent selfdevotion was not to be found except in woman  so the wornout body that once had been bright smiling mary underwood was borne to the church she had not entered since she had knelt there with her husband and then she was laid beside him in the hillside cemetery the graves marked by the simple cross for which there had been long anxious saving the last contribution having been a quarter of the bishops gift to lancelot the inscription was on the edges of the steps from which the cross rose               under wode under rode             edward fulbert underwood         nine years curate of this parish                 epiphany 1855                    aged 40        thy rod and thy staff comfort me   there was room enough for the name of mary wilmet his wife to be added at the base of the rood that cross which they had borne the one so valiantly the other so meekly during their forty years in the wilderness  many persons were present out of respect not only to the former curate but to his hardworking son and daughter and not only the daughters hollywreath but one of camellias sent by sister constance lay upon the pall when the mourners had turned away mr audley saw a slender lad standing by waiting till the grave was smoothed to lay on it a wreath of delicate white roses and ferns there was no mistaking the clear olive face and indeed mr audley had kept up a regular correspondence with ferdinand travis and knew that the vows made two years ago had been so far persevered in and without molestation from father or uncle he had written an account of mrs underwoods death but had received no answer  this is kind ferdinand he said it will gratify them  may i see any of them the youth asked  felix and lance will be most glad  i only received your letter yesterday evening dr white forwarded it to me in london and i persuaded my father to let me come down  you are with your father  yes he came home about a fortnight ago i was going to write to you  o mr audley if you are not in haste can you tell me whether i can see my dear diegos grave  the roman catholic burialground is on the other side of the town i think you will have to go to mr macnamara for admittance come home with me first fernan  home he said warmly yes it has always seemed so to me i have dreamt so often of her gentle loving face and tender weak voice she was very kind to me and he raised his hat reverently as he placed the flowers upon the now completed grave i saw that all were here except the little ones and geraldine he added how is she  as well as usual wilmet is a good deal worn and downcast but all are calm and cheerful the loss cannot be like what that of their father was  will they go on as they are doing now  i trust so i am going down to the family consultation the london cousin is there  then perhaps i had better not come in said ferdinand looking rather blank shall i go down to mr macnamara first  had you rather go alone or shall i send lance to show you the way  dear little lance pray let me have him  it is a longish walk is your lameness quite gone  oh yes i can walk a couple of miles very well and when i give out it is not my leg but my back they say it is the old jar to the spine and that it will wear off when i have done growing if i get plenty of air and riding this will not be too much for me but i must be in time for the 330 train i promised my father  is he here alone  yes my uncle is in brazil my father is here for a month and is very kind he seems very fairly satisfied with me and he wants me to get prepared for the commission in the life guards  the life guards  you see he is bent on my being an english gentleman but he has some dislike to the university fancies it too oldworld or something and honestly i cannot wish it myself i cant take much to books and dr white says i have begun too late and shall never make much of them  if you went into the guards my brother might be a friend to you  my back is not fit for the infantry said ferdinand but i can ride anything i always could i care for nothing so much as horses  then why not some other cavalry regiment  well my father knows a man with a son in the life guards who has persuaded him that it is the thing and i dont greatly care  is he prepared for the expensiveness  i fancy it is the recommendation said ferdinand smiling with a little shame but if you really see reason for some other choice perhaps you would represent it to him i think he would attend to you in person  have you positively no choice fernan  i never like the bother of consideration said ferdinand and in london i might have more chance of seeing you and other friends sometimes i do know that it is not all my father supposes but he thinks it is all my ignorance and i have not much right to be particular  only take care that horses do not become your temptation said mr audley  i know gravely replied ferdinand the fact is he added as they turned down the street that i do not want to go counter to my father if i can help it i have not been able to avoid vexing him and this is of no great consequence i can exchange if it should not suit me  i believe you are right said the curate but i will inquire and write to you before the application is made wait and i will send out lance but ought you not to call at the rectory  i will do so as i return said ferdinand and as mr audley entered the house he thought that the making the cacique into an english gentleman seemed to have been attained as far as accent mind and manner went and the air and gesture had always been natural in him his tone rather than his words were conclusive to the curate that his heart had never swerved from the purpose with which he had stood at the font but the languor and indolence of the voice indicated that the tropical indifference was far from conquered and it was an anxious question whether the life destined for him might not be exceptionally perilous to his peculiar temperament of nonchalance and excitability  consideration was not possible just then for when mr audley opened the door he found that he had been impatiently waited for and barely time was allowed to him to send lance to ferdinand travis before he was summoned to immediate conference with thomas underwood who on coming in had assumed the management of affairs and on calling for the will was rather displeased with felixs protest against doing anything without mr audley whom he knew to have been named guardian by his father the cousin seemed unable to credit the statement and wilmet had just found the long envelope with the black seal exactly as it had lain in the desk which had never been disturbed since the business on their fathers death had been finished  there was the old will made long before leaving whatever there was to leave unconditionally to the wife with the sole guardianship of the children and there was the codicil dated the 16th of october 1854 appointing charles somerville audley clerk to the guardianship in case of the death of the mother while they should all or any of them be under twentyone and directing that in that contingency the property should be placed in his hands as trustee the interest to be employed for their maintenance and the capital to be divided equally among them each receiving his or her share on coming of age all this was in edward underwoods own handwriting and his signature was attested by the rector and the doctor  thomas underwood was more put out than the management of such an insignificant sum seemed to warrant he was no doubt disappointed of his cousins confidence as well as of some liberal if domineering intentions and he was only half appeased when edgar pointed to the date and showed that the arrangement had been made before the renewal of intercourse it was hardly fair to thrust a charge upon a stranger when there was a relation to act poor edward he ought to have trusted he said there was genuine kindness of heart in the desire to confer benefits though perhaps in rather an overbearing spirit as well as disappointment and hurt feeling that his cousin had acquiesced in his neglect without an appeal however after asking whether mr audley meant to act and hearing of his decided intention of doing so he proceeded to state his own plans for them the present state of things could not continue and he proposed that wilmet and geraldine should go as half boarders to some school to be prepared for governesses felixcould he write shorthand oh yes but then he knew of a capital opening for him a few years and he would be on the way to prosperity the little ones might be boarded with their old nurse till fit for some clergy orphan schools if the means would not provide for all there need be no difficulty made on that score  mr audley saw felixs start of dismay and glance at him but knowing as he did that the lad was always more himself when not interfered with and allowed to act for himself he only said it is very kind in you sir but i think felix should be consulted  it is impossible began felix hastily  impossible it is quite impossible i would have you to understand that a lot of children like you should keep house together and on such an income as that quite preposterous  as for that said felix still unsubmissively it is only what we have been doing except for the name of the thing for the last three years on the same means  you dont mean to tell me that you have kept things going on such means without a debt  of course we have we never let a bill run said felix slightly indignant  now mind im not insulting you felix but i know what the women are and what they tell us are you sure of that no debtshonour bright  none at all said felix with an endeavour at calmness but glowing hotly i help my sister make up her books every saturday night we always pay ready money  humph said mr underwood still only half convinced living must be cheap at bexley  you had better explain a little felix said mr audley  felix did bring himself to say i am subeditor now and get 100 pounds a year besides being paid for any article i write wilmet has 25 pounds a year and her dinner and angelas at school so there are only five of us constantly dining at home and with mr audleys two guineas a week we can do very well  what you lodge here  did not you know that said felix surprised  mr underwood gave a whistle and the curate felt his cheeks growing redder and redder as he perceived that sevenandtwenty was not considered as so very much older than eighteen edgar understood and smiled but felix only thought he was suspected of making a good thing of his lodger and was beginning something awkward about it is all kindness when mr audley broke in  of course nothing is settled yet butbut i believe i shall change my quarters a smaller house would be better for them but i think the children should keep together indeed my dear friend said he chiefly appointed me that felix might be kept at their head  thereupon mr underwood began to expostulate against the sacrifice of position and talent that felix was making for the sake of bearing the burthen of a family that would have pressed heavily on a man double his age it was what felix already knew much better than when at sixteen he had made his first venture he had experienced the effects of change of station as well as of exertion drudgery and of the home hardship that no one except mr audley had tried to sweeten he saw how edgar had acquired the nameless air and style that he was losing how even clement viewed him as left behind and on the other hand he knew that with his own trained and tested ability and application and his kinsmans patronage there was every reasonable chance of his regaining a gentlemans position away from that half jealous halfconceited foreman who made every day a trial to him and looked at him with an evil eye as a supplanter in the post of confidence but therewith he thought of his fathers words that to him he left this heavy burthen and he thought what it would be to have no central home no place of holidaymeeting no rallyingpoint for the boys and girls and to cast off the little ones to hired service this alternative never seriously occurred to him for were they not all bound to him by the cords of love and most closely the weakest and most helpless yet his first reply did not convey the weight of his determination it was only geraldine is too delicate  well well good advice and treatment might make a change or if she be fit for nothing else would not that sisterhood at dearport take her on reasonable terms not that i can away with such nonsense but your father had his fancies  my father wished us not to break up the home  that was all very well when your poor mother was alive you have been a good son to her but it is impossible that you and your sister mere children as you are should set up housekeeping by yourselves  mr audley must see it cannot be suffered it is the bounden duty of your friends to interfere  mr audley did not speak he knew that felix could reckon on his support and moreover that the youth would show himself to greater advantage when not interfered with so after pausing to see whether his guardian would speak felix said of course we are in mr audleys power but he knows that we have made some trial and except in name we have really stood alone for these three years wilmet can quite manage the house and it would be misery for ever to us all to have no home in short and felixs face burnt his voice choked and his eyes brimmed over with hot indignant tears as he concluded it shall never be done with my good will  and under the circumstances said mr audley i think felix is right  very well said thomas underwood much displeased i have no power here and if you and that lad think he can take charge of a house and a dozen children you must have it your own way only when they have all gone to rack and ruin and he is sick of being a little tradesman in a country town he will remember what i said  felix forced back his resentful feelings and contrived to say yes sir i know it is a great disadvantage and that you only wish for our good but i do not think anything would be so bad for the children as to be all cast about the world with no place to go to and becoming strangers to one another and since there is this way of keeping them together it seems right  the steadiness of his manner struck mr underwood and the reply was not unkind  you are a good boy at bottom felix and mean well and i am only sorry not to be able to hinder you from throwing yourself away for life by trying to do what is morally impossible in a foolish spirit of independence do not interrupt i warn you that i am not to be appealed to for getting you out of the difficulties you are plunging into but of course your brother and sister will be mine as before and as i promised myself to do the same by your mother as by your fathermy near cousins bothhere is to cover necessary expenses  it was a cheque for 150 pounds the same as he had given on the former occasion and though felix had rather not have taken it he had little choice and he brought himself to return cold but respectful thanks and mr underwood did not manifest any more displeasure but showed himself very kind at the meal that was spread in mr audleys sittingroom and even invited wilmet to accompany alda when she joined the family in a weeks time at brighton so as to have sea air for the remainder of her holidays  nothing could be more reluctant than was wilmet at first but there was a chorus of persuasions and promises and the thought of being a little longer in aldas presence made her waver and almost consent  ferdinand travis came in but had only time for a greeting and a hasty meal before mr underwoods carriage came round and nothing loth he gave a lift to the mexican millionaire to the station with him and edgar so for the last time had all the thirteen been at home together     chapter x  the family cobweb on the move    oh the auld house the auld house    what though the rooms were wee  oh kind hearts were dwelling there    and bairnies full of glee                            lady nairn   every one except edgar would it was hoped stay at home till after the epiphany that most marked anniversary of birth and death  clement at first declared it impossible for st matthews could not dispense with him on the great day and fulbert grinned and nudged lance at his crestfallen looks when he received full leave of absence for the next three weeks  but lance was bursting with reverse troubles the same post had brought him a note from his organist and that stupid old dean as he irreverently called him had maliciously demanded how beautiful are the feet with the chorus following and nobody in the choir was available to execute the solo but lance he had sung it once or twice before and if he had the music and would practise at home he need only come up by the earliest train on the epiphany morning if not he must arrive in time for a practice on the 5th he would be wanted at both the festival and sunday services but might return as early as he pleased on monday the 9th  lance did not receive the summons in an exemplary spirit it is not certain that he did not bite it he rolled on the floor and contorted himself in convulsions of vexation he bothered the dean he bothered the precentor he bothered the organist he bothered shapcotes sore throat he bothered harewoods wool gathering wits he bothered his own voice and thereby caused clement to rebuke him for foolish murmurs instead of joy in his gift  a fine gift to rejoice in to make one be whipped off by an old fogey when one most wants to be at home i thank my stars i cant sing said fulbert  i should thank mine if bill harewood had any sense said lance sitting up in a heap on the floor he can go quite high enough when he pleases only unluckily a goose of a jackdaw must needs get into the cathedral just as bill had got to sing the solo in as pants the hart and there he stood staring with his mouth wide openand no wonder for it was sitting on the old stonekings head wasnt miles in a rage and didnt he vow hed never trust a solo to harewood again if he knew it oh i say wilmetfee i know do let me bring bill back with me on monday morning and he could go by the six oclock train oh jolly  but is he really a nice boy lance asked wilmet doubtfully  oh isnt he just youll see his father is a vicarchoral you know lives in our precincts his private door just opposite ours and tis the most delicious house you ever saw you may make as much row as you please and nobody minds  i know who mr harewood is librarian too is he not said felix i have heard people laughing about his goodnatured wife  arent they the people who were so kind to you last year lance asked cherry when you could not come home because of the measles  of course do let me bring him fee entreated lance he is no end of a chapcaptain of our form almost alwaysand such a brick at cricket i told him id show him the potteries and your press and our organ and everythingand it is such a chance when we are all at home i shall get the fellows to believe now that my sisters beat all theirs to shivers  can you withstand that flattering compliment wilmet said felix laughing i cant  he is very welcome said wilmet only lance he must not stay the night for there really is not room for another mouse  the little girls had heard so much about bill harewood that they were much excited but their sympathy kindly compensated for the lack of that of the elder brothers fulbert pronounced that a cathedral chorister could never be any great shakes and clement could not forgive one who had been frivolous enough to be distracted by a jackdaw but lance trusting to his friends personal attractions to overcome all prejudice trotted blithely off to the organist schoolmaster to beg the loan of the music and received a promise of a practice in church in the evening meantime he begged clement to play the accompaniment for him on the old piano neither boy knew that it had been scarcely opened since their fathers hand had last lingered fondly upon it music had been found to excite their mother to tears geraldine resembled fulbert in unmusicalness and wilmet had depended on school the brothers on their choirpractice so that the sound was like a new thing in the house nor was any one prepared either for the superiority of clements playing or for the exceeding beauty and sweetness of lances singing no one who appreciated the rare quality of his high notes wondered that he was indispensable geraldine could hardly believe that the clear exquisite proclamation that came floating as from an angel voice could really come from the little slight grubby dusty urchin who stood with clasped hands and uplifted face and clement himselfthough deferring the communication till lance was absent lest it should make him vain confided to wilmet that they had no such voice at st matthews and it was a shame to waste him on anglicans  wilmet hardly entered into this enormity she had made a discovery which interested her infinitely more little theodore hitherto so inanimate had sat up listened looked with a dawning of expression in the eyes that had hitherto been clear and meaningless as blue porcelain and as the music ceased his inarticulate hummings continued the same tune could it be that the key to the dormant senses was found his eyes turned to the piano and his finger pointed to it as soon as he found himself in the room with it and the airs he heard were continually reproduced in his murmuring sounds that how beautiful which had first awakened the gleamhis own birthday anthembeing sure to recur at sight of lance while a doleful irish croon sibbys regular lullaby always served for her and the hardy norseman for felix who had sometimes whistled it to him wilmet spent every available moment in awaking the smile on the little waxen face that had never responded before it seemed to be just the cheering hope she needed to revive her spirits only she was almost ready to renounce her journey with alda for the sake of cultivating the newfound faculty  no one would permit this and indeed so far from waiting to be exhibited to lances friend the two sisters received their billet de route on the very day he was expected and there was no appeal since a housekeeper was to travel from centry who would take charge of them to london whence they would go down with mr underwood poor wilmet was much dismayed at leaving geraldine to what they both regarded as the unprecedented invasion of a strange boy indeed the whole charge made cherrys heart quail though she said little of her fears knowing the importance of wilmets having and enjoying her holiday and mr audley promised extra aid in keeping order among the boys  but as they came in that evening from the practice at the church to which clement had insisted on their coming to hear lance mr audley beckoned felix to his room with the words theres a thing i want to talk over with you  felix recollected those ominous words to mr underwood and stood warming his hands in dread of what might be coming it was all he feared  i wanted to sayi wanted to tell you began mr audley i would not have chosen this time but that i think it may save wilmet something to be able to tell her friends that the present arrangement is to cease  wilmet exclaimed felix then bethinking himself was that what tom underwood meant but you will not trouble yourself about such rubbish  well you see began the curate with heightening colour it cant be denied that your sister has grown up and that things are changed  mrs froggatt did ask me if you were going on here said felix still unconvinced but cant we leave people to be stoopid without interfering with us  felix you ought to be a better protector to your sisters you would not like to have my lady remonstratingnay maybe writing to my mother she is quite capable of it  felixs cheeks were in a flame if people would mind their own business he said but if they will have it so  they are right felix said the curate quietly appearances must be carefully heeded and by you almost more than by any one your slowness to understand me makes me almost doubtful about my further design  not going away altogether  not immediately but things stand thusdr white my old tutor you know and fernans is nearly sure of the new bishopric in australia and he wants me  felix hardly repressed a groan  any way i should not go immediately but when your father spoke to me about the guardianship he made me promise not to let it stand in the way of any other call i fancied he had mission work in his mind and it disposes me the more to think i ought not to hold back but while your dear mother lived i would not have gone  yes you have been very good to us was all felix could say but when  not for some time but i am not going this moment three months notice mr bevan must have and if he requires it six i must spend some time at home and very like shall not be off till you are of agecertainly not if i find there is any difficulty in handing the management of things over to you how long i remain with you must depend on circumstances how much notice must you give before leaving this house  i do not knowhalf a year i fancy you think we ought to give it up i suppose it is too large for us now  and you could take no lodger but one of the oldlady type  horrid said felix well we will see but it will be a great stroke on poor cherryshe can remember nothing before this house  it will be very good for her to have no old associations to sit brooding over  my poor little cherry if i saw how to cheer up her life but without your lessons it will be more dreary for her than ever  give her all you can to do and do not be overcareful to keep your anxieties from her knowledge she is very much of a woman and if you leave her too much to herself she will grow more introspective  wilmet and i have always wanted to shelter her she never seems fit for trouble and she is so young  compared with you two venerable people said mr audley smiling but her mind is not young and to treat her as a child is the way to make her prey upon herself i wish her talent could be more cultivated but meantime nothing is better for her than the care of bernard and stella i hope you will not be in a hurry to promote them out of her hands  very well but she will miss you sorely  i hope to see her brightened before i am really gone and i am not going to decamp from this house till some natural break comes to do that would be absurd  there was a silence and then felix said with a sigh yes a smaller house and one servant i will speak to wilmet  perhaps you had better so that she may have an answer in case she is attacked  wilmet was aghast at first but a hint from alda made her acquiesce not with blushing consciousness but with the perception that the way of the world was against the retention of the lodger and sorry as she was to lose mr audley her housewifely mind was not consoled but distracted by calculations on the difference of expenditure again she tried to beg herself off from her visit in the dread that felix would go and take some impracticable house in her absencesome place with thin walls no cupboards and no coalhole and she was only pacified by his solemn promise to decide on no house without her she went away in an avalanche of kisses and tears leaving geraldine with a basketful of written instructions for every possible contingency at which the anxious maiden sat gazing anxiously trying to store her mind with its onerous directions  shall i give you a piece of advice cherry said the curate as he saw the dark eyebrows drawn together  oh do she earnestly said  put all that in the fire  mr audley  and go by the light of nature you have just as many senses as wilmet and almost as much experience and as to oppressing yourself with the determination to do the very thing she would have done under all circumstances it is a delusion people must act according to their own nature not some one elses  certainly said geraldine smiling i could never walk stately in and say now boysand much they would care for it if i did  it seems to be a case for now boys at this moment said mr audley what can all that row be  oh it must be that dreadful strange boy lances friend sighed geraldine almost turning pale then trying to cheer up but it is only for the day and lance wished it so much  as she spoke the shout of cherry heres bill came nearer and the whole of the younger half of the family tumbled promiscuously into the room introducing the visitor in the midst of them to the elders no end of a chap appeared as mr audley said to mean all ends of shock hair and freckles up to the eyes but when fulbert and lance had whirled him out again to see the lions of bexley robina and angela were overheard respectfully pronouncing that he was nice and spotty like the dear little frogs in the strawberrybeds at catsacre and that his hair was just the colour cherry painted that of all the very best people in her holy pictures  the object of their admiration was seen no more till the middle of dinner when all three appeared immoderately dusty and no wonder for the organist had employed them to climb sweep fashion into the biggest organpipe to investigate the cause of a bronchial affection of long standingwhich turned out to be a dead bat caught in a tenacious cobweb  shortly after the guest was found assisting angela in a tableau where a penwiper doll in nuns costume was enacting the exorcism of the said bat in a cave built of wooden bricks  clement was undecided whether to condemn or admire and geraldine to whom edgar had lent some volumes of ruskin meditated on the grotesque  before there had been time for the fanciful sport to become rough comedy lance had called off his friend to see the potteries and to poor cherrys horror she found that robina had been swept off in the torrent of boyhood clement pitying her despair and selfreproach magnanimously offered to follow and either bring the little maid back or keep her out of harms way and for some time cherry reposed in the conviction that tina was as good as a girl any day  but at about a quarter to six a little tap came to mr audleys door and angela stood there saying with a most serious face please mr audley cherry wants to know whether you dont think something must have happened and going upstairs he found the poor young deputy in a nervous agony of despair at the nonreturn of any of the party quite certain that some catastrophe had befallen them and divided between selfreproach and dread of the consequences  the very first day wilmet had gone as she said  it was almost time for harewoods train which made it all the more strange mr audley tried to reassure her by the probability that the whole party were convoying him to the station and would appear when he was gone but time confuted this pleasing hypothesis and cherrys misery was renewed she even almost hinted a wish that mr audley would go out and look for them  and then he said smiling in an hours time you would be sending felix to look for me no no cherry these waiting times are often hard no doubt but as i fear you are one of those destined to abide by the tents instead of going out to battle you had better learn to do your watching composedly  o mr audley how can i i know it must be very wrong but how can i not care and verily the nervous sensitive girl was quivering with suspense  he will not be afraid of any evil tidings for his heart standeth fast and believeth in the lord answered mr audley i see that does not tell you how not to be afraid but i imagine that a few trusting ejaculations in the heart and then resolute attention to something else may be found a help  cherry would have sighed that attention was the most impossible thing in the world but before she had time to do so mr audley had begun to expound to her his australian scheme it excited her extremely and as a year and a half seemed an immense period of time to her imagination the dread of losing him was not so immediate as to damp her enthusiasm they had discussed his plans for nearly an hour before cherry started at the sound of the door and then it was only felix who entered he was irate but not at all alarmed and presently the welcome clatter of steps approached and in dashed the whole crew mired up to the eyes but in as towering spirits as ever  their delay had it appeared been caused by a long walk that ensued upon the visit to the potteries and a wild venture of will harewood upon impracticable ice which had made him acquainted with the depths of a horsepond there was none of the dignity of danger for the depths were shallows and the water only rose to his waist but the mud was above his ankles and he had floundered out with some difficulty he wanted to walk back with no more ceremony than a waterdog but the underwoods had made common cause against him and had dragged him to a cottage where he had the pleasing alternative of an old womans blankets and petticoats while his garments were drying he was as nearly angry as a harewood could be lance observed declaring that they should never have got him into the cottage without fighting him if tina had not been so tall and if robin had not nearly cried while he throwing off all responsibility ascribed all his lateness to his friends maggots no more trains stopped at bexley till after midnight but as to his absence causing any uneasiness at home he laughed at the notion and was corroborated by lance in averring that they had too much sense listening with undisguised amazement to the elaborate explanations and apologies about robina which clement was scrupulously pouring forth to his brother and sister saying that he would have brought her home at once but that he really did not like to trust those boys alone  whereat lance held up his hands with a dumb show of amazement that convulsed fulbert bill harewood and robina herself with agonies of halfsuppressed merriment the boy had come in prepared to be grave and quiet as knowing how lately affliction had come to the family and having been warned by lance that as to going on as we do in the precincts why it would make cherry jump out of her skin  but by some extraordinary influencewhether it were the oddity of william harewoods face or the novelty of his perfect insouciance in the household whither care had come only too earlysome infection seized on the young underwoods and before the end of the evening meal if the goings on were not equal to those in the precincts they were at any rate not far short of it  lance presently incited his friend to show how he had mesmerised lucy clement made a horrified protest and geraldine looked alarmed at her eldest brother who began indeed lance we can have nothing of that sort here  but felix i do assure you there is no harm  upon my word and honour theres not a spice of anything the archbishop of canterbury could stick at added will harewood  it is impossible there should not be harm interposed clement but the boys including fulbert were in such fits of laughter that felix began to suspect the seriousness of the performance and when lance sprang at him exclaiming ill go to mr audley feecherry will you be satisfied if mr audley says we may felix and cherry both consented and lance rushed off to make the appeal and returned not only with full sanction but with mr audley himself come to see the operation this perfectly satisfied felix who even consented on the entreaty of his brothers to become the first subject and cherry knew that where the curate and felix had no scruples she need have none but for all that she was more than half frightened and uncomfortableabove all when clement amid shouts of mirth from the three schoolboys indignantly marched away to shut himself up in his cold bedroom  by and by after some unseen preparationall the more mystifying because carried on in the kitchen where sibby always used to keep theodore in a cradle till felix was ready for himwill harewood caused felix to stand exactly opposite to him and to the spectators with a dinnerplate in his hand and under injunctions to imitate the operator exactly armed with another plate william rubbed his own finger first on the under side of the plate and then after some passes and flourishes on his own forehead entirely without effect so far as he himself was concerned but his victim standing meekly goodnatured and unconscious was seen by the ecstatic audience to be at each pass painting his own face with the soot from a flame over which his plate had been previously held the shrieks of amusement redoubled at the perplexity they occasioned him till they penetrated the upper rooms and suddenly a cry of horror made all turn to the door and see a little white barefooted figure standing there transfixed with fright which increased tenfold when felix hurried towards it not yet aware of the condition of his visage until a universal shout warned him of it while lance darting in pursuit picked up bernard and by his wonderful caressing arts and partly by his special gift of coaxing partly as the object of the little fellows most fervent adoration made the scattered senses take in that it was all play and even carried back the little white bundle heart throbbing and eyes staring but still secure in his arms to admire felix all black and then to be further relieved by beholding the restoration of the natural hue at the pump below stairs  then amid sibbys scoldings and assurances that the child would catch his death of cold bernard was borne upstairs again by felix who found clement in the nursery comforting the little girls and preventing them from following the example of their valiant pioneer felix now thoroughly entering into the spirit of the joke entertained for a moment the hope of entrapping clement but of course bernard could not be silenced from his bold and rather doubtful proclamation that the funny boy made felix black his own face and i wasnt afraid  naughty boy commented stella poor feeand she reared up to kiss him and stroke the cheeks that had suffered such an indignity  what it was only a trick said clement slowly as if half mystified  of course said felix could not you trust to that  i dont know cathedrals are very lax and it had a questionable name  o clem if it had not been in you before i should wish you had never gone to st matthews come down now dont let us disturb the little ones any longer goodnight angel goodnight little star well not make a row to wake you again  clement in a severe mood followed felix downstairs but some wonderful spirit of frolic was on all the young people that nighta reaction perhaps from the melancholy that had so long necessarily reigned in that house for though the fun was less loud it was quite as merry a course of riddles was going on and clement who really was used to a great deal of mirth among the staff of st matthews absolutely unbent and gloried in showing that even more conundrums were known there than by the house of harewood he was not strong in guessing them but then will harewood made such undaunted and extraordinary shots at everything proposed that the spirit of repartee was fairly awakened and cherrys bright delicate wit began to play so that no one knew how to believe in the lateness of the hour and still less that this was the same house that grave wilmet had left that morning  poor dear little cherry said felix to mr audley after helping her upstairs she is quite spent with laughing indeed my jaws ache and she is ready to cry as if it had been unfeeling  dont let her fancy that we certainly were surprised into it to night but i only wish for her sakefor all your sakesthat you could keep the house merrier  felix sighed he too felt as if he had been betrayed into unbecoming levity and though he would not dispute his heart had only become the heavier however he did not forget and when cherry again breathed a little sigh as to what wilmet would think of their first day he stoutly averred that there was no use in drooping and no harm in liveliness and that no one had ever been so full of joyousness as their father  she owned it but  and that but meant the effects of the three years that she had spent as the companion of her mothers mournful widowhood and of the cares of life on her elder brother and sister  it was true as mr audley said that the associations of the rooms were not good for her spirits in her many lonely hours and confined life and this reconciled felix more than anything else to the proposed change he was keeping his promise to wilmet of not seeking a house till her return when mr and mrs froggatt whose minds had been much relieved by hearing that the lodger would consult the proprieties communicated to him their own scheme of taking up their residence at a village named marshlands about two miles from bexley where they already spent great part of the summer in a pleasant cottage and garden which they had bought and adorned mr froggatt would drive in to attend to the business every day but the charge of the house was the difficulty as they did not wish to let the rooms and they now proposed that the young underwoods should inhabit them rentfree merely keeping a bedroom and little parlour behind the shop for mr froggatt and providing firing in them with much more diffidence at his wifes earnest suggestion the kindly modest old man asked whether miss underwood would object to his coming in to take a piece of bread and cheese when he was there in the middle of the day  it was an excellent offer and felix had no hesitation in gratefully closing with it even without consulting wilmet her reply showed that a great weight was taken off her mind and she was only longing to be at home again contriving for the move which was to take place at lady day she was burning to study the new rooms nevertheless as by kind marildas contrivance she was taking lessons in german every day from a superior fraulein who had once been her cousins governess and was further allowed to inspect the working of a good school her stay was extended by miss pearsons entreaty a full fortnight beyond what had been intended nor had anything gone wrong in her absence even the overlooking of the boys linen which she had believed impossible without her was safely carried on by cherry and all were sent off in sound condition no catastrophe occurred and the continual occupation and responsibility drove away all the low spirits that so often had tried the homekeeping girl she did enjoy those teteatete evenings when felix opened to her more than he had ever done before and yet it was an immense relief to have the day fixed for wilmets return and how much more to have her walking into the room with all the children clinging about her in incoherent ecstacy which had not subsided enough for much comprehension when felix came joyously in hurrah wilmet mr froggatt sent me home a couple of hours before time  how very good i met him in the street just now really he is the kindest old gentleman in the world  i believe you dazzled him mettie he says he did not know you till you spoke to him and if he had realised what a beautiful and majestic young lady you were he should hardly have ventured to propose your taking up your abode under his humble roof  that must be the effect of living with alda said wilmet merrily but oh i am glad to be at home again  and i never was so glad of anything in my life said geraldine eagerly  i am longing to go over the house and know what to do about furniture continued wilmet  there now w w is herself again said felix  mrs froggatt came and called on me said geraldine she talked of leaving us the larger things that will not go into the cottage  which is well said felix for how much of ours will survive the shock of removing is doubtful  all the things that came from vale leston are quite solid said wilmet bristling up  that carpet is solid darn said felix we tried one evening and found that though the pattern of roseleaves is a tradition no one younger than clem could remember having seen either design or colour  you should not laugh at it felix said wilmet a little hurt for indeed her mothers needle and her own were too well acquainted with the carpet for her to like to hear it contemned  felix and cherry both felt somewhat called to order as if their mistress had come home again and cherry was the first to break silence by inquiring after wilmets studies at brighton  oh yes said wilmet i do hope i am improved that was all marildas kindness she quite understood how i missed everybody and everything and at last one day when i was wishing i could pronounce german like alda and that alda had time to give me some lessons  alda hasnt time  oh you dont know how useful she is she writes all the notes marilda devised getting this frauleinsuch a goodnatured woman and when she heard what i wanted she got leave for me to come every day to study the working of the school i do believe i shall teach much better now if only i were not so ignorant i never had any notion before how little i knew  however wilmets value had really risen so much in consequence of these instructions that miss pearson arranged that she should lay the french and german foundations and prepare the scholars and should receive half a sovereign a half year from each girl whom she thus instructed being the moiety of extra moreover the head teacher talked of retiring and her succession was promised to wilmeta brilliant prospect that the sight of aldas grandeur did not make her contemn  wilmets anxious mind was well satisfied by her inspection of the new quarters which among other conveniences had that of shortening by ten minutes her walk to school the family apartments were all upstairs the space below being entirely taken up by the business and the kitchens were under ground the chief sittingroom upstairs was unfortunately towards the street and had a northern aspect it was a spacious room with three large windows filled with boxes of flowers and contained a big table and two sofas which with the carpet and curtains would remain well covered up foldingdoors led into a smaller room with a south window towards the little garden where mrs froggatt generally sat and which had been used for the diningroom there were two bedrooms besides on the same floor one of which would remain untouched for mr froggatt and above these there was a large nursery and more rooms than had been ever furnished rent rates taxes and repairs all off her mind wilmet felt as if prosperity were setting in and she was the first to make the audacious statement that they need not part with martha and indeed that the house could not be kept in order nor dinners cooked fit for mr froggatt by sibby singlehanded and cherry made up her mind that they were like a family of caterpillars moving their cobweb tent angela seeing such an establishment of young tortoiseshells in their polished black under their family web had asked which was their brother felix and the name was adopted  so a time of much business and excitement set in and the lengthening spring evenings were no sinecure to wilmet as the flitting day approached being rather hurried on by the old bookseller who wanted to be at marshlands in time to admire his hyacinths and sow his annuals mr audley would take rooms at the fortinbras arms for the remainder of his stay at bexley and indeed there was a good deal to break the old habit of constantly depending on him for his brothers young wife was slowly dying in london and the whole family seemed instinctively to turn to him for comfort and advice so that he was obliged to be continually going backwards and forwards  on the 24th of march when he came down by an afternoon train he found the house door open the steps scattered with straw and after looking in and seeing his own parlour intact and with a cheerful fire he pursued his way upstairs and there found the sittingroom bare except for a sort of island consisting of the sofa on which geraldine lay rolled in cloaks and shawls trying to amuse the twins by a feeble attempt to sing        weel may the boatie row   while making paper boats for stella to drag by strings upon the smooth boards  eh cherry are you the last man or the last rose of summer   the last of the caterpillars said cherry smiling but with effort do you see stellas fleetjust thirteen  making omens foolish child but though stella was eagerly pointing and explaining tat tellas boattat tedostat brotherstat angel and so on the word foolish was not directed to the little one but to the gray eyes heavy with unshed tears that rested wistfully upon a wreck that had caught upon a nail and lay rent and ragged  pray dont look which it is said she  certainly not i hate auguries  do you think there is nothing in them  i think there is nothing in this room but what ought to be in mine do you expect me to stand discussing superstition in this horrible raw emptiness here picking up theodore ill come back for you  oh no thank you let me get down by myself he cannot be left alone in a room  come stella and take care of him  thats worse she leads him into mischief we are fox goose and cabbage please give me my crutch wilmet put it out of reach because she said i was destroying myself  you are tired to death  oh no but one cant sit still when so much is going on oh how delicious as after an interval she arrived and found mr audley winding up a musical box which theodore was greeting with its own tunes and stella with a dance and chant of sing boxsing box and then the two sat listening to the long cycle of tunes which would hold theodore entranced for any length of time  after a short inquiry and a reply as to the sisterinlaws state and a few words on the progress of the flitting there was a silence while mr audley read the letters that had come for him in his absence and cherrys face became more and more pensive at last when mr audley laid down his letters and leant against the chimneypiece she ventured to say is it wrong  is what wrong said the curate who had quite forgotten the subject  to care about omens  that depends to accept them is sometimes necessary to look out for them is generally foolish and often wrong  sometimes necessary said cherry eagerly  sometimes experience seems to show that in good providence a merciful preparation is sent not so much to lead to anticipations as to bring the mind into keeping with what is coming and as it were attune it  so that little things may be constantly types of great future ones  my dear cherry i said not constantly  just let me tell you sibby says that the very day we all came into this poor old house just as the omnibus stopped there was the knell ringing overhead and a funeral coming up the street she knew it was a token and burst out crying and dear mamma who you know never shed tears turned as white as a corpse as if she was struck to the heart  and your father  oh sibby said he just stood in the doorway lifted his hat as the funeral passed and then wellnigh carried mamma with the baby that was fulbert in her arms over the threshold and smiled at her saying well mother what better than to have found our home till death so you see he did believe in it  i see he wanted to cheer her spirits not by saying stuff and nonsense but reminding her that there are worse things than death have you an omen on your mind cherry have it out dont let it sink in  only please dont laugh at me indeed it was not my own doing but stellas fancy to have a boat for each of us when she was launching them and i could not help recollecting how we are all starting out and away from our first home  stellas was not a very perilous ocean  that was a comfort at first and stella tried to draw all the thirteen lines together but they tangled and one thread broke and that boat was left behind and one poor crooked illmade thing fell over and was left at home because hindering all the rest and even stella knew that was me andher voice quivered one was caught on a nail and torn into a wreck now can i help thinking though youll just call them newspaperboats dragged by a baby on a dry dusty floor  watched by a weary fanciful damsel said mr audley sitting down by her who does not know a bit more than she did before that all are launching on a sea and if it is a rougher one theres a better guiding star than stella eudora to lead them and they have compasses of their ownay and a pilot and if there are times when he seems to be asleep in the shipwhy even the owner of the unseaworthy boat left at home can show the light and pray on till the others are roused to awaken him  i wish there had not been that wreck she sighed  what seems a wreck need not be really one said mr audley it may be the very way of returning to the right course and by and by we shall see our master standing on the shore in the morning light  at that moment there was a sound at the doorfelix had accompanied cherrys chair to bring her and theodore to the new home there was too much haste for the wistful last looks she intended she was deposited in the chair with theodore on her knee stella trotting after with felix and mr audley who was coming to see the inauguration st oswalds buildings were left behind and she was drawn up to the green private door beside the shop window wilmet hurried down and took theodore from her felix helped her out and up the narrow steep staircase which certainly was not a gain but when landed in the drawingroom the space seemed to her magnificent and their own furniture the two or three cherished portraits brought from vale leston their fathers chair their mothers sofa the silk patchwork tablecover that had been the girls birthday present to mamma the bookcase with papas precious books made it seem home like  the mantelpiece is just the same cried cherry delighted as she recognised all the old ornaments  the next moment her delight was great at the flowerstands which mr froggatt had kindly left full of primulas squills and crocuses and when she looked out from the back room into the little garden where mr froggatts horticultural tastes had long found their sole occupation and saw turf green laurels and bunches of snowdrops and crocuses she forgot all stellas launch     chapter xi  the choral festival    and with ornaments and banners  as becomes gintale good manners  we made the loveliest tayroom upon shannon shore                                              thackeray   of course after this said lady price miss underwood did not expect to be visited  otherwise the gain was great the amusement of looking out of window into the high street was alone a perpetual feast to the little ones and saved geraldine worlds of anxiety and the garden where they could be turned out to play was prized as it only could be by those who had never had any outlet before it was a pleasant little long narrow nook between the printinghouse on the west and such another garden on the east a like slip with a wall masked by ivy and lilacs and overshadowed by a horsechestnut meeting it on the south it was not smoky and was quite quiet save for the drone and stamp of the steampress there was grass a gumcistus and some flower beds in the centre and a gravelwalk all round bordered by narrow edgings of flowers and with fruit trees against the printinghouse wall and a banksia and wisteria against that of the house mr froggatt was quite touched at the reverence with which angela and stella regarded even the daisies that had eluded his perpetual spud and when he found out the delight it was to cherry to live with flowers for the first time in her life he seldom failed to send her a bunch of violets or some other spring beauty as soon as he arrived in the morning and kept the windows constantly supplied with plants  the old bookseller was at first very much afraid of his new inmates to felix he was used but he looked on the sisters as ladies and to ladies except on businessterms he was much less accustomed than to gentlemen besides being a thorough gentleman himself at heart he had so much delicacy as to be afraid of hurting their feelings by seeming at home in his own house and he avoided being there at luncheon for a whole week until one afternoon felix ran up to say that he was sure mr froggatt had a cold and would be glad if a cup of tea appeared in his parlour gratitude brought him in to face the enemy and after he had been kept at home for a day or two by the cold his wifes injunctions and felixs entreaties brought him to the dinner  it happened to be one of wilmets favourite economical stews but these were always popular in the family though chiefly composed of scraps potliquor rice and vegetables and both for its excellence and prudence it commanded mr froggatts unqualified approbation all that distressed his kind heart was to see no liquor but water except cherrys thimbleful of port he could not enjoy his glass of porter and shook his headperhaps not without reasonwhen he found that his young assistants diet was on no more generous scale and was not satisfied by felixs laughing argument that it was impossible to be more than perfectly healthy and strong false economy said the old man in private but felix was not to be persuaded into what he believed to be an unnecessary drain on the familyfinances and was still more stout against the hint that if redstone discovered this prudential abstinence it might make him disagreeable felix had gone his way regardless of far too many sneers for poverty and so called meanness to make any concession on their account though the veiled jealousy and guarded insolence of that smart gent the foreman had been for the last three years the greatest thorn in his side and at least he made this advance that the errandboy cleaned the shoes  geraldine though shy at first from the utter seclusion in which she had lived put forth a pretty bashful graciousness that perfectly enchanted mr froggatt who was besides much touched by her patient helplessness he became something between her grandfather and her knight loading her with flowers giving her the run of the circulating library and whenever it was fine enough taking her for a mile or two in his low basketcarriage either before or after his days business in the shop it was not exactly like being with her only other friend mr audley but he was a thoroughly kind polite and by no means unlettered old man and geraldine enjoyed and was grateful while the children were his darlings and were encouraged to take all manner of liberties with him  among the advantages of the change was the having felix always at hand and though she really did not see him oftener in the course of the day than at st oswalds buildings still the knowing him to be within reach gave great contentment to cherry the only disadvantage was that he lost his four daily walks to and fro and hardly ever had sufficient fresh air and exercise he was indeed on his feet for the most of the day but not exerting his muscles and all taste for the active sports in which his kind old master begged him to join seemed to have passed away from him when care fell upon him he tried not to hold his head above the young men of his adopted rank many of whom had been his schoolfellows but except with the members of the choir and choral society he had no common ground and there were none with whom he could form a friendship thus he never had any real relaxation except music and his sunday walks besides his evenings with his sisters and of play with the children it was not a natural life for a youth but it seemed to suit with his disposition for though not given to outbursts of animal spirits he was always full of a certain strong and supporting cheerfulness  indeed though they did not like to own it to themselves the young people had left behind them much of the mournfulness of the widowed household which had borne down their youthful spirits and though the three elders could never be as those who had grown up without care or grief yet their sunshine could beam forth once more and helped them through the parting with their best friend for mr audleys sisterinlaw died in the beginning of june and his father entreated him to go abroad with his brother so that he was hurried away directly after midsummer after having left his books in felixs charge and provided for the reception of the dividends in his absence  his successor was a quiet amiable young mr bisset not at all disinclined to cultivate felix as a link with the tradesfolk only he had brought with him a mother a very nice prim gentlemannered blackeyed lady who viewed all damsels of small means as perilous to her son had she been aware that bexley contained anything so white and carnation so blueeyed and straightfeatured so stately and so penniless as wilmet underwood he would never have taken the curacy she was a kind woman who would have taken infinite pains to serve the orphan girls and she often called on them but when the rectors wife had told her that such a set had been made at mr audley that he could bear it no longer it was but a natural instinct to cherish her sons bashfulness  that autumn wilmet came home elevated by the news that the head teacher was going to retire at christmas and that she was to be promoted to her place of forty pounds a year her successor was coming immediately to be trained being in fact the daughter of miss pearsons sister who had married an officer in the army she had been dead about three years and the girl had been living in london with her father now on half pay and had attended a dayschool until he married again and finding his means inadequate to his expenses and his wife and daughter by no means comfortable together he suddenly flitted to jersey to retrench and made over his daughter of seventeen to her aunts to be prepared for governessship  this was the account miss pearson and miss maria gave to wilmet and wilmet repeated to geraldine who watched with some interest for the first report of the newcomer  she is rather a nicelooking little thing was the first report but i dont know whether we shall get on together  the next was miss maria has been begging me to try to draw her out they are quite distressed about her she is so stiff and cold in her ways with them and they think she cries in her own room  poor thing how forlorn she must be cannot you comfort her mettie  she will have nothing to say to me she is civil and dry just as she is to them  i think she can talk said angela  how do you know anything about it little one said wilmet  i heard her talking away to lizzie bruce in the arbour at dinner time her face looked quite different then from what it does in school  then i hope she is settling down to be happier said wilmet thoughtfully but having watched angela out of hearing she added not that i think lizzie bruce a good friend she is rather a weak girl and is flattered by carry price making a distinction between her and some of the others  when is carry price ever going to leave school  when she can play mendelssohn well enough to satisfy mr bevan i wonder lady price does keep her on here but in the meantime we can only make the best of her  a day or two later wilmet and angela came in from school eager indignant and victorious  you did manage it well the younger was saying i was so glad you saw for yourselfjust fancy cherry there were carry price and lizzie bruce turning out all the most secret corners of miss knevetts workbox laughing at them and asking horrid impertinent questions and she was almost crying  and you fetched wilmet  she was sitting out in the garden showing some of the little ones how to do their crochetit was the playtime after dinnerand i just went to her and whispered in her ear and so she strolled quietly by the window  yes added wilmet and before i came to it edith was saying to jane martin on purpose for me to hear that she thought it would be a good thing if miss underwood would look into the schoolroom so angel was not getting into a scrape  i should not have minded if i had said angel it was such a shame and she looks such a dear  there she was said wilmet her fingers shaking and her eyes full of tears trying to do some work while carry price went on in her scoffing voice laughing over all the little treasures and jewels and asking who gave them to her and what they cost all i could do was to put my hand on her shoulder and say i saw she did not like it and then lizzie bruce looked ashamed but miss price bristled up and declared that miss knevett had unlocked the  box herself then the poor child burst out that she had only said she would show her maltese cross she had never asked them to turn everything out and meddle with it and carry tossed her head just like my lady and said oh very well they did not want to see her trumpery since she was so cross about it i suppose you mean to show the things one by one to the little girls a fine exhibition she cried out exhibit i dont mean to exhibit at all i only showed it to you as my friend whereupon carry price flounced off with as if i were going to make a friend of an underteacher and she went into a tremendous fit of crying like what you used to have cherry except that it was more passionate  im sure i never had anything like that to cry for what did you do with her how lucky she had you  why when she went on sobbing ill not stay here i wont be insulted ill tell my aunts my great object was to get her upstairs and to silence her for i was sure miss pearson would dislike nothing so much as having a regular complaint from her about carry and besides that all the girls who pity her now would be turned against her and think her a mischiefmaker i did get her up at last and oh dear what a scene we had poor thing i suppose she has been a spoilt child going to a ladys fashionable institute as she calls it where she was a great girl and rather looked up to for the indulgences she got from her fathervery proud too of being a majors daughter then came the stepmother what things she said about her to be sure no end of misery and disputeswhose fault i am sure i dont know then a crisis of debts she says it was all mrs knevetts extravagance but miss pearson told me before that she thought it had been going on a long time and at last when the father and his wife and her child go off to jersey this poor girl is turned over to the aunts she never saw since her mother died twelve years ago  i dare say it is the best thing for her  if she can only think so but she fancies the being a teacher the most horrid thing in the world  oh wilmet interrupted angela why you like teaching and robin means to be a real governess and so do i if i am not a sister  me too called out stella  but you see this unlucky girl cant understand that teaching may be a real way of doing good she fancies it a degradation she says she and her friends at her institute hated and despised the teachers and played all manner of tricks upon them  how foolish the teachers must have been  she did say something about their being low and mean she did me the favour to say not like me and that she was quite shocked to find i was one of this dreadful race it was quite amazing to her when i told her how robinas dear miss lyveson keeps school without necessity only to be useful you may imagine what it is to her to be plunged all on a sudden into this unhappy class she began by trying to take her old place as an officers daughter and to consort with the girls but i think if she and carry price were left to one another she would very soon sink as low as any of the poor hounded teachers she describes  she must be very silly and conceited  no i think she is sensible and loving too at the bottom said wilmet only every one is strange here i think she will understand better soon and in the meantime she has quite forgiven me for being a teacher she clung about me and called me all sorts of pretty namesher only friend and so forth  perhaps she can forgive you for being a teacher in consideration of your being a twin said cherry  there cherry you understand her better already than i do ill bring her to you i have not time for such a friendship  poor thing i should like to try to comfort her if she is strange and dreary but i think she must be rather a goose whats her name  alice but in school miss pearson is very particular about having her called miss knevett we have exchanged christian names in private of course  you horrid old prosy thing of four us said geraldine you are sitting up there you great fair creature you for the poor child to worship and adore and not reciprocating a bit  of course said wilmet if she cant be happy without being petted i must pet her and let her be nonsensical about me but i think it is all great stuff and that you will suit her much better than i ever shall  do you never mean to have a friend mettie  oh no i havent time besides ive got alda  geraldine had however many dreams about the charms of friendship she read of it in the books that felix selected for her and robina had a vehement affection for a schoolfellow whose hair and whose carte she treasured and to whom she would have written daily during the holidays but for the cost of stamps the equality and freedom of the letters she received always made cherry long for the like since edgar had left her she had never been on those equal terms with any one wilmet was more like mother or aunt than sister and though felix had a certain air of confidence and ease when with her and made her his chief playfellow he could not meet all her tastes or all her needs and there was a sort of craving within her for intimacy with a creature of her own species  and though wilmets description of alice knevett did not sound particularly wise cherry in her humility deemed her the more secure of being on her own level not so sensible and intolerant of little dreams fancies and delusions as those two sensible people the twin sisters so she watched impatiently for the introduction and at last wilmet said well she is coming to tea tomorrow evening little ridiculous chit she bridled and doubted but as you were an invalid she supposed she might only it was not what she had been used to and papa might object  what to the shop well i really think she had better not come ill have nobody here that thinks it a favour and looks down on felix  my dear if she contrives to look down on felix after she has seen him she will deserve anything you please just now i believe the foolishness is in her school and not in herself  nevertheless geraldines eagerness underwent a great revulsion instead of looking forward to the visit she expected it with dread and dislike to the pert conceited flippant londoner who despised her noble brother and aspired to the notice of carry price her nervous shrinking from strangersthe effect of her secluded life increased on her every moment of that dull wet afternoon her feet grew cold her cheeks hot and she could hardly find temper or patience for the many appeals of bernard and stella for her attention  her foolish little heart was palpitating as if a housebreaker were entering instead of wilmet conducting a dainty cloud of fresh lilac muslin out of which appeared a shining black head and a smiling sparkling face with so much life and play about the mouth and eyes that there was no studying their form or colour and it was only after a certain effort that it could be realised that alice knevett was a glowing brunette with a saucy little nose retrousse though very pretty a tiny mouth full of small pearls and eyes of black diamond  in spite of her gracious manner and evident consciousness of her own condescension the winsomeness of the dancing eyes fascinated cherry at once indeed the simplicity and transparency of her little dignities disarmed all displeasure they were so childish and they vanished in a moment in a game at play with bernard and stella when wilmet brought out geraldines portfolio her admiration was enthusiastic if not critical  a sketch of wilmet and alda enchanted her she had never seen anything so lovely or so well done  no no said cherry rather shocked you must have seen the royal academy  oh but i am sure this ought to be in the royal academy i never saw anything there that i liked half so much how clever you must be  cherry could not but laugh at the extravagant compliment my brother edgar draws much better than that she said producing a capital watercolour of a group of flemish marketwomen  i shall always like yours best oh and what is this  i did not know it was there said cherry colouring and trying to take it away  oh let me look what is it a storm or a regatta or fishing boats what is that odd light what is written under the waves of this troublesome world why that is in the bible is not it  thirteen boats cherry said wilmet is that a device of your own  what not copied oh dear i wish i was so clever  it is the sea of this life isnt it said angela coming up is it ourselves cherry all making for the golden light of heaven and the star of faith guiding them  she reads it like a book exclaimed alice and those two close togetherthat means love i suppose  love and help the weak and the strong said geraldine in her earnest dreamy voice  do pray make a picture of my boat on a nice smooth sea of light i dont like rocks and breakers such as you have done there  there always must be a last long wave said cherry  oh but dont let us think about horrid things i like the summer sea arent there some verses        youth at the prow and pleasure at the helm   that would not be a pleasant augury said cherry do you know what this is meant for bad as it is longfellows verses  the phantom host that beleaguered the walls of prague how can you draw such things  so i say observed wilmet  they come and haunt me and i feel as if i must  who is this kneeling on the wall he looks like a knight watching his armour  so he is said cherry  but there is nothing about him in the poem did you make him for yourself  why he is ferdinand travis exclaimed wilmet  what is it a real man i thought it was somebody in a story  i see said angela quietly he is watching his armour the night before he was baptized  for the child had never forgotten the adult baptism though she had been little more than four years old at the time but she was one of those little ones to whom allegory seems a natural element with which they have more affinity than with the material world  however the mention of ferdinand travis led to the history of the fire at the hotel and of his recovery alice declared that everything nice seemed to happen at bexley and was laughed at for her peculiar ideas of niceness but there was something in the feminine prattle that was wonderfully new and charming to geraldine while on the other hand the visitor was conscious of a stimulus and charm that she had never previously experienced and the eager tongues never flagged till felix came in he had evidently taken pains with his toilette in honour of the unusual event and the measured grave politeness of his manners renewed alices scared punctilious dignity of demeanour and entire consciousness that she was a majors daughter and he a bookseller  but felix had brought in some exciting eastern news and alice put on an air capable as one connected with india and the army but she soon found out the deficiency of her geography and was grateful for the full clear explanations while her amour propre was gratified by finding that her familiarity with a few indian terms was valuable before the end of the evening all were at ease and she was singing with felix and wilmet at the old piano  no sooner had the door shut on her when the maid came to fetch her than a storm fell on wilmet  so thats what you call rather nicelooking  well she is undersized and very brown but i did think you would have allowed that she was rather pretty  rather exclaimed cherry indignantly  thats what it is to be a handsome woman said felix  do you mean to say that you think her anything remarkable said wilmet  say no more my dear w w laughed felix i never understood before why negroes dont admire white people  i am sure i dont know what you are talking about said wilmet betaking herself to her darning with great goodhumour alice knevett is prettier than i thought she was when she was all tears and airs but i cant see any remarkable beauty to rave about  no you cant said geraldine merrily you look much too high over her head but you see i dont and such a little sparkling diamond beetle is a real treat to me  and geraldine often enjoyed the treat  in a very short time the green door and steep stairs were as familiar to alice as to the underwoods themselves for her aunts were thankful to have her happy and safe and she was rapturously fond of geraldine reflecting and responding to most of her sentiments most of the underwoods had the faculty of imprinting themselves upon the characters of their friends by taking it for granted that they felt alike and alice knevett had not spent six weeks at bexley before she had come to think it incredible that she had thought either teaching or the underwoods beneath her she was taking pains to do her work well and enjoying it and was being moulded into a capital subordinate to wilmet while with geraldine she read and talked over her books obtained illustrations for the poetry she wrote out in her album and brought in a wholesome air of chatter which made cherry much more girllike than she had ever been before it was an importation of something external something lively and interesting which was very refreshing to all and even felix in his grave politeness and attention to his sisters friend manifested that so far from being in his way as they had feared he found her a very agreeable element when she joined the home party or the sunday walk  indeed there was a certain tendency to expansion about the life of the young people the pinch of poverty was less griping than previously and their natural spirits rose in january lance was allowed to bring his friend harewood to a concert of the choral society and on the following evening alice knevett came to tea and there was a series of wonderful charades chiefly got up by clement and robina and of comic songs by lance and bill harewoodall with such success that alice declared that she had never seen anything so delightful in all her experience of london christmases  the young people really seemed to have recovered elasticity enough that year to think of modest treats and holidays as they had never ventured to do since that memorable sixteenth birthday of felixs here was his twentyfirst not very far off and when it was announced that this identical 3rd of july had been fixed on for a grand choral meeting at the cathedral at which the choir of bexley was to assist there was such a spirit of enterprise abroad in the family that geraldine suggested that wilmet might take robina to see the cathedral and hear lance  lance will be just what will not be heard said felix they will not show off their solos but the robin ought to have the pleasure if possible and as i go in two capacities press and choir i hope we can manage it for her  he came in full early for the evening all right he said two tickets are come for the pursuivant and mr froggatt says he would not go at any price and besides each of the choir may take a friendso thats three  am i to be reporter or friend asked wilmet  reporter i think for you will have to do audience  nay cherry ought to be the gentleman connected with the press said wilmet for in fact geraldine did sometimes do copying and correcting work for her brother and indeed i do not see why she should not we could go home directly after morning service and leave you there  oh no impossible said geraldine it would never do it would only spoil everybodys pleasure and be too much for me  i think you are wise said felix and somehow it struck her with a prick that he had rather the proposal had not been made there is sure to be a great crush and i may be obliged to be with the choir  i am quite able to take care of her i can always lift her said wilmet surprised  i would not go on any account protested cherry i should be like the old woman in that servian proverb who paid five dollars to go to the fair and would have paid ten to be safe at home again  there might be no getting a bench fit for you to sit upon added felix who as a gentleman of the press was not devoid of experience i could not be easy about you my dear it is much safer not  perhaps so owned wilmet disappointed but angel is too little for such a long day and cherry is so much stronger that i thought  oh but could not alice knevett go put in cherry  a very good suggestion said felix she hardly ever has any amusements well thought of whiteheart  i believe he thought of it from the first felt geraldine angry with herself that this conviction gave a prick like the point of a needle she threw her energies into the scheme and was begging wilmet to go and make the proposal when there was a sudden peal of the bell a headlong trampling rush a dash open of the doortheodore began to hum the anthem how beautiful the other three small ones hailed lance at the top of their voices and his arms were round the neck of the first sister who came in his way  what lance how came you here  our organ is tuning up its pipesman comes tomorrowprayers in the lady chapel and not choral and its a holiday at school so i got off by the 520 and need not go back till the 610 tomorrow we are practising our throats out to lead you all on the 3rd you know yon are coming the whole kit of you  do we said wilmet it is only for the last ten minutes that we have known that any of us were coming  all right thats what im come about robina must be got home  she will be come she comes on the 1st  thats right then theres to be a great spread in bishops meads between services everybody sends provisions and asks their friends but cherry is to go and rest at the harewoods the governor will get her in through the library into the north transept as quiet as a lamb no squash at all it is only along the cloistera hop step and lump and miles has promised me the snuggest little seat for her then the harewood sofa  it is too much lance began cherry mrs harewood  dont be absurd she wishes it with all her heart she wont want a ticket if mr harewood smuggles her in but i can get as many as you want how manywilmet cherry robin angel and miss knevett shell come wont she  we were thinking of going to ask her  ill do it ive brought my own ticket for a friend for her here it is with l o u in the corner ill run down with it before any one else cuts in  hold hard said felix we shall not get her if you set about it in that wild way  oh but ill promise wilmet shall take her in tow and if anything will pacify the old girls that will  you had better let me come with you said wilmet  look sharp then is it a practising night yes thats well miles is in a state of mind at the short notice and has crammed me choke full of messages he says it will save his coming down come along then w w and softsawder the venerable aunts  no more of this operation was necessary than the assurance that miss underwood was going and that mrs harewood would be a sort of chaperon alice knevett was happy and grateful and if anything were wanting to the universal enthusiasm of anticipation it was supplied by lance the boy with his musical talent thorough trustworthiness and frank joyous manners was a favourite with the organist and was well versed in the programme and his eagerness and fulness of detail were enough to infect every one geraldine thought it was great proof of his unspoilableness that he took quite as much pleasure in bringing them to these services where he would be but a unit in the hundreds as if it had been one of the anthems of which every one said have you heard little underwood in the charm of the general welcome and the congratulation on lances arrangement geraldine had quite forgotten both her alarms and her tiny pang of surprise at not having been felixs prime thought lance by dint of a judicious mixture of hectoring and coaxing obtained leave for angela to be of the party though against wilmets judgment and bernard and stella were to spend the day with mrs froggatt which they regarded as an expedition quite as magnificent as that to st marys minster  mr froggatt was almost as eager about this pleasure for his young people as he called them as they could be he came in early to drive geraldine to the station and looked with grandfatherly complacency at the four sisters who had ventured on the extravagance of white pique and black ribbons and in their freshness looked as welldressed as any lady in the land  he entertained cherry all the way with his admiration of wilmets beauty and industry and when arrived at the station waited there with her till first the three girls came up with alice knevett white with pink ribbons and then the choir arrived marching with the banner with the rood of st oswald before them each with a blue satin bow in his buttonhole and the bag with his surplice under his arm the organist the schoolmaster and the two curates bringing up the rear mr bevan my lady and miss price whirled up in the carriage the omnibus discharged the friends of the choir and two waggon loads of musical talent from the villages came lumbering and cheering in the very train roared and shrieked in with a sound of cheering from its vertebrae and banners were projecting from the windows amid nodding heads and waving handkerchiefs of all colours the porters ran about distracted and geraldine began to be alarmed and to think of the old woman of servia but behold felix had her on one side mr froggatt on the other a solid guard held open the door and protected her from the rush and before she well knew what they were doing with her she was lying on the seat of the carriage with her sisters and alice all in a row in front of her the recently crowded platform was empty of all but a stray porter the stationmaster and mr froggatt kissing his hand and promising to come and fetch her on her return  the train seemed hardly to have attained its full speed before it slackened again and another merry load was disposed of within its joints another start another arrival and before the motion was over a flash of sunny looks had glanced before the sisters eyes there was lance perfectly radiant under his square trencher cap hair eyes cheeks blue bow boots and all seeming to sparkle with delight as he snatched open the door  hurrah there they are give her out to me wilmet as if she had been a parcel  stay wait for felix you cant  felix rushed up from his colleagues of the choir and geraldine was set on her foot and crutch come along ive got balls chair for you and bill harewood is sitting in it for fear any one should bone it wheres your ticket  lance take care dont take her faster than she can go as he whisked her over the platform and wilmet was impeded by the seeking for alices parasol and angelas cloak they were quite out of sight when lance had dragged cherry through the crowd at the door and brought her to the wheeled chair just in time to find bill harewood glaring out of it like the red planet mars and asseverating that he was the lame young lady it was hired for  in went geraldine imploring to wait for wilmet but all in vain off went the chair owner and escort alike in haste and she was swept along with lance and will with a hand holding either side of the chair imparting breathless scraps of information and exchanging remarks there goes the archdeacon the thorpe choir is not come and miles is mad about it thats the town hall theres where jack licked a cad for bullying theres a cannonball of oliver cromwells sticking out of that wall thats the only shop fit to get gingerbeer at that old horse in that cab was in the crimea we come last in the procession and if you see a fellow like a sheep in spectacles thats shapcote hurrah what a stunning lot where is it from bembury my eyes if that big fellow doesnt mean to bawl us all down down that waythats the palace whose carriage is it stopping there now heres the close  is that the cathedral oh  you may well say so no not that way and on rattled poor amazed geraldine through an archway under some lime trees round a corner round another comer to another arched doorway with big doors studded with nails with a little door for use cut out of one of the big ones  you must get out here said lance we are close by and he helped her out and paid and thanked the man with the chair heres our domain he continued as he introduced cherry through the open doorway into a small flagged court with two houses gray and old fashioned forming one side and on the other an equally old long low building with narrow latticed arched windows opposite to the entrance was a handsome buttressed gothiclooking edifice behind which rose the gable of the north transept of the cathedral beautiful with a rose window and farther back far far above the noble tower  already everything was very wonderful to geraldine thats our kennel said lance pointing to the low buildings to the right schools behind but we boarders are put up in one of the old monks dormitories between court and cloister  is it really exclaimed geraldine  so my father says said will heres our door another stone arched passage almost dark with doors opening on either side seemed common to both houses and will was inviting them to enter but lance held back no time he said better call your father  the others sighed geraldine  bother the others thats right here he is  halloo father cried will weve got cherry  by which unceremonious designation i imagine you to mean to introduce miss underwood said a figure appearing from beneath the archway in trencher cap surplice and hood with white hair and a sort of precision and blandness that did not at all agree with cherrys preconceived notions of the harewood household i am very glad to see you my ladies as usual are unready will you have a glass of wine nowhat do you say lancelotvery well we will take you in at once you will not object to waiting there and this is the quiet time boys you ought to be with the choir  oceans of time dad coolly answered will none of the fellows up there are under weigh  mr harewood offered his arm but perceived that cherry preferred lance and her crutch advancing to the door opposite that by which they had entered he unlocked it and geraldine found herself passing through a beauteous old lofty chamber with a groined tudor roof all fans and pendants and shields tall windows stained with armorial bearings parchment charters and blazoned genealogies against the walls and screens upon screens loaded with tomes of all ages writingtables and chairs here and there and glasstopped tables containing illuminations and seals here is my paradise said the librarian smiling  i think it must be said geraldine with a long breath of wonder and admiration  ah would you not like to have a good look cherry said lance thats richard coeur de lions seal in there  dont begin about itdont set him on whispered willie with a sign of his head towards his father who was fitting the key into the opposite door or we shall all stay here for the rest of the day  this low door open mr harewood and the boys bared their heads as they entered and geraldine felt the strange solemn sensation of finding herself in a building of vast height and majesty full of a wonderful stillness as though the confusion of sounds she had been in so recently were far far off  where now lancelot asked mr harewood in a hushed voice do you want me any further  no thank you sir ill just take her across the choir to mr miles and then join the rest of us at the vestry  goodbye for the present then said mr harewood kindly you are in safe hands your brother comes round every one i could not do this  through the sidescreen into the grandly beautiful choir arching high above with stallwork and graceful canopies below and rich glass casting down beams of coloured lightall for glory and for beauty thought geraldine  you must not stop you must look when you are settled thats my side pointing to one of the choristers desks it will be only we that sing in here the congregation is in the navea perfect sea of chairs ill come for you when it is over here is mr miles my sister sir  a pale gentleman in spectacles with a surplice and beautiful blue hood was here addressed he too greeted geraldine very shyly but kindly and she found herself expected to ascend some alarming looking stone steps the organ was on the choir screen and to the organists little private gallery was she to ascend it was a difficult matter and she had in her trepidation despairingly recognised the difference between lances good will and felixs practised strength but at last she was landed in an admirable little cushioned nook hidden by two tall painted carved canopiesexactly over the deans head her brother told herand where as she sat sideways she could see through the quatrefoils into the choir on the right hand and the nave on the left delightful oh thank you how kind if i am only not keeping any one out  no said lance smiling and whispering lower than ever he has no one belonging to him he hates women never a petticoat was here before in his reign have you a book  they are robing underwood said the misogynist in the organloft and lance hurried away leaving geraldine alone palpitating a good deal but almost enjoying the solitude in the vast structure where the sanctity of a thousand years of worship seemed to fill the very air as she gazed at the white vaultings and bosses carved with emblems above at the vista of clustered columns terminating in the great jewelled west window or at the crownlike loveliness that encompassed the sanctuary all was still except a deep low tone of the organ now and then mr miles looked in after the first to hope she did not feel it uncomfortably and to assure her that though she was too near his organ she need not fear its putting forth its full powers it was to be kept in subordination and only guide the voices this was great attention from a womanhater and geraldine ventured to reiterate her thanks at which he smiled and said when one has such a boy as your brother there is pleasure in doing anything he wishes you are musical  i never was able to learn to play  but you can read music  oh yes for she had often copied it  so he brought her whole sheets of music and put her in the way of following and understanding perceiving as he went that she was full of intelligence and perception  when he went back to his post a few groups looking very small were creeping in by transept doorsby favour like herself then a little white figure flitted across to the desks opened and marked the books took up something and disappeared and in another moment lance in his broad white folds was at her side heres the music oh you have it ive seen fee he whispered they are at mrs harewoods all right and he was gone  here she sat her attention divided between the sacred impressions of the place its exceeding beauty and the advance of the multitude into the nave as the doors were open and they surged up the space left in the central aisle and occupied the ranks of chairs prepared for them then came a long pause she scanned each row in search of her sisters and only was confused by the host of heads felt lost and lonely and turned her eyes and mind to the silent grandeur to the east rather than the throng to the west  at last there came the sweet floating sound of the chant growing in power like the ocean swell as it approached and the first bright banner appeared beneath the lofty pointed archway and the double white file came flowing on like a snowy glacier the chant becoming clear and high as the singers of each parish marched along to their places each ranked under a bright banner with the symbol of their churchs dedication st oswalds rood helped geraldine to make out that of bexley better than their faces though she did make out her eldest brothers fair face and trace him to his seat the cathedral singers came at last and that kenspeckle red head of will harewoods directed her to the less conspicuous locks belonging to lance whose own clear thrushlike note she could catch as he passed beneath the screen then came the long train of parish clergy the canons the dean and lastly the bishop the sight of whom recalled so much  the unsurpliced contribution had meantime been ushered in by the side doors and filled seats in the rear of the others so as to add their voices without marring the general effectthe perfection of which geraldine enjoyedof the whiterobed multitude that seemed to fill the whole chancel  the sight seemed to inspire her whole soul with a strange yearning joy as though she were beholding a faint earthly reflex of the great vision of the beloved disciple and far more was it so at the sound which realised in a measure the words as the voice of mighty waters and as the voice of thunder  these were the very words that had been selected for the second lesson and the first consisted of those verses in which we hear of davids commencement of the continual chant of psalms at the sanctuary and both unwonted as they were gave a wonderful thrill to the audience as though opening to them a new comprehension of their office as singers of the sanctuary  there is no need to dwell on the wonderful and touching exhilaration derived from the harmony of vast numbers with one voice attuned to praise it is a sensation which is so nearly a foretaste of eternity that participation alone can give the most distant perception thereof to the entirely unprepared and highly sensitive geraldine it was most overpowering all the more because she was entirely out of sight and without power of taking part by either gesture or posture she was passive and had no vent for her emotion  lance who made his way to her round through the transept the moment he had disrobed found her pale panting tearful and trembling with burning cheeks so that his exaltation turned to alarm are you done up cherry it is too hot up here ill try to find felix or wilmet which  neither i am quite well onlyo lance i did not know anything could be so heavenly there seemed to be the sweeping of angels wings all round and over me and papas voice quite clear  i know said lance it always does come in that te deum  the sister and brother were silent not yet able for the critical discussion of single points only as he put his arm round her to help her to rise she said with a sigh o lance it is a great thing to be one of them thank you i think this is the greatest day of all my life  the getting her down what with lances inexperience and want of height and strength was anxious work and just as it had been safely accomplished the rest of their party were seen roaming the aisle in distress and perplexity geraldine was very glad of felixs substantial arm but she had rather he had omitted that rebuke for venturesomeness in dealing with her which would have affronted fulbert but never seemed to trouble lance who was only triumphant in his success and her perfect contentment charmed away the vexation which really arose from a slight sense of having neglected her  the others had been perfectly happy in their several ways and made eager comments on their way to the house of harewood whither lance piloted themthis time by the front way through the garden which lay behind the closeentering in spite of the mannerly demurs of the elder ones through the open door into a hall whence a voice of hearty greeting at once ensued here you are at last and hows the poor darling your sister not overtired  and cherry before she was aware found herself kissed and almost snatched away from felix to be deposited on a sofa and while the like kisses were bestowed on the two little girls and hospitable offers showered on all she was amused by perceiving that good mrs harewood was endowed with exactly the same grotesque order of ugliness as her son william but she was even more engaging from an indescribably droll mixture of heedlessness blundering and tender motherliness  there now youll just leave her to me the poor dear and lance will take you down to the mead and find papa and the girls for you  oh thank you i could not think of your staying now pray  now prays were to no purpose mrs harewood professed only to want an excuse for staying at homeshe did not want to be done up with running after her girls to the four ends of the mead when it was a long step for her to begin with off with them  so when wilmet was satisfied that geraldine was comfortable the five moved offfelix and alice angel in wilmets hand and lances and robinas tongues wagging so fast that the wonder was how either caught a word of what the other was saying  meanwhile mrs harewood tossing her bonnet and gloves aside in perfect indifference to the exposure of the curious structure of red and gray hair she thus revealed lavished meats and drinks upon her guest waiting on her with such kindness that in spite of all weariness and craving for quiet after these deep and wonderful impressions it was impossible not to enjoy that warmth of heart there was exactly the tender motherliness that even wilmet and sister constance could not give  it was charming to hear how fond mrs harewood was of lance and how the having such a companion had made it possible to keep her willie at the cathedral school where the mixture of lads was great but the master firstrate he thought highly of the promise of both but to tell the truth said mrs harewood as she sat and fanned herself with her husbands trencher cap looking more than ever like a frog in a strawberry bed though my willie is the cleverest boy in the school little good his cleverness would have done him and he would have been harumscarum bill more than ever if it were not for lance so say his father and brother jack so that they will not be for his going to a public school unless lance were sure of it too  will not they be able to stay on here  mrs harewood explained that the year that the barristerschoristers she meantwere sixteen when their voices were usually unserviceable they together with those of like age in the school were subjected to an examination and the foremost scholar obtained an exhibition in virtue of which he could remain free of expense for another two years and then could try for one of the minsterham scholarships at one of the colleges at cambridge those who failed either had to pay like the ordinary schoolboys or left the school  dear mrs harewood was a perfect malaprop and puzzled geraldine by continually calling the present occasion the rural meeting and other like slips uncommonly comical in a welleducated woman with the words she knew best  all this and a great deal moreabout the shy womanhating organist and the unluckiness of the dissenterno precentorhaving a sick wife and the legal difficulties that prevented building a better house for the boarders than the queer long room where they lodged between the cloister and the baileythe proper name of the little court by which geraldine had comewas poured out and kind as it was there was a certain sense of having been talked to death  a whole flood of harewoods underwoods and untold numbers besides swept into the room as the bell began to ring for evensong most sincere were cherrys entreaties that she might be left alone she could not go back to her coign of vantage it had been too beautiful for her to bear more she said and she severally declined offers of companionship from three female harewoods and two sisters telling wilmet at last that all she wanted was to be still and alone  alone she was but not still for there was nothing to hinder the magnificent volume of sound that surged around the cathedral from coming to her and she could trace the service all alongin chant pealing mighty amens with the hush between in anthem and in jubilant hymn she was more calmly happy than in the oppressive grandeur of the morning as she lay there in the cool drawingroom with the open window veiled by loose sprays of untrimmed roses and sacred prints looking down from the walls  the solitude lasted rather too long when she had heard the hum and buzz of the host pouring out of the cathedral and still no one came they were to go home by the 510 train and every time she counted the chimes she became more alarmed lest they should be too late minutes dragged on five it was five was she forgotten should she be only missed and remembered at the station too late tired nervous unused to oblivion she found tears in her eyes and was too sorrowful and angry with her own impatience even to think of the old woman of servia hark a trampling had they remembered her but oh it would be late for the train  in burst lance in his cap and little short quaint black gown  o lance i shall be too late  you dont go by this train  oh dear oh dear mr froggatt was to meet me and the tears started from her eyes how could felix forget  never mind theres sure to be a fly or something  yes but mr froggatt waiting  never mind repeated lance tis a fine evening to air the old boss  dont lance you none of you have any proper regard for mr froggatt which as far as lance was concerned was unjust and it was well for cherry that it was not addressed to either of the brothers who better deserved it  what lance did was to execute one of his peculiar summersaults and then making up a dismal face to say alas i commiserate the venerable citizen disappointed of the pleasure of driving my lady geraldine home from the wash as well as hisself  she was past even appreciating the bathos it is no laughing matter she said it is so uncivil when he is so kind i cant imagine what felix is thinking of  croquet said lance briefly then seeing the flushed quivering mortified face he added wilmet has not forgotten you one bit cherry but alice knevett and robin did so want to see the fun in the meadtheres running in sacks and all sorts of gamesthat theres no getting any one away and the ws are in charge and cant leave them to their own devices so she said perhaps you would be more rested by lying still than rattling home  oh i dare say wilmet is as sorry as anybody said cherry rather querulously for the needle point was pricking her again  and as to your dear old froggy continued lance she says he told her he did not in the least expect you back by this train and if you did not come by it hell stay in town for the 850  how very good of him said cherry beginning to be consoled and felix at croquet  alice is teaching him you never did see such a joke as old blunderbore screwing up his eyes at the balls and making at them with his mallet like a sledgehammer he and alice and robin and that bisset curate are playing against bill two of the girls and shapcotebexley against minsterham and little bobbies a real out andouter shell make her side win by sheer cool generalship  and poor little angel the needle point was a pang now  oh angel is happier than ever she was in her life the bishops daughter has a turn for little kids and has got all the small ones together in the pleached alley playing at all manner of things  run back lance to the fun i shall do very well said poor geraldine  i should think so when i get you so often scornfully ejaculated lancelot drawing a dilapidated brioche from under the sofa and squatting on it with his dancing eyes close to her sad ones  an effusion of spirits prompted her to lay her hands on his shoulders kiss him on each cheek and cry o lance you are the very sweetest boy  sweetest treble you mean said lance quaintly if you had only heard me you should see how the old ladies in the stalls peep and whisper and how bill harewood opens his mouth rather wider than it will go and they think it is he  not for fun lance  well i believe all their jaws are hung on looser than other peoples but i say aint you dying of thirst  perhaps mrs harewood will give us some tea when she comes in  if you trust to that  o lance she cried alarmed at seeing him coolly ring the bell  bless you shes forgotten all about you and tea and everything they are drinking it by the gallon in the tents and by and by shell roll in ready to cry that youve had none and mad with herself and me for giving you none and the fire will be out and the kettle will boil about ten minutes after you are off by the train well have some this minute  but lance  but cherry aint i a walking sahara with roaring at the tiptop of my voice to lead the clodhoppers how they did bellow i owe it as a duty to the chapter to wet my whistle  one comfort is nobody knows your coolness nobody comes for all your ringing  reason good every living soul in the house is in the bishops meadow barring the old cat i seen em with their capstrings flying but thats nothing i know where mother harewood keeps her tea and sugar and he pounced on a teacaddy of indian aspect  lance if you did that to mettie  exactly so i dont and he ran out of the room while cherry sat up on her sofa her petulance quite banished between amusement and desperation at such proceedings in a strange house he came back presently with two cups saucers and plates apparently picked up at haphazard as no two were alike my dear lance where have you been  in the kitchen such a jolly arched old hole bill and i have done no end of welsh rabbits there once when we were melting some lead bill let it drop into the pudding and the pater got it at dinner and said it was the heaviest morsel he ever had to digest  but wasnt it poison  i suppose not for you see he isnt dead another time when we were melting glue we upset a whole lot of fat and the chimney caught fire and wasnt that a go bill got a pistol out of jacks room and fired it up the chimney to bring the soot down and down it came with a vengeance he was regularly singed and i do think the place would have been burned if it had not been too old all the shapcotes ran out into the court hallooing fire and the engine came but there was nothing for it to do oh the face wilmet would make to see that kitchen kettles bilingi must run  he came back with an enormous metal teapot in one hand and a boiling kettle in the other a cloud of vapour about his head  you appear in a cloud like a greek divinity said cherry beginning to enter into the humour of the thing  bringing nectar and ambrosia said lance depositing the kettle amid the furbelows of paper in the grate and proceeding to brew the tea excuse the small trifles of milk and cream and as to bread i cant find it but here are the cakes you had for luncheon shunted off into the passage window sugar cherry fingers were made before tongs now i call this jolly  i only hope this isnt a great liberty  if you fired off a cannon under mrs harewoods nose she would not call it a liberty  so it appears but mr harewood does not looklike that  oh hes well broken in he is the pink of orderliness in his own study and the library but as long as no one meddles there he minds nothing it just keeps him alive but i believe the shapcotes think this house a mild lunatic asylum  who are the shapcotes  hes registrar they live in the other half of this placethe old infirmary mr harewood calls it such a contrast he is a tremendous old turk in his house and she is a little mincing woman and theyve made gushes one of us you knowa horrid sneak and think its all my bad company and bills bytheby cherry gus shapcote asked me if my senior wasnt spoony about  i nope you told him to mind his own business cried geraldine with a great start of indignation  i told him he was a sheep said lance but i say cherry i want to know what you think of it  think im not so ready to think nonsense  well when the old giant was getting some tea for her i saw two ladies look at one another and wink  abominably illmannered she cried growing ruddier than the cherry  but had you any notion of it  impossible she said breathlessly he is only kind and civil to her as he is to everybody think how young he is  im sure i never thought old blunderbore much younger than methuselah twentyone isnt it about the age one does such things  not when one has twelve brothers and sisters on ones back sighed geraldine poor felix no there cant be anything in it dont let us think of foolish nonsense this wonderful day what a glorious hymn that was  lance laid his head lovingly on the sofacushion and discussed the enjoyment of the day with his skilled appreciation of music geraldines receptive power was not inferior to his own though she had none of that of expression nor of the science in which he was trained he was like another being from the merry rattle he was at other times and she had more glimpses than she ever had before of the high nature and deep enthusiasm that were growing in him  hark theres somebody coming she cried starting  let him come oh it is the paterhere is some capital tea mr harewood have some ill get a cup  you are taking care of your sister that is right a good colonist you would makecome in lee said mr harewood who to cherrys increased consternation was followed by another clergyman we are better off than i dared to expect thanks to this young gentleman miss geraldine underwoodmr leeyou knew her father i think  not poor underwood of bexley indeed i knew him i always wished i could have seen more of him said mr lee coming up and heartily shaking hands with cherry and asking whether she was staying there etc  meantime lance had fetched a blue china soupplate a white cup and pink spotted saucer another plate labelled nursery a coffeecup and saucer one brown and the other blue and as tidily as if he had been lady of the house or parlourmaid presented his provisions mr harewood accepting with a certain quiet amusement his remarkable trim neatness of appearance and oldschool precision of manner made his quiet humorous acquiescence in the wild ways of his household all the more droll after a little clerical talk that reminded cherry of the old times when she used to lie on her couch supposed not to understand but dreamily taking in much more than any one knewit appeared that mr lee wanted to see something in the library and mr harewood asked her whether she would like to come and see coeur de lions seal  she was fully rested and greatly pleased lances arm was quite sufficient now and she studied the cathedral and its precincts in a superexcellent manner mr harewood who had spent almost his whole life under its shadow and knew the history of almost every stone or quarry of glass was the best of lionisers and gave her much attention when he perceived how intelligent and appreciative she was he showed her the plan of the old conventual buildings and she began to unravel the labyrinth through which she had been hurried the close and deanery were modernised but he valued the quaint old corner where he lived for its genuine age the old house now divided between him and mr shapcote had been the infirmary and the long narrow building opposite between the bailey and the cloister had been the lodgings either of laybrothers or servants there being few boarders at the cathedral school they had always been lodged in the long narrow room with the second master in a little closet shut off from them cherry was favoured with a glance at lances little corner with the oldfashioned black oak bedstead solid but unsteady table and stool the equally old press and the bookcase he had made himself with boards begged from his friend the carpenter a photograph and drawing or two and a bat completed the plenishing she thought it very uncomfortable but lance called it his castle and mr harewood pointing to the washing apparatus related that in his day the cock in the bailey was the only provision for such purposes the boys were safely locked in at eight every night when the curfew rang and the bailey door was shut there being no other access to the rooms except by the cathedral through the library and the private door that led into the passage common to the harewoods and shapcotes  the loveliness of the cloister the noble vault of the chapterhouse the various beauties and wonders of the cathedral and lastly the curiosities of the librarywhere mr harewood enthroned her in his own chair unlocked the cases brought her the treasures and turned over the illuminated manuscripts for her as if she had been a princessmade geraldine forget time weariness and anxiety until as the summer sun was at last taking leave a voice called at the window here she is i thought papa would have her here and the freckled face of a miss harewood was seen peering in  there the truants were eager hurried afraid for the train full of compunction for the long abandonment alice most apologetic wilmet most quiet felix most attentive robina still ecstatic and angela tired outthere they all were it was all one hasty scramble to the crowded station and then one merry discussion and comparison of notes all the way home geraldine maintaining that she had enjoyed herself the best of all and alice incredulous of the pleasure of sitting in a musty old library with an old gentleman of at least sixty while felix was so much delighted to find that she had been so happy that he almost believed that the delay had been solely out of consideration for her  mr froggatt was safe at the station in his basket full of delight at the enjoyment of his young people and of anecdotes of bernard and stella and geraldine found herself safely deposited at home but with one last private apology from wilmet as she was putting her to bed i did not know how to help it she said alice was so wild with delight that i could not get her away and felix was enjoying his holiday so thoroughly i knew that you would be sorry it should be shortened  indeed i am very glad you stayed it would be too bad to encumber you  i wanted to come and see after you but i had promised miss pearson not to lose sight of alice and then lance offered to take care of you  o wilmet i never half knew what a dear boy lance is what boy would have come when all that was going on to stay with a lame cross thing like me and how nice for him to have such kind friends as the harewoods  they seem very fond of him said wilmet but i wish he had taken up with the shapcotes i never saw such a house it is enough to ruin all sense of order but they were very kind to us and if you were well off it was all right i never saw felix look so like his bright old self as today and it is his birthday after all  so wilmet was innocent of all suspicionswise experienced wilmet that was enough to make cherry forget that little thorn of jealousy especially as things subsided into their usual course and she had no more food for conjecture     chapter xii  giant despairs castle    who haplesse and eke hopelesse all in vaine  did to him pace sad battle to darrayne  disarmd disgraste and inwardly dismayde  and eke so faint in every ioynt and vayne  through that fraile fountaine which him feeble made                                                    spenser   felixs majority made no immediate difference his thirteenth part of his fathers small property remained with the rest at any rate until his guardian should return from his travels in the east but in the course of the winter his kind old godfather admiral chester died and having no nearer relation left him the result of his small savings out of his pay which would the lawyer wrote amount to about a thousand pounds but there was a good deal of business to be transacted and it would be long before the sum was made over to him  wilmet and geraldine thought it a perfect fortune leading to the university and release from trade and they looked rather crestfallen when they heard that it only meant 30 pounds per annum in the funds or 50 pounds in some risky investment mr froggatts wish was that he should purchase such a share in the business as would really give him standing there but wilmet heard this with regret she did not like his thus binding himself absolutely down to trade  you are thinking for alda said felix smiling you are considering how froggatt and underwood will sound in her ears  in mine too felix i do not like it  i would willingly endure it to become redstones master said felix quietly  is he still so vexatious asked geraldine for not above once in six months did felix speak of any trials from his companions in business  not actively so but things might be better done and much ill blood saved i cannot share w ws peculiar pride in preferring to be an assistant instead of a partner  then this is what you mean to do with it  wait till it comes he said oracularly seriously though i dont want to tie it all up the boys may want a start in life  neither sister thought of observing that the legacy was to one not to all everybody regarded what belonged to felix as common property and the boys were far enough into their teens to begin to make their future an anxious consideration clement was just seventeen and though he had outgrown his voice was lingering on as a sort of adopted child at st matthews helping in the parish school and reading under one of the clergy in preparation for standing for a scholarship he tried for one in the autumn but failed so much to his surprise and disgust that he thought hostility to st matthews must be at the bottom of his rejection and came home with somewhat of his martyrlike complacency at christmas meaning to read so hard as to force his way in spite of prejudice he was very tall fair and slight and his features were the more infantine from a certain melancholy babylike gravity which music alone dispersed he really played beautifully and being entrusted with the organ during the schoolmasters christmas holidays made practising his chief recreation that lance would often follow him into church for a study and always made one of the group round the piano when alice knevett came to sing with them was a great grievance to fulbert who never loved music and hated it as a rival for lances attention  these two were generally the closest companions and were alike in having more boyishness restlessness and enterprise than their brothers this winter their ambition was to be at all the meets within five miles follow up the hunt and be able to report the foxs death at the end of the day indeed their appetite for whatever bore the name of sport was as ravenous as it was indiscriminate and their rapturous communications could not be checked by clements manifest contempt or the discouraging indifference of the restall but robina who loved whatever lance loved and was ready to go to a meet if wilmet had not interfered with a high hand  before long felix wished that his authority over the male part of the family were as well established as that in her department  one hunting day the two brothers came in splashed up to the eyes recounting how they had found a boy of about their own age in a ditch bruised and stunned but not seriously hurt how with consolation and schoolboy surgery they had cheered him and found he was harry collis whom they had known as a schoolfellow at bexley how they had helped him home to marshlands hall and had been amazed at the dreariness and want of all home comfort at the place so that they did not like to leave him till his father came home and how captain collis had not only thanked them warmly but had asked them over to come and shoot rabbits the next day  there was nothing to blame them for but felix had much rather it had never happened captain collis was one of a race of squires who had never been very reputable and had not risen greatly above the farmer he had been in the army and had the bearing of a gentleman but ever since his wifes death he had lived an unsatisfactory sort of life at the hall always forward in sport but not well thought of and believed to be a good deal in debt his only child this harry collis had been sent somewhat fitfully to the st oswalds grammar school and had been rather a favourite companion of lances but separation had put an end to the intimacy and this renewal was not at all to the taste of their eldest brother  it cant be helped this time he said when he heard of the invitation i suppose you must go tomorrow but i dont fancy the concern  fulberts bristles began to rise but lance chatted gaily on but fee you never saw such a place stables for nine hunters only think and a horse entered for the derby we are to see him to morrow it is the jolliest place  nine hunters moralised clement they cost as much as three times nine orphans  and they are worth a dozen times as much as the nasty little beggars said fulbert  on which angela put in the trite remark that the orphans had souls  precious rum ones muttered fulbert and in the clamour thus raised the subject dropped but when next morning in the openness of his heart lance invited clement to go with them to share the untold joys of rabbitshooting he met with a decisive reply certainly not i should think your dean would be surprised at you  oh the dean is a kind old chap answered lance offhand whenever he has us to sing at a party he tips us all round thanks us and tells us to enjoy ourselves in the supperroom like a gentleman as he is  do you know what this colliss character is  hang his character i want his rabbits  and lance was off with fulbert while clement remained to make geraldine unhappy with his opinion of the temptations of marshlands hall returning to the charge when felix came in before dinner  yes said felix briefly mr froggatt has been telling me it must be stopped  have you heard of the mischief that  dont be such a girl tina i am going to do the thing and there is no use in keeping on about it  felix had not called clement tina since he had been head of the family and irritability in him was a token of great perplexity for indeed his hardest task always was the dealing with fulbert and he was besides very sorry to balk the poor boys of one of their few chances of manly amusement  he would have waited to utter his prohibition till the excitement should have worked off but he knew that clement would never hold his peace through the narrative of their adventures so as they had not come in when his work was over he took theodore on his arm and retreated to the little parlour behind the shop where he lay in wait reading and mechanically whistling tunes to theodore till he heard the bell and went to open the door  the gas showed them rosy merry glorious and bespattered one waving a couple of rabbits and the other of pheasants and trying to tickle theodores cheeks with the long tails of the latter of course frightening him into a fretful wail  take theodore upstairs if you please lance said felix and then come down i want you  the captain was going to dine at bowsteads said fulbert so he drove us in his dogcart if the frost holds we are to go out and skate on monday  felix employed himself in putting away his papers without answering  i had very good luck continued fulbert four out of six wonderful for so new a hand the captain said  such a lovely animal you never saw said lance swinging himself downstairs you must walk out and see it fee for youll have it in the pursuivant some saturday  lance i am very sorry said felix standing upright with his back to the exhausted grate just attend to me both of you  oh said lance hastily i know theres a lot of old womens gossip about collis but nobody minds such stuff harry is as good a lad as ever stepped and there was no harm to be seen about the placewas there ful  the old frog has been croaking hoarsely muttered fulbert  boys of sixteen and fourteen were incapable of coercion by a youth of oneandtwenty and the only appeal must be to conscience and reason so felix went on speaking though he had seen from the first that fulberts antagonism rendered him stolid deaf and blind and lancelots flushed cheeks angry eyes impatient attempts to interrupt and scornful gestures told of scarcely repressed passion  you may have seen no harm i find no fault fulbert scowled but if i had known what i do now i should not have let you go today my father would rather have cut off his right hand than have allowed you to begin an acquaintance which has been ruinous to almost all the young men who have been in that set  but we are not young men cried lance it is only for the holidays and we only want a little fun with poor harry he is so lonelyand just to go out rabbiting and skating it is very hard we cant be let alone the first time anything worth doing has turned up in this abominable slow place  it is very hard lance no one is more concerned than i but if this intimacy once begins there is no guessing where it will lead and i do not speak without grounds listen  if it comes from old frog you may as well shut up said lance theres been no peace at marshlands since he took that cottagea regular old nuisance and mischiefmaker spiting the captain because one of the dogs killed his old cock and bothering charlie to no end about him  i have heard from others as well said felix and he briefly mentioned some facts as to the scandals of the dissipated household some of the imputations under which captain collis lay and named two or three of the young men whose unsatisfactory conduct was ascribed to his influence  he saw that both lads were startled and wound up with saying therefore it is not without reason that i desire that you do not go there again  with which words he opened the door turned off the gas and walked upstairs hearing on the way a growl of fulbertsthats what comes of being cad to a stupid brute of an old tradesman and likewise a bouncing rolling and tumbling and a very unchoristerlike expletive from lance but he hurried up like the conclave from the vault at lindisfarn only with a sinking heart and looks that made his sisters say how tired he must be the boys were seen no more but sent word by bernard that they were wet through they should not dress but should get some supper in the kitchen and go to bed  on sunday lance had recovered himself and his temper but in the evening he made another attempt upon felix in private his heart was greatly set upon marshlands and he argued that there was no evil at all in what they had been doing and entreated felix to be content with the promise both were willing to make to take no share in anything doubtfulnot even to play at billiards or cardsif that would satisfy him said lance but we will promise anything you please against playing or betting or  i know lance you once made such a promise and kept it i trust you entirely but before it would have been cruel to keep you from that sick boy now this would be mere running into temptation for your own amusement  harry is not much better off than fernan was said lancelot wistfully  poor fellow very likely not but it would be more certain harm to yourself than good to him any way no respectable person would choose to be intimate there or to let their boys resort there and it is my duty not to consent  ful is in such an awful way said lance disconsolately fee you dont know how hard it is you always were such a muff  that is true said felix not at all offended and i had my father and edgar but indeed lance nothing ever was so hard to me to do as this i cannot say how sorry i am  you do really order me not said lance looking straight up at him  i do i forbid you to go into captain colliss grounds or to do more than exchange a greeting if you meet him  i will not theres my word and honour for it sincesince you are so intolerably led by the nose by old frog and lance flung away with the remains of his passion worked up afresh and was as glum as his nature allowed the rest of the evening but felix though much annoyed saw that the boy had set up voluntarily two barriers between himself and his tempted willin the command and the promise  but the command that was a guard to the one was a goad to the other for fulbert had never accepted his eldest brothers authority and could not brook interference still his school character was good and there was a certain worth about him which made him sometimes withdraw his resistance though never submit and felix had some hope that it would be so in the present case when while speeding to church in the dark winter monday morning he overheard lance say to clement i say clem tis a jolly stinging frost if youll take your skates and give us a lesson well be off for the lake at centry  one of the whittingtonian curates had taken the boys to the ice in the parks and taught them so effectively that clement was one of the best skaters in bexley but he was too much inclined to the nayward not to reply i have to practise that anthem for wednesday  oh bother the practice  which felix mentally echoed  i can play that anthem if thats all said lance and i believe you know it perfectly well now clem dont be savage i think if you will come we might put that other thing out of fuls head  well if you think it is to be of use  thats right thank you cried lance and you wont jaw us all the way he cant stand that you know  clement winced but in compensation apparently for this forbidden lecture he observed i am glad you at least take it properly lance though it would be worse in you than in him considering your  bother it unceremoniously broke in lance and the words of wisdom were silenced  lance did his best to organise his party but it was a failure fulbert said he had made an engagement and would not break it he was not bound to toady old froggy nor in bondage to any old fogeys of a dean and chapter and he walked off the faster for clements protest leaving lance to roll on the floor and climb the balusters backwards to exhale his desire to follow he was too much upset even to follow clement to the organ or to settle to the drawing which cherry was teaching him and was a great torment to himself and his sisters till dinnertime when clement had done his organ and his greek and was ready for a rush for the ice and robina went joyously with them between two young ladies one cant well run into harms way said lance  so things went on for a fortnight fulbert never shuffled he went openly to marshlands hall and though not boasting of his expeditions did not treat them as a secret wilmet and geraldine each tried persuasion but were silenced rudely and felix unable to enforce his authority held his tongue but was very unhappy both for the present and for the future he did not believe much harm was doing now but the temptation would increase with every vacation as the boys came nearer to manhood and he seemed to have lost all influence and moral power over fulbert  good old mrs froggatt gave a small childrens party to which with many apologies she invited the lesser underwoods under charge of wilmet they were to sleep at the cottage and wilmet having offered to help in dressing the christmastree they set out early in the day to walk escorted by the three brothers that the trio did not return to tea did not alarm felix and geraldine who suspected that the dislike the two elder expressed to the whole house of froggatt had melted before the pleasure of working at the tree  the evening was taken up in the discussion of a letter of edgars more than usually discontented with his employment and another of aldas who had been laid under orders to write to her eldest brother and desire him to remonstrate with edgar on his inattention laziness and pleasureseeking the anxiety had long been growing up felix had come to write his difficult letter by the light of geraldines sympathy and they were weighing what should be said when the doorbell rang some sounds puzzled them and just as felix was getting up to see what was the matter fulbert put his head in at the door and said low but earnestly step here felix please  he thought there must have been some terrible accident but when from the top of the stairs he beheld clements aspect under the gas in the passage and heard the thick tones in which he was holding forth according to instinct his consternation was almost greater than at any injury fulbert looked pale and astounded i cant get him upstairs he said  however sense enough remained to clement to give effect to his eldest brothers stern words be quiet and come up and they dragged him stumbling upstairs without more words  wheres lance then asked felix  stayed at the froggatts i wish he hadnt he will walk home by and by  now ful run and tell cherry that nobody is hurt do not let her get frightened  felix spoke resolutely but he felt so full of dismay and horror that he hardly knew what he was doing till fulbert had returned and repressing all poor clements broken moralities they had deposited him safely in bed and shut the door on him then fulbert gazed up at felix with eyes full of regret and consternation and he gathered breath to enter his own room and say what is the meaning of this  his head must be ridiculously weak or there was some beastly trick nobody else was the least queer  marshlands hall  well he had gone on at me so that when lance let himself be persuaded into staying to hang up the lamps it struck me what a lark it would be to take tina across the hall lands and then tell him he had been on the enemys ground so i told him of the old chantry that is turned into a barn and of course he must go and see it and take sketches of the windows for his clergy while he was doing it up comes young jackman you know young jackman at the potteriesa regular clever fellow that knows everything  yes i know him  well they got into early pointed and late pointed and billets and dogtooths and all the rest and clem went on like a house on fire and by that time we had got to the big pond where collis and half a dozen more were and he had got his skates and i believe he did surprise them they called it first rate  did he know where he was  not at the beginning of the skating i only wanted to get him down from his altitudes and never thought it would come to this you believe that felix  yes i do go on  it was fine moonlight and we stayed on ever so long while jackman and clem and two more danced a quadrille on the ice and when it was over everybody was horribly cold and captain collis said we must all come in and have something hot and jackman said he was going to drive home to dinner at eight and would take us but every one got talking and it was halfpast eight before we started it was all in such a scramble that i had no notion there was anything amiss till clem began to talk on the way home  what were they drinking  various thingsbrandyandwater chiefly i dont like it and had some ale but i was playing with harrys puppies and not much noticing clem  do you think it was a trick  i cant tell he is so innocent he would have no notion how stiff to make it if any one meant mischief it was jackman and i did think once or twice he had found out tina and was playing him off on the way home when i was trying to hinder poor clem from falling off he went on chaffing so that i longed to jump off and lay the whip about his ears  poor clem said felix more grieved and shocked than angry and not insensible to fulberts being even more appalled and quite frightened out of his sulkiness  it is a bad business he sighed it was all lances fault for letting himself be lugged into that baby party  even this was a great admission and felix would not blight it by a word  it is well the girls are not at home was all he said  i only told cherry that clem wasnt well i cant face her i shall go to bed i would not have had this happen for the world  i shall say nothing to her said felix dejectedly turning to leave the room under a horrible sense of disgrace and stain on the whole family but at the door he was caught hold of by fulbert who looked up at him with a face quite unlike anything he had ever seen in the lad  felix i never was so sorry in my life i wish you would give me a good rowing  felix half smiled i could not he said you did not know what you were doing goodnight  fulbert gazed after him as he went downstairs and went back with a groan to his own room  felix had never before felt so hopeful about fulbert but still he was too much overset to talk to cherry and hurried her off to bed soon following her example for he had not the heart to see lance that night  of course the first hours of the morning had to be spent in attending on the victim whose misery mental and bodily was extreme and was aggravated by his engagement to the organ lance could supply his place there and was sent off to do so but looking as subdued and guilty as if he had been making fulberts confession instead of hearing it and stumbling uncomfortably over the explanation that clement was not well and that felix could not leave him  for there was a fragility about clements long lank frame that made any shock to it very severe and he was ill enough to alarm his happily inexperienced brothers and greatly increase fulberts penitence but by the time mr froggatt drove the sisters home and wilmet wondered that she could not go out for a night without some one being ill he had arrived at a state which she could be left to attribute to mrs froggatts innocent mincepies  he burrowed under his blankets and feigned sleep and discomfort beyond speech whenever she came into the room begging only that the light might be kept out and that nobody would speak to him he was too utterly miserable for anger with fulbert but only showed a sort of brokenhearted forgiveness which made fulbert say in desperation to lance i wish you would just fall upon me i shall not be myself again till ive been blown up  i suppose you are doing it for yourself and that is worse said lance  and you know it was all your doing for going to that disgusting old philistines tea and cake  what you and clem wanted me to lead you about like two dogs in a string said lance  no tina would have kept the babybunting out of harms way  more likely he would have bored me into going poor tina i should almost like to hear him jaw again after all you and he never promised and i did  i wish i had said fulbert i am awfully afraid they are getting hold of it in the town  so am i mowbray smith looked me all over and asked me after clement when i met him just now in the street as if he had some malice in his head  what did you tell him  i said he was in a state of collapse and that serious fears were entertained for his life and reason and then he warned me against the nineteenthcentury manners and i thanked him and made a bow and now i suppose he is gone to tell my lady  when felix was free in the evening he found clement dressed and sitting over the fire in his roomso well indeed that he might have been downstairs but that he shrank from every one and that fire had been the fruit of such persevering battles of wilmet and sibby with the smoke and soot that it would have been a waste of good labour to have deserted it  well clem you are better  yes thank you  headache gone  nearly with a heavy sigh  felix drew an ancient strawbottomed chair in front of the fire backwards placed himself astride on it laid his arms on the top and his forehead on them and in this imposing mentorial attitude began after all clem i dont see that you need be so desperately broken hearted it was mere innocence and ignorance waterdrinkers at home are really not on a level with other people i always have to be very guarded when i have to dine with the other reporters  no said clement sadly i do not regard the disgrace as the sin so much as the punishment  it was more sensible than felix had expected he was conscious of not understanding clement who always seemed to him like a girl but if treated like one was sure to show himself in an unexpected light  you did not know where you were going  not at first i found out long before i came off the ice and then like an absurd fool as i was i thought myself showing how to deal courteously and hold ones own with such people  you are getting to the bottom of it said felix  i have been thinking it over all day said clement mournfully i see that such a fall could only be the consequence of long continued error have i not been very conceited and uncharitable of late felix  not more than usual said felix intending to speak kindly  i see i have been treating my advantages as if they were merits condemning others and lording it over them long ago i was warned that my danger was spiritual pride but selfcomplacency blinded me and he hid his face and groaned  felix was surprised he could not thus have discussed himself even with his father but he perceived that if clement had no one else to preach to he would preach to himself and that this anatomical examination was done in genuine sorrow  no humility continued clement that is what has brought me to this if i had distrusted and watched myself i should have perceived when i grew inflated by their flattery and neveregregious fool that i washave thought i was showing that one of our st matthews choir could meet worldly men on their own ground  felix was glad that his posture enabled him to conceal a smile but perhaps clement guessed at it for he exclaimed a fit consequence to have made myself contemptible to everybody  come clem that is too strong your censorious way was bad for yourself and obnoxious to us all and it was very silly to go to that place after what you had heard  after telling lance it was unworthy of a servant of the sanctuary moaned clement  very silly indeed continued the elder brother very wrong but as to what happened there it is not reasonable to look at it as more than an accident it will be forgotten in a week by all but fulbert and yourself and you will most likely be the wiser for it all your lives i never got on so well with ful before or saw him really sorry  clement only answered by a disconsolate noise and felix was becoming a little impatient thinking the penitence overstrained when he broke silence with you must let me go up to st matthews  really clement it is hardly right to let you be always living upon mr fulmort now your occupation is ended and it would be braver not to run away  i do not mean that cried clement i will not stay there i would not burthen them but see the vicar i must i will go third class and walk from the station  the fare of an omnibus will not quite break our backs said felix smiling if this is needful to settle your mind you had better go  you do not know what this is to me said clement earnestly i wish you did then perceiving the recurrence to his old propensity he sighed pitifully and hung his head adding it is of no use till saturday the vicar is gone to his sisters  very well you can get a return ticket on saturdaythat is if the organist is come back  lance must play i am not worthy  you have no right to break an engagement for fancies about your own worthiness said felix rouse yourself up and dont exaggerate the thing to alarm all the girls and make them suspicious  they ought to know i felt myself a wicked hypocrite when wilmet would come and read me the psalms and yet i could not tell her tell them felix i cannot bear it without  no i shall not you have no right to grieve and disgust them just because you cannot bear it without cannot you bear up instead of drooping and bemoaning in this way it is not manly  manliness is the great temptation of this world  you idiot felix in his provocation broke out then getting himself in hand again dont you know the difference between true and false manliness  i know men of the world make the distinction said clement i am not meaning any censure felix circumstances have given you a different standard  felix interrupted rather hotly only my fathers i have heard him say that if one is not a man before one is a parson one brings the ministry into contempt the things the boys call you tina for are not what make a good clergyman  i dont feel as if i could presume to seek the priesthood after that  stuff and nonsense cried felix if no one was ordained who had ever made a fool of himself and repented we should be badly off for clergy you were conceited and provoking and have let yourself be led into a nasty scrapethats the long and short of the matter but it is only hugging your own selfimportance to sit honing and moaning up here come down and behave like a reasonable being  let me stay here tonight felix i do need it said clement with tears in his eyes if i am alone now i think i can bring myself to bear up outwardly as you wish  the affected tone had vanished and felix rose and kindly put his hand on his shoulder and said do clem you know it is not only my worldlinessmere man of business as i amthat bids us to hide grief within and anoint the head and wash the face  just then an exulting shout rang through the house many feet scuttled upstairs knocks hailed upon the door and many voices shouted mr audley felix clem mr audley  wont you come clem  not tonight i could not  clement shut the door and felix hastened down among the dancing exulting little ones i thought you were at rome he said as the hands met in an eager grasp  i was there on christmas day but dr whites appointment is settled and he wants me to go out with him in june my brother is gone on to london and i must join him there on saturday  i am glad it is today instead of yesterday said wilmet we were all out but felix and cherry and poor clement was so ill  clement ill is he better  he will be all right tomorrow said felix  mr audley detected a desire to elude inquiry as well as a meaning look between the two younger boys and he thought care sat heavier on the brow of the young master of the house than when they had parted eighteen months before  his travels were related his photographs admired his lodging arranged in mr froggatts room and after the general goodnight he drew his chair in to the fire and prepared for a talk with his ex ward  you look anxious felix have things gone on pretty well  pretty fairly thank you till just now when there is rather an ugly scrapeand he proceeded to disburthen his mind of last nights misadventure when it must be confessed that the narrative of clements overweening security having had a fall provoked a smile from his guardian and an observation that it might do him a great deal of good  yes said felix if his friends do not let him make much of his penitence and think it very fine to have so important a thing to repent of  i dont think they will do that you must not take clement as exactly the fruit of their teaching  theres no humbug about him at least said felix he is really cut up exceedingly indeed all i have been doing was to get him to moderate his dolefulness i believe he thinks me a sort of heathen  well said mr audley laughing you dont seem to have taken the line of the model head of the family  the poor boys were both so wretched that one could not say a word to make it worse said felix this satisfies me that fulbert is all right in that way he would not have been so shocked if he had ever seen anything like it before but though he is very sorry now i am afraid it will not cut the connection with those collises  you do not find him easier to manage  no that is the worst he is not half a bad boynay what is called a wellprincipled boyonly it is his principle not to mind me i do not know whether i am donnish with him or if i bullied him too much when he was little but he is always counter to me then he is one of those boys who want an outofdoor life and on whom the being shut up in a town falls hard the giving up sporting is real privation to him and to lance and much the hardest on him for he does not care for music or drawing or anything of that sort  how old is he  just sixteen  suppose i were to take him out to australia  fulbert  yes i always intended to take one if i went but i waited till my return to see about it and i thought clement was of a more inconvenient age but you must judge  poor tina said felix smiling he would hardly do in a colony he is heart and soul a clergyman and whether he will ever be more of a man i dont know but i dont think he could rough it as a missionary  is he going to get a scholarship  he has tried at corpus and failed he is full young and i suppose he ought to go to a tutor i am afraid he learnt more music than classics up at that place  can the tutoring be managed  i suppose a hundred out of that thousand will do it  is that thousand to go like the famous birthday five  five hundred is to be put into the business but the rest i meant to keep in reserve for such things as this  if all are to be helped at this rate your reserve will soon come to an end  perhaps so but i have always looked on clement as my own substitute indeed i held that hope out to my father when it distressed him that i should give it up so clem is pretty well settled thank you besides i am not afraid of his not going on well here but i do believe fulbert will do the better for being more independent only it seems to me too much to let you undertake for us  they are all my charge said mr audley and as i am leaving you the whole burthen of the rest and my poor little godson is not likely to want such care you need have no scruple one of the somervilles is going out to a government office at albertstown and perhaps may put me in the way of doing something for him  felix mused a moment then said the only doubt in my mind would be whether if it suited you equally it might not be an opening for edgar  edgar surely he is off your hands  i am greatly afraid his present work will not last he always hated it and i believe he always had some fancy that he could persuade tom underwood into making a gentleman of him at once sending him to the university or the like and they petted and admired him enough to confirm the notion mrs underwood makes him escort her to all her parties and you know what a brilliant fellow he issure to be wanted for all manner of diversions concerts private theatricals and what not and you can fancy how the countinghouse looks to him after tom underwood declares he requires nothing of him but what he would of his own son and i believe it is true but work is work with him and he will not be trifled with here is a letter about it one of many i was trying to answer last night only this affair of poor clems upset everything  six brothers are no sinecure felix  they are wonderfully little trouble said felix standing on their defence they are all good soundhearted boys and as to lance theres no saying the comfort that little fellow always is he has that peculiar pleasantness about himlike my father and edgarthat one feels the moment he is in the house and he is so steady with all his spirits the other two both say all this could not have happened with him  high testimony  yes as both are inclined to look down on him but think of that boys consideration he has never once asked me for pocketmoney since he went to the cathedral he gets something when the dean and canons have the boys to sing and makes that cover all little expenses  what do you mean to do with him  if he gets the scholarship a year and a half hence he will stay on two years free of expense unluckily he says that young harewood is cleverer than he and always just before him but i have some hope in the harebrains of master bill if he do not get itwell we must see but it will go hard if lance cannot be kept on to be educated properly  mr audley took the letters and presently broke into an indignant exclamation to which felix replied  the work is not good enough for him that is the fact  if you are weak about any one felix it is edgar i have no patience with him his work not good enough forsooth considering what yours is  mine has much more interest and variety and he is capable of much more than i am  then let him show it instead of living in the lap of luxury and murmuring at a few hours at the desk  i ascribe that to his temperament which certainly has a good deal of the artist that deskwork is peculiarly irksome  very likely but it is his plain duty to conquer his dislike no felix i wish i could take him away with me for i am afraid he will be a source of trouble  never edgar is too considerate  but he is exactly what australia is overstocked with alreadya discontented clerk if he be spoilt by luxury here do you think he would bear with a rude colony no fulbert is a gruff obstinate boy but not idle and selfindulgent and i am not afraid to undertake him but i should be of edgar  felix had flushed up a good deal for his love for edgar was less paternal and more sensitively keen than that for any of the others but he was more reasonable and had more control of temper now than when mr audley had last crossed him and he made answer i believe you are right and that edgar could not be happy in a colony any way you are most kind to fulbert but i am afraid i must go now or theodore will wake  do you still have him at night  he is not happy with any one else you have not seen him yet i am sure he is improving theres his voice goodnight and felix hurried away leaving mr audley feeling that though here and there the young pillar of the house might be mistaken the daily unselfishness of his life was a beautiful thing and likewise impressed by his grave air of manly resolution and deliberation  by the morning clement had recovered his tone so as not to obtrude his penitence or to be much more subdued in manner than usual mr audley made him bring his books to the diningroom after breakfast and the examination quite exonerated the authorities at oxford from any prejudice except against inaccuracy and showed that a thorough course of study was needful before he could even matriculate and clement in his present lowliness was not incredulous of any deficiency at st matthews but was only meek and mournful  what shall i do he asked perhaps some school would take me to teach and study at the same time or i might get an organists place and read so that i might be ordained as a literate at last it would come when i was fit i suppose  mr audley only said he would inquire and talk to felix and clement pleased him by answering that he could not bear to be an expense to felix the good principle in the boys was quite to be traced when presently after it was necessary to put fulbert to a severe trial on going to pay his respects at the rectory mr audley found mr mowbray smith there and after some preliminaries he was asked whether he knew how the young underwoods had been going on of late of course though it would be concealed from him but it was right etc then mr bevan feebly suggested that he did not believe there was any truth in it and was sharply silenced and miss caroline observed that she was always sure that clement underwood was a great humbug whereupon between the mother daughter and curate the popular version of the marshlands hall affair was narratedor rather versions for all were beautifully entangled and contradictory  some one had been in the street and had seen poor clements exit from young jackmans dogcart and reported indiscriminately that it was young underwood lance had not been able to put a sufficiently bold face on his mornings report of clements indisposition and felixs absence and this together with the boys hunting propensities and fulberts visits to marshlands had all been concocted into a very serious accusation of the whole of the brothers including felix of having entered into a dangerous friendship with captain collis and underhand enjoying the dissipations of the hall which had been the bane of many a young man of bexley  there were different measures of indignation miss price expected a grand series of denunciationsto mr froggattto miss pearson whose niece was always theremost imprudentnay perhaps to the dean and to the vicar of st matthews the least excitement she expected was felix underwoods expulsion from the choir  lady price merely believed it all and thought the friends ought to interfere and save the poor young things while there was time for any of them she would never mention it so as to injure them but nothing else could be expected  mr mowbray smith supposed there must be some exaggeration but he had been surprised at lancelots manner and he did not think felixs absence accounted for he did seem steadybut and there was something unnatural in the way of life at st matthews that would make him never trust a lad from thence  yes and even mr bevan did not like st matthews because it was not slack or easy and he too could believe anything of clement no doubt poor felix found those great brothers getting too much for him  mr audley was standing by the window he saw fulbert with lance and little bernard going down the street and by one of the sudden dashes that had often puzzled the rectory he flew out at the door and the next moment had his hand on fulberts shoulder  fulbert they have made a terrible scandal of this affair at marshlands hall they fancy felix had something to do with it  felix i should like to punch their heads  you can do better you can contradict it  but sir  however fulbert while still following to plead with mr audley found himself where he never recollected to have been in his life before among the cushions armchairs and tables covered with knickknacks of the rectory drawingroom mr bevan in an easy chair mr smith standing before the fire lady price at work looking supercilious and her daughter writing notes at a davenport  mr bevan half rose and held out his hand the others contented themselves with a nod while the big stout lad stood rather like a great dog under the same circumstances very angry with everybody and chiefly with mr audleyto whom nevertheless he trusted for getting him safe out again  fulbert said mr audley mr bevan would be better satisfied if he could hear what intimacy there has been between your brothers and the collises  none at all said fulbert bluntly  my boy said the gentle rector deprecatingly nobody ever suspected your eldest brother  i should think not exclaimed fulbert with angry eyes all he ever did was to warn us against going more fools not to mind him  then said my lady it has been the insubordination and wilfulness of you younger boys that has nearly involved him in so grave an imputation  of nobodys but mine returned fulbert the others would have nothing to do with it  that cannot be the literal fact said mr smith in a low voice to lady price there were certainly two of them  fulbert heard and turning to the rector as if he thought every one else beneath his notice said the long and short of it is this lance and i picked young collis out of a ditch and took him home then captain collis asked us rabbitshooting lance never went again because felix did not choose it i did and just by way of a joke i took clement there without his knowing what place it was we fell in with them skating and went into the house the day before yesterday that is said fulbert concluding as he had begun the long and short of it whatever happened was my fault and no one elses  a very honest confession said kind mr bevan pleased to have something to praise  and i hope it will act as a warning said lady price  but said mr smith partly incited by carrys looks it was true that youtwo of you were brought home by young jackman  yes said fulbert growing crimson he drove clement and me home  and said mr audley it was clements great distress that kept felix at home the next morning  yes said fulbert there was nobody else but me and clem could hardly bear the sight of me because i had led him into it we thought no one in the house would know itand i dont believe they do  ah said lady price it is false kindness to attempt concealment  from lawful authority it is said mr audley but in this case it was only from children and servants however fulbert i think you have fully satisfied mr bevan as to the amount of intercourse between your brothers and marshlands  entirely said mr bevan in fact you may assure your brother that i never believed anything to his discredit  i shall say nothing about it said fulbert not choosing to see the hand held out to him i should be ashamedmay i go now sir to mr audley and with an odd sort of circular bow he made his escape and mr audley having remained long enough to ascertain that the worst that could be said of him was that he was a cub and that it was a terrible thing to see so many great hulking lads growing up under no control took his leave and presently came on the three boys again consulting at the ironmongers window over the knife on which bernard was to spend a halfcrown that mrs froggatt had given him  can lance and bernard settle that i want you a moment fulbert not to confront the rectory again he added smiling it was a horrid bore for you but there was no helping it  i suppose not said fulbert gloomily as if he did not forgive the unpleasant moments  it was not about that i wanted to speak to you though said mr audley i wanted to know whether you have any plans or wishes for the future  i said fulbert looking up blank  yes you you are growing up fulbert  i suppose i must take what i can get said fulbert in the same sulky passive voice  that may be a wise determination but have you really no choice  well when i was a little chap and knew no better i used to think i would be a soldier or a farmerbut thats all nonsense and i suppose i must have some abominable little clerkship said fulbert with a certain steadiness for all the growl of his tone  well fulbert have you a mind to try whether the other side of the world would suit you better  fulbert looked up you dont mean that you would take me out  yes i do if you are inclined to come and try for work at albertstown  fulbert instead of answering quickened his pace to a walking run dashed on nearly upsetting half a dozen people and was only checked by a collision with a perambulator then he stood still till mr audley came up to him and then again muttered under his breath go out to albertstown  they walked on a little way and then the boy said say it again please  mr audley did say it again in more detail and fulbert this time exclaimed it is the very thing thank you mr audley and his face clearing into a frank open look he added ill try to do my best there i wonder i never thought of it before i would have worked my way out as a cabin boy if i had where is lance does felix know  there was no sentiment about fulbert he jumped at the offer as instinctively as a young swallow would prepare to migrate seemed to brighten all over and shake off his dull defiant mood and gave no sign of feeling about brother or sisterexcept that he said he believed felix would get on better without him and that he told lance that they would have splendid fun together when he was big enough to come out and ride a buckjumper     chapter xiii  pegasus in harness    fear not on that rugged highway    life may want its lawful zest  sunny glens are on the mountain    where the weary heart may rest                           charles gavan duffy   there was much relief and comfort in that visit of mr audleys for one thing geraldine was able to pour out all her troubles as she had been used to do ever since her father had left her in his charge her repentance for the stirrings of her naturally fretful plaintive temper for her fits of impatience and her hard judgments and what surprised him chiefly for jealousy  yes she repeated at his word of surprise i am jealous  indeed  i never knew it till the choral festival i used to be very fond of her but im sure it is jealousy i dont like to see her more eagerly attended to than myself not that there is anything to complain of he never neglected me in his life  mr audley smiled people would tell you it is the natural lot of sisters  then she saw that he knew all about it for in fact felix had rather to the general surprise observed that the miss pearsons would like to meet mr audley and the trio had spent a musical evening with the underwood party  oh she cried is it all my own horridness or is it really  my own horridness or my own discernment said he taking the words out of her mouth my dear such an affair as this would be generally the family jest  oh  it is just as well it should not be so here continued mr audley for nonsense is not always a cure and the talk would be mischievous besides i think both are unconscious  he is i believe said cherry  at any rate he is more than ordinarily full of sense and self control and may safely be trusted to do nothing imprudent she is pretty and attractive and of course he likes to be with her but i should think it very unlikely it would go farther has any one else observed it  not wilmet only lance  and has not made fun of it that speaks well for master lances discretion yet you all feel the weight of life too heavily i had rather have found you amused by these little prepossessions than weighing them seriously and wearing yourself to fritters  i will try not to mind but i cant help being afraid for him it must be very wrong to be almost turned against her because he likes her and yet what is all very well as my friend does not seem enough for felix  nor will it be my dear cherry such things come on and go off twenty times in a mans life you will treat the symptoms more lightly before you have done with your seven brothers meantime dont fret your conscience over fancies unless you have spoken or acted unkindly or fretfully  o mr audley what shall i do when you are quite gone all this time i have felt as if i were without my pilot  mr audley too had been thinking this over and wished to put her more formally under the spiritual charge of mr willoughby of st faiths feeling that the morbid and sensitive nature needed external support and that it was not right to deprive it of what the church sanctions  her only doubt was felixs approval his nature did not readily accept progress beyond that to which he had been bred up and in border lands like these an unfavourable medium made much difference to the clearness of the sight clements contempt for what had satisfied his father annoyed him and his mind was selfreliant his soul accustomed to find its requirements met by the system around him and his character averse to intermeddling so that it was against the grain with him that spiritual guidance should be sought outside the family or at any rate outside the parish he thought such direction weakened the nature and mr audley after warning him against taking the disease for the effect of the remedy had to laugh at him as a british householder after all he yielded because he thought mr audley had a certain right over geraldine and that it was proper to defer to his judgment while his guardian trusted to a sight of st matthews for the overthrowal of the prejudices that clement had managed to excite  before leaving england mr audley was resolved that little theodore should be shown to some london physician the child was five years old but looked no more than three he could totter in an uncertain run and understood a few simple sentences but came no nearer to language than the appropriation of a musical sound to every one whom he knew there was nothing unpleasant about him except his constant purring and humming he was perfectly docile loved music and could be amused by simple recurring games his affections seemed to have gone out chiefly to felix and to sibby and as to his twinsister he seemed lost without her and she seemed to view him as the complement of herselflike a sort of left hand giving him things to hold in his feeble grasp saying her lessons to him and talking as if to a doll there was something sad in the very resemblance for their eyes were of the same shade of deep blue their long soft hair of the same flaxen tint their faces equally fair but while hers was all colour light and life his was pale and vacant and scarcely ever stirred into expression  mr audley thought it right to ascertain whether treatment could be of any use and finding that his fathers london house was only occupied by his brother the captain he arranged that felix should come up to town with the child and sibby when the law business could be arranged and there would be an opportunity of his seeing something of the world  he had never had a holiday before and mr froggatt rivalled his guardian in his desire that it should not be too short the first call was by appointment on the doctor he was not used to have patients like theodore brought by youths of felixs age and was touched by the care and tenderness of the young man as he tried to overcome the alarm that was rendering the little one impracticable when it was desirable to exhibit his slender store of accomplishments his nearest approach to his natural state was when perched on his brothers knee with his back to the strange faces listening as felix whistled the tunes he loved best  after all little was gained by the consultation except the assurance that the poor little fellow was as well situated as was possible a few directions for treatment and discipline were given but very little hope was held out of any important change for the better  the verdict disappointed felix to an extent that surprised mr audley who had better understood the hopelessness of the case of all the family felix had the most of the parental instinct for the most helpless and while he warmly thanked his friend he looked so mournfully at the child who clung to him that mr audley said in a voice of sympathy it is a burthen but one that will never bring the sting of sin  not a burthen said felix no as my father said when he gave him to me he is the gift of god the son of my right hand may it always be able to work for you he murmured as he bent his head over the little one  and i think the gift will bring a blessing said mr audley  theodore was sent home with sibby thus restoring stella to herself for she had been greatly lost without her speechless companion but felix remained in london for a week of business and pleasure captain audley was very goodnatured and friendly and abetted his brother in all his arrangements for showing felix as much of life as was possible in a week assuring him that every new experience was a duty to the pursuivanta plea that felix with his loverlike devotion to every detail of his paper admitted with a smile edgar was of almost all their expeditions and dined with them nearly every day that young gentlemans peculiar pleasantness had very nearly averted the remonstrances with which his brother and his guardian had come up armed there he was finding his work real and not a royal road to immediate wealth idling lounging and gratifying his taste for art and music and when his employer stormed and threatened listening with aggravating coolness and even sweetness merely hinting that his occupation was a mistake and living all the time as a son of the house with a handsome allowance and free access to society and amusement thus when mr audley talked to him he smiled with a certain resignation and observed that he was concerned for poor old tom to have been unlucky enough to have drawn such a fellow as himself probably it was a judgment on him for not having come forward sooner when he might have had felix and when mr audley upheld felix as an example of hearty sacrifice of taste and inclination it was to obtain an enthusiastic response nobody breathed equal to dear old fee and it was the most ardent desire of edgars heart to take some of the burthen from his shoulders when it was hinted that such an allowance as tom underwood gave afforded the opportunity edgar smiled between melancholy and scorn saying times must have altered since your time mr audleyno i forgot expense is the rule in our line swells can do as they please  however there things rested mr underwood treated him exactly like an idle son storming at him sometimes but really both fond and proud of him and very gracious to felix whom he invited once to a very dull and dazzling dinner and once sent to the opera with his ladies  felixs sunday was chiefly spent at st matthews which he was very glad to see without tinas spectacles he was amazed to find so much more good sense and reality than the effect on clement had led him to expect and mr fulmort who struck him as one of the most practical looking men he had ever seen spoke in high terms of clements steadiness and wish to do right but added i am afraid we have rather spoilt him he came up to us so unlike the kind of boy we generally get that we may have made rather too much of him at first  felix smiled perhaps we had knocked him about and made too little of him at home he said  besides esprit de corps in so small a place as this is apt to become so concentrated as not to be many removes from egotism i daresay we have been a terrible bore to you  felix laughed we have always been very grateful to you sir  i understand i am glad he is going farther afield he will be much improved by seeing other places and having his exclusiveness and conceit shaken out of him but we shall always regard him as the child of the house and i only hope he may end by working among us  poor fellow conceit has been pretty well shaken out for the present said felix  i hope it may last he was rather hurt at my not making his misfortune of more importance but it seems to have been accident all except the priggish selfconfidence that led to it  felix increased much in cordiality towards mr fulmort and at the same time mounted many stages in clements estimation on the discovery that however behindhand his ecclesiastical advantages might be the vicar was exceedingly impressed by his excellence  a day or two after felixs arrival ferdinand travis was first encountered riding a spirited horse in the park looking remarkably handsome though still of the smalllimbed slender make that recalled his indian blood his delight in the meeting was extreme and he seemed to be as simple and good as ever he was in deep mourning having newly heard of his father having been killed in an american railway accident and though his uncle seemed proud of him and continued his liberal allowance the loss and blank were greatly feltall the more that he had not found it easy to make friends among his brother officers in the life guards his foreign air was somehow uncongenial he had no vivacity or cleverness and being little inclined to some of the amusements of his contemporaries and on his guard against others he seemed to find his life rather dull and weary he did not seem to have anything to love except his horses especially the creature he was then riding brown murad he had obtained it after such competition that he viewed the purchase as an achievement while felix heard the amount with an incredulous shudder and marvelled at mr audleys not regarding it as wildly preposterous it was a dangerous position and though mr audley certified himself through his soldier brother that travis was steadiness itselfneither betted gamed nor ran into debtyet while he seemed personally acquainted with all the horses that ran and apparently entered into no literature but the racing calendar it was impossible not to be anxious about him even though he seemed perfectly happy to be allowed to be with his two godfathers and followed them everywhere from the houses of parliament to st matthews  this was not the last expedition felix had to make to london that spring after many appointments of the time and as many delays a telegram suddenly summoned him in the beginning of may to bring fulbert up to london when the business would be wound up and captain audley would take his brother and the boy in his yacht to alexandria there to join the overland passengers  so fulberts farewells were made in the utmost haste and mixed up with wilmets solicitous directions for his proper use of all her preparations for his comfort on the voyage and lance could only be seen for the brief moments of halt at the minsterham station during which neither spoke three words but lance hung on the step till the train was in motion and then was snatched back and well shaken and reprimanded by a guard while fulbert leant out after him at even greater peril of his life long after the last wave of the trencher cap had ceased to be visible  felix believed that this parting was more felt than that with all the other eleven and while fulbert subsided into his corner the elder brother felt much oppressed by the sense that it was his duty to give some good advice together with great perplexity what it should be how it should be expressed and whether it would be endured he would have been thankful for some of clements propensity for preaching when he found himself teteatete with fulbert in a cab but while he was still considering of the right end by which to take this difficult subject he was startled by his beginning felix i say im glad you are going to get shut of me  i believe it is for your good said felix  youll get on better without me repeated fulbert then with an effort look here it isnt that i dont know youre a brick and all that but somehow nothing riles me like your meddling with me  i know it answered felix i wish i could have helped it but what could be done when there was nobody else  ay responded fulbert i know i have been a sulky nasty brute to you and i should do it again and yet i wish i hadnt  i should be as bad myself if i were a junior was the moral reflection felix produced for his brothers benefit only ful if you try that on with mr audley out there youll come to grief  i dont mean to said fulbert  and youll keep in mind what my father meant us to be fulthat we have got to live so as to meet him again  fulbert nodded his head emphatically  it is his name you have to keep unstained in the new country added felix the fresh thought rising to his lips but it was met by a gush of feeling that quite astonished him  ay and yours felix i doi do want to be a help and not a drag to you i really dont think so much of any of themnot even lanceas of you i hope i shouldnt have been better to my father than i have been to you and whenwhen im out there i do hope to showthat i do care  the boy was fighting with very hard sobs and for all the frightful faces he made the tears were running down his cheeks felixs eyes were overflowing too but with much of sudden comfort and thankfulness  i always knew you were a good fellow ful he said with his hand on his brothers knee and i think youll keep so with mr audley to keep you up to things and show you how to be helped  all after this was bustle and hurry fulbert had to be sent alone to take leave of alda while his brother and mr audley transacted their business edgar came back with him and after some hurried rushings out in search of necessaries forgotten the last farewells were spoken and fulbert with the two audley brothers was out of sight while felix after drawing a long deep sigh looked at his watch and spoke of going to see alda  dont run your head into a hornets nest said edgar its all up with me there come this way and ill tell you all about it  all up with you  there are limits to human endurance and tom and i have overpassed each others i dont blame him poor man he wanted raw material to serve as an importer of hides and tallow but you the genuine article were bespoken and my father was not in a state for the pleading of personal predilections  what is it now  only a set of etchings from atalanta in caledon that was the straw that broke the camels back said edgar so coolly as to make felix exclaim  how much or how little do you mean  separated on account of irreconcilable incompatibility  impossible  possible because true  why did you not tell before mr audley was gone  it would have been bad taste to obtrude ones own little affairs and leave him with vexatious intelligence to ruminate on his voyage nay who knows but that he might have thought it his duty to wait to compose matters and so a bright light might have been lost to the antipodes  you actually mean me to understand that you have broken with tom underwood  the etchings were the text of an awful row in which the old gentleman exposed himself more than i am willing to repeat and called on me to choose between his hides and tallow and what he was pleased to call my tomfoolery  felix groaned  exactly so you are conscious that his demand was not only tyrannical but impracticable one cant change the conditions of ones nature  are you absolutely dismissed  nothing can be more so  and what do you mean to do demanded felix stung though to a certain degree reassured by his tranquillity  study art  and live  on my own two hundred you will advance it i only want sixteen months of years of discretion and then ill pay it back with more than interest  i must know more first said felix i must understand what terms you are on with tom underwood and whether you have any reasonable or definite plans  spoken like an acting partner well come to renville he will satisfy you as to my plans i am to be his pupil he teaches at the south kensington museum and is respectability itself in fact he requires my responsible brother to be presented to him come along  stay edgar i do not think it right by tom underwood to see any one before him i shall go to him before anything else is done  do not delude yourself with the hope of patching up matters like audley last winter losing me five months of time and old tom of temper  how long ago was this  the crisis was yesterday i was just packing to come home when fulbert burst upon the scene  nothing could be worse news yet edgars perfect selfpossession greatly disarmed felix never having thought his brother and the work well suited he was the less disposed to anger especially as the yoke of patronage was trying to his character but he persisted in seeing thomas underwood before taking any steps for edgars future career feeling that this was only due to the cousin to whom his father had entrusted the lad so edgar with a shrug piloted him to the metropolitan railway and then to the countinghouse where in the depths of the city kedge and underwood dealt for the produce of the corrals of south america  edgar as he entered the office full of clerks nodded to their bald headed middleaged senior in a halfpatronising manner dont be afraid mr spooner im not coming back on your hands whatever this good brother of mine may intend is the governor in  mr underwood is in his room mr edgar was the very severe answer but after this most serious annoyance i would not answer for the consequences  wouldnt you indeed said edgar quietly in a nonchalant tone that made the younger lads bend down to sniggle behind their desks while he moved on to the staircase  mr spooner and he were visibly old foes but the senior devoured his wrath so far as to come forward and offer a chair to felix repeating however mr underwood is very seriously annoyed  before felix could attempt an answer edgar had redescended newspaper in hand go up felix he said threw himself into the chair and proceeded to read the paper while felix obeyed and found the principal standing at his door ready to meet him  what felix underwood glad to see you this intolerable affair cant have brought you up already though  no sir i was telegraphed for late last night to bring up my brother fulbert to start with mr audley  oh ay well i hope hell have a better bargain of him than ive had in edgar youve heard his impudence  i am exceedingly sorry  then mr underwood broke out with his account of edgars folly and ingratitude after all the care and expense of his education he had taken up with a set of geniuses for friends was always rehearsing for amateur performances with them keeping untimely hours and coming late to the office to cast up accounts or copy invoices in his sleep make caricatures on his blottingpaper or still worse become besotted with some design for a drawing or series of drawings and in the frenzy of execution know no more what was said to him than a post finally the ladies being as mad as himself as mr underwood said had asked him to draw for a bazaar and in his frenzy of genius over the etchings he had entirely forgotten an important message and then said he could not help it on being told that if so he was not fit for his profession he merely replied exactly so the experiment had been unsuccessful and when his meekness had brought down a furious tempest of wrath and threats of dismissal he had responded with his intolerable cool insolence that this would be best for all parties  this is the offence anxiously asked felix  offence what greater offence would you have  certainly nothing can be much worse as to business said felix but when he told me what had happened i was afraid that he might be running into temptation  oh as to that theres no harm in the ladspooner allows that nothing low about him  and his friends  how should i know raffs those fellows always are sure to bring him to the dogs  did you ever hear of an artist named renville  ay meditatively he was the master the girls had at one time wasnt he  then he is respectable i ask because edgar wants to study under him  eh what demanded mr underwood in manifest astonishment is the lad gone crazy  i thought you had dismissed him sir  well well said mr underwood taken aback i told him only what he deserved and he chose to take it as final i thought you were come to speak for him  you are very kind sir but i doubt whether he would resume his work here or indeed if it would not be an abuse of your kindness to induce him  eh what again exclaimed thomas you give in to his ungrateful folly felix underwood i thought you at least were reasonable  the imperious passionate manner rather than the actual words made felix side the more with the wayward genius and feel that having sacrificed himself for the good of the family he might save his brother from the gloomy office and piles of ledgers and bills below stairs sir he said i am sorry edgar has not been better fitted to return the timely help you have given us but i am afraid that such unwilling work as his could never be of service to you  why on earth should it be unwilling better men than he have sat at a desk before now ive no patience with young mens intolerable conceit there have i done everything for this young fellow and he is unwilling unwilling indeed to give his mind to the simplest business for six hours a day  it is wrong said felix but his powers lie in such a different line  fiddling and daubing pah if anything could be more incomprehensible than his not being able to cast up an account or take a message it is your backing him up  i am afraid he is too old for coercion  no coercion like having not a penny in the world pray how is he to live  his own means will help him through his studies  his own200 pounds about as much as he has made ducks and drakes of in a year besides he is not of age  no but i have something of my own to advance for him  wherewith there began a fresh storm thomas underwood was greatly mortified at the desertion of one brother and still more at the acquiescence of the other he would no doubt have been ready to retain the handsome engaging youth grumbling and enduring as a sort of expensive luxury and in his wrath disappointment and sense of ingratitude at finding that his restive protege was not to be driven back to him he became so abusive that felix could hardly keep his tongue or temper in check but when he declared that if any support were given to edgars lunatic project the whole family except alda should be left to their own resources for the rest of their lives it was with quiet determination that the reply was made with studied though difficult respectfulness  sir we are much obliged for what you have done for us but we hope to be able to work for ourselves and for one another without becoming dependent you cannot suppose that such a consideration would affect my opinion respecting edgar nbif mr underwood had supposed it he felt as if it were impossible as all his cousin edwards high spirit glowed in that young mans eyes and strengthened the studiously calm voice i think continued felix that no one can be doing right whose work is not thorough if edgar cannot or will not apply himself in earnest to your business he will be doing better by studying art with a will than in pretending to work here and abusing your forbearance that would be so improper towards you and so wrong in him that it would be simply unjustifiable in me to try to persuade you into allowing it  somehow mr underwood had not at all expected such a reply and as luckily want of breath had forced him to wait and really hear it a sensation came over him of old times when edward underwood had argued with him and it was with much less heat that he returned with an effort at irony and so you take the bread out of the mouths of the others to support my fine gentleman in his absurd nonsense  no sir what i advance is entirely my own  oh ay didnt i hear something about a legacy  yes from admiral chester a thousand pounds it has only just been paid to me  that you may throw it away on this young scamps fancies  no sir i hope not half of it goes into the business at bexley we sign the deed of partnership next week it will make a great difference to me the rest is ready for emergencies  tomfooleries muttered mr underwood pray what are the plans for this making a new michael angelo am i expected to give him the run of my house i shall do no such thing  no sir it would not be proper to ask it this renville takes pupils for the royal academy and edgar would board and lodge there but i hope you will still be good enough to allow him to call on alda and not let him be entirely left to himself he is much to blame but it is not as if he had run into bad dissipation  thats true said mr underwood a terrible disappointment that young dog has been to me felix underwood but as you put it theres an honesty in the thing where is my fine gentleman  downstairs sir  mr underwood breathed through a mysterious tube and edgar appeared with his usual easy grace and with a sharp glance at felix as if to inquire whether there were to be any attack on his newlyfound liberty  look here edgar was the address your brothera much better one than you deserve  thrue for you muttered edgar between his teeth  says what has some sense in it that nothing is so ruinous as doing things by halves and that you ought to be ashamed of hanging about here doing nothing  a quick glance passed between the brothers  so he is for letting you have your way and if he chooses to support you and you choose to rob himfor i think it nothing less than robberywhy therei cant help it so i put it to you for the last time will you buckle steadily to your work here like a rational being or cast yourself loose to live as a beggarly artist on what your brother can give you by pinching the rest  thank you sir i hope the sooner to help him to feed the rest by taking the plunge you think so desperate said edgar with more gravity than usual  oh indeed sneered mr underwood remember not a farthing of mine goes to such folly i dont understand it i thought once youd have been as good as a son to me he added in a very different tone as he looked at the fine young man in whom he yearned to take pride  i wish i could sir said edgar with real feeling i wish you had hit upon any one of us but my unlucky self youve been very good to me but what a man cant do he cant and if i gave in now it would only be the same over again but we dont part in anger uncle he continued with a trembling of voice  anger no my boy im only vexed at the whole thing but i dont want to lose sight of you altogether youll stay with us till youve found decent lodgings and youll be welcome to look in on a sunday mr underwood spoke in a tone between asking and granting a favour  thank you sir with all my heart said edgar  and youll come to dine and sleep he added to felix youve not seen your sister  no thank you sir i cannot today i must be at home tonight  they shook hands cordially but as edgar crossed the countinghouse he paused to open his own desk and pocket some of the contents saying lightly as he did so theres promotion in store for some of you youngstersi congratulate you mr spooner youre free of a burthen to your spirit  indeed mr edgar im very sorry if  dont throw away your sorrow mr spooner i was foredoomed your soul to cross and i bear no malice to you for having been crossed shake hands and wish me success as a painter  i wish you success mr edgar but it will not be met with in any profession without application and regularity  edgar forbore from any reply but a low and deferential bow such as to provoke another smothered laugh from the other young clerks to whom felix suspected as he looked round the favoured kinsman was subject of jealousy admiration or imitation according to character however edgar shook hands with each with some little word of infinite but gracious superiority and on coming out exclaimed ban ban caliban you who are emancipated from a redstone congratulate me  felix neither observed on the vast difference between the excellent confidential spooner and pettily jealous redstone nor on the extremely dissimilar mode of emancipation he was more occupied with the momentous responsibility of having assisted to cut his brother loose from the protection to which his father had confided him mr audleys warning that he was inclined to be weak where edgar was concerned came before him yet the life of luxury and unfulfilled duties was in his eyes such a wrongful course that he felt justified in having put an end to it and his heart warmed with hope and exultation as he recollected how ettys success had been owing to his brothers aid and felt himself putting edgars foot on the first round of the ladder and freeing his ascent from all that had hitherto trammelled it such bright visions haunted him when talking was impossible on the omnibus outside which edgar had exalted him he did not well know why till on descending at charing cross he found he was to have an interview with mr renville who was copying a picture in the national gallery and whom he found to his great relief to be no wild bohemian but a simple painstaking business like man who had married a german hausfrau and lodged a few art students with unexceptionable references knowing edgar already he had measured his powers and assured felix that his talent was undoubted though whether that talent amounted to genius could only be decided when the preliminary studies were accomplished but even if it were not of the very highest order a supposition that rather hurt felixs feelings the less aspiring walks of the profession would afford sufficient security of maintenance to justify the expense of the study he talked with sense and coolness and his charges though falling severely on such funds as were at the disposal of the young pillar of the house were edgar declared and felix could well believe very moderate the time was to be further decided after reference to mrs renville  will you not come home first asked felix as they descended the steps  not in the character of the discarded who knows the effect it might have on old froggy by the by i hope this advance does not make any difference to the terms of your bondage  nothing important  draw bills to any amount on the ra of the future  the light hopeful tone contrasted with clements grave thankfulness and sorrow at being an expense but felix really preferred it as far less embarrassing  could you come down in a months time he continued lance is to be confirmed at the cathedral and it might be an opportunity for you  i cannot lose this months work at the academy it is the most important in the year  it might be arranged for you to come down for the day you could see any one you pleased here  has tina excited you to consign me to the whittingtonian fathers  no felix had almost rested there but presently added gravely i constantly feel the impossibility of getting through this world and keeping straight without helpthe help that is provided for us he added lamely enough  dear old blunderbore said edgar affectionately what comes naturally to you no 1 letter a in a flock of girls and boys cant be the same when one has got out into this wicked world go on in your own groove and leave me to my aberrations dont vex yourself old fellow a popular journalist must have got far enough to know that men dont concern themselves about these little affairs in one another  brothers do  not unless they partake of the sister come you have had no sustenance since breakfast at six oclock have you come in here and learn what soup means  theres no time the train is at five  time you dont mean to walk  i do and get something to eat at the station  i declare fee your unsophistication would be refreshing if it were not a disgrace to your profession why are you not reporter to the teetotal times no wonder if the pursuivant has a flavour of weak tea  felix smiled rather sadly aware that this was meant to lead him away from the last subject he perceived that the door between his favourite brothers soul and his own was closed and that knocking would only cause it to be bolted and barred it might be true as mr audley had told him that edgars was not so much real scepticism as the talk of the day and the regarding the doubts of deeper thinkers as a dispensation from all irksome claims but this was poor solace while his brother rattled on my dear blunderbore the hastypudding on which you characteristically breakfast is a delusion as to economy renvilles little frau will keep us better and at less expense than ever wilmet conceived you wrap yourself in your virtue and refuse to spend a couple of shillings as deeming it robbery of the fry at home you wear out at least a shillings worth of boot leather pay twopence for a roll and fourpence for a more villainous compound called coffee come home in a state of inanition cram down a quartern loaf and a quarter of a pound of rancid butter washed down with weak tea and if selfsatisfaction and exhaustion combined are soporific it is only to leave you a prey to nightmare then to say nothing of poorness of blood producing paucity of ideas it is fearful to think of the doctors bill you are laying up  nonsense edgar i am in perfect health  edgar went off into a learned dissertation on the qualities of food and liquor and the expedience of enriching the blood and giving substance to the constitution he was in fact much more robust and athletic as well as much taller than his brother who looked like one who led an indoor life without cultivating his strength but had no token of lack of health or activity always of small appetite he did not care how long he fasted and was so much used to be on his feet that the long walk through the streets seemed to fatigue him less than edgar who nevertheless kept with him as finding real pleasure in his company  the only pauses were at the sight of an accordion in a shop window labelled at so low a price that felix ventured on it for theodore and again when edgar insisted on stuffing his pockets with bonbons for the babes as antidotes he said to the blunderbore diet  i beg to observe it was not blunderbore that lived on hasty pudding that was the welsh giant said felix  ay blunderbore had three heads and was buried up to the neck completing the resemblance well some day ill give you all a hoist old fellow and then youll be immortalised for having developed the president of the royal academy out of his slough of hides and tallow  felix went home through the summer twilight tired and heavyhearted to find wilmet sitting up over a supper not much less rigorously frugal than edgar had foretold telling wilmet was perhaps the worst of it to felix true she forbore to reprove or lament when she understood that the deed was actually accomplished and saw that he was fatigued and out of spirits but her indeed oh felix and her involuntary gesture and attitude of dismay went as far as a volume of reproach and evil augury he was weary beyond vindicating himself or edgar but the next morning when wilmet and angela had started for school there was a sense that the cat was away and geraldine looking up under her long black eyelashes whispered oh it is so nice in you to have let him loose dear fee it was such cruel waste to pin him down there  it was mockery for him to pretend to work there against the grain and live in all that ease and luxury said felix greatly appreciating her sympathy that must be so clearly wrong that the more i think it over the more i trust i did right in not trying to make it up again as mr audley did  it was only a pity he did said cherry but of course it was for your sake that you might not have him thrown back on your hands  and for edgars own protection too said felix but i cannot think lazy insufficient work and constant amusement otherwise than so unworthy that i am sure mr audley would think it more honest and right to put an end to them even at some risk  risk said the little sister ruffling up her feathers he is sure to succeed and you know it  i did only mean risk in that sense said felix gravely but i hope he is safely and satisfactorily placed renville seems an excellent person and more trustworthy perhaps because he only commits himself to edgars capability  capability contemptuously repeated cherry no one but you and i really understand what edgar can do  i could have shaken the fellow for his coldness said felix smiling but no doubt it was right of him and edgar will soon show  that he will only look at the beauty and freedom of this outline as she opened her portfolio  dont beguile me cherry i cant stay ive all yesterdays work to make up  here are all the proofs ready only just look at the sentence i marked for you o felix how lucky edgar has you for a brother to save him from being blighted and crushed  is that head yours or his yours i should say he was lucky to have such an unenvious sister you would draw as well as he if you only had the teaching  oh no dont say that it spoils his though i do wish my drawing could be of some use  never mind about use you are our pleasure as he saw her dissatisfied besides what would pur the household abbreviation of pursuivant do without the sub  this was much pleasanter cherry smiled at his kiss and he ran downstairs exultinglike herselfin their artist brothers future fame  when he returned to the sittingroom in the evening twilight the first voice he heard through theodores humming was wilmets as in mitigationi daresay he is well educated and not vulgar  oh but the sound of it cried alice knevetts voice a mere tradesman  who is the unfortunate asked felix coming forward  o mr underwood how you do steal upon one yes im furious heres my old friend florence spelmanthe dearest girl in the world and so prettygone and engaged herself to young schneider of schneider and co on the tailors advertisements you know it is one of the first houses in london and hes very rich and handsome and all that but isnt it dreadful all her friends will have to drop her and i was so fond of her  is it trade itself or the kind of trade that outrages your feelings asked felix in a tone of raillery  oh a tailor is too horrible as if all trade wasnt bad enough said alice laughing then recollecting herself she turned blushing and confused to cherryat leasti meanyour brother makes one forget he isnt in the least like that  i never wish to forget anything he is said cherry proudly looking up to him  ah you dont know what is in my pocket said felix leaning his back against the mantleshelf  oh what cried alice and geraldine both together while wilmet looked at him as if she wished to put him in mind of the presence of a stranger  guess he said  somebody has left you a fortune oh delightful cried alice clasping her hands  mr thomas underwood will take edgars art study on himself exclaimed the more moderate geraldine  you burn cherry it comes from that quarter heres a letter by the evenings post to offer me if i have not closed with mr froggatt to invest in kedge and underwoods concern and begin with 300 pounds a year as clerk  it cant be possible said wilmet the only one to speak as the other two girls looked rather blank  just so far that the deed of partnership here is not signed  what is the business asked alice  he is a south american merchant and deals with rio for hides and tallow if you prefer that to books and stationery said felix in a wouldbe light tone  oh but a south american merchant that sounds quite delightful cried alice and youll have to live in dear dear london how i envy you  that must be the effect you had upon him felix said cherry proudly  well i thought i had been a specimen of the obstinate observed felix here is his letter  he gave it as of right to wilmet but other eyes remarked the address to f c underwood esquire an unusual thing since as mr froggatt had never aspired to the squirehood felix made all his brothers and sisters write only the mister and thus entirely deprived himself of the pleasure of aldas correspondence  where will you live oh youll let me come and stay with you sometimes cried alice  felix smiled as he answered im afraid our house is not built yet  miss pearsons maid for miss alice said martha at the door oh dear how tiresome but youll tell me all about it tomorrow how horrid it will be here when you are all gone  we are not gone yet said wilmet repressively and if you please alice do not talk of this  no said felix it must be entirely a family matter i know we can trust to you  thank you im so glad i was there it is so nice to have a secret of yoursand this is a beauty why youll be a great man with a house in london just like mr underwood of centry  pleasing ambition cherry could not help muttering with an ironical smile as alice laughed and nodded herself away  ready sympathy is a pleasant thing returned felix  you dont mean that you think this feasible said wilmet with a negative inflection in her voice  i think it ought to be considered before it is absolutely too late  both were surprised having always thought that he considered his destiny as fixed and as geraldine looked on while the other two discussed pounds shillings and pence it was plain to her that he had an inclination to the change the probability of rising the benefit of lodging edgar the nearness to alda the probable openings for the younger lads were advantages but against these wilmet set the heavy london houserent rates and taxesfrom which they were freethe expense of living the loss of her present situation the dangers of deterioration of health as to edgar his habits must be formed he was already in a respectable family and lance and bernard ought not to be risked for his sake in fact wilmet looked on london with a sage country girls prudent horror of the great and wicked capital and when that experienced man of the world felix tried to prove that she did it injustice he was met with a volley of alarming anecdotes he hinted that ladies schools might need teachers there but was met by the difficulty of forming a new connection and when he suggested that cherrys talent might be cultivated wilmet hotly exclaimed she could never go about to classes and schools of art  not alone certainly said cherry wistfully  edgar is as good as nobody and i should be of no use in places like that added wilmet  im afraid you dont look very chaperonish said felix contemplating the fair exquisitelymoulded face the more grecian for the youthful severity that curved the lip and fixed the eye if we could only turn her inside out cherry she would be a dozen duennas in one  and then the pursuivant you would not like to desert poor pur added cherry  i could do that better in town in some ways  mr underwood would think that as bad as edgars drawing said wilmet no no felix you have learnt one business thoroughly and it would be foolish to begin a fresh one now besides how about mr froggatt  of course i should do nothing in such haste as to inconvenience mr froggatt said felix and no one is more anxious for our real benefit if this were possible  but you see it wont do reiterated wilmet  perhaps not he answered with more of a sigh than his sisters expected  rather nettled wilmet set to work with pencil and paper to calculate expenses geraldine looked up at felix who had taken up a book and began to whistle for a that an a that  presently wilmet by way of making assurance sure went off for her accountbook when he looked up and said how should you have liked this cherry  i dont know ive not thought did you  i hadnt time before our pallas athene settled it and i believe she is right if she would not lay it in quite so hard it only seemed a pity to lose our last chance of a lift in life without at least considering it  i thought you did not care about lifts in life  i ought not but when it is brought home that we have slipped down two degrees in the social scale it is tempting to step up one again however it plainly cannot be  yet when wilmet mustered her irrefragable figures to prove how much poorer they would be in london than on their present income at bexley he would not go into details saying that he wanted to hear no more about it in a tone that a little hurt her he was so uniformly gentle and gracious that what would have passed unnoticed in most brothers was noticed anxiously in him and as wilmet darned his shirt sleeve a glistening came between her eyes and her needle as she felt the requital of her prudence rather hard must all men pant to be out in the world and be angry with women for withholding them  nor was geraldine devoid of the old prick when she thought of the degrees in the social scale in connection with the words about tradesmen and merchants  wilmet was not quite happy without knowing that the letter of refusal was written and was more vexed than she liked to show when felix laughed at her for supposing he could have made time to write it on a busy saturday even if there had been any london post to send it by poor alice knevett got a considerable snubbing for bursting in to ask the decision and lamenting over it when she had heard it but she stood her ground with a certain pertinacity of her own and so late in the evening that wilmet had gone up to put stella to bed felix came up with the letter in his hand it was so carefully expressed that cherry could not help saying saucily that it was worthy of the editor of the pursuivant while alice much impressed by the long words enthusiastically broke out it is a most beautiful letter only it ought to have said just the other thing  why what would you have done without cherry said felix  id have come to stay with her and it is such a pity a merchant is a gentleman and i am sure you could get to be anythinga member of parliament or a baronet or as if her imagination could not go farther but she looked up at him with a dew of eagerness glistening in her bright hazel eyes i was telling cherry it does seem such a dreadful horrible pity that you should be nailed down in this little hole of a place for life  felix smileda mans superior gratified but half melancholy smile as he answered at any rate you wont lose the pleasures of imagination or of pity  but i want to see you have the spirit to try cried alice eagerly i know you could  it would not be right said felix sitting down by her and in full earnest gentleness and gravity setting before her the reasons that cherry had hardly thought it worth while really to explainnamely the impossibility of their being able to pay their way and meet the needful expenses and the evils of the young inexperienced household residing in london resigning security for dependence  alice flattered by being treated as a sensible person said yes and i see at all the proper places then drew a sigh saying it is very good in you  i knew you would see it in the right light replied felix  oh but the sigh recurred i cant help being sorry you know  there is nothing to be sorry for he said gratefully i was disappointed at first myself but for sheer usefulness to ones neighbour i believe that this present position if i have sense to make use of it rightly is as good as any and the mere desire of station and promotion iswhen one comes to look at it properly nonsense after all  she opened her eyes in amazement and made a little exclamation  they may be well when they come said felix in answer but i have thought it over well tonight and i see that to do anything doubtfully right for their sake would be a risk for all that i have no right to run  alice hung her head overcome by the pure air of the region where he was lifting her and in a sort of shyness at the serious tone in which he had spoken he added smiling  then youll forgive the sound of it  o mr underwood she said in the simplest and most earnest voice that cherry had ever heard from her im ashamed to recollect that nonsense     chapter xiv  what it may lead to    i never was so berhymed since i was an irish rat  which i can scarcely rememberas you like it   dim memories haunt the child  of lives in other beings led    other and yet the same                          keble   in the autumn alda made a visit at home she had as usual gone with mr and mrs underwood to their german baths and had there fallen in with a merry set of her intimates in london who had persuaded her to join them in an expedition to the tyrol which lasted till the end of september on her return she was dropped at bexley where her sisters were greatly edified by her sketchbook a perfect journal in clever scenes and groups like the voyage en zigzag two of the gentlemen seemed always in waiting on the graceful outline that did duty for alda and indeed she gave wilmet to understand that only the skill that played them off one against the other had averted an offer from each hundreds of miles from home when it would have been so very inconvenient every morning wilmet considered how her dinner would appear if one or both should suddenly drop in to pursue his courtship  even felix though he had poohpoohed the mysterious whisper from his sisters was startled at the apparition of a picturesque figure in tyrolese hat green knickerbockers belt knapsack loose velvet coat and fair moustache marching full into the shop and while the customers who were making it a rendezvous gazed in doubt between gamekeepers and stage banditti holding out a hand too fair and dainty for either character and exclaiming how are you mr froggatt hollo felix  mr froggatt was amazed beyond measure and it was only on hearing the ring of the mirthful laugh that he exclaimed mr edgar  this is an alteration you will find the young ladies upstairs  felix was disengaged at the moment and could take him through the parlour too glad to have him there at all to utter the faintest wish that he would have rung at the private door and he ushered him into the drawingroom with the words heres the artist who has begun with himself and then retreated  edgar oh you wonderful boy cried happy geraldine as he threw his arms round her while alda asked is that the thing now edgar  quite comifo he answered ha little ones have you forgotten me  stella says youre the clarionet in the brass band said bernard what have you got in that pack  munitions of war he answered unstrapping his bag and producing packets of french bonbons bought on his way home from the sketching tour mr renville always made with sundry of his pupils in early autumn gobble them up little mice before the cat comes home  stella paused with a dutiful may i and cherry had to interfere between the little maidens scruples bernards omnivorous inclination and theodores terror at any new article of food while alda and edgar exchanged eager question and answer  youve been at home youve seen them all  i dined there on sundaymight do so any day they cant do without me thats a fact  nor me i imagine said alda i suppose i am to go back with you  so madam proposed but the fact is that molly has done uncommonly well without you this time  what do you mean  asked alda sharply  what think you of a friend of cherry  i havent got any friends  think again not the great convert the cacique of all the mexicos  ferdinand travis you dont mean it  i dont but the elders mean it and the youngers will do it  do tell me i cant understand cried alda much excited we have never met him  the uncle or fatherwhich  the uncle  well the uncle has been in england and fraternised with our governor at peter browns there was a banqueting all round and his nephew was carried at his chariot wheels if i am not much mistaken gold and timber jingled to silver and bullockhide and concluded a prospective union in the persons of my nephew and my daughter im sorry i have long been persuaded that a very small effort on the part of our respected blunderbore might have redeemed the family fortunes in the person of polly  how could you think of anything so absurd said alda  as if my uncle would consent  if tom has any sentiment it is for my father and the name of underwood said edgar you remember he was sorely disappointed that felix would not step into my shoes  and very angry and hurt said alda as well he might be  yes but that anger proved the vastness of his good intentions besides theres something about our old giantsteadiness and breeding i believethat uniformly makes tom knock under to him and theres a peculiar affinity of good sense between him and marilda that ought to have ripened under favourable circumstances  and is he really cut out said alda i dont know how to believe this how far has it gone  hanger on and oyster in love promptly answered edgar  honest polly has the most comical look of anxious coyness on her jolly face and holds her elbows squarer than ever and a few paces off stands montezuma magnificent and melancholic and edgar assumed the posture  melancholy no wonder said the conscious beauty edgar he must be over head and ears in debt  so it struck me but he must have managed it uncommon quietly for they call him the mexican muff hes hand and glove with all their holinesses up at clements shop and the wildest orgie he has been detected at was their magiclantern  then it is real goodness that draws them together exclaimed cherry looking up from her presidency over the comfits  goodness and a balance said edgar  did you know said cherry that as soon as he came of age he paid the insurance all the money for the fortinbras arms the agents were quite overwhelmed and wanted to put it in the pursuivant  she was cut short by the return of wilmet and angela accompanied by miss knevett the effect of edgars appearance was startling alice gave a little scream of surprise angela crept behind her sisters and wilmet stood for a moment like a stag at gaze then as he said well mettie are you going to send for the police exclaimed you edgar what a figure you have made of yourself  see how our eldest crushes me said edgar such a face as yours mettie ought not to be wedded to the commonplace  i suppose it is like german artists said wilmet trying to resign herself  it is such a beautiful becoming dress whispered alice to geraldine while edgar rattled onno wonder there is a deterioration in taste from living in the very tents of the philistines why cherry how do you bear existence surrounded by such colours as these  the paper asked wilmet surprised it is rather a large pattern to be sure  i call it cruelty to animals to shut cherry up among the eternal abortive efforts of that gilded trellis to close upon those blue dahlias crimson lilacs and laburnums growing upwards tied with huge ragged magenta ribbons they would wear out my brain  well i think when you remember our old paper you might be thankful said wilmet  precisely what i do and am not thankful what our paper may have been in its earlier stages of existence i am not prepared to say but since i can remember that hateful thing the pattern could only be traced by curious researches in dark corners and the wall presented every nuance of purplish salmon or warm apricot  dear old paper cried cherry yes wasnt it soft deepening off in clouds and bars sunsets and stormclouds to make stories about  where it was most faded and grimy said wilmet it is all affectation not to be glad to have clean walls  clean cried edgar in horror defend me from the clean bare bald and frigid with hard lines breaking up and frittering your background if walls are ornamented at all it should not be in a poor material like paper but rich silk or woollen tapestry hangings  we couldnt have tapestry now said alice in a puzzled voice  then     comrades take warning by my fall              and have it strong or not at all  not walls laughed cherry  let them be of natural or at any rate uniform tint and cover them with your own designs of some character and purpose not patterns bought by the yard  oh i see what you would be at said wilmet quaintly  you are bewailing the loss of your great man friday  achilles i beg your pardon  he never would come out said angela he came through the whitewash after the measles  i wonder what the present inhabitants think of him said cherry one comfort is if he is a bogy now they may show him some day as an early effort of sir edgar underwood president of the royal academy  oh dear i must go cried alice i only came to fetch a pattern for aunt maria and she is waiting for it but you are all so delightful here  what pretty little thing have you picked up there asked edgar as she went  have we not told you of miss pearsons niece  you should take her likeness cherry as a relief from the classically severe  cherry opened her portfolio and showed two or three watercoloured drawings of the graceful little head and piquant features edgar criticised and promised a lesson and the sitter nothing loth though rather coy was caught she blushed and smiled and took exception at little personalities and laughed her forgiveness going through a play of countenance very perplexing to the pupil but much relished by the master as he called up the pout and smile by turns and played with her little airs  he took alda back on monday but promised to come home for christmas and kept his word perhaps the renville wirthschaft afforded less contrast with home than did the underwood menage and in spite of the philistine furniture the rooms in the high street agreed better with his tastes than the old house in st oswalds buildings he was above objecting to the shop and whereas clement carefully avoided the public precincts he was often there hunting up books reading newspapers gossiping with mr froggatt or with redstone and always ensuring himself a welcome by the free bright sweetness of his manner and his amusing talk  it was a prosperous winter felix as partner and acknowledged editor was in a more comfortable position both as to income and authority other matters were going well fulbert to the general surprise turned out a capital letterwriter and sent home excellent accounts of himself working heartily in a situation in the post office which mr audleys somerville interest had managed to secure for him moreover all close scholarships had not been abolished and felixs opportunities in the newspaper line had enabled him to discover one at st cadocs a small college at cambridge to be competed for by the natives of the county where clement had fortunately been born a letter to the parish clerk of vale leston to ask for the baptismal register of edward clement underwood produced a reply from a wellremembered old abednego tripp who declared himself horned and rejoiced at hearing from master felix and at being able to do anything for one of the reverend mr edwards sons the competition was not very severe clement obtained the scholarship and therewith his maintenance for three years to come and he was at the same time able to exercise a bit of patronage on his sisters behalf more gratifying to his own feelings than theirs mr fulmorts unmarried sisters had lived in the country with a former governess until on the death of the elder the survivor decided on employing her very considerable fortune in establishing a school where girls of small means might be prepared for becoming firstrate governesses with special openings for the daughters of poor clergy and of missionaries  one of the first families thought of was that of the favourite chorister so angela now ten years old was nominated at once to the relief of wilmet who did not think her romping intimacies with the girls at miss pearsons very desirable moreover after a correspondence between miss fulmort and miss lyveson it was decided that robina should be transferred to the new school at brompton with her sister partly by way of infusing a trustworthy element and partly that her studies might be perfected by london masters robina whose allegiance to miss lyveson was most devoted was greatly grieved but she was a reasonable womanly little being aware that governessship was her profession and resolute to qualify herself so though she came home with telltale spots under her eyes she replied to all condolences with i know its right what must be must and her spirits rose when lance came home bound only to return during the holidays on two or three special days when his voice was indispensable at the cathedral  edgar and he together kept the house in continual merriment so that the sober pillars of the house found themselves carried along they knew not whither  i have had a serious application said felix one evening a solemn knock came to the office door and an anxious voice came inplease brother i want to speak to you there stood the little star i thought at least she had broken the chandelier but no such thing it was please brother maynt i have a birthday  poor little darling cried some voices  what could have put it into her head said wilmet  she said all little girls had birthdays and ellen bruce had told angel all about the dance in honour of hers  ah said wilmet well have angel out of the way of that kind of chatter  poor little maid of course i had to quench her said felix as far as her own day was concerned i told her more about it than she had ever heard but then she took me aback by saying father was happy and she thought he would like her to be happy  you didnt consent exclaimed wilmet  i represented that it was theodores birthday as well and that strangers would make him miserable she was really very good and i want you just to consider whether we could not do somethingof course on a different daybut in the course of the holidays by way of treat surely you could invite some of miss pearsons pupils  i dont like to begin felix said wilmet there would be reciprocity and no one knows where it might lead to  a few white muslin frockseh w w i think we could stand them  that is not all i mean said wilmet it is the sort of style of thing it would be all very well to have a few little girls here but they would all ask us again and i could not answer for what might happen at their homes  it is out said edgar now we know the sort of style of thing it might lead to minerva under a mistletoe bough  hurrah burst out lance in convulsions of mirth which infected felix and cherry while wilmet as simple as she was discreet blushed up to the tips of her ears and tried to defend herself  they tell me of doings at their parties that are what i should not like for our little girls and i dont think you would felix  forfeits to wit asked edgar or cards or waltzing you may as well be explicit mettie  no no said felix mettie shall not be teased she is right in the main but his tone was that he always used when her prudence was too much for him  and the family refinement is to be secured by sitting in ashes all christmas said edgar slightly unchristian it strikes me  but continued felix out of these domestic ashes we must get up some sport for the children i stand committed to stella  shall i get bill harewood and do box and cox suggested lance  might we not get up something they could take part in themselves said cherry cinderella or some such little playedgar you know how to manage such things  wilmet doesnt know where they would lead to gravely responded edgar  to lances going off with a circus said felix  i always had a great mind to do so responded lance to sing comic songs on one leg on a spotted horses back and go about day and night in a yellow van drawn by elephantsi call that life  secure a berth for me as scenepainter cried edgar see how id draw a house by the very outline of mazeppa outside  and felix will print all our advertisements gratis  oh broke in cherry i have a notion couldnt we make a play of the conjuror in disguise it is dr knowall in german popular tales robin the conjuror in english  nothing foolish i hope seriously asked wilmet  oh no dont you recollect the story is that a set of thieves steal a jewel a man comes shamming conjuror and offering to find it for the owner intending to trust to chance and feast at her expense as long as he is not found out  i remember exclaimed lance you used to tell us the story somebody suspects him and brings a creature shut up in a covered dish to ask him to tell what it wasand it happens to be a robin so when he cries out oh poor robin thinking himself done for out hops the bird and the enemy is sold  yes and then he counts his dinners every day and the thieves who have come to look on think he is counting them and throw themselves on his mercy  it has capabilities said edgar  but the moral said wilmet  what not the lesson against dealing with conjurors demanded edgar ill undertake to arm your pupils against spiritrapping for ever  in that point of view said wilmet doubtfully  in that point of view said felix laughing it has my vote  i dont like deception to succeed said wilmet but at least theres none of the worst sort of nonsense  lance leapt up and performed a pas seul insisting that bill harewood must come and be a robber and edgar and cherry instantly had their heads together as playwrights and managers  never mind wilmet said felix at their bedroom doors that night remember father never was a man for all work and no play  i dont mind play but i dont know what this may lead to then as felix laughed merrily at the repetition she followed him into his room saying i mean i have no trust in edgars discretion or lances either and all sorts of things may be put into the childrens heads  you cant keep childrens heads a blank said felix and edgars good taste ought to be trusted in his own home for his own sisters even you might stretch a few points to keep him happy and occupied with cherry besides i believe we do live a duller life than can be really good for any one it cant be right to shut up all these young things all their holidays without any pleasure  i thought said wilmet her eyes growing moist it was pleasure enough to be all at home together  so it is to staid old fogies like you and me said felix kissing her but the young ones want a lark now and then and i confess i should be immensely disappointed if this fun didnt come off no no w w i cant have you an old cat you are much too young and pretty  the levity of this conclusion shocked wilmet beyond remonstrance was felix falling from his height of superiority or was her strictness wearisome  meantime geraldines brain was ringing with doggrel rhymes and whirling with stage contrivances in the delight of doing something with edgar whether versifying or drawing and as felix said to keep him happy at home for christmas was no small gain even though it brought a painful realisation that their feast was not his feast  geraldine suffered in silence for a word from her was always put down by some tender jest avowing as much inferiority in goodness as superiority in intellect as to clement edgars sport was to startle him with jokes dilemmas and irreverences and then to decline discussion on the ground that he never argued with sisters and that clement would understand when he went to cambridge otherwise the subject was avoided at home but edgar consorted a good deal with mr ryder calling him the only person in the town except cherry who knew the use of a tongue and one day when felix was assisting his old master in a search through old newspapers in the reading room mr ryder said bytheby your brother edgar has a good deal more of the talk of the day than you can be prepared for  i am afraid so sir said felix but he does not put it forth much at home  so i hoped it would have startled your father a good deal but i believe myself acting in the spirit of his wishes in letting him talk out his crudities  thank you sir said felix not quite knowing how to take this  it is a phase to be passed through said mr ryder indeed a good deal of it is fashion and vanity  mr audley thinks so replied felix he said he thought poor edgar did not think enough to have real doubt but that he considered other peoples a dispensation from attending to the subject at all  exactly said mr ryder except so far as repeating what he has caught up seems to him knowing and according to the spirit of the time fit to dazzle us down here whatever may deepen him will probably change all thati do not say into what you or your father would wish but what is jargon now will pass away into something more real for better or  for worse asked felix anxiously as he paused  i do not say so returned mr ryder perhaps what i chiefly wished at this moment was to clear myself in your eyes of treachery to your father  no sir that i never could suspect  but the conversation might well leave heaviness behind it was it come to edgars views being such as to startle mr ryder who for that matter had of late shown much less laxity of opinion than in his younger and more argumentative days and there was little comfort in supposing that these were not real honest doubts at all only apologies for general carelessness and irreligion  yet with even this trouble in the recess of the heart this was the merriest winter the underwood household had known since their fathers time  edgar chose to frame the play upon the italian form of the story where the impostor is a starveling poet nicknamed signor topo or master ratton because his poverty had brought him to live in a hay loft this character he assumed and no doubt it fitted him better than either the english cobbler or the german doctor besides as he said sham court costume is always the easiest to contrive but cherry was by no means prepared to find the ratlike poet the secret admirer of a daughter of the serene highness who owned the jewel  such a monstrous interpolation quoth geraldine  interpolations are the beauty of the thing it would be as flat as a pancake without  and wilmet wont like it  wilmet must be brought to the level of ordinary human nature  i dont feel as if this were using her well you know she expressly consented to this because there was no nonsense in it  ie if it had been cinderella it would have been improper if the sleeping beauty highly scandalous eh cherie  you know i think mettie does carry her scruples pretty far said geraldine trying not to laugh but i wont be a party to cheating her and if this young princess is to come in she must be told of it  or she will take out her gorgons head in the midst and petrify her subjects maybe it will be safest to prepare her you see such discipline reigns here that a poor bohemian like me doesnt know where to be  accordingly edgar said in his airy way o mettie bytheby we have put in a part for little miss knevett  indeed i thought it was to be all among ourselves have you spoken to her  of course and she is in the ecstatic state of preparation of spangles and coronets  i wish you had spoken before it would be hard to disappoint her now what is she to be  nothing less than heroine there must be some sort of conventional catastrophe or the whole concern falls flat  i dont see why it should not fall flat said wilmet with a sober air that drove cherry into an uncontrollable convulsion of laughter it would amuse the children just as well  the children of six maybe said edgar gravely but hardly the children of sixteen have you no mercy on them my venerable sister  wilmet had arrived at such a pass of resignation as to perceive that a fuss on her part might be more mischievous than any nonsense in which edgar was likely to indulge in public especially with geraldine as his coadjutor she tried to obtain some reassurance that there was nothing more silly than needful in this play of yours  no indeed there is just a little mock courtship but as that is the case with ninetenths of the stories in the world i dont think you gain much by turning it out  i did hope for once in a way we ourselves might be quit of it  it is hard on you said cherry smiling but it would make a great uproar to disturb all now  at any rate i have found the old receipt for teacakes responded wilmet whose mind was almost as much preoccupied with the entertainment of the body as her sisters with that of the mind  she had relented so far as to invite two little girls and their widowed mother from whom there was no danger of reciprocities lance had prevailed to have will harewood as one of the robbers and the miss pearsons were coming to behold their niece besides which stella having imparted the great secret to mr froggatt felix found the good old gentleman and his wife burning to have an invitation thus the party would be the largest wilmet had ever contemplated and the mysteries of tea and supper were so congenial to her housewifely soul that she did not distress herself about the frequent rehearsals in miss pearsons empty schoolroom the transformations of garments under the needles of cherry and robina nor even the wildness and ecstacy of all the children from lance downwards all bursting with secrets and letting them out at every corner of their grinning mouths  it must soon be over and felix seemed to be enjoying it thoroughly and wilmet could tolerate a great deal when either felix or alda enjoyed he was much too busy with christmas accounts to undertake any part that needed learning but he was pressed into the service as a courtier only with a dispensation from either speaking or rehearsing while wilmet utterly scouted any idea of taking any share in the drama having enough to do in her own character  and in that character she was left alone to entertain the guests for even cherry was in request as prompter and assistant dressernay with the assistance of theodores accordion formed the whole band of musicians at the ball which opened the performance and which required the entire corps dramatique robina as the elderly princess demonstratively dropped her bracelet with a ruby about as big as a pigeons egg being the stopper of a scentbottle and after the dancers had taken some trouble not to step on it they retired and it was stolen by the gang of robbers cloaked up to their corked eyebrows and moustaches  then appeared in his loftsupplied with straw culled from packages at the printinghousethe poet well got up in his knickerbockers and velvet smokingcap scarf and guitar soliloquising in burlesque rhyme on his fallen state and hopeless admiration and looking very handsome and disconsolate until startled by the cry behind the scenes        o yes o yes o yes       by command of her highness       lost stolen or strayed       gone to the dogs or mislaid       her highness splendid ruby       whoso finds itwit or booby       tinker tailor soldier lord       let him ask what he will he shall have his reward   thereupon the poet communicating his designs in a stage soliloquy disguised himself in a tow wig and beard and a railway rug turned up with yellow calico and the scene shifting to the palace he introduced himself to the elderly princess as the greatest of spiritualistsso great that        detective police are an ignorant fable       no detective can equal a walnutwood table   but he required as a medium a maiden fair and lovely but with a heart as yet untouched otherwise the spirits might be offended the only lady who was available was of course the youthful princess fiordespina whose alarm and reluctance had been contrived so as to be highly flattering to the disguised poet  the dinner scenes at which the robbers presented themselves in turn and imagined that they heard themselves counted went off in due order also the test when the courtiers tried to pose the spiritualist with making him divine what they brought him in a covered dish and were disconcerted by his sighing out        alas alas see envy batten       on the unhappy master ratton   while the rat leaped out from beneath the lid  then came the avowal by the robber but the conclusion was so far varied that the jewel having been judiciously hidden the poet made use of his voice and his guitar to throw the lady fiordespina into a mesmeric sleep before the court and then to cause a table to rap out the letters which she interpreted so as to lead to the spot  it was the prettiest scene of all his music and song were so graceful and in spite of some suppressed giggling the attitude and countenance of fiordespina were so very pretty in her trance nothing more was left save the restoration of the ruby the claiming of the reward and the final tableau in which ratton and fiordespina in their native good mien had their hands joined by the benignant elderly princess while to the equal amusement and confusion of all good old mrs froggatt fairly burst out crying with excitement and admiration  mrs vincent the young widow was likewise enchanted and so was miss maria pearson but wilmet could not quite fathom the tone of the elder and graver sister or decide whether it were her own dissatisfaction that made her think miss pearson had not expected to see such a role bestowed upon her niece  the doors between the drawingroom and the theatre were opened again the boys handed round negus and lemonade and felix standing over cherry said lances circus speculation would not be a bad one theres plenty of dramatic talent in the family  did you like it felix  i could tell exactly which parts were yours and which edgars was the ambiguous answer as he turned to secure the princess fiordespina for the dance that was to crown the performance  o mr underwood oh yes thank you but  is it part of the programme that wizard and medium should dance together  oh no only it seems so funny to think of your dancing  what you thought a stationer must be stationary  o mr underwood what a shocking pun and she was led off sparkling with pretty laughter while the conjuror muttering        the gouty oak began to move       and flounder into hornpipes   turned graciously on little susie vincent and scared as much as he elevated her by claiming her as his partner  will harewood dashing across the room and looking earnestly with his bold and now flushed face up to wilmet blurted out miss underwood now please let me dance with you  thank you she said graciously but i believe i must play for them  ill do that said clement over her head  the dead march in saul murmured edgar  nonsense broke out mrs vincent starting up what am i good for but to play  so clement who thought he had found an escape was reduced to the necessity of asking the other little vincent and wilmets smile of consent so elated bill harewood that he could not help flying across to that very happy and wellmatched pair the elderly princess and first robber to tell them ive got her  who  why your sister  youve never been and made up to wilmet said lance as if this instance of valour crowned his merits  yes i have and she will you see there aint another gentleman out of the family except the old froggy and the little one has got him well i always wished beyond anything to dance with miss underwood  did you said robina i never should have thought of that  most likely not said bill but she is the most beautiful woman i ever did or shall see in all my life and he flew back to her side  is she said robina altogether amazed  well perhaps said lance you know one might go a long way without finding any one so handsome  then i wish people wouldnt say so it seems making our wilmet common like any other girl to care for her being pretty  so froggys dancing with stella observed lance i declare ill try if mrs frog wont stand up with me some one ought youll not mind waiting bobbie it is not often one has the chance to dance with a cap like that  bobbie resigned herself amicably and lance with his bright arch face made his bow and half polite half saucy addresses to mrs froggatt in her magnificent headgear making her laugh herself almost to tears again as she declined he held the miss pearsons in greater awe and ventured on neither so that robina had him for sir roger de coverley where the sole contretemps arose from angel and bear being in such boisterous spirits that wilmet decreed that they must not be partners again of the rest some had a good deal of dancingmaster experience mrs harewoods impromptu merrymakings had afforded plenty of practice to the two choristers even clement had had a certain schoolfeast training and felix with a good ear ready eye and natural ease of movement acquitted himself to miss knevetts eagerly expressed admiration  take care master ratton will be jealous said edgar as he claimed her for the next dance a quadrille  jealous oh no some people one never thinks of complimenting  cherry caught the words and wondered what they meant  a few more dances and then came wilmets anxiously contrived supper  i say observed will harewood to lance why cant we have things like this at home  tisnt their nature to judiciously responded lance  this cream is quite up to the grub we get after a crack letoff in the close added will for requisitions for their voices at private concerts had made the choir connoisseurs in the relics of feasts  better i should say returned lance mettie doesnt make it of soap or arsenic or verdigris like old twopenny  what you dont mean that she made it herself  of course who else should  my eyes and to see her looking like that then with a deep sigh if i could only book her for my wife on the spot  whence it may be inferred that stellas birthday party was not only a brilliant success but might in wilmets phrase lead to something all it seemed to have led to at present was a discovery on the part of the good miss pearsons that the household they had been wont to pity as small orphan children now contained three fine young men  at least geraldine connected this with the desire they expressed that alice might enjoy the same opportunities as robina of giving her acquirements a final polish up to diploma pitch a correspondence commenced resulting in miss knevett being engaged as teacher being remunerated by lessons in languages and accomplishments the arrangement gave universal satisfaction cherry could not detect any regret on the part of felix alice would still spend her holidays with her aunts and the sense that her departure was near made the intercourse between the two houses more frequent and familiar than it had ever yet been  one evening cherry while looking up a quotation for felix in southeys doctor lit on his quaint theory of the human soul having previously migrated through successive stages of vegetable and animal life and still retaining something characteristic from each transmigration her brothers were a good deal tickled with the idea and lance exclaimed i know who must have been rhubarb queenwasp and a henharrier  oh thats too bad cried robina  why a henharrier asked felix recognising like almost all the others  one of the birds of prey where the female is bigger than her mate drily observed edgar  besides said cherry recollect the henharriers countenance in pictures with beady eyes and a puffed supercilious smile about the beak  why thats lady price chimed in alice making the discovery at last  lengthily and gravely edgar uttered the words puzzlemonkey praying mantis sacred stork howler  lance and robin roared with merriment and after one glance at clements half virtuous half offended countenance felix and cherry fell into like convulsions while alice exclaimed but who is it and angel shouted the sufficiently evident answer clement oh the howler the black preaching monkey in a natural surplice  i cant think how you do it exclaimed alice  i object to the mantis cherry struggled to say nasty hypocritical creature that eats things up  praying for its living eh cherry said wicked edgar if you had ever seen the long thin animal with head back hands joined and pious attitude you couldnt doubt  and as he spoke he sketched his mischievous likeness at which the mirth grew more furious while cherry always the most easily excited uttered in a strangled voice a parsnip a barndoor hen a dilapidated guernsey cow an old mother whale  o cherry cherry youve immortalised yourself shouted lance how did you hit off the parsnip the very thing that had stumped me  the colour and the odd sort of sweetness said cherry  wont we have fun with it when i go back cried lancenot tell nonsense why no one will enjoy it like mother harewood herself  only dont say i made it there edgar has got one  touchmenot balsam blisterfly bantamcock full strut black terrier  he did not caricature this time except with the muscles of his face and with these he contrived to put on four different aspects each so exactly like mr mowbray smith that not even alice required the proclamation of the name and wilmet gravely said i do not think this is a proper sort of game it must be illnatured or irreverent  that depends said geraldine now thoroughly in the swing here hawthornden appletree stickleback goldfinch beaver        the hardy norsemans house of yore       was on the foaming wave   sang out lance recalling theodores substitute for felixs name  exactly likefigures tastes and all said edgar scanning felixs clear bright fresh face glossy hair and rather short figure at once trim and sturdy the goldfinch hit him off exactly but i dont see the force of the appletree  you would said cherry if you were properly acquainted with our three trees and their individualities the hawthornden is a resolute looking fellow but it indulges in the loveliest pink and white blossoms and waxen delicate peachy fruit  uncommonly sour thank you cherry said felix  not in a pie suggested alice  properly treated and sweetened eh  asked he smiling on her  but why is felix like a stickleback said angela  dont you know said cherry a beautiful bright little fish and the good male one swims up and down taking care of the nest  i do like the beaver allowed wilmet it always was my favourite beast  it hits off the respectable householder element added edgar three flaps of his broad tail rule beaverdom like jupiters nod  i have one interposed robinabelladonna lily working bee menura  hold hard called lance is a menura fish flesh or fowl  fowl the lyretailed pheasant that makes a shelter for its nest with its own tail  decided liar tale muttered edgar  go on bobbie felix encouraged her the pheasant suits both the twins as well as the belladonna any more  perhaps the leading stag of the herd  dont make us like that proud cowardly tyrannical beast exclaimed wilmet  i have seen you look exactly like one said geraldine that and the pheasant both give the notion of your neck  such a set of trumpery gaudy things grumbled wilmet nothing but the bee is tolerable  i did think of a speckled hamburg hen and a nice quiet shegoat said robina but they are all dowdy and would not suit alda  theres something in the theory said edgar that belladonna approves itself perfectlyso delicate and stately and yet so essentially unpoetical  that mettie takes as a compliment said felix only she would rather have been a potato or a cabbage  now said cherry you will all knowbellheather the grasshopper the lark and the squirrel  is this the larks crest or the squirrels tail said felix giving an elder brothers pull to the boys highest wave of hair  or the grasshoppers leap cried lance springing on him for a bout of buffeting and skirmishing in the midst of which alice was heard wondering how the riddles as she thought them were either made or guessed  they come said geraldine i am only afraid we shall fall into a trick of making them for everybody  i wonder what you would make for me  geraldine had it on her tongues end that alice would be difficult for want of anything distinctive but felix and edgar were both jotting something down and robina was beforehand with either scarlet pimpernel tortoiseshell butterfly budgerigar marmoset  no one answered for felix had pushed a slip of paper over to alice on which she readforgetmenot ladybird linnet kitten i dont think i ever saw a linnet isnt it a little brown bird  with a rich glow of red and a beautiful song said felix smiling and the red glowed redder on her cheek as she said laughing kitten for mischief eh for shame mr underwoodwhat another dear me i shall not know myself  this had been slipped into her hand and cherry suspected that her exclamation had been a mistake of which she was conscious as the colour deepened on her already blushing cheeks and her eyes were cast down while a demure smile played on her lips the incautious exclamation had betrayed her and the young ones clamoured to hear edgars view of her transmigration but there was a little coy struggle of oh no she wouldnt and she couldnt        she smiled and blushed and oft did say           her pretty oath by yea or nay   and in the midst came the message that the maid was arrived to take her home and this being a cross stiff personage who might never be kept waiting she had to hurry away and had no sooner gone than angela burst out with here it is ive got it listen to it say lady  stay angela interrupted felix you have no business with that  not edgars fun she exclaimed why where is he  surely he is not going home with her said wilmet in some dismay  oh but it is such fun went on angela only i cant make it out you read it lance  did she give it you said felix  no i whipped it up when she dropped it theres something about ratton in it  felix quietly took the paper out of her hand folded it and put it into an envelope you take it back to her the first thing to morrow he said now go to bed  angela durst not oppose that tone so unusually serious and authoritative but she contrived to prolong her goodnights and the putting away of her goods with a kind of half droll half sullen resignation and just as wilmet was hurrying her off edgar returned he always spoilt angela a little and she sprang to him with a kind of droll pout youll not be cross edgar youll let us hear alices transmigrations look heres felix bottled them up in an envelope and wont let us peep at them but youll let me hear you wont order me off to bed  cherry fancied she saw a disconcerted look on his face when he saw the envelope held up to him but if so it instantly gave place to the mischievous entertainment of defeating a lesson on discretion the heads of the family must assert themselves sometimes my dear even about nothing he said consolingly  indeed said wilmet bristling in defence of felix of course we knew it was nothing it was only very illmannered and wrong of angela to go prying into what was not meant to be shown  im sure said edgar most ungratefully it might be posted on the church door for what i care except for its intrinsic vileness  oh lets have it lets have it burst out lance and robina who had been burning with curiosity all the time  dont let us have them murdered whatever they are said edgar taking them into his own hand pity the sorrows of a poor wretch seduced into one of your horrid jeux desprita ladys excuse for fishing for compliments that sound more than they mean here goes then        say lady what existence past       thine essence hath enfolded       what humble antecedent cast       thy present self hath moulded        the hawthorn bush with blossom white       veiling her branches pricking       the painted lady fluttering light       the rash pursuer tricking        grass paraquit who loves to sit       in clustering rows and chat on       caressing purring traitor kit       fatal to master ratton   there ladies and gentlemen i hope you are satisfied he concluded letting his performance float into the fire the metaphors to say the least are startling but that is the fault of the game  i dont enter into it all said cherry  not likely another of the grass paraquits would my dear said edgar  and it is exactly what robin made her said angela both that and the butterfly and felix the kitten you didnt borrow of course how funny  but i didnt make her inconstant said robin that is not fair  not when you made her a butterfly and the shepherds weatherglass too  i never thought of that only their being both bright dark sparkling things and felix has the forgetmenot by way of antidote  i do not think such things are wise pronounced wilmet  and by the by edgar it has always been the custom that nobody should walk home with alice miss pearson would not like it and it would make a talk  edgar laughed dear w w let it not trouble you what it may lead to is a bugbear to you you cant think how much younger and more agreeable you will be when you have learnt that there can be passages that lead to nothing  geraldine went to bed uncomfortable and perplexed before she was dressed in the morning alice darted in cherry im so vexed i dropped that paper do you think it is here  no angel picked it up and edgar read us the verses and then threw them into the fire  burnt them  yes he said the worst of such games was that they force one to pay compliments that may be taken to mean more than they do  cherry spoke under a stern sense of virtue doing a service to alice and when the quick answer came he didnt say that im sure it was wilmet she asseverated indeed he did i dont confuse in that way it is a very good warning not to dwell on what gentlemen may say in mere play  who told you i did said alice sharply youve no business to say such things  happily there was an interruption cherry felt as if she had had a taste of the claws but she feared she had been malicious and she was penitent     chapter xv  what it led to    then out and spak the popinjayold ballad   geraldine was hard at work on a drawing edgars teaching had improved her so much that under a sore longing to obtain some good studies she had ventured to place in the shop one of her best imaginary groups and to her surprise and delight it had brought her in fifteen shillings and an order for a companion  vistas of hope began to rise before her only obscured by her consciousness of the want of knowledge and skill it took some resolution not to attend exclusively to her art and she was forced to make it a rule never to touch a pencil till the lessons of bernard and stella were both over for the day  they were finished the children in the garden and cherry was in that world of joy and something like inspiration known to spirits imbued with any of the constructive poetry of art always endeavouring to fulfil an ideal never indeed satisfying themselves but never so at rest as in the effort  presently she was startled by a step on the stairs nothing short of the fall of delhi had ever been known to bring felix upstairs in business hours and he was especially bound to his work at present since mr froggatt was detained at home by a serious attack of rheumatism she looked up amazed at the eager question is there a letter from alda  i believe there is waiting for wilmet what is the matter  the most astonishing thing here is ferdinand travis writing to tell me of his engagement to alda  to alda  to alda i looked twice to be sure that there was no confusion between the names but it is my sister alda beyond a doubt  he would not ask my consent if it were marilda heres the letter as good and nice as possible dear good fellow  then what edgar told us must have been pure imagination  not the old folks wishes most likely for the rest edgar can make a good story one cant wonder at the preference and theres no denying that it is a brilliant chance for alda  and what a blessing that he should be so good  infinite no one could be so welcome how pleased mr audley will be but i must go and try not to look too much disposed to stand on the counter and crow  whatever felix did below upstairs cherry found drawing impossible ferdinand a brother the pleasure was enhanced by the affectionate simplicity of his letter the outcome of so good a heart greatly in love but very conscientious and utterly unpresuming on his wealth but showing all his old affection and reverence for felix what a delightful wonder that alda should bring in a connection so faithful to felix  yet what would not cherry have given to be as unsuspicious as felix or wilmet why would misgivings come into her head such as never troubled theirs why must she be haunted by aldas intimations about her travelling companions and her manner half scornful half nettled when edgar described the terms on which mr travis stood  she read ferdinands letter a second time and was convinced that he looked at the whole with such artless seriousness as to preclude all notion of his having been consciously playing fast and loose but she was ready to torture herself for the involuntary doubt whether her own sister were equally to be trusted  however when wilmet came home her genuine wholesome overflow of undoubting rapture could not but sweep cherry along in the tide ferdinand combined the apparently impossible advantages of being thoroughly one of themselves and yet of being able to give alda the luxuries to which she had become accustomed and wilmets joy was beyond expression the contrast between the twinsone admired praised followed esteemed as one of the brightest ornaments of london society the other toiling in an obscure povertystricken home a teacher in a small thirdclass school her beauty unheeded or viewed as a real disadvantageall this never occurred for one moment to wilmet she only felt elevated in her sister  two days passed before more letters were received and these came by the first instead of the second post before breakfast was over fourbesides one unheeded being only in robinas childish handwritingalda to wilmet thomas underwood and ferdinand both to felix edgar to geraldine there was a simultaneous opening of the letters then a general starting and looking into one anothers eyes and geraldine faintly murmured  then it was really so  so what do you mean broke forth wilmet these selfish people are treating my poor alda most cruelly among them and felix must go and fetch her home to be married from her own brothers house as she ought to be  i shall have to fetch her home said felix thoughtfully but i wish i were quite clear that she has been dealing kindly by marilda  you are not believing that man thomas rather than your own sister cried wilmet if alda does happen to be prettier than his daughter she cant help it im sure i should be glad enough not to be pretty but it is a trial and one must do the best one can  that is just what i fear alda has been doing said felix between his teeth as he frowned over his letter  read her letter poor dear girl cried wilmet and see if you arent ashamed of such a judgment no some is only meant for me but listenyour letter of sisterly joy has come on troubled waters i always knew i was the poor relation upon sufferance but i have been taught to feel it now she does not know how she could bear it but for the security of ferdinands strength and they will not let her see himsay she must give him up or themmrs underwoods violence inconceivable and all because of a chimerical fancy  what does ferdinand himself say asked cherry as wilmet looked on for further selections  he says said felix reading that our greeting was especially welcome from the contrast to what he met with from mr underwood the angry opposition took him by surprise having always thought they regarded alda as a daughter but of course nothing makes any difference to him and he would much rather come to us for her than to a stranger his uncle is at new orleans and he is writing to him he is afraid they ought to wait for the answer though there can be no doubt about it and he owes him no obediencenow cherry there is just time for edgars account before we go our several ways  o felix cried wilmet arent you going to fetch her home poor dear  not possible today mettie i shall have much ado to get away to morrow dont be so unhappy you know she could come alone or with edgar if it were so very dreadful or if you are so fierce you had better go yourself and encounter man thomas  wilmet looked so much hurt that geraldine thought to defend felix by reading aloud at once   ma cheriesuch a beargarden never was seen madame furious tom abusive alda injured innocence montezuma heroism and poor polly magnanimousthough the least said about her the soonest mended i saw when i went back that the crisis could not be far off the fact is that our dear sister cannot see any one else treated as an object and has so persuaded herself that she is the proverbial maltreated poor relation as to think everything fair   geraldine exclaimed wilmet how can you read felix how can you listen to such things about your own sister  it is only what she said herself said felix drily go on cherry   it must be owned that it was hard when for once polly had fallen in with something alike palatable to self and parents and able to swallow her broad visage if madame had had any wit she would have kept alda away till the fish was hooked when it is my belief he would have had no eyes for aught beyond but the good creature is too sure of the charms of her own goose to dread the admission of any swan whatsoever to her pond while the cacique being yet uncommitted small blame to him if he saw the differ especially as he attaches to alda all the sanctity of bexley which is to him at the least what st matthews is to clem to have been reared on the otheror indeed either side of the atlantic our intended brotherinlaw is curiously simple he accepted the intimation that aldas face is her fortune with superb indifference whether it will be the same with his uncle remains to be seen and i am afraid he is a good deal dependent on him his mothers mexican property having been speculated away i dont like the look of the business but if any one can do any good it is marilda herself tom is in a towering rage and his wife worse neither perceiving that the noise they make is small mercy to their daughter she looks all manner of colours but stands out gallantly that she is glad and that all is as it should be and i believe that left to herself she will set things straight felix had better keep out of the fray except upon compulsion  here is compulsion said felix tom underwood summons me i cant say i like the errand  you ought not to let yourself be led by edgars unkind joking way  we ought to be off now at any rate said felix glad to close the discussion ill write to get fernan to meet me at the station to morrow  accordingly when he arrived there was ferdinand travis driving a magnificent horse the whole turnout very far from looking like a connection of froggatt and underwood he had certainly developed into a splendidly handsome fellow though still lithe and slight rather than robust and his dignified bearing giving the idea of greater height than his inches testified to his greeting was warmly affectionate with all his old wishful reverence towards his young godfather and even with a sort of doubt of his thinking him worthy of his sister as to the disturbance created by the avowal of the object of his attentions he seemed amazed at it and entirely unconscious of any supposed change on his part  i knew my uncle wished me to be an intimate with the family he said and i was rejoiced to fall in with any one who bore your name and knew how to appreciate you but i had reason to think thatthat there were other viewsfor and here the olive cheeks grew crimson and he stammered himself into a hopeless entanglement whence felix recalled him charitably to an account of the explosion as it had affected himself  it appeared that his proposal had not been mentioned to the family till felixs answer had been received ferdinand feeling that no one ought to hear of it before the eldest brother the lovers had met that night at a ball and their consultation over the letters had taken place in the conservatory where they had been surprised and partly overheard by mrs underwood when ferdinand arrived the next morning he was received with denunciations of underhand ways and his explanation only made matters worse a thunderstorm about ingratitude and treachery was launched forth and he was told that the connection was so contrary to any intentions of his uncle that mr underwood could not hear of it and that alda must renounce it entirely on peril of being cast off by the family that ferdinand regarded her brother as the true head of her house was only additionally provoking and mr underwood had given him warning which he only hinted at to felix that the engagement could not be carried on with impunity  therewith they reached kensington palace gardens and being in a measure forbidden the house ferdinand drove about waiting for felix who on giving his name found himself ushered into the room where the whole party were finishing breakfast  alda looking meek and pensive but very lovely exquisitely dressed in white and blue ribbons flew into his arms as if her protector were come mr underwood without getting up acknowledged him by a grunt and hand held out marilda came round and put a cold hand into his clasping it tight and her mother greeted him with so felix underwood you are come up about this unlucky business  there is no reason it should be anything but a very happy one said marilda stoutly come mamma we had better leave papa and felix and she set the example but mrs underwood did not stir  you hear the dear girl she said it ought to go to aldas heart  it is of no use talking before the ladies said mr underwood getting up that is unless you have the good sense to join with me in telling alda that she must give up this wild affair the fellow has next to nothing of his own and his uncle would see him at jericho before he consented to a match like this  i am hardly prepared to do that sir said felix as alda clung to his arm and looked appealingly in his face unless the objection were more personal  objection burst forth the lady of the house when he has been making his way underhanddeceiving us all along  alda my dear said felix in her ear dont you think you had better go upstairs  but alda seemed as little disposed as mrs underwood to quit the scene of conflict o felix i dont know what she means nor what we have been doing for them all to turn against me  dont tell me miss innocence retorted mrs underwood the artificial polish giving way and the native scolding polly kedge breaking out in a storm of words wasnt the young man doing just as his uncle meant him and my poor dear girl fancying him as i never saw her do any one before till you came home with your sly artful waysyou that owed us the very clothes on your back  hush mary ejaculated her husband but he might as well have tried to stop a torrent ay i know she comes round every man of you with her smooth tongue and pretty face till youyou are ready to take her part against your own child underwood when my poor girls laid in her coffin then you will know what a serpent youve been fostering  to felixs surprise and annoyance alda must needs answer im sure its very hard if people will look at me i cant help it and ive as much right to be spoken to as marilda she that has got everything and poor me  luckily her tears stopped her voice  come along felix said the master of the house opening the door and he perceiving that escape alone could put an end to this most humiliating scene whispered again his recommendation to alda to go to her room and saw her hurrying up the stairs before his kinsman shut the door of his private room with a bounce exclaiming there now we are out of the way of the womens tongues we can hear ourselves speak i am afraid it is an awkward business felix underwood  i am afraid it is sir  and the ladies make it worse by making such a din about it said tom who after all was an underwood and whose better breeding had come to the perception how these ravings compromised his daughters dignity how far any one is to blame i cant tell the truth is that it would have been very satisfactory both to alfred travis and to me if the lad and my girl could have made it up together and they seemed ready enough to like each other my girl has got rather a turn for your newfashioned sort of saints and he seemed just her style everything does go contrary at times and when your sister came home with her pretty face and way my wife declares now she saw a change from the first but to tell the truth i never did and i doubt her doing so but you may guess how amazed we were when she came on them whispering together and it came out that he had been writing to you to sanction his proposing for alda as if he were ashamed to come to me who had always been a father to her  he meant no slight to you sir said felix eagerly but you know we were his first acquaintance and he had a feeling that an elder brother came nearest i am sure he felt no shame he was conscious of no change of intention  well well he is a little bit of an ass between ourselves felix i dont blame him half as much as alda the girl is sharp enough she has swarms of lovers men come about her like wasps to a lump of sugar and theres 5000 pounds ready for her the day she marries but when there was one my poor mary liked for once we liked for her and was in the way of liking hermary who has shared everything with her like a sistershe might have let him alone indeed her aunt gave her a hint but it only served to make her carry it on on the sly  felix wished he had not known of aldas hearing edgars report he could only say sadly if so she is quite indefensible  what would wilmet have thought of his fight with man thomas  of course proceeded that gentleman we know the less we say of that part of the story the better some day mary will know shes well rid of a coxcombical foreignlooking fellow she can afford to look farther but for your sister this is the maddest thing in the world william travis made a regular mull with his wifes fortune and depend on it the young man has next to nothing and would come to beggary if he offended his uncle there is nothing for it but for them to give one another up  i do not think there is much chance of their doing so replied felix  not as they are now in the height and fury of the thing but you are a sensible lad felix you will do your best to show them the utter folly of the thing  we do not know whether ferdinand can afford it yet said felix  dont delude yourself with fancying alfred travis will swallow this not he why hes set on that young spanish don making a great match hardly thought my marys hundred thousand good enough  very likely he will refuse consent returned felix but in the meantime i see nothing to be done but for alda to go home with me and wait  to very little purpose ejaculated mr underwood except that maybe a taste of your way of life may bring her to her senses and serve her right i must say he added it is hard that both this boy and girl should be thrown back on your hands for no fault of yours i wish i could help it but you see there wouldnt be a moments peace if alda stayed here without giving him up  it is not fit that she should said felix  i like the girl too indeed shes almost like my own continued mr underwood the house will be dull without her and i believe those pretty young women cant help flirting and think one anothers beaux fair game eh well well send for her and put it to herwill she give up travis and stay here or hold him to it and go home with you  felix could make no objection though he had no question what the decision would be so the bell was rung alda was summoned and soon appeared with burning cheeks and moist eyes  now alda said her adopted uncle your brother and i have talked it over and i am ready to overlook what has gone bythat is if your aunt willand to let all be as it was before on this one condition that you break off this foolish concern listen to me you will find that he has little enough to call his own and his uncle can cut off his allowance any day it is mere insanity to think he will consent to such a match as you would be and you would be doing the best thing for the young man and yourself to tell him it is all nonsense and youve thought better of it  o uncle i couldnt do that  if notyou have the choicei cant abet what travis never intended your aunt couldnt stand it either theres nothing for it but that you should leave this house choose between us and him  that cant help being done uncle said alda with streaming eyes and a choked voice you have been very good to me but he must come first and she moved towards felix who put his arm round her kindly and kissed her saying  then alda i will leave you to prepare i must go and see the children and edgar i will come back for you in time for the half past five train  aldas tears flowed too fast again for words and she turned to leave the room  i shall see you again said mr underwood can i give you a lift anywhere felix  no thank you sir travis is waiting for me  ay ay very fine with his thoroughbred but when his allowance is docked how is he to live on his pay  the brougham had long been waiting for tom underwood and he left them together alda hung on her brother o felix is it not dreadful  i thought him very kind and forgiving said felix  is that what you call forgiving and oh if you could hear aunt mary you little think what i have gone through  it will be over soon said felix kindly you are going home you know and wilmet is wild to have you  but felix you dont think they mean to do more than frighten me ferdinand must have a real right to his own fathers money and besides he cant properly object to me uncle tom promised me my 5000 pounds whatever happened  i cannot stay to discuss that now alda said felix i have a great deal to do and fernan is waiting for me i shall come back in time  oh i wish i could come with you now dear fernan tell him i have borne it all for his sake but it is such an age since i saw him  no doubt he will meet us at the station said felix escaping at last and finding ferdinand not many yards off in the road outside  well fernan to brompton if you please mr underwood is really much kinder than i expected but as things stand you cant carry it on in their house so alda comes home with me tonight  then the dear girl is really banished for my sake i mean no place is like bexley to me but it is very noble of her exclaimed ferdinand curiously divided between regard for felix and sense of aldas sacrifice  it is the proper place in which for her to wait for your uncles answer said felix but indeed fernan it is a question whether we ought to let you risk all your prospects  ferdinands vehement demand what felix took him for and equally eager protest that his uncle must know he had no right to withhold the means that were in all equity due to him lasted through all the brief transit to the farther end of brompton where a great old house and grounds once quite in the country had been adapted and revivified by miss fulmort  might i not come in and see the little girls asked ferdinand wistfully  i should rather suppose not said felix smiling lifeguardsmen are not exactly the visitors expected in establishments for young ladies you had better not wait for me i cannot give the children less than an hour  i would wait if it were ten hours  but how about your horse he isnt in love  ferdinand would not however be denied and when at length a rendezvous was agreed on felix free of the dashing equipage of which he was to tell the truth slightly ashamed rang at the gates arrived at the house door announced himself as mr underwood asked to see his sisters and after a long labyrinth of matted passages found himself in a pretty countrified room where a wiry elderly sensible lady with grey hair and a keen face gave him a friendly reception drew a favourable but not enthusiastic picture of robinas steadiness and industry and said that angela was a more difficult character by this time robina came into the room with her hat on eagerly but with her face flushed and her eyes rather frightened and as she received her brothers kiss she said the little ones are not come in yetmay i take my brother into the garden miss fennimore  permission was given and robina held his hand with an unusually tight grasp as she led him to the wide square walled garden with a broad gravelwalk around an oldfashioned bowlinggreen he thought the round face looked anxious and perplexed and was rather uneasy as he began by saying i hope not to lose angel do you always walk so early in the day  on herr mullers days because he only comes in the afternoon said robina but i am rather glad i wanted to speak to you felix  is anything wrong said felix seeing that the childs face had become crimson and hearing effort in her voice you are happy here dont be afraid to tell me anything my dear remember there is no one so bound to watch over you  i know said robina looking up into those kind eyes i want to tell you but she panted and he encouraged her by putting his other hand over hers caressingly edgar comes every sunday came out at last  and what of that isnt it a pleasure  itit would bebut he and alice ought not to send each other notes and messages  what very low  indeed they do and i cant tell what to do  what sort of notes and messages asked felix in a half reproving voice as though he thought the solemnity of thirteen was taking alarm needlessly  o felix love notes half whispered the girl hanging her burning head  nonsense child you have misunderstood some joke  no said robina looking full in his face with sturdy offended dignity they both were in earnest when they told me about it  about what said he still severely as he sat down on a bench unheeding february damp  about she was not far from tears as she faltered out their engagement  theirs he wrung the hand that he still retained edgar and  and alice knevett said robin i would not promise not to tell i hope it is not treachery  how long asked felix hoarsely  ever since the holidays they used to walk together when miss pearson thought she was with us but none of us ever knew it then  you are certain remember this is a graver matter than perhaps you understand  i think i do understand and it is that which makes me so unhappy but indeed it cant be fancy i have seen her ring emerald and amethyst for edgar and alice and the locket with their hairs twisted together the very first sunday we were here he gave me a note for her and when i told him it was not allowed he tried quizzing me at first and at last told me i was a silly child who did not know what was proper between engaged people so i said continued robina with dignity that i could allow much to be proper in that case but i wanted to know whether this was only kept from me because i was a baby and was known to you and the grownup people  right robin muttered felix feeling that she needed encouragement  then he laughed at me more than ever about expecting things to be proclaimed on the marketcross and tried to puzzle me out of my senses till i could only stick to one thing that i couldnt take his notes unless somebody knew and after all i found the thing in my jacket pocket he must have put it in when i was not looking  and what did you do with it  oh the dreadful thing i felt as if it would bite me all the week long but i didnt think it would be honourable to tear it or burn it and i kept it luckily alice didnt ask if i had a note only whether he had said anything and when she found i knew she told me all about it and said all sorts of things about my being unkind and mean to stand out but i never promised to keep the secret  are you still keeping this note  no i gave it back to edgar on sunday and told him to play no such tricks i thought he would have been in a rage but he wasoh so provoking just as if he didnt care for a little spite in a naughty child  then is this intercourse checked  no thats the worst of it when i would not they took to angel you know she got very fond of edgar in the winter and was always running after him and waiting on him so she did what he told her quite innocently at first till i found out what was going on and tried to stop her but she doesnt care for me as she does for edgar and thinks it grand to be in all their secrets when i am too cross and then theres a class that goes to the south kensington museum and alice is one of them and edgar is about there im sure miss fulmort ought not to be deceived as they are doing its all nonsense about schoolmistresses being designed by nature to be hoodwinked it makes me so miserable i dont know what to do and when i heard you were come it was as if you had been sent on purpose to help me  poor child said felix with a heavy sigh you have kept this all to yourself  i could not tell any one i could have told miss lyveson because she is ones friend but it would only be being a telltale and informer here and ones own brother too and i could not write for they look over all the letters that are not to fathers and mothers  they must make an exception for me said felix in an indignant tone  i knew you would say so o felix tell them so i do feel like having papa now i have you  if you only had sighed felix my poor bob it is a grievous business but you have been very upright and considerate as far as i can see  im so glad you dont want me to have told she said with a sigh of relief as unlike his as that of one who throws off a burden is to that of him who takes it up  not if it can be helped it would be a mischievous and cruel exposure and would be hard on one who has been led into it he said with breaks and pauses half for breath half for considering it is most reckless most unjustifiable in edgar he knit his brows so that she gazed at him in awe and wonder as having something in his countenance that she did not comprehend then after a silence he said robin i will speak to edgar and if you do not find that this is stopped after one communication which of course there must be write to me these ladies must make an exception in favour of such as we are  o felix it is so nice to hold you and feel you only i wish i had not had to grieve you so much  dishonourable conduct is not what i was prepared for he said setting his teeth  and will you speak to angel i hear them coming in said robina  yes let me have her alone at first come back in ten minutes time  he was still sitting on the bench with his elbows on his knees and his hands over his brow when angela came towards him she was of the same longlimbed make as clement was nearly as tall as the square sturdy robina nearly three years older and had clements small almost baby mould of features relieved only by such arch deep blue eyes as shone in edgars face she looked such a mere child that when her step and exclamation caused felix to raise his head it seemed absurd to imagine her to be knowingly engaged as gobetween in a clandestine correspondence and with a sort of pity and compunction for the blame he had intended he held out his arms to her  o felix how cold you are your face is like marble now if i was to sit there in this weather wouldnt they be at me like wild cats  thus reminded felix rose and certainly shivered after the exercise of his privilege are you happy here angel he asked in a constrained tone  yes it is jollier than miss pearsons there are more girls and we do have such fun  i hope you are good and steady and very careful of all the rules  angela fidgeted as if she didnt like the style of the conversation  you know he continued there may be rules that you may not see the use of but that must be obeyed for all that  what a tiresome dry old blunderbore you are broke out angela with illassured sauciness this isnt the way edgar goes on when he comes to see us  felix could not check a sort of groan or grunt and angela whose pertness was defensive quailed a little she had driven him out of the due sequence of his discourse but he resumed it angel i must tell you if anybody asks you to break rulesby giving lettersyou must not  angela kicked pebbles about  have you ever been asked to do so  she hung her head and a pout came over her face  angel he said in a voice from the sadness of his heart i will not ask any questions in case you have made promises not to betray secrets but you must never make such promises again tell me you will never dothis thing again  she was silent  angela he said reprovingly  i dont know why i should promise you more than edgar broke out angela petulantly he is my brother too and he isnt cross and i love him and will keep his secret  between this flat defiance of his authority and his scruple about interfering with the childs sense of honour felix was in no slight perplexity even as to this interview with his little sister his disclaimer came first i ask about no ones secret he said but angel i must have you understand this if you break the rules that forbid the giving of notes from any person outside the school it will be doing more harm than you can understand i shall put a stop to it at once and most likely you will be sent away in disgrace  she was somewhat awed but she did not speak  whatever any one may say to you said felix recollect that it is dishonesty and treachery to do anything underhand and the greatest possible mischief to those you wish to be kind to dont you see it is no kindness to help any one to do wrong  she began to cry they dont want to do wrong it is very nasty and mean of bobbie to have told  you will know some day how good and trustworthy it is in bobbie said her elder brother you cannot understand the rights and wrongs in such a manner as this at your age angel to tell the child this was a mistake if he had but known it you must be satisfied with knowing that whatever breaks rules and must be kept secret is necessarily disobedient and deceitful and may have terrible consequences do you believe me then give me your word to have no more to do with it  she muttered something among her tears like i wont and felix was satisfied for the exaction of promises had necessarily been the chief mode of government with the two youthful pillars of the house who spent so much time apart from their dominions and it was almost unprecedented that such a promise was not observed  robina was lingering near and as they joined her felix found that his time was up he was taken back to the drawingroom where he found himself in presence of the lady he had seen and of a much younger smaller person with a slight cast in her eye and a peculiar jerking manner such as he could well believe would frighten away a young girls confidence when he made his request for free correspondence from his little sisters there was no demur only miss fulmort said half vexed it ought to have been mentioned before she did not know why the children had not told her and then she made a point of ascertaining felixs individual address for she said a great deal of undesirable stuff may be scribbled to brothers and sisters  felix possessed no card unless such might be reckoned the announcement of photographs and stationery etc which was wont to be put up with parcels for strangers and when he tried to write mr f c underwood the shivering chill so affected his fingers that he could hardly guide the pencil he took leave and soon found the assiduous ferdinand who presently asked shyly what the little ones thought of it  felix bethought himself really fernan it was put out of my head and moreover perhaps it had better not be known more widely than needful  you do not doubt  all the ground that had been gone over before was argued out once again by the eager mexican before they reached the national gallery the appointed place of meeting with edgar he was not within but without and throwing away his cigar hailed them as fernan drew up his horse  at last the storm must have been pitiless to judge by the effects you are blue with cold felix  ferdinand thank you said felix getting out i am sorry but i must have edgar alone a little while  look here travis said edgar seeing his blank look well give you the honour of giving us a spread you go on and order it at s and ill walk this fellow there curry soup that will astonish him and warm the cockles of his heart mind  ferdinand nodded and drove off perfectly satisfied with this compensation  lets see if we can walk a little life into you said edgar taking his brothers arm bless thy five wits toms a cold was it madame i always thought she could not be many generations from billingsgate  i have been to brompton  that tragical hoarseness would lead me to conclude something eh has that robin been chirping out her fancies and do you mean to say that you are struck all of a heap by the awful discovery of a boardingschool mystery  it is naturally distressing to find you acting such a part  then i am afraid you have a good deal to go through in the course of your life if every little flirtation on the part of your geschwister is to produce this effect there wont be much left of you by the time it comes to stella  what meaning do you attach to the words little flirtation  when the head of the family puts the question in that solemn tone how is it to be answered bless me blunderbore such a countenance can only proceed from being smitten yourself to be sure when there was only one girl you ever spoke to it was no wonder poor old fellow id never have poached on your manor but how was i to imagine a pillar of the house giving way to such levities  this is mere bravado edgar was the grave answer in a tone not disconcerted but full of repression and with a pale but steady countenance gloss it over as you will a correspondence such as you have begun is unjustifiable it risks damaging for ever the prospects at once not only ofof the objectbut those of your little sisters  o felicissimo mio how green a spot is bexley as though secrets and mysteries were not the elixir of life to the boardingschool  have you ever considered what a discovery must involve  i need not it seems since you had not the sense to box that childs ears for a meddlesome telltale did the scene equal madames performance  you do not imagine that i mentioned it  oh the revered prop of the state soars so far above my head that i did not know what he might regard as his duty  you shall know it now edgar there are two choices if you are really engaged to this young lady edgar made a nod of impatient scornful acquiescence but certainly of acquiescence then ask her honourably from her friends and let whatever you do be open otherwise give it up as an impossible imprudence but drop all attempt at what is clandestine unless you do one or other of these i warn you that i shall speak to miss pearson  if you were a reasonable and experienced paterfamilias instead of only a poor conscientious overharassed prig of a boy with more brothers and sisters than he knows what to do with ill tell you in candid unprejudice what you would do just let it alone there are as many of such little affairs going as there are midges in a sunbeam and they never do any one any harm unless the higher powers make an unadvised hubbub  am i to understand that as an avowal that you know yourself to be trifling  i know nothing about it i dont live in the heroics like some of my friends in the rural seclusion of bexley i saw a pretty lively girl who not to put too fine a point upon it made quite as much up to the romantic young artist as ever the young artist did to her of course there was an exchange of prettinesses and life on either side became a blank when she was immured at brompton and the only solace left was the notes that so outrage your and bobbies united sense of propriety  and what is to follow  is it to lead to he corrected with a mimicry of wilmets tone that depends if you make the explosion i shall have to rise to the occasionkeep the slipknot ready and patent and as soon as i get my head above water have a wife and family on my back to keep me down and hinder me from coming to your rescue if notwhy it will take its chance and we shall have a reasonable chance of trying whether we get tired of one anotherthe best thing that could happen to us by the bythough she is such a saucy little darling that were that picture of mine painted i should be fool enough to marry her tomorrow  and whymay i askseeing these things so clearly did you draw the poor child into an engagement  edgar shrugged his shoulders you had better ask why she drew me if you didnt know it before my dear felix tis human natur to be fools  allowing it to be folly you do not mean to persist  as if a poor fellow must always have a meaning life is not worth having if one is to be always so awfully in earnest  i have the misfortune to be in earnest said felix with the formality of one past patience but resolved to keep his temper in hand when i warn you that if i find that this intercourse is continued unless you choose to ask her properly of her father it will be my duty to let miss pearson know  so be it was the answer in a tone of half mocking half compassionate submission that was more provoking than all except for the sudden change to the gay kindliness that followed as edgar threw aside his own affairs to laugh over ferdinand traviss honest simplicity of adoration of alda and all her household declaring that it had been as much for his delight as to be rid of him that he himself had devised that commission of the luncheon what a spread it will be edgar chuckled to himself and how it will be thrown away on the present company not that there ever was a man who wanted it more he added as he saw how white his brothers face was youve been and got a chill  felix did not deny it and if his unsophisticated palate did not appreciate all that ferdinand had ordered on the principle that nothing could be too good for him either in his individual capacity or as aldas brother he at least submitted to what his two companions required of him in the way of hot soup and even of one glass of wine before he grew restive and insisted on carrying the head that their solicitude had succeeded in rendering heated and flushed to burning pitch to do the business in the city that always sprang up whenever any one had to go to town  edgar bade him adieu and the faithful ferdinand drove him wherever he had to go and finally to kensington palace gardens where he was ushered into the drawingroom to find marilda resolved upon unconsciousness but only succeeding in a kind of obstreperous cordiality and good will which together with the hot room made him quite dizzy and his answers were so much at random that he sent fulbert to an examination at cambridge and clement prospecting in australia neither mr nor mrs underwood made their appearance but when felix spoke of getting a cab marilda said the carriage was ordered then alda was explicit about the boxes that were to follow but on the whole she was behaving very prettily and unobtrusively marilda kissed her warmly and detained felix a moment to say this will blow over and then she will come back unless things have settled themselves better if i can do any good write to me  so alda quitted her adopted home but the change might be lightened to her by being handed out of the carriage at the station by a militarylooking figure who announced that he wanted to see a fellow at aldershot and meant to dine there it was not his fault that he got out at farnborough     chapter xvi  the winter of discontent    peace brother be not exquisite  to cast the fashion of uncertain evils  for grant they be so while they rest unknown  what need a man forestall his date of grief                                            milton   wilmet was so devoted to alda and her hopes and fears that she let felix escape with less reproof than usual for the cold that sat heavily upon him after the last days chill he did not give way to it there might have been some temptation to sit over the fire if geraldine had been alone there but alda when wilmet was out of reach engrossed cherrys ears with descriptions of her feelings and cravings for sympathy in her suspense treating every other subject as futile and the interruption of the childrens lessons as an insult no one might talk of anybody but ferdinand and cherry did not wonder that felix looked wearied and harassed and always betrayed some anxiety to come first into possession of the morning post one day nearly a fortnight after his visit to london he called wilmet away from the breakfast table into the sittingroom wilmet he said i must go and see miss pearson before school hours  you is there anything the matter with alice asked wilmet startled at his tone  had theyhad youany notion of anything between her and edgar  no miss pearson has taken to saying my dear your brothers are quite grown into young men and i thought she did not like the play  ah that play it threw them together  is it really so i suppose nothing is too foolish and provoking for edgar  the fact of admiration is not wonderful said felix rather in a tone of defence but the worst of it is that he has been trying to communicate with her through those poor girls at school  wilmets horror was surpassing and when she found that he had known it all this fortnight she was so indignant that to his reply that it was not fair to leave both parties the chance of acting honourably she replied with scorn for his weakness in expecting anything from edgar and exposing the children to the chance of expulsion which might be a lasting blight such as merely in thought put her into a perfect agony nevertheless angry and excited as she was she flew at him when he gave her the letters and was off to miss pearsonsgo there without breakfast in the sleet sitting and still with that bad cold not half gone and she dragged him back reluctantly to the other room where ignominiously ordering off bernard and stella to finish their stirabout elsewhere she insisted on his breakfasting while she told the story she was far too loyal to blame him except teteatete but she burst on him now and then  you are not eating felix  a cup of tea then please cherry no one can swallow stirabout in hot haste but wilmet herself he spoke goodhumouredly but with a force upon himself that cherry detected and she further saw that he took nothing but that one cup and a fragment of bread and then hurried off saying that he must catch miss pearson for the little girls sake  the letters he had left were robinas and another enfolding it containing these words   dear siraccording to my promise i have refrained from opening this letter though i own that the discovery of the purpose for which free correspondence was asked has been no small amazement to me in the first shock i will not trust myself to say more until after consultation with my brother but you shall hear from me again respecting your sistersi remain your obedient servant                                                     r m fulmort   the letter within was   my dear felixit has all come out there is a dreadful uproar and nobody will believe me if only miss lyveson was here this was the way edgar came yesterday and took us for a long walk in kensington gardens and afterwards i saw angela going towards alice knevetts room and as we are not allowed to run into other peoples bedrooms i stopped her and put her in mind of what you said but she began to cry and struggle with me and alice came out and made a fuss to get the note angel had for her till i got into a passion and spoke so loud that miss fennimore came out upon us angel did not know what she was about by that time and cried saying that i was unkind and was hurting her and alice took her part accusing me of tyrannising and being jealous so that i faced round and told all on the spot miss fennimore took us all straight down to miss fulmort and it was a dreadful business they are frightfully angry with us all and me the most for having told you instead of them they cannot understand the difference between you and any common brother they think i have not told the whole truth and it is very hard nobody ever distrusted me before we are just living on sufferance till mr fulmort comes to see about it and then i think we shall be sent away i hope so for i know my own dear miss lyveson will believe me and take me back to justice and confidence here the girls are as angry with me for telling as the ladies are for not telling they have no idea of such loyalty and love as we had at catsacre there is a report that miss pearson has been sent for if we are sent home with her it will be a horrid shame and injustice but i shall not be able to be sorry one bit for i know you will stand by medear dear brother felix your affectionate sister                                bobbie   when the three sisters had made out all that could be understood geraldine owned herself less amazed than wilmet and alda laughed at both for not being aware that edgar was a universal flirt all that surprised her was his having let it proceed to such dangerous extremities but of course that was the girls own faulthe would give it up when it came to the point  why should you expect edgar to be more inconstant than ferdinand asked cherry  both twins turned on her and told her she was a child and knew nothing about ittheir favourite way of annihilating her and then alda in her excitement walked with wilmet to the school leaving cherry as usual to wash up the breakfast things she felt a conviction that all this accounted for the weary oppressed look broken by occasional starts of vivacity which ever since felixs day in london had been laid to the score of the cold he had brought home  she was glad she was still alone when felix looked in for a moment to say miss maria goes up by the 1130 train i am going to send a letter by her and i think she will save robin angel is so mere a child that it matters less  how can they all be so unjust  they have not had time to know the child  i did not mean robina but you  i dont mind that he said with a smile though i am glad there is one lady who does not scold me and he bent down to kiss her  did the miss pearsons  they allowed that i meant to act for the best and you know what that means however he added they are earnest to save the little girls which is more to the purpose wilmet or i would have gone up but miss maria thinks she can do better than either and i believe they are more likely to trust an old schoolmistress who is the injured party besides i must write my letter shall i help you into the other room  no thank you i have the lessons here for they tease alda if you would only send theodore to me as you go  does alda never help you  only by criticising my french pronunciation she is much too restless o felix what a cough you have made your throat worse  it is only this black east wind  you ought to stay upstairs and be taken care of cant you and let redstone call if you are wanted  i am wanted it is quite as warm in the office as here when the door is shut what i want is only to be twenty years older good bye  cherrys ponderings were divided between that sigh and the possible sighs of the wind if that door were not shut until her own door was opened by felixs hand to admit a little figure still in petticoats with the loose flaxen curls tottering feet limp white fingers and vacant blue eyes whom she daily put through a few exercises to train his almost useless fingers and tongue the sight of this alda declared made her ill though the little boy was as docile as he was helpless but it was quite true that to nerves and ears not inured from the first theodores humming and his concertina were a trial from their perpetuity  late that evening came a message to beg mr and miss underwood would step up and they stepped though the east wind was blacker than ever they found that in great tribulation miss maria had brought alice knevett home and sent her to bed all tears and exhaustion but that robina and angela were forgivena word so offensive to felix as relating to the former that he sorely lamented that prudence forbade their removal but was somewhat consoled by a letter that miss maria brought him from the vicar of st matthews who had had a private investigation of the whole subject he wrote to felix that his sister was new to the management of the girls and was a good deal annoyed at the secrecy observed towards herself not making full allowance for robinas exceptional circumstances but that for his own part he was convinced of the girls genuine uprightness and unselfish forbearance and though he feared her position must be unpleasant just now he thought it would be for the good of all if she had the patience to live it down and earn the good opinion he was sure she deserved miss maria reported that miss fennimore had been brought round by his opinion though miss fulmort remained persuaded that robina had come over him in some way and while yielding to his stringent desire that as he said one of the worthiest of her girls should not be unjustly expelled only let the child herself know that she was tolerated in consideration of her youth her orphanhood and her relationship to clement poor robin no one could help grieving for the tempest that had fallen on her guiltless head and hope that all would result in her final good but the sorrows of an absent schoolgirl could hardly occupy even her dearest friends in the full and present crisis of two love affairs  for edgar and major knevett both arrived the lover as dispassionate as the father was the reverse edgar did however as he had undertaken rise to the position he joked at it a little in private to the annoyance and perplexity of cherry and even of felix but he was perfectly steady in maintaining his perfect right to address miss knevett in avowing his engagement and in standing by it  to major knevett the affair appeared outrageous impudence on the part of a beggarly young painter out of a country booksellers shop encouraged by the egregious folly of the aunts what was said of clergymans sons and good old family went for absolutely nothing and edgars quiet assurance of success in his profession was scoffed at with incredulity not altogether unpardonable in the encounter that felix had the misfortune to witness since it took place in his own officeparlour he could not help thinking that edgar with his perfect temper unfailing courtesy calm selfrespect and steady sense of honour towards the young lady showed himself the true gentleman in contrast with the swaggering little major who seemed to expect that he could bluster the young man out of his presumption and was quite unprepared for edgars cool analysis of his threats but instead of like tom underwood cooling down into moderation and kindness so soon as his bolt was shot the finding it fall short only chafed him the more and rendered him the more inveterate against all conciliation  there was an appeal all round to felix but he was not so practicable as the universal compliments to his good sense showed to be expected he had expressed his opinion that it was a rash engagement hitherto improperly carried on but he could not be brought to advise his brother to break it off on his side while the lady held to it on hers it might be best to give it up by mutual consent but as long as one party was bound so was the other and he thoroughly sided with edgar in not being threatened out of it whilst alice persisted still more flatly did he refuse miss pearsons entreaty that he would see the wilful girl and persuade her how hopeless was her resistance and how little prospect of the attachment being prosperous nothing but despair and perplexity could have prompted the good aunts to try such a resource but they were at their wits end they really loved their niece and they dreaded the tender mercies of her father who had indeed petted alice as a young child but had made her mother suffer greatly from his temper if she would yield they hoped to procure for her a home at york with their brothers widow and to save her from a residence in jersey with the stepmother but alice upheld by a secret commerce of notes ingeniously conveyed felt herself a heroine of constancy and kept up her spirits by little irritations to whoever tried to deal with her she could deftly insinuate on the one hand that her aunts had always preached up the underwood perfections and on the other hint to her father that if her home had still remained what it was she should never have looked out of it and whenever he flew into a rage or used violent language she would look up under her eyelids and whisper something about real gentlemen those thorns and claws that had figured in the scale of her transmigration were giving a good many little scratches which did her feelings some good but her cause none at all by the vexation they produced if she could only be made to understand said poor miss pearson how little she gains by irritating her father and that he is really a very dreadful person when he is thoroughly offended poor child my heart aches for her  so wilmet was turned in upon her and before she could utter a word was hugged and kissed all over because she was the very image of darling edgar and his dear violet eyes were exactly the same colour  unsentimental wilmet extricated herself saying eyes cant be violet coloured dont let us go into that silly talk alice things are too serious now  you are come to help me and be a dear cried alice clasping her hands how does he look the dear boy  the same as usual said wilmet coolly but alice if you think that i am come to  does hereally and truly i saw him out of the little passage window and i thought he looked quite thin and lizzie bruce said mrs hartley asked who that handsome young man was who looked so delicate  he is particularly strong and healthy alice i want to set it all before you as a reasonable being  only do tell me has he got his appetite for you know he is used to live where everything is recherche and when ones out of spirits things do make a difference  was that the claw in the velvet paw  he eats three times as much as felix any day said wilmet with a certain remembrance of the startling nudity of the bone of yesterdays leg of mutton he is doing very well you need not be afraid for him but it seems to me that you should consider whether it can be right  come wilmet you were my first friend you cant help being kind to me  i want to show you true kindness  true kindness means something horridly cross now dont wilmet i get ever so much kindness as it is i know what you are going to say it is very naughty of people to like each other when neither of them has got a sixpence but if they cant help it what then must they leave off liking eh  they ought to try to prevent their liking from leading to disobedience and concealment  ah but if they cant  people always can  were you ever tried asked alice slyly for all the simplicity  i hope never to be if deceiving my friends and making others deceive is to be the consequence  well luckily there isnt much chance crept out of the demure lips it was intended as the thorn beneath the mayflower but it was no such thing wilmet was quite ready to accept the improbability as very fortunate  that has nothing to do with it she said the question is what it is right to do now it seems hard for me to say so being your friend and his sister  oh never mind that peoples sisters never do like the girls they are fond of  decidedly wilmet could not get on her mouth was stopped either by a little rapture about edgar or a little velvetpawed scratch to herself whenever she tried in earnest to set the matter before alice and when being a determined person she at last talked on through all that alice tried to thrust in and delivered her mind of the remonstrance she had carefully thought over and balanced between kindness prudence and duty and all the time with the conviction that not one word was heeded if it was not english malice it was french malice that pointed the replies and sent wilmet away as much provoked as pitying and not at all inclined to be examined by edgar on her interview and let him gather that she had not had the best of it poor alice what were these little triumphs of a sharp tongue in comparison with the harm she did herself by exacerbating whoever tried to argue with her there was one person she did profess to wish to see namely geraldine but the flying rheumatic pains excited by the black east wind with sleet upon its blast could not be trifled with and major knevetts wrath put an effectual stop to alices entering the house during the saturday and sunday of his stay at bexley perhaps cherry was not sorry she could not have pleaded against edgar in spite of her disapprobation of both and moreover the thought at the bottom of her heart was how could any one who had been the object of such tones of the one brothers voice be won by the showy graces of the other edgar could easily have thrown off a disappointment but felix came firstand oh can he shake it off in the same light way  she had not the comfort of talking it over felix made no sign and edgars line was to treat the whole complication as a matter of pleasantry pretending that he had only gone into it to please felix and yet as came to their knowledge privately exchanging billets and catchwords with alice while he openly declared his engagement and resolution to work his way up and lay his laurels at her feet  he went away the very same morning as major knevett carried off his daughter to jersey audaciously following them to the station where he exchanged a grasp of the hand with her in the very sight of the grey tyrant father who actually gnashed his teeth in his inability either to knock him down or give him in charge  there was no time to breathe between the departure of this pair of lovers and the arrival of aldas splendid life guardsman who horses and all took up his abode at the fortinbras arms and spent his days in felicity with alda a very demonstrative pair they were to geraldine often unwillingly en tiers they seemed to spend their time chiefly in sitting hand in hand playing with one anothers rings and dangles of which each seemed to possess an inexhaustible variety ferdinands dressingcase and its contents were exquisite in their way and were something between an amusement and a horror to wilmet who could not understand felixs regard for so extravagant and wasteful a person who gave away sovereigns where halfcrowns would have been more wholesome halfcrowns instead of shillings shillings instead of pence and who moreover was devoted to horse flesh his own favourite steed brown murad had been secured at a fabulous price and the possession of him seemed to be the crowning triumph over a certain millionaire baronet in the same corps evidently his rival what was even more alarming was that every detail about races and horses in training was at his fingers ends so that he put felix up to a good deal of knowledge useful to the racing articles in the pursuivant but he declared that he never betted his was a perilous position homeless and friendless as he stood and this rendered him doubly grateful for the brotherly welcome he received yet the days would have been long to any but lovers in spite of the rides and walks one even to minsterham to see lance ferdinand liked to recur to the old remembrances of his convalescence but in these alda had no part and they seemed to jar on her she might sometimes seem half fretted by his impetuous southern love but she could not bear a particle of his attention to be bestowed on aught save herself and when geraldine would have utilised his fine straight profile as an artistic study the monopoly was so unpleasing that the portrait had to be dropped the odd thing was that alda should have a lover whose most congenial spirit was clement he was a great frequenter of st matthews and had no interest save in kindred subjects felix always found them alike difficult to converse with from a want of any breadth of sympathy with subjects past or present such as would have occupied him even without the exigencies of his profession they seemed to talk not church but shop as if they did not look beyond proximate ecclesiastical details which they discussed in technical terms startling to the uninitiated and yet felix trusted that clements soul was a good deal deeper and wider than his tongue and that ferdinands if narrow was thoroughly resolute finding in his enthusiasm for these details a counterpoise for the temptations of his position  his seemed to be a nature that would alternate between apathetic indolence and strong craving for excitement he could go on for days with a patient almost silent round of mechanical occupations performed well nigh in his sleep and then when once stirred up became possessed with a vehement restlessness as if there were still a little about him of the panther of the wilderness  at first he awaited his letter from his uncle much more philosophically than did alda but when it tarried still he became so eager that he made two journeys to london to meet the mail and pestered every one with calculations as to time and space  the letter came and was all that every one else had expected alfred travis had always detested the family into which his nephew had been thrown by his accident and the tidings that the heiress had been rejected for the sake of one of these designing girls could not be welcome so he gave notice that nothing more could be expected from him if his nephew stooped thus low this however did not much concern ferdinand he curled his black moustache and quietly said his uncle would not find that game answer the affairs of the brothers had always been mixed together and ferdinand had been content to leave the whole in his uncles hands only drawing for his own handsome allowance but the foundation had been his mothers fortune and he had only to claim his own share of the capital and disentangle it from the rest either to bring his uncle to terms at once or to be able to dispense with his consent the delay was vexatious but it could be but brief and in the meantime bexley was felicity yes in spite of the warning he received at the rectory which my lady followed up by a remonstrance to felixover the counter for in vain he tried to get her into the office he could only tell her that he much regretted edgars conduct but as to alda there was no disobedience and the young mans character was high he was just as impracticably courteous as his father and lady price shrugged her shoulders and hoped for felix underwood she said i am convinced that after all you are a very wellmeaning young man  this was her farewell for mr bevan had been more ailing than usual and had obtained permission to leave his parish for a year to be spent partly in the south of france partly at the german baths  well was it for those who could get away never had the spring been sourer easter came so early as itself to seem untimely and the wednesday of its week was bleakness itself as lance and robina stood on the top of the viaduct over the railway looking over the parapet at the long perspective of rails and electric wires their faces screwed up and reddened in unnatural places by the bitter blast felix had asked at breakfast if any one would be the bearer of a note to marshlands lance had not very willingly volunteered because no one else would then robina joined him and they had proceeded through the town without a syllable from either of the usually lively tongues till as they stood from force of habit watching for a train the following colloquy took place robina being the first speaker  what is it  what is what  what is the matter  what is the matter with what  with it all  there came a laugh but robina returned to the charge well but what is it is it east wind  something detestablewhatever it is grunted lance  youve found it so too said robina for lance had only come home after evening cathedral the day before  havent i though  he said no more being a boy of much reserve as to his private troubles and robina presently said  i say lance did alda use to be nice or is it love  never nice like wilmet or cherry  i am sure proceeded the girl i thought love was the most beautiful and romantic thingtoo nice to be talked about for fear it should turn ones head but here it seems to be really nothing but plague and bother and crossness  poor bob said lance you got the worst of it up at brompton  i got it every way said robina there was edgar treating me like a little contemptible baby and alice sometimes coaxing me and sometimes spiting me and angel poisoned against me and when i thought i must be acting for the best in telling felix somehow that turned out altogether horrid  i suppose a girl must be telling some one said lance and if it was to be done felix was the right one  so i made sure said poor robin but miss fulmort and miss fennimore seemed to think it no better than if i had told you they say i am forgiven but i hate their forgiveness ive done nothing wrong and yet they dont like or trust me and they seem to grudge me all my marks and prizes for proficiency not for conduct they say in that hard cold voice and then the girls nod and whisper angel and all think me a nasty spiteful marplot alice set half of them against me before she went  poor bob and you cant have a good set to and punch their heads all round thats the way to have it out and get comfortable and friendly  for choir boys o lance  choir boys aint girls i thank my stars  well continued robina glad to pour out her troubles even for such counsel as this when i came home last week i did think it would be made up  well said lance as robin grew rather choky and drew the back of a woolly glove across her eyes not much to their benefit  clem looks black because he says his sisters were meant to raise the tone of the school  confound the tone of the school i know what that is but who cares for tina  then wilmet says i ought to have asked leave to write to her and she could have managed it quietly and kept everybody out of a scrape  whewww whistled lance but at the melancholy tone he absolutely took his red hand out of its comfortable nest in his pocket to draw his sisters arm into his it was well for her voice was far more trembling now i could bear it all if it were not for felix himself i know he is angry with me but he wont talk nor tell me how he only said we both meant to act for the best but it is a painful affair and we had better not discuss it and then he began to whistle to theodore if any one did know how i hate being told i meant to act for the best  something is come over felix said lance i never knew him give such a jaw as he has to me to be sure he was set on to it  set on  yes by wilmet for one you should have seen the way she was inas if i hadnt a right to do what i please with my own money  what  my violin ferdinand travis tipped me when he rode over to the cathedral and by good luck it was the day before the auction at old spicers bill and i went in to see the fun and by all that is lucky there was a violin routed out of an old cupboard nobody bid against me but godwin the broker and it was knocked down to me for twentytwo and six bill lent me the halfcrown and poulter our lay vicar who is at a musicshop says tis a real bargain hes mad to have missed it himself but he showed me how to put my fingers on it and i can play mendelssohns hirtenlied you shall hear by and by robin well wilmet comes on it when she was unpacking my shirts im sure i wish shed let me unpack them myself instead of poking her nose there and if she wasnt in a way wasting my money when i ought to be saving it up to buy a watch and wasting my time and all the rest of ittill one would think twas old scratch himself id brought home  oh dont lance and did she set on felix  ay and then you know our new precentor beccles isnt one quarter the man nixon was and he has been and written a letter to fee that any schoolmaster in creation should be licked for writing to go and pison a poor chaps homeall about those cards  what cards  the pack jones found in the middle of the north transept ten days ago  of the cathedral how shocking but why should he write to felix  because the bigwigs make sure some one out of the bailey must have dropped them getting into the town through the cathedral at night  but they dont suspect you  no but beccles got into an awful way and swears  you dont mean really swears  no nostuffvowsthat unless he gets to the bottom of it not one of us shall have the goodconduct prize now i did think i might have had thatthough im not a church candle like tinafor i never was had up for anything and it is precious hard lines such a beauty robin the bishop gives itall the cathedral music bound in red morocco and this beggar hinders us all this very last chance and then he is dirty enough to write and tell felix to get out of me who has been getting out through the cathedral and dropping the cards  do you know  hold your tongue i thought you had a little sense felix had that he saw i could not tell him and said it must be as i pleased about that but then he rowed me as he never did before for wasting time and not mugging for the exhibitionas if that was any use  why shouldnt t you get the exhibition  put that out of your head said lance angrily harewood is sure of that a fellow that construes by naturelooks at a sentence and spots the nominative in a momentmakes versesrale superior iligant articles  but i thought he wasnt always accurate cant you catch him out o lance dont look so fierce i only said so because he cant want the exhibition as much as you he can go to some other school or be paid for  not conveniently said lance they are not at all well off and jack helps them besides i wouldnt get the thing in a sneaking way and besides bill could no more make a mull in construing out of carelessness than i could a false noteits against nature i cant beat him except in arithmetic my birthday comes at such an unlucky time i should get another year if id only been born in july instead of june i might be second for shapcote is only dogged by his father but thats no good for the exhibition and then theres an end of cathedral and all  what should you do then lance  whatever costs least id as lief work my way out to fulbert if this is to go on  oh dont dont do that whatever you do cried robina clinging to his arm  i dont see why not if everybody is to be as savage as a bear when one comes home one always trusted to felix to see sense if nobody else did but what with his jawing one about the exhibition and wilmet about the tin and every spot on ones clothes and alda growling at whatever one does in the parlour im sure i wish id stayed at bexley  the boy and girl had never before been tried by want of sympathy and what seemed to them injustice when they had thus descended into the perturbed atmosphere of what they were used to regard as a happy home there was a long mutual communication of grievancesirritable speechesinattention from their eldersfancies and complaints of aldas enforced peremptorily by wilmetappeals to felix either quashed or unheeded the strange thing was in how short a time so much had managed to go wrong with them except that they added the vexations of the last quarter to the present discomfort real or fancied and though they were both good children each had the strong feeling that there was not as much encouragement as usual to goodness and that it could not have been much worse if they had been seriously to blame one had expected to be caressed for her endurance in a good cause the other had not expected to be severely rebuked for what he scarcely viewed as faults it was the first time this younger half of the family had ever suffered anything approaching to neglect or injustice from their seniors and the moment was perilous the discussion was forming their discontents into a dangerously avowed state if it had the beneficial effect of raising their spirits by force of sympathy at any rate they were in no gloomy mood when they reached the tidy little villa with its beds of open hearted crocuses defying the cold wind and admitting the sun to the utmost depths of their purple and golden bosoms as they laughed their cheery greeting  no less cheerful was the welcome from kind old mrs froggatt who met them at the door master lancelot miss robina this is an unlooked for pleasure to be sure my dear miss robina as the girl gave her hearty embrace  they were the prime favourites next to felix and were the more gladly hailed that mr froggatt was anxious about the business on which they came and had been trying to get leave from his wife to peril his rheumatics by coming in to bexley about it they must stay to luncheon and while mr froggatt went off to answer his note they were made much of over the fire in the way that had of late become so abhorrent to bernard with difficulty avoiding a preluncheon or nooning of cake and wine within an hour of the meal of the day  and how is mr underwood asked mrs froggatt when robina had been divested of her wraps placed close to the fire screened and footstooled and when lance had transferred the big white cat from the armchair to his own knee  oh very well thank you said robina rather surprised that the lengthy catechism on the family health did not as usual start from poor dear miss geraldine  he was looking so thin and had such a cough i was quite concerned when he walked out here on good friday afternoon continued mrs froggatt i hope he is taking care  wilmet is always at him about it said lance  that is right and i hope he minds to keep the officedoor shut it is such a draughty place does he wear flannel do you know my dear  i think so said robina sister constance told wilmet he ought when he had that long cough after the measles  ay you knowyoull excuse me my dears a cough is not to be trifled with in your dear family  you should write to the clerk of the weatheroffice mrs froggatt said lance rather gruffly  and as mrs froggatt was not good at understanding jokes but was always ready to accept mr lances she thought he meant admiral fitzroy and much explanation and banter followed which the children made the louder from dread of the subject mrs froggatt was by no means the cultivated person her husband was but being of a good old plain farmer stock she was quite as unassuming and her manners with the young underwoods were a good deal like those of a superior old housekeeper only perhaps less authoritative and familiar but she was not to be kept away from the subject of her real anxiety i wish i could see your sister and speak to her he ought to have some advice rather than let it run on in this way im sure mr froggatt would be willing to do anything it has been a great concern to him to have to leave such a heavy charge to him this spring and with all the family cares on his head too at his age miss aldas wedding put off toois it and is the young gentleman here still  no his leave was over last monday said robina a week after i came home  i should like to have seen him your brother says he is grown up such a finelooking young man and quite got over his lameness a handsome couple they will be i did see them ride through the place but miss alda didnt see me  you saw his horse broke in lance who considered brown murad as a superior specimen to either of the lovers and mrs froggatt whose father had bred horses and whose son was much more addicted to them than was for his good was a much more intelligent auditor of the perfections now dilated on than could have been expected  yet nothing could keep off the dreaded subject and even at table lances disappointing deficiency in schoolboy voracity became the cause of a lamentation over his brothers small appetite and an examination of robina resulting in her allowing that felix seldom gave himself time to do more than snatch a crust of bread in the middle of the day and did not always make up for it at teatime mr froggatt shook his head and looked distressed and his good lady went on discoursing about the basin of soup she always used to keep prepared for him evidently longing though not quite daring to send a lecture to wilmet on taking care of her brother but what made more impression on both the children was that after they had been into mr froggatts little conservatory with him and had received into their charge a basket of camellias violets and calycanthus with a pot of jonquils in the middle for geraldine the old gentleman said as he bade them goodbye tell your sister that if she thinks a day or two of laying by would be good for your brother i should be ready and glad to change places with him a little change might take away his cough and i dont like his looksno i don t he ought to be careful this to himself with a long sigh  then the children got out into the garden and with the natural impatience of the evil omen exclaimed at the same moment        croak croak croak went the frogs  and       were there ever such a pair of good old coddles   but then they walked on for a full quarter of a mile before either said another word and then it was you dont think felix looking ill do you lance  i never thought about his looks at all said lance  no more did i said robina but he does cough i hear him through the wall in the morning do you think there is anything in it lance  how long has it been going on  ever since he came up to london he got a chill in our garden when i was telling him about said robina stopping short of what she hated to mention  then thats it said lance turning round with a face of one who had made a great discovery  it what is the matter with him  yes said lance hold your tongue robina but cherry and i thought long ago that he fancied that little knevett himself then i made sure it was all a mistake but now depend upon it thats what he is so cut up about  it carried conviction to the hearer perhaps because it fitted in with a girls love of romance then thats why he wont talk to me  of course  and then they began putting together all the tokens of inclination which their small experience and large imagination could suggest till they had pretty well decided the point in their own belief and had amused themselves considerably but the anxiety came back again  do people get over such things lance there was ophelia and there was wilfred in rokebyonly she was a woman and he was pipy did you ever know of anybody really and truly  lance meditated but his experience reached no farther than the surgeons assistant at minsterham who was reported to be continually in love but who did not look greatly the worse for it  and then robina suggested that she did not remember that either wilfred or ophelia had a cough  but my father had said lance in the depths of his throat dont you know robin it was hard work and trouble and poverty thatdid it  was it awestruck for she had been so young as to have no clear ideas  ive heard it told often enough my lady cut off the third curate and thatand all the rest of ithelped to bring on the decline  but lance at least that wasntlove  nonsense robin dont you see whatever takes the heart and spirit out of a man makes him ready for illness to get hold of lance plucked desperately at the hazels in the hedge and his eyes were full of tears  o lance lance what can we do  i dont know id let him pitch into me from morning till night if that would do him any good  im sure i am very sorry i grumbled well give wilmet mr froggatts message and see what she thinks  poor children their consternation was such that they must judge by their own eyes of felix without loss of time so they both marched into the shop with mr froggatts note and there felt half baffled to see felix looking much as usual very busy trying to content a lady with nursery literature and casting a glance at robin as if she had no business there  wilmet received mr froggatts message without excitement she thought it would be a very good thing but she did not believe felix would consent and alda broke out then we should have mr froggatt inflicted on us all the evening  nor did felix consent he said it was very kind but his cold was almost gone and he did not need it moreover he had his private doubts whether alda would be decently gracious to mr froggatt and wilmet whose one object in life was to keep her sister contented and happy at home could press nothing so disagreeable to her altogether the reception of their hints at home was so prosaically placid that they were both rather ashamed of the alarm into which they had worked themselves up even when robina privately asked cherry whether she thought felix looking well the answer was eager  oh veryvery well he looked pulled down when his cold was bad but he is quite well now  mrs froggatt thought  oh youve been talking to mrs froggatt she thinks nothing so kind as to say one is looking poorly i said how well you are looking mrs froggatt one day and i assure you she only swallowed it by an act of christian forgiveness she is fondest of felix so of course he looks the worst  robina got no more out of geraldine whose fears at that moment were in the form of utterly denying themselves commonplace life greatly reassured the two young things and of the alarm there chiefly remained a certain shame at their own former discontent and doubly tender feeling towards their fatherly elder brother now that they guessed something to be amiss with him they had no irritation for himand indeed he gave them no cause for any the discomfort was partly indeed occasioned by the lack of his usual quiet mirth but far more by aldas fastidiousness and wilmets vigilance lest she should be annoyed this caused restrictions that weighed more heavily on the younger ones than on lance and robina and had the effect of making angela and bernard rebellious they had neither the principle nor the consideration of their two seniors to them every one seemed simply cross and against this crossness there was a constant struggle either of disobedience or of grumble  both were at rather an insubordinate age angela having begun school life with getting into a scrape greater than she understood had acquired a naughtygirl reputation of the kind that tempts the young mind to live up to it and her high spirits boisterous nature and dont care system made her irrepressible by any one but wilmet whose resolute hand might be murmured at but was never relaxed while bernard hitherto very fairly amenable to cherry and a capital little scholar became infected with the spirit of riot and insubordination whatever fastidiousness the children took for fine ladyism in alda they treated unmercifully and resented in their own fashion her complaints and wilmets enforcement of regard to her tastes nor was lance always blameless in the tricks played upon her  it was strange to see the difference made by one incongruous element a few sneers at cherrys pronunciation an injudicious laugh when she was rebuking and a general habit of making light of her on aldas part upset all bernards habits of deference to the sister who had taught him all he knew his lessons grew into daily battlesmiseries to himself and far greater miseries to his teacher and sufficient misery to the spectator to induce her to do that which the other sisters could scarcely have brought themselves to do on any provocation namely to complain to felix and by and by make a representation for the general good she said that it was a mere farce to leave the boy under cherrys management  cherry with bitter tears was forced to own that she could no longer keep him in order nor make him learn and there was no alternative but to send him to mr ryders he had no voice nor ear so that he could not follow in lances steps and for the present bexley was the only resource  of course cherry charged the whole of this upon her poor little self and some amount of the trouble certainly was due to her incapacity not to show in voice and manner when she was under fret anxiety or depression and now poor child all three at once had come upon her whether aldas conversation or the childrens naughtiness fretted her most it would be hard to tell she was in a continual state of unuttered vague and therefore most wearing anxiety on felixs account and the physical discomfort of the ungenial spring told on her whole frame and spirits aldas talk when goodhumoured opened such vistas of brightness amusement conversation and above all of beautiful scenes that they awoke longings and cravings that cherry had hardly known before the weariness of the grinding monotony of home seemed to have infected her she knew it for discontent and was the more miserable over her want of power to control it because of the terror that hung over her lest repinings might bring on them all the judicial punishment of a terrible breakup of the home she loved even while the tedium of the daily round oppressed her alternate plaintiveness and weary sharpness of course aggravated both alda and bernard and they knew nothing of the repentant wretchedness that rather weakened than strengthened her  little stellas unfailing docility and sweetness were her great solace even alda was exceedingly fond of stella and would have spoilt her if the child had not been singularly firm in her intense love and loyalty to the heads of the family angel and bear were too rough for her and alarmed her sense of duty but lance was her hero and the happiest moments of those holidays were spent in a certain loft above a warehouse in the court of the printingoffice only attainable by a long ladder here secure that none but favoured ears could hear lance practised on his beloved violin at every hour he could steal emulating too often mother hubbards dog fiddling to mice but his audience often including his three younger sisters he had had scarcely any hints but his was the nature that could pick music out of anything and angela much more than robin was ecstatic in all that concerned the sixth sense and watched and criticised with rapture wanted to learn and pouted at being told that it was not fit for a woman among those stacks of paper in the dusty loft with the stamp and thud of the press close at hand it was possible to forget in creating sounds and longing to fulfil the dream of the spirit that alda was exacting and trying wilmet blind to the annoyances she caused cherry striving hard and not always successfully with the fretfulness of anxiety and felixthey durst not think in what state that loft and that violin made their fairy land and one that rendered it most unusually hard for lance to learn his holiday task  ill tell you what lance said robina at last when he had vainly been trying to repeat it to her with his eye on a sheet of music all the time you cant do two things at once if i were you i would lock up that violin till the summer examination is over  he turned on her quite angrily very fine talking lock up all the pleasure i have in life thank you  im quite sure youll never get the exhibition if you have your head in this  i shant get the exhibition any way  but if you do your utmost for it  i shall do my utmost  you cant if you have these tunes always running in your head and are always wild to be picking them out  well robin i sometimes think i should do more good with music than anything else  maybe said robina a sensible little woman but youll do no good by half and half if you dont do well in the examination felix will be horribly vexed and youll always hate the thought of it  i tell you i shall be as dull as ditchwater and as stupid as shapcote if i dont have any pleasure  i only dont want you to be stupider  lance chucked up a penwiper and caught it  the fact is said robina all weve got to do is our best if we dont it is wrong in us and it makes us more a weight on felix and i think it is our real duty to keep everything out of the way that hinders us if it is ever so nice  is that cock robin or parson rook with his little book said lance throwing the penwiper in her face  but the week after when robina was at school again she was called to receive a letter which had something hard in it  did you leave a key behind you she was asked a little suspiciously for there was nothing about it in the brief note  no miss fennimore but my brother has sent it to me to keep for him it is the key of his violincase and he is not going to touch it till he is past his examination  from that time miss fennimore entertained a better opinion of robina underwood but little recked robina she only felt secure that after this act of heroism lance could not but gain the exhibition     chapter xvii  midsummer sun    for phoebus awful self encountered him  amid the battle throng invisible  in thickest darkness shrouded all his face  he stood behind and with extended palm  dealt on patroclus neck and shoulder broad  a mighty buffet                         iliad book xvi earl of derby   warmer weather came at last and brought mr froggatt back to his daily work lifting a weight of responsibility from his young partners shoulders  the cough mended too but did not entirely cease and when june came in with an unusual access of summer heat there were those who felt it as trying as the sharp wind had been one evening when the home party had been sitting in the garden and the fall of the dew sent cherry indoors felix as usual gave her his arm and lifted her step by step up the stairs she felt all over her frame that what used to be almost nothing to the boy was a severe exertion to the man  you should not do it she said as they both stood resting at the top he leaning back against the wall and wiping his forehead where the big blue v of the veins stood out prominently  having so often carried the calfi should be able to carrythe cow he said the smile not disguising the panting of his voice  you are to be at the agricultural meeting at dearport tomorrow i wish you would just go and see dr lee  i think i shall and there they were interrupted  poor geraldine what worlds of apprehension were founded on that quiet assent his first intimation that he believed himself unwell she kept absolute silence she could not have uttered her terrors for ten thousand worlds  she was on her couch under the appletree in the late afternoon trying to force her thoughts out of miserable possibilities when she saw felix come out of the house flushed heated dusty tired but somehow she gathered hope from his air as he threw himself down on the grass by her side saying mr froggatt sent me out to cool  stella dear to the little one who had her storybook at hand run and ask sibby to bring felix out a cup of tea then she tried to guess at his face but durst not look at him fully are you very tired  rather that place was a mere oven of roaring well cherry pulling off his necktie and settling himself with an elbow on her couch and his back against the tree theres nothing amiss with my lungs  she shuddered all over and almost bounded then put her hand tenderly on his shoulder  your doctor is a clever man i can see he continued he seemed to guess about me directly he sounded my chest and says it is all right now but that there had been a little damage he thought the long cough i had after the measles had left traces that this winter has told upon  ah a great gasp  but theres no active diseasenone at all nor likely if i can shake off this remnant of cough and get into condition before the winter  cherry sighed again at the white hand and the network of blue veins on both it and the temple that was propped against it you must indeed she wistfully said  i must said felix sighing too as with little mind for the struggle ive brought home a detestable bottle of codliver oil on the spot and am to take to all the good living i can swallow wont that delight mr froggatt s good old soul then the worst of it is that i am to go away to some sea place for the hottest of the weather  oh im so glad  he taxed me with not taking food enough and when i allowed that i had no turn for eating insisted on this sea plan but he laughed me to scorn when i asked whether i might not get a room at dearport and run backwards and forwards ay he said you have a good deal on your mind and i fell into the trap and told him my partner had been ill and we had a great deal to work up and he went on to ask if i had not the charge of the family and was not apt to get anxious about them and he turned round on me and ordered me to get a thorough holiday and turn my back on everybody and everything for theres nothing the matter with me but overwork and harass something that did not amount to and finished the sentence  o felix i know i have felt she said the tears standing in her eyes and the colour rushing into her face at this first venture  have youlittle foolish thing he answered but shifting hand and elbow so that nothing of his face could be seen but a bit of brow and temple and that was crimson to the roots of his hair dont take it for more than it ever was he muttered  it was enough to hurt you grievously whispered the sister  it ought not he said it was only the putting out of a vain foolish hope i had no right to indulge eh cherry as she made a little sound tell me one thing was it all imagination and folly that sheshe could haveliked me he bent his head with almost as much suppressed emotion as if it had been a matter of present hope  certainly not said cherry she liked youryour attentions and i thought sometimes you were quite pulling her up to your level if no one else  i did not imagine it was visible he interrupted i tried to be very guarded but one does not know  you were somehow one feels more than one sees  and you thought she did then at least i was not quite a fool i fancied that there was response enough to what seems to have shown in spite of me to warrant the dream that if ever a time came  if she had had depth enough  but of course said felix in a tone of defence she never really knew he guessed still less  no i am sure he never guessed there is that comfort said cherry  it is the greatest i have had all along said felix for the rest it was no wonder  no said cherry but it all managed to fall in the very hardest way on you no wonder it was too much for you  it is odd mused felix how this one dream has seemed to take all the heart and soul out of one there seemed no elasticity to meet other things i must say all this doctors advice has been seeming an amazing amount of trouble for what is not very well worth having in the end  o felix felix you will  my cherie you dont think id drop off the coach while you are in it if i can help it to say nothing of the rest i suppose every one has something of the sort in his turn and ill take good care not to be let in for it again thank you cherry he added presently and now looking at her i am very glad to have had this out with you i think i can make a fresh start now what silly little thing crying when i thought i had brought you good news  you are quite sure you have told me all dr lee said she demanded holding his hands tight and gazing into the face which certainly with the still heightened colour looked both delicate and weary you have been so much worse than you told  no indeed i have felt very little but weariness and want of energy but i am better now than i have felt for weeks and what is more cherry i dont feel like getting worse i mean to set myself to live to get through the work my father left me  taking care of all of us is that all you care to live for felix  all just now dont look shocked cherry you know it is all very fresh five monthspoor felix thought she and there is the continual pain of knowing how wretched those people make the poor child when she is happier perhaps the shade will lighten dont be afraid you dear little thing he was answering her piteous eyes theres plenty of time to recover it i suppose i am really very young still  not quite three and twenty oh felix i am sure god will give you back happiness you are so good and patient where will you go and when  how i wish you could go with me dr lee said he should like to send me to switzerland but as he might as well have said the moon he said any sea place would do rest and good air are all that signifies so i thought of ewmouth and then i might see vale leston again i believe you want it as much as i you are a little washed out rag  i shall be all right when i know you are better then as sibby brought out the tea and stella the toast she had insisted on making he began to look at his shorthand notes never mind those you are to rest you knowstella little one run to the office and if mr froggatt is not busy get him to come and have some tea  this was always a mission to stellas taste and mr froggatt was soon installed in the only basketchair that would hold him and was professing his relief and satisfaction that mr underwood had been wise enough to take advice at last he had better go any day the sooner the better and even his desire to take the newspaper work with him would have been overruled but for the simple fact that there was nobody else capable of it in the present state of mr froggatts eyes  alda had been lying down in her own room her cup of teaan institution that for any one else wilmet would have deemed sinful wastehad been rung for when she saw from the window that mr froggatt was one of the party in the garden and whereas sibby did not choose to hear or attend to her whims she came down full of wrath and indignation as soon as she saw that cherry was left alone under her tree and wilmet coming out to her with the step of one who was glad her days work was over  really sibbys inattention was shameful not choosing to bring the tea upstairs when it was rung for  you forget how much sibby has to do alda  you have quite spoilt sibby i would not have such a servant on any account im sure i dont know why the tea was so early either cherry ordered it i believe  yes said cherry because felix came in so hot and tired  he could have waited i suppose began alda but wilmet was asking anxiously is he so very tired where is he i was afraid he would be knocked up he looked so pale when he set off  he is gone to write out his notes said cherry i think he is rested now and mettie she added knowing that he had rather not have to begin the subject again i am glad to say he has been to see dr lee and he says that his lungs are all safe only he must be careful and go away for a change  just as i say exclaimed alda no one can be well living in such a hole when are we to go  my dear alda said wilmet you forget no one can possibly go but felix and it will be hard enough to manage for him  then i do think it is very selfish in him said alda when every one of us wants change im as languid as possible and look at cherry  felix selfish even wilmet could not stand that and answered with her most severely gentle manner nothing but necessity will induce felix to do so i beg you will say nothing of the sort again  cherry was alarmed lest wilmet might not be convinced of the necessity and might think more of present pounds than future health but in fact wilmet was as much relieved as cherry herself by the medical opinion for she had charged the failure of health entirely to the constitution instead of the heart and moreover never was troubled with misgivings and heartsinkings for the future so as for a needful and infallible cure she set herself to arrange writing again to abednego tripp the vale leston clerk whose possession of a market boat kept him conversant with ewmouth and who recommended rooms in the house of a former servant at the rectory who had married a sailor  felix only waited to put his business in train and make over theodore to the care of clement who had just come home from cambridge the quantity of work and bustle had not been beneficial and his sisters did not feel at all happy in sending him off by himself while alda was inclined to think the time a particularly cruel one just as all the most unquiet spirits of the household would be coming home for the holidays and his authority would be most wanted  however wilmet was free first of all and she was a more efficient guardian of the peace than ever felix could be downstairs lance was to come on the evening of the 26th of june after the examination for the exhibition which as he had told every one he was quite sure not to gain and then what was to be done with him small and boyish as he still was  the question was sighed over on that day by the three sisters as they sat endeavouring to be cool and looking out at the glowing street where the few passengers seemed to be crawling like flies on a windowpane  presently a rather hesitating knock at the door was followed by the entrance of mr froggatt ushering in no other than mr harewood  in the moment of shaking hands cherry had foreboded enough to set her pulses throbbing so violently as to deafen her ears lance had failed had run away in despair to go to fulbert rather than be a burthen felix would go in search of himbreak a bloodvesseland  naywhat was it lance it really was lance was not wilmet talking of going mr harewood saying something about trains she made a great effort to clear her senses and the first thing she really distinguished was wilmet saying thank you i will put a few things together  then she hurried away and cherry found mr froggatt standing over her saying kindly dear miss geraldine dont be alarmed there is often no bad result  how was it i dont understand said alda  mr harewood owned himself not perfectly informed but he feared the trouble had been in great part occasioned by his own poor boy williams carelessness the two boys had strolled out the evening before along the bank of the river and had compared the copies of verses which were to be shown up at the examination afterwards they had bathed and will had left his verses meantime in the hollow of a tree never remembering them till he found himself in his place in the cathedral on the very morning of the examination when he came out not only did his duties as senior chorister chain him to the spot but he had put off to the last moment the fair copying of his algebraic exercises and his chance of the exhibition was as good as lost the very loophole that robina had predicted his carelessness would make had not lance whose preparations were all made as soon as he understood the difficulty dashed headlong off bareheaded as he stood at the school door without waiting to fetch his cap and laid the verses on his rivals desk just in time for them to be shown up he had been absent about twenty minutes and had scarcely been missed but when his turn came a few moments later to bring his papers to the examiners as soon as he stood up he staggered gazed round cried out and fell forward on his desk insensible a doctor who like mr harewood himself had been present to hear a sons performance had helped to raise him and pronounced it to be a case of sunstroke nor when half an hour later the librarian set off to fetch his sister had there been any sign of consciousness  mr harewood tried to be calm but he was evidently in great distress and mr froggatt could not restrain large tears from dropping  as to cherry she could only tremble unable to speak or cry and mr froggatt called out to alda to do something for her when alda said she would call wilmet which made cherry burst out with dont dont and shudder the more with tearless sobs but happily clement coming down fetched her remedies and did more by whispering a few kind words of hope and comfort  he was going with wilmet who was as usual the selfpossessed one and while passively allowing mr froggatt to give her biscuits and even wine she left her few parting directions alda take care of them allstella try to keep tedo happycherry dont give way and fancy thingsabove all dont write to felix he must not be hurried home without necessity i could telegraph if there was and there her steady voice faltered she drew down her veil and turned to walk to the station clement carrying her bag and mr froggatt accompanying them to the train  very little was said on the way before they reached the town whose last associations were so joyous mr harewood would have given wilmet his arm dreading the tidings that might meet her but she was walking straight on with head erect as though neither needing nor seeking support  they reached the low wicketdoor of the bailey and as they entered the little court and passed the window they saw that people were still standing about the bed in the corner everything was open to admit such air as might stir that sultry heat some one came to the door and said no change  then wilmet and clement advanced to the narrow old dark oak bed and mrs harewood made way for them fresh tears starting at their presence there he lay their bright agile boy with eyes half closed and fixed and circled half way down his cheeks with livid purple like bruises the purple lips emitting a heavy breath his crest of sunny hair hanging dank with the melting of the ice on his head  clements lips trembled and he dropped on his knees hiding his face and stifling his sobs in his hands wilmet after looking for permission to a gentleman at the foot of the bed whom she took for the doctor laid her hand on the helpless fingers and bent to kiss the brow saying softly and steadily lance dear lancey  the eyelids moved the hand closed there was a struggling stifled utterance wilmet wilmet bring me back oh bring me back  she looked up and read in the watchers faces that they were glad yes dear lance she said in her soft steady voice i am here you will soon be better  he clung to her as if blindly struggling with some terrible oppression and the effort ended in violent sickness exhausting him into unconsciousness again but just then the real doctor came in having been summoned by a message at the first symptom of change from the state of stupor at the same time the cathedral bell began to ring for evening prayer and lance at once was roused to endeavour to obey it and when he was gently held back murmured on about finding the places and seeing bill was not late mr harewood had to go but whispered that he would ask the prayers of the congregation it was comfortable to remember that lance was thought of there when as the deep roll of the organ vibrated round the building psalm chant anthem and response came thronging thick and confusedly on those unconscious lips  dr manby however told wilmet not to be too much alarmed at this delirium for the most immediate danger had passed when the lethargy had given way and that though fever was probably setting in there was fair hope that so healthy a boy would be able to struggle through it without permanent harm there was a gentleness and consideration in his manner quite new to her after her dealings with mr rugg and she felt at the same time that he was not concealing the truth from her she told how it was with her eldest brother asking whether he ought to be sent for and it was a great lightening of present fear to be told that there was now no need for haste and that any change for the worse would give full time to bring him moreover that new faces were to be avoided should a nurse be sent from the hospital wilmet raised her steady sensible eyes and said she could manage she was well used to nursing  i see you are he answered well satisfied since there were besides the precentors housekeeper who was used to act as matron to the boarding choirboys and apparently an unlimited power of harewoods  as to the place lance had at first been carried to his own bed and even if there had been a regular infirmary he was in no state to bear being moved the other boys goods had been removed and they all were going home that evening so that it was as cool and as quiet a place as could be had since there was no doubt that the sounds from the cathedral would be hushed for so critical a case  indeed just as dr manby had said this both the dean and the precentor were seen coming through the bailey on the way out of church to ask after the patient and the former promised wilmet that the bells and organ should both be silenced and that the daily service should be in the lady chapel  it appeared there had been little but the instrumental music that evening and strangers who had heard the praises of the minsterham choir must have been disappointed for the psalms so entirely overcame the senior chorister that he could do nothing but sob and at last was fain to stuff half the sleeve of his surplice into his mouth to hinder a howl such as the least of the boys actually burst out with most of the other lads were far past singing and even two or three of the men and such voices as did uplift themselves were none of the best or clearest  that poor senior choristerhe crept back after his father into the room it was his first entrance for he had been kept all day at the examination with what power of attention may be guessed and when some halfrecognition of him set the sufferer off into wanderings that showed habitual vigilance over his carelessness he was so much distressed that he rushed out and was heard crying so piteously in the court that his mother went out to hush and comfort him never strong the shock anxiety and exertion had so worn her out that her family would not let her come back but their attention to the nurses did not relaxthey were viewed as guests both by mr beccles and the harewoods and when it was found that neither would come away to another house to dine a little table was prepared in the court close to the door and the sister and brother coaxed one by one and made to eat and drink while as clement could not bear to go home a note was written the delivery of which to the sisters mr beccles undertook to secure all the evening mr harewood or his eldest son the engineer captain the same whom wilmet had taken for the doctor sat at the other end of the room while lance lay sometimes babbling school tasks mixed with anthems and hymns sometimes in something between sleep and torpor but always moaning and fevered  this strange temporary infirmary of which wilmet was made free consisted of two long narrow rooms each with a row of quaint black oak beds and presses between the double row of narrow lattice windows looking into the court on one side and the cloister on the other there was a smaller room dividing these two chambers and opening into both which the undermaster had vacated and where the matron installed miss underwoods little bag  clement was a good deal impressed with the place in the grand quiet shadow of the old cathedral and the room itself told much of his brothers daily life in his own little section of it the deep windowseat and old oak chest were loaded with piles of punch sheets of music schoolbooks and grotesque sketches bat hockey stick and fishingrod were in the corner trencher cap and little black gown hung on their peg on the whitewashed walls and pinned beside them lists of the weeks music schoolwork etc in the corner by the press was a little rough deal table covered with an old white shawl that clement remembered as his mothers and on it lay lances old brown bible the prayerbook given him by the bishop steps to the altar and kens manual over it hung the photograph of his father and next above an illumination of cherrys the joy of the lord is your strength while above was a little print of the good shepherd nor was it a small testimony to the boy who had been senior in the room that clement found one or two other such little tables evidently for private prayer he had never believed such things could be out of st matthews nor where the books were not more of his own exclusive type than were lances and perhaps there was some repentance for harsh judgment in his spirit as he knelt on by that little table long after mr harewood near midnight had read a few prayers and gone to his house  when clement stood up his sister made him lie down as well as his long legs would permit on one of the other beds where he soon fell asleep while she sat on where she could see the spire rising aloft into the pale blue of the summer nights sky while the perfect stillness was only broken by the quarterly chiming of the clock re echoed from its fellow in the townhall every window and door was open but the air was heated and oppressive till the early dewy coolness before dawn crept in making her bend over lance to cover him less slightly then she met his eyes heavy and bloodshot but with himself in them  wilmet is that you he said in a wondering tone  yes here i am dear lance  is it night or morning  morning there it is striking threequarters past two  oh a long sigh im so thirsty  she brought some drink but as he tried to raise his head the distressing sickness returned in full force and in the midst the gasping cry my head my head  some more ice clem said wilmet but clement looked up from the icepail in despair for all was melted and she could only steep handkerchiefs in the water and in eaudecologne and lay them on the head while clement wondered if he could find a shop but where was the use at three in the morning and poor lance rolled round wearily sighing oh i did not know ones head could ache so  just then a step crossed the court and a low voice said is he awake i have brought some more ice  o jack thank you faintly breathed lance  thank you fervently added wilmet we did not know what to do for some more  i thought you must want some by this time i have a little ice machine for indian use he added as clement looked at him like a sort of wizard  he was small sandy and freckled after the harewood fashion and was besides dried up by eastern suns but one who brought such succour could not fail to be half celestial in the sisters eyes and as he said you are getting better her response was fervent in its quietness though poor lance conscious only of oppression and suffering merely replied with a groan and seemed to be dozing again into torpor in the relief the ice had given  clement and captain harewood besought wilmet to restthe latter declaring himself to be too much of an east indian to sleep at dawn and she consented to lie down in the little room where she had enough of wakeful slumber to strengthen her for the heat of the day when the fever ran high and all the most trying symptoms returned  the doctor continued to forbid despondency building much on the lucid interval in the cool of the morning and ascribing much of the excitement of brain to the excessive almost despairing study that lance had been attempting in the last weeks before the examination there had too been a concert given by one of the great ladies of the close for which there had been a good deal of practice harassed by certain amateur humours and the constant repetition of one poor little shallow song in the delirious murmur greatly pained the precentor and made him indulge in murmurs that boded ill to the ladies chances with the choirboys the sultry weather was likewise a great enemy and could hardly be mitigated by the continual fanning kept up chiefly by poor bill harewood who seemed to have no comfort except in working the fan till he was ready to drop and his brother or clement took it from him  mrs harewood was quite knocked up and her daughters were curiously inefficient people their father came and went all day but the serviceable person was the engineer with his experience of sun strokes his devices for coolness and his cheerful words stilling the torrent of rambling restlessness so that wilmet depended upon him as much as on the doctor himself  on saturday the third day of the fever which had rather increased than diminished wilmet begged clement to go home for the night to carry a report to the sisters and fetch some things she wanted he lingered grieving and reluctant while the heated atmosphere was like a solid weight on the sufferer who lay now and then murmuring some distressed phrase as though labouring with some forgotten task and wilmet shunned touching the pulse again lest the reckoning should be higher than the last and strove to construct a message conveying the hope that seemed to faint in the burthen of the day insisting above all that guarded accounts should be sent to felix keeping carefully to dr manbys report  i can be here before nine said clement i wish i could help going i feel as if something must happen  a thunderstorm said captain harewood in a reproving voice as he plied the fan with heatdrops on his brow a thunderstorm which will prove the best doctor take care you will miss the train  clement stooped to kiss the unconscious face as though he had never prized his little brother before and as some association of the touch of the lips awoke the murmur mamma mamma he sped away with eyes full of tears  before he could have reached the station the storm was cominggreat rounded masses of cloud with silverfoamed edges and red lurid caverns began to climb slowly up the sky distant grumbles of thunder came gradually nearer a few fitful gusts of wind came like sirocco adding to the stifling heat and were followed by exceeding stillness broken by the first few big drops of rain the visible flashes and the nearer peals of thunder till a sudden glare and boom overhead startled lance into a frightened bewildered state that so occupied wilmet that she hardly heard the roaring pattering hail drops on the roofs and pavements but when a sweet fresh wind blew away the hail the weary head was more at rest the slumber more tranquil the breathing freer and softer than it had been since that wednesday  some two hours later she saw him looking at her with a sort of perplexed smile and the first words upon his tongue were is bill first  nothing is settled till the bishop comes home captain harewood answered  what time is it then asked lance  halfpast eight  it seems always half dark said the boy dreamily and yet theres no curfew  they have been so kind as not to ring the bells said wilmet  not ring the bells repeated lance in a feeble voice of amazement  no nor play the organ said wilmet you have had to be so quiet you know  no organ and for me repeated lance impressed almost as if the unchanging sun his daily course had refused to run but it rather frightened him for he added am i very ill then  not now i hope said wilmet tenderly and possessing herself of his wrist you are so much better tonight  he looked wistfully into her face whats the matter with me he said what does make my head go on in this dreadful way  dear lance it was that running in the hot sun  oh a sort of sigh of discovery i hope he had the verses  yes indeed you gave them  then he must be first said lance and then as his thankful nurses were preparing to give him some nourishment he spoke again mettie please come here and as she bent over him is this being very illlike dying i mean  not now dearest said wilmet kissing him you must be through with the worst thank god  he asked no more for his voice was low and faint the pain and dizziness still considerable and the being fed without raising himself occupied him till the doctor came for his evening visit and confirmed the sisters comfort in his improvement she sat gazing as he fell asleep again till captain harewood reminded her that her letter to ewmouth must be sent before the mail closed she turned to the window where still lay her anxiouslyworded bulletin not yet closed but as she took the pen the blinding tears fell thick and soft as the summer rain outside  this will be a happy ending said john harewood as he saw her silently striving to clear her sight  would you be so very kind as to write it for me she answered pointing to the paper with a lovely smile through her tears he will believe it all the more  and as he took the pen she retreated in quiet swiftness to her little room but came back as he finished the few freshly hopeful lines then going to the door with him looked up with the same sweet tremulous smile thank you what thankfulness it is what a merciful rain this is if you knew the relief it is to send this report to felix you cannot guess what this dear little fellow is to him  i think i can a little said john harewood with his heart in his voice and wilmet smiled again her stately but usually rather severe beauty wonderfully softened and sweetened by emotion  the improvement continued when clement arrived on the sunday morning and though fevered confused and beset by odd fancies especially about the silence of the cathedral lance knew his brother smiled at him and returned his greeting clement had a more cheerful task than usual in what seemed to be his days workanswering inquiries at the door and taking in presents of fruit all the chapter and half the town seemed to call or send at least once a day and little boys used to hang about the court too shy to come to the door but waiting to collect tidings from the attendants and mutually using strong measures upon one another when either was betrayed into noise  clement called his sister aside to ask whether she could spare him since she had the help of the matron and the harewoods i should be very glad to stay he averred but somebody is really wanted at home  wilmet had not been so much accustomed to consider clement in the light of somebody as greatly to care whether he went or stayed and only said i can get on very well no one is of so much use as captain harewood  just so said clement and i think i am doing more good at home imagine my finding all the windows open in that pouring rain and cherry sitting shivering  very foolish of cherry said wilmet  poor cherry she could not help herself and was only thankful when i had the courage to shut them in aldas face then they dont know what to do with theodore  poor tedothats the worst of it  you see he is used to a mans hand and voice he is very good with me but sibby has had dreadful work with him every night till i came home and wilmet couldnt you send a message who is to be mistress while you are away  alda of course  alda doesnt seem to understand and she will not let cherry tell her  cherry always does bother alda i cant help it clem they must rub on somehow  and if you can make theodore happy the rest does not so much signify  not signify clement did not know whether he was standing on his head or his heels and never guessed that not only was she too much absorbed in the present thoroughly to realise the absent but that she would not venture to send orders based on his report which in her secret soul she qualified by his love of importance and interference however he went away and was not seen again all the ensuing weekthe early part of which was very trying for the fever recurred regularly about noon and midnight and always brought rambling which since that conversation with wilmet had taken the turn of talking about being buried in a surplice and of continually recurring to the 134th psalm which it was now remembered lance had shortly before taken part in over the grave of an old layvicar who boy and man had served the cathedral for nearly sixty years often too the poor little fellow seemed struggling with some sense of demeritwhether positive disgrace or suspicion or the general christian feeling of unworthiness wilmet and john harewood could never make out and they did not choose to speak of these wanderings either to will or to mr beccles in the intervals of consciousness the thought of danger and death seemed to be lost in the weakness of exhaustion and the dread of whatever brought back the pain from which there was no respite except in cool air and perfect quiet the least movement intensified it and brought on the sickness that showed the brain to be still affected and still worse was any endeavour to attend to the shortest and simplest devotions when mr harewood attempted them yet all the time there was amendment the fever was every day less severe the intervals longer the sleep calmer the doctor more securely hopeful and by the end of a week from the time of the accident recovery was beginning sensibly to set in  clement meanwhile did not appear nor was he seen till the ensuing monday when he stood on the threshold of the open door at the bailey bewildered at the emptiness of the bed where he had last seen his brothertill a weak voice said here clem and he saw on another of the little old beds a small figure in a loose soft white silk indian robe de chambre the face shrunken into nothing but overhanging brow and purple haloed eyes though the eyes themselves were smiling welcome in all their native blueness and clearness and two thin white hands were held out  out of bed lance that is getting on  yes they thought i should be cooler and sleep better for it  and are you all alone said clement hanging over him  the maids are about somewhere wilmet is gone to the cathedral while jack got me up  then you must be a great deal better  oh yes i havent had any of that horrid fever since friday  and the pain  better if i lie quite still and it is not hot but i couldnt stand a bit when i tried i hardly know how jack carried me here  you are little and light enough said clement but ill help to carry you back i am sorry not to have been here more lance but i was so much wanted at home  thank you i didnt want any one jack is such a fellow and wilmet somehow clem i never seem to have cared enough about w w  nor i till i saw what home is like without her murmured clement  and isnt she beautiful too added lance it is quite nice to lie and look at her at work dont you think her much better looking than alda  if handsome is that handsome does said clement you wouldnt like me to stay with you instead of mettie old chap  the helplessly alarmed look of illness came into lances eyes oh no no i couldnt spare wilmet yet she doesnt want to go  no i have said nothing to her but cherry is not well and everything is at sixes and sevens but there never mind as the tears started into the sick boys eyes well manage i should not have said anything about it  please dont said lance if she ought to go let her and dont tell me i cant help it clem im afraid to think if it ought to be or i should make my head rage and i should begin to talk nonsense again and that s worst of all  do you know when you are talking nonsense said clement surprised and eager to lead off from the subject he felt he ought not to have broached  oh yes i know that it is not the right thing and the right thing wont come and the worst of it is lowering his already feeble voice saving ones prayers is hardest of all i cant remember what i know best i couldnt so much as go through the magnificat if you were to shoot me  but holloa they dont generally come out of the cathedral this way do they  who  the bishop ay and the dean speaking to wilmet i believe they are coming here lie still lance  i must he acquiesced after half raising himself and falling back oh can it be about the prize some of that stuff on my forehead please clem  wilmet came in first ascertained that all was ready put an arranging touch to lances pillows and ushered in the two dignitaries who shook his languid hand and asked after him kindly  you have put the chapter into great difficulties by disabling yourself and harewood said the bishop what did you not know that the poor fellow entirely broke down as the eager eyes inquired  nobody would tell me anything about it said lance  it could not be helped continued the bishop but the examiners said they felt it a great cruelty when they saw how utterly astray distress rendered him  however his papers and yours were both so goodhis verses especially and your arithmeticthat it was impossible to reject them so the decision was put off till my return on saturday  we think said the dean who was very old very gentle and very slow of speechwe think my little fellow that though there is no doubt that shapcote did best in the examination and ought to have the exhibition yet under the peculiar circumstances you and harewood can be retained as choir scholars for another year so as to try again you dont look sixteen im sure and we should be sorry to lose your voice  im only just turned sixteen said lance only on the 14th of june thank you sirthank you my lord and his face beamed joy though his words faltered  moreover proceeded the bishop i have the greatest pleasure in giving the goodconduct prize where so far as i am able to judge it has been well deserved  a perilous flush of joy overspread the pale face he started up on his elbows and his eyes danced rapture as some one at the door handed in the beautiful red morocco quarto of the cathedral music and the bishop with a fatherly hand making him lie down again laid the book beside him as he gasped out something like thanks  we are quite convinced that you have deserved it repeated the dean again shaking hands with him and then taking leave but the bishop remained talking kindly to clement about cambridge and inquiring for felix while wilmet helped lances feeble fingers to turn the thick creamy pages on which he durst not fix his eyes  presently the bishop sat down again and said i have acted on my own judgment in giving you this my boy i have seen enough of our choir these six years to know that what caused so much displeasure was certainly not to be laid to your charge  lance made an uneasy movement became alarmingly red and said in a choked voice i dont know but what it might my lord  you mean that you knew of this custom of getting out at night through the cathedral  yes my lord i found out the way  there was a silence  then the bishop said after this i can only leave it to your own conscience whether you ought to keep this book but i think you would do wisely to let me know remembering that i have no authority in the school  lance brightened and he answered my lord i did get out once but only once and i dont think i did wrong it was a long time agoin the autumn  last autumn was it not then that there was a report of a chorister in his shirt sleeves being seen at the green man at eleven oclock at night  that was i my lord  clement was ready to start forward under the impression that lance was talking his nonsense but the bishop said you were named but nobody believed it for a moment  one of our little fellows was very ill my lord said lance excitement restoring something of his natural briskness we thought he was going to have the cholera and i went to get something for him the chemists shops were shut so i went in there  may i ask the question said the bishop rather as if taking a liberty why did you not call up mr stokes  we couldnt my lord for it was all mr shapcotes swans eggs he caught themthree of our least fellows i meanjumping at the branches that hung over the river wall and he blackguarabused them so that they got into a rage and vowed he shouldnt have a plum left on the tree we seniors knew nothing about it but they got over the wall at dark and one ate eightyfive and the other eightyone but little dickone of them i meancould only get down nineteen and brought the rest in his pockets it was the first time such a thing had happened and it put me in a proper rage the little one was the one i found out first and i thought he was sulky so i licked him till he howled so that i was afraid id done him some dreadful harm like a regular brute and when i found it was his inside instead of his outside i was so glad i could have done anything for him but we couldnt call stokes or the poor little chap would have suffered for it three times over  that would have been hard measure and did your remedy succeed  yes i think a good deal was fright he went to sleep on the brandy and was all right next day  and the gentlemen with the eightyfive and eightyone suffered no inconvenience of course said his lordship much amused may i hear how you got out  with mr harewoods key said lance he used to keep it on a nail inside the study door which opens into the passage leading into this court and is never locked  that is the key of the cathedral library  yes my lord it unlocks the outer door and the door into the north transept  and after that  you can shoot the bolt on the inside of the little sidedoor at the west front and climb over the railing  boys are animals not to be kept in that is certain so you were pioneer but you had nothing to do with those cards  no my lord but i ought not to have told how i got out for there were some who would do it afterwards however those cards were none of ours  whose were they  walter shapcotes my lord he is gone now so it does not signify  that nephew mr shapcote had in his office  yes my lord he had got the command of poor gus because he had lent him money for some debt that gus was afraid to let his father know of and made him get the key and let him out and in  you all knew of this  yes my lord but poor gus was sure that his father would be so dreadful that we durst not let out a word mr shapcote makes every soul afraid of him  the young man is gone  yes my lord to london  and there is no danger of the like with gus  oh no my lord hes too like a sheep and now his debt is paid after the last concerthes sure not to get into the same scrape again  thank you very sincerely said the bishop it is a great relief to me to know all this and it is safe with me i am only afraid i have made you talk more than is good for you  and may i keep this my lord he wistfully asked  indeed you may my dear boy if you have transgressed the letter of discipline you have kept the spirit of charity i am glad to keep you as well as your voice but i have tired you out  and laying a hand of blessing on his brow the bishop took leave wilmet going to the door with him to answer his fears that the interview had been too much for her patient with assurances that the relief and gratification must do good in the end  he told her that the threat of the withholding of the prize had not been made by his authority and that he had much regretted it just as the tidings of the sunstroke and its cause had reached him he had been with mr nixon the former precentor who had spoken warmly of lance saying that the whole tone of the boys had improved since his coming though he was too much of a pickle ever to get the credit wilmets pleasure was great but before she could get back lance was nervously calling for her the excitement was still great his head was aching violently and yet he could not leave off eager talking which as feverishness came on began to degenerate into such rambling as terribly frightened clement lest a relapse should be coming on he wanted to hurry off to the doctor at once but wilmet well knowing he would not be at home repressed him and quietly said she had some draughts ready and knew what to do while she was out of sight preparing them a great alarm came over the patient lest she should have left him and all the rest of those noonday hours were spent in a continual restless desire to keep her in view hold her hand and elicit her assurances that she was not going home nor going to leave himno not on any account the very presence of his brother seemed to increase the uneasiness and in the deepest humiliation and despair clement allowed himself to be invited away by captain harewood to see the process of icemaking and be so far comforted that the bishops visit was probably far more likely to have done the mischief than his own rash suggestion and that there was no reason to fear it would last many hours in fact lance was recovering favourably and had had few drawbacks so i tell everybody said john harewood especially poor bill who is still ready to break his heart every time lance has a headache and would chatter him to death when he is better and thats the way with them all there seems no one that can be tender and reasonable both at once except your sister  clement did full justice to that tenderness when out of sight himself he had watched wilmets soothing firmness and patient reassuring softness at last calming the feverish agitation into a sleep which he was allowed to see for himself was gentle and wholesome only thentowards four oclockcould captain harewood persuade her to let him keep guard while she went to take the food that had been long waiting for her and over which she could hear clements penitent explanation of his own unlucky proposal  i thought he seemed so wellable to get up and all and they do think me a good nurse at st matthews i nursed fred somers almost entirely when he had the scarlet fever wilmet looked as if she pitied st matthews but of course i see now that it is out of the question  entirely so said wilmet too kind to remind him of the qualifications he had evinced  and you cannot guess when he can come home  not in the least even if he could be moved think of the noisiness of our house  clement groaned it was very wrong in me to speak to him before you wilmet he said but i should be thankful if you could tell me what is to be done cherry was thoroughly chilled that evening of the thunderstorm and has been very poorly ever since  she always feels changes of weather  thats what alda tells you she wont believe there is anything the matter but poor cherry has had rheumatic pain all over her and her bad ankle seems to have a bit of bone coming out sibby thinks so now ought she not to have her doctor  well ifi wish i could be quite sure it is such an unlucky thing that she has that dislike to mr rugg  wilmet you are as bad as alda  clement she answered gently you do not know what it is to have to reckon the expense there is felixs journey and what this illness may cost i cannot guess and now cherry it is not that i grudge it but i dont see what is to become of any of us if we spend unnecessarilyor necessarily either for that matter  i thought her doctor didnt charge  he did not when she was at st faiths but at home it is a different thing but of course if it be really needful it cannot be helped  and you couldnt come home and seeeven for one hour  not yet most certainly  i think i had better write to sister constance  if you really do find it impossible to get on and cherry is more than just ailing andand fractious the word came out at last i dont like always calling for help it seems presuming on kindness and robina will be helpful when she comes home but no doubt alda does not know what to do she added in a deliberating tone  then you authorise me  i dont know what you mean by authorising  only that alda will neither do anything herself nor let any one else do it  poor alda it is a hard time for her and she is not used to it i am afraid she is out of her element among you all dont be vexed clem you all ought to make allowances for her  i make allowances from morning to night said clement i wonder how many travis will have to make  wilmet had finished her hasty meal and wanted to get back to her patient so she only protested by a reproving look and shake of the head while clement stood disconcerted but less surprised than if he had not been familiar with the part of the family cassandra     chapter xviii  by the river    and lancelot lookd and was perplext in mind  and being weak in body said no more                                   tennyson   it was a lovely afternoon and the sun shone outside the green tracery of a hornbeam alley in the deanery garden leading from the cloister to the river here lay lancelot on the long cushion of a sofa while wilmet sat stitching at the last of the set of collars that would always bring so many recollections for this was a saturday afternoon and on the monday lance was to go to ewmouth to join felix who was to have his holiday extended another month on that account alda who had had a quarters allowance from her uncle had made this possible and wilmet was doubly gratified by its having been her twins gift and thought  wilmet would of course go home and she found herself almost regretting the close of a time that had of late been very pleasant she had not felt as geraldine would have done the romance of living in the old monastic buildings in the calm shadow of the grand old minster yet something of the soothing of the great solemn quiet rested upon the spirit that hadsince six years oldnever known freedom from responsibility andsince fifteenhad borne the burthen of household economies and of school teaching it was a strange novelty to have meals provided without care of her own no shortcomings of servants to make up no claimant for her attention save a solitary patient and that one with lances temper wilmet had undergone a good deal from aldas clashes with the rest even felixs was only a temper well in hand and alternate fretfulness and penitence were regarded by her as part and parcel of geraldines ailments so that it was almost a surprise that her present convalescent never visited his discomforts upon her but was always patient and goodhumoured smiling whenever he could like his father before him as if according to the pretty spanish saying the sun had shone on his cradle at his birth his unselfish nature had made him a little uneasy when with cooler senses he remembered clements hint while love and instinct alike made him feel utterly unable to dispense with his motherly sister but when she had assured him that nothing could make him leave him as yet and when sister constance was known to be at bexley he threw it from his mind and was perfectly happy and contented  he could still exert no attention could neither read nor be read to nor occupy himself in any way but he was amused by talk around him and companionship was never lacking wilmet whose forte had never been conversation found herself in a stream of small talk with inquiring friends of all degrees in the hierarchy but was most at her ease when the female harewoods were prattling goodhumoured inconsequent chatter willie lying on the grass murmuring with lance or john lured into stories of indian surveying adventures in the cause of the ordnance map and when she was carried off to have her meals with the family she had put herself so entirely at the mercy of circumstances that she never seemed scandalised by their crazy unpunctuality their wonderful free and easy ways and customs of putting things to every use but the right did not censure grace or lucy for dawdling and gossiping whole mornings away and took it naturally when their mother inquired after her eldest brother by the alternate names of festus and frank and when she mentioned lances disaster as his coup detat and here was the last of these pleasant afternoons full of still sweet sounds midsummer hum above the soft ripple of the water close by the cawing of the rooks in the close all such peace that her heart quailed as she looked forward to the din of the high street at bexley and she strangled a sigh half way up her throat  the click of the cloister door was heard and lance awoke from a doze saying is that billyouve not been here since morning you vagabone  see what ive got for you said bill what do you say for that now  for lance with sparkling eyes was rising to his feet hurrah robin herself o robin a bobbin isnt this jolly and robina was entangled in that wonderful embrace peculiar to their own two selves too ecstatic for a word between them though as she received her sisters kiss she spoke rather pleadinglycherry and sister constance said i might wilmet and mrs harewood was so very kind as to send willie to fetch me to spend sunday do you mind wilmet  mind of course she doesnt said lance i was hungry to see you bob  it was very kind in mrs harewood said wilmet i must go and thank her only first how is cherry  much better she has been out for a drive with mr froggatt it will be all right now you are coming home mettie oh and dr lee is delighted to hear of lances going to ewmouth to make felix stay longer there oh if ever anything was so delightful as this place only i must see your prize lancey  as the two children linked their arms round one anothers waists to walk along the alley allsufficient to one another maybe there shot a little pang across wilmets breast no one had raptures for her she was felixs housekeeper and represented mother to all but since alda had been taken from her she had ceased to be any ones perfect equal and delight she might be valued but only like air or bread or any other necessary of life but she was foremost with no one lance had been everything to her and she to lance for full four weeks but she should never awaken the look on his face she had seen for robin such thoughts as these had never troubled her before it had been quite enough to know herself indispensable to all and there was no time for sentiment but this strange time of nursing had inspired a new sensation of yearning a softness and melancholy that she strove against vainly as weak and unnatural  the change had not been unperceived by lance for as his little sister looking at his sunken cheeks and feeling his thin bony hand poured out her pity he answered ive had rather a jolly time of it of late mettie is so delicious you cant think how her very voice and eyes seemed to do me good im sure that the belladonna lily cold hard painted thing was a mistake she must have been something much sweeter what do you think of a honeysuckle thats bright red and white and its leaves come out when nothing else does  but it trails about and doesnt stand alone  it has got a good stout hard stem that can make a bush of its own when it hasnt anything to twine upon i say robin thats just what you womenfolk should be always ready to twine and yet able to stick up for yourselves when youve got nothing to hang upon  well if wilmet was the honeysuckle im sure alda wasnt o lance it has been so horrid coming home without any one i wanted and all so queer and uncomfortable i would as soon have been at school or sooner for there i had home to think about  the last holidays werent firstrate said lance  no but then id got you  i wish dr manby would prescribe you to come with me said lance  its something to have this little sight and here i wanted to give this back lance  ah as he took the key of the violincase well take a look at her robin to see if shes quite well but i couldnt make her speak it would be like sticking daggers through my head  poor little key i looked at it so often when you were so bad and grieved to think you had missed all that pleasure only it was a comfort to know you had been so good about it  i am glad you took it robin i know i should have grown idle if i had had it depend on it twas that gave me this year of grace and the bishops prize  oh come and show me that i hope it is not packed up  no i wanted to take it to show felix but mettie says it is too big and would come to grief what prizes have you robin  three general good marks catechism and historybeautiful books  then the avenging harpies have forgiven you  pretty well and they were very kind when you were ill and the girls are much nicer i am glad we stayed on except for angels sake do you know lance i really am afraid she is going in for naughtiness  give a dog an ill name quoted lance is that it  i do believe it is that she is such a tomboy fancy one afternoon there was an awful uproar and her class were all found playing at races some riding astride with handkerchiefs round the forms which they had named after the real horses and the others pretending to bet on them with their books in their hands shouting out at the top of their voices  go it angel said lance laughing thats the way clems sisters improve the tone of the school  robina still looked distressed but that was soon forgotten in visiting lances quarters and admiring his books peeping respectfully at his silent violin and being lionised as far as his strength would permit they were hand in hand the whole evening till be was sent to bed and his sisters were claimed by the harewoods  the cathedral was resuming its usual voices on the sunday morning and when the early bell brought wilmet from her room she found lance up and dressed his little black gown on and his trencher cap in his hand  thats nice he said in admiration as she advanced in her fresh white pique and blue ribbons o mettie im so glad this isnt my last time here and he added as she bent over him and kissed him not quite able to speak please mettie i beg your pardon for all the times i have been tiresome or cross  my dear little boy she broke down and finished with another kiss for robina was at hand shy in her thankfulness and clinging to lances hand but as will harewood followed grave and subdued lance went up to him and put his arm into his mr harewood the captain and lucy were all likewise there but the greetings were silent and then mr harewood led them all through the library and was followed by the two boys to the sacristy for though the celebration was not choral all those of the choir who were present were always robed wilmet hardly liked not to keep her boy beside her but she could not be sorry when she saw the two friends once more heading the little procession together and with such happy grave faces though so different one broad ruddy sandy the other fair wasted delicate the hollow cheeks scarcely more coloured than the white linen and yet with a pure fresh air of bright hope and recovery  the cathedral was nobly and calmly beautiful in the summer morning the sunbeams high up in the slender brilliant windows that crowned the east and the voice sounding low and solemn in the distance at the altar to wilmet and robina it was a great deal more than the joyous festival they had last shared in there even though then they had exulted in their brothers jubilant notes and now he scarcely breathed a faint response left his book unopened and knelt in the dreamy passiveness of one incapable of actions of the mind but too simply happy and thankful to doubt of his welcome in his place clement would have distressed himself and his advisers over this inability to perform his usual mental exercises of devotion but lance never seemed to question but that he ought to lay himself before the altar in thankfulness as soon as he was able as certain of being welcomed there as by the kind hands that shook his in the sacristy  he came to breakfast afterwards at the harewoods to put an end to his invalid ways but the clatter soon was too much for him and he spent the chief part of the day lying on his bed able now to follow dreamily the echoes from the minster the full glories of which his sisters were enjoying there was afterwards a rush of his choir mates to shake hands with him and little dick graeme a delicate sallow blackeyed boy in whom wilmet believed she recognised the hero of the swans eggs could not be got rid of the whole day he lived at a farm three miles off and had been sent in to take his part on the sunday indeed he had often been at the door to inquire but had only been allowed momentary glimpses of lance whom he followed about like a little dog till at last late in the evening the proposal was started of walking him down to the river along which lay the path leading to his home  it was a charming summer evening when they set forth the three underwoods the two harewood brothers and little graeme slowly moving along robina in ecstasies with the loosestrife and forget menots and the boys absorbed in fish and waterrats till bill holding robin a little back pointed to a pollard and told her in a low hoarse voice that was where i left those verses  there robina tried to measure with her eye the distance which looked immense for such a run she could not speak but little dick turned  ay twas a jolly run in the time spyers and i tried it and both got blown but nobody runs like underwood  well it does look a goodish distance said lance and robin do you know it all came of this fellow being too good a poet he thought it was the tiber you know  the subject was the tiber wasnt it  ay and bill here got to spouting about horace cocles till he didnt know nor i either whether we were heathen romans or not it was a mercy he didnt go home in cocles costume  bill did not laugh he seemed to forget everything bystanders and all and threw his arm round his friends neck o lancey dont say a word more if you only could guess whatwhat this month has been like to me and now to see you standing here like your dear old self again oh if i could only and he broke off and rushed away behind the tree where they heard him sobbing  lance shrugged his shoulders poor old bill he will treat himself as if he did it on purpose but hell be better now hes had it out but dye see i cant go no farther now so you dick be off spare the feelings of your dutiful parents and get home in christianable time  i say please underwood may i have the bed by yours next half  thats not as it pleases underwood but mrs drake but look here graeme theres a little brat of a new treble coming into our dormitory you stand his friend and speak to harewood if bolt takes to bullying him  but youll be back said the child his face all consternation  i hope so but for fear of accidents you know good night dick and thank your mater for those stunning raspberries  thats a good dodge said will harewood emerging to keep the little ape from bullying the little one himself but you will be able to come back lance tis as dull as ditchwater without you  i shall be glad enough to come back said lance and make the most of this year i didnt know how i cared for this place theres nothing like it and he leant against a tree looking back at the cathedral where the sunbeams were weaving a parting crown for the tall tower and the soft grey of the exquisite stonework of the chapterhouse contrasted with the fresh green of the trees rising up from the sparkling river and emerald meadows presently he burst out you beautiful old thing and did you hush your grand glorious old voice only for me i should like to be your own and to serve you for ever  the other two felt a little awed at the outburst and possibly lance a little ashamed for he suddenly started from his tree trunk crying im sure we ought to go home however there are jack and mettie on beyond ever so far and he elevated his voice in a cooee after what he believed to be australian fashion but his weakness prevailed and he laughed at his own want of power to shout much above his breath you do it bill  not i cooee indeed tis coocoo there river and moonlight and all  at one and the same moment lance exclaimed jack and mettie thunder and ages and robina for shame willie while that personage cut a caper at once expressive of affirmation and amusement at their surprise  after all sagaciously observed lance im not so much surprised i think ive made a pretty good cupid  you believe it then cried robina  bless you affirmed willie weve been roasting jack about it for the last fortnightonly the pater was so awfully afraid of your sisters hearing it that he said any one who breathed the ghost of a joke near her should be shipped off to old aunt grace that instant  well they have my consent and blessing said lance  amen responded his friend  ho continued lance thats the meaning of old w w being so jolly i wondered whether it was only that i thought so because i had nothing to do but to look at her  oh you know she is a real true beauty and no mistake said bill beginning to feel a personal pride in her theres miles raving about her and every one runs about saying have you seen little underwoods handsome sister half the folks that came to ask after you did it to get a look at her and if she stayed a week longer she might have a dozen offers only luckily jack cut in first  well im glad she is even with alda was lances next sentiment  thats the one that is booked for the red indian you converted aint it asked bill fact robina we heard a new fellow was coming who had converted a cherokee and that the bishop had christened him in his war paint and feathers mrs shapcote sent out invitations to a missionary tea in honour of him  what of the cherokee  no no of the little brute of a missionary chap and we made up our minds to tar and feather him before he converted us but long before we had found out which of the new trebles was the model christian old shapcote had caught us two pitching into one another because i said bexley was a snobbish place full of pots and pans  and that founded your friendship  no not quite for we had a worse fight because i shut his bible up in his face when he tried to look over the lessons in the cathedral  why you all do said robina  yes now but before nixon came we were a horrid set of little ruffians do you remember lance how roper offered you a bullseye in the cathedral and thrashed you afterwards because you wouldnt have it  o lance but that was persecution cried robina who would have thought you went through things like that  ay said bill you believed in the little cherub chorister boys that sing and look out of their great violet eyes till they die of declines  ah said lance who was leaning on his arm rather wearily jack will do for himself if he tells wilmet her eyes are violet it is like a red rag to a bull  yes said robina she says nobody ever had eyes the colour of violets and they would be hideous if they were  i have seen them said willie gravely  oh where cried robina darker blue than edgars  its generally only one at a time  after a cricket match eh suggested lance  but depend upon it said bill while robina was recovering her laughing disgust he may tell her her eyes are any colour he pleases by this time  how do you know that sharply protested robin as if she would care for him more than for all of us who cant spare her either  i thought you were thick and plenty up the country  not of that sort said lance  i dont believe it insisted robina why she had never seen him a few weeks ago she cant have had time to get to like him  thats your simplicity said bill now aint that oraculari mean oculardemonstration there they are very moral of people making fools of themselves in books  i wish theyd have done with it then sighed lance my legs wont hold out much longer  yes you must go in said robin bringing her sturdy shoulders for his other arm to rest on  but those two said lance some one must stay to make it respectable dont laugh you vagabone you shake up the marrow of my bones im her brother and bound to see to her  ill stay out with willie if that will make it right said robina only you must go to bed and you have to be up so early too  so they saw him to the bailey door beyond which he declined further assistance saying he could tumble into bed alone and leaving them to their pleasant task of making propriety  it was made after this sort bill delivered himself of a deep sigh and observed well if shes done for i suppose i must take up with you and after all youre the jolliest  i shall never be jolie like wilmet if thats what you mean said robina not quite understanding whether it were jest or earnest  well if you aint a regular stunner like her it doesnt much matter i never did see a face that i liked better than your round one and i know i shall like it more and more wont you have me robina one of these days  o willie oughtnt one to wait till we are old enough to think about it  i dont see why i shall always be thinking im working for you and i dont see why you shouldnt think the same of me wont you again he repeated at least of course i shall do all the work for you  oh no i should not like that i had rather be doing something for you willie look here i am learning all i can now and when i go out  go out  for a governess  murther ill hinder that  but willie you cant make a fortune in five years and i shall go out at eighteen i think i shall begin the fortune soonest and she laughed merrily  mother didnt make a fortune  i didnt mean that exactly but im learning all the superior branches and if i got a hundred a year think of that will if i went on with that till you are a clergyman and have a living how nice it would be there would be plenty to give away and if we were poor i would take girls to teach  do you think i shall ever let you do all the work that way said will strong in boyhoods infinite possibilities i dont know how its to be but ill keep you out of slaving though youre a dear girl to think of it any way robin you and i will hold together always  i am sure i shall never like anybody half so much said robin  shall we break a sixpence and keep the halves thats the thing aint it i believe ive got oneor fourpence which is all the same  no no said robina backing i dont think mettie would like it it doesnt seem right  but arent you in earnest robin  oh yes indeed indeed i am from the depths of a very earnest childish heart that little knew to what it pledged itself  and so am i ill never care for any one else robinanever  nor i william here they come  the other two had not got near so far though captain harewood was talking and wilmet listening as would never have been the case without the influence willie asserted but the special charm that enchained wilmet was entirely unapprehended by her till just as the first star brightened and the hues faded from the landscape she bethought her of her patient and perceived that he had gone in how late it must be i must go and see after him i hope he is equal to the journey  i will come and bring you an account of him on my way home if i may  oh thank you but it is taxing your goodness tootoo much  cannot you believe how glad i am to have a good excuse and the tone gave wilmet a sudden thrill so that she answered not and he continued i am going to beg leave to be sometimes at bexley  when felix is at home faltered wilmet  i can hardly afford to wait my time at home is so short i shall i hope make friends with him tomorrow and perhaps you will neither of you forbid me to come again i am asking nothing now only opportunity to try to make you  oh dont hurriedly broke in wilmet standing still in consternation  nay he said in a pleading voice i know it would be presumption to think so short an acquaintance could suffice but you see i have so little time and all i want is leave to use it in coming to see you  oh dont she repeated indeed you had better not it would be only pain i couldnt and i cant have felix worried and there was a startled sob in her voice but he answered with the strength and sweetness that had upheld her in lances most suffering moments  i would not distress you or felix for more than words can utter i would not have breathed a hint of this most earnest wish of my heart till you had had some preparation if it were not so impossible otherwise to have any chance of being with you and striving  please entreated wilmet that is just what should be avoided it can never come to anything and the sooner it is stopped the better  why should it never come to anything he asked encouraged by detecting tears in her voice  because you knowno you dont know or you never could think of such a thinghow wrong and impossible it would be for me  no i dont know that is what i want to have the opportunity of knowing  i can tell you before she answered faintly oh if you would but take my word for it it would save so much  no that i cannot do he repeated i must see for myself your preciousness at home  she broke in again please please im saying what i ought not but it is to hinder distress dont want to let us get to like each other any better for as yet it cant be more than what could be got over and it is only making pain to let it grow  that i deny so far as i am concerned the thing is done if you wanted to save me that pain you should have turned me out the moment i saw you call the boy back to life a month like this is not so easily got over  wilmet dropped her head and made no answer  so since you see he continued you will spare me nothing by holding me aloof will you not let me come and gladden myself while i may in your presence and then when my time is up it may be more possible to judge there was a faint oh no but he heeded it not whether you can bear such an ugly fellow enough to let him look to the time when home claims may be less pressing i look for no answer i only want to be able to ask for one three months hence and i shall beg your brother to put it into my power so to do  ah but to have felix disturbed and worried is just what must not be it has made him ill already and if he thought  i promise not to harass him said captain harewood gently you may trust me to take care that what i shall say will not cause him any very trying perplexity  if you knew sighed wilmet  i hope to know he replied i do know enough already to be aware that you stand in no common relation to the rest and if you have my heart wilmet it must follow that somehow i share in your self devotion do not fear my trying to make you less yourself i want not to take you away from your burthens but to share them  yes youthat is your goodness but would it be right in us she faltered  leave your brother and me to judge of that he said  they were already at the bailey door in the shadow of the buildings the flood of moonlight lying on the tower above and one little mysterious lamp under the deep brow of the archway of the passage no more passed but one goodnight from each he had not even seen her face under her shady hat while she hastened to her little room glad to ascertain that lance was fast asleep and with a rush of new sensations bursting on her against which she was strengthening all the dykes of her resolute nature hehethat it should be he how good how generous how kind oh it would be so happy it will make me happy that he only just thought of it but it wont do it is no use im not in love with him i wont be im not im not  and as ardently as wilmet had ever prayed for lances life and reason by that little bed did she beseech not to be tempted to desert her duties and all night she lay between sleep and waking ever repeating to herself im not in love im not im not     chapter xix  the house without pillars    and who save she could soothe the boy  or turn his tears to tears of joy                              samuel rogers   lances train was at six oclock and that by which the sisters were to return to bexley so little later that they would await it at the station so the household was betimes more or less afoot there was a frenzied scramble of maids and young ladies in hasty toilette yet breakfast was only forthcoming by personal exertion on the part of the captain who made the coffee boiled the eggs and sent his brother foraging into the kitchen then a message came that mother must see the sweet girl to bid her goodbye and wilmet was dragged up to find the paddy good natured face in bed in an immense frilled nightcap whence two hornlike curl papers protruded she was kissed cried over and told she was the dearest girl and jack the best boy in the four kingdoms and while her head was turning round between dizziness at all that this cordiality implied and a governesss confusion whether these were the four kingdoms of ireland or england ireland scotland and wales a demand followed for the darling boy but when she had gravely told the captain that his mother wanted him the result was to send him down laughing no no im not the only darling boy in the world tis you lance you know the way  between finding her in bed and being powerfully embraced lances sense of decorum brought him down with his blanched cheeks so rosy red that the family were choking with suppressed mirth when the omnibus called for the luggage and the party set forth to walk to the station lance in a grass hat enfolded by the captains hands in an ample puggery and provided with a natty blue umbrella presented by the librarian as a shield against the fardarting apollo  if this had been in my day he said some wit would have produced a neat epigram on phoebus playing his old tricks out of jealousy of wills verses but dainty feats of scholarship are gone out of date well patroclus when we have you back again i think we shall none of us mourn over the effects of your generous action  wilmet was near enough to hear and colour she had imagined the last nights conversation unknown to all but underwood reticence was so incapable of guessing at harewood communicativeness that it never entered her brain to suspect the topic of conversation between the three juniors as they walked up the drowsy street  thanks to the difficulties of getting under weigh from the harewood house there was barely time for john and lance to take their places while mr harewood got their tickets and they were whirled off leaving the others to promenade the platform just then a complete solitude  mr harewood with the attention of the old school backed by something warmer gave wilmet his arm he and his son john never seemed to belong to so ramshackle a household as the rest and he was so gentle and fatherly that when wilmet found him aware of all it was a relief to tell her objections without being answered by a lover after all she could only repeat that leaving home was so impossible for her that as she murmured he had better not get to like me any more it would be such a pity for him  that said mr harewood with his air of oldfashioned gallantry depends on the esteem in which wealth or merit is held  and station said wilmet in an undertone  for that my dear one would be a fool not to honour you and your brother besides it may make you more at ease to hear that my father was an apparitor and i went to oxford as a servitor so that in birth you have the advantage of us of course i do not mean that every one does not in the abstract prefer prosperous matches but john has a fair independent competence and can afford to do as he pleases and for my part i should be very sorry if this were not what he pleased  you are so very kind but surely ifeven ifit must be such long waiting and you would not like that for him  let us arrive at the if before we settle about the waiting said mr harewood in truth i have long looked on john as so much the most sensible person in my house that all i feel called on to do is to hope for his success i know both you and he will be wise enough not to be either selfish or unselfish in the wrong place  wilmet did not quite understand but she carried away the conviction that she need have no scruple as to the parents cordial approbation and she had had her cure from yesterdays sense of want of individual affection as to the future of course it swelled her heart to think of such love and generous kindness but she tried to believe that she was as much touched by the goodness of the father as by that of the son and she would be on her guard against herself unless she saw some reasonable hope that home would ever dispense with her dear wilmet would she not at any other time have thought it an outrage to think of such a possibility at any rate she thought nobody but felix need ever know  little guessed she as robina sat opposite kept silent by the presence of two stout old females that the child was revolving the question whether she might tell cherry she knew that wilmet would not like her affairs to be discussed without her own permission but it seemed unfair that when all the harewoods were openmouthed her own sister should know nothing after all much would depend on the chances of a teteatete  at the station stood clement thats right i thought you would come by this train what a comfort how is lance  almost well how are you getting on  you will soon see for yourself in an ominous tone  just then she was accosted by mr ryder who was waiting for his own train and after courteous and anxious inquiries said i was thinking of writing to your eldest brother but perhaps a word from you would do as well  about bernard  why yes i dont quite see my way about him he is a sharp little fellow and very well taught in fact he can afford to do nothing but waste time somehow a boy will now and then seem to come into school with the wrong foot foremost  has he fallen in with idle boys  so i fear i placed him in a form high for his age but where the lags have got hold of him and make him think idleness the thing so i gather i conclude he is not to remain here  do you mean that you wish him to be taken away asked wilmet in consternation  no no dont understand it in that sense said mr ryder anxiously i only meant that he is doing no good here and that possibly a change or the stimulus of preparing for an examination might rouse him goodbye  and there mr ryder had to rush off to secure his seat  oh good morning miss underwood this was from mr mowbray smith a few steps beyond the station i am glad to see you back so your patient is gone to join your eldest brother but we shall have you here on sunday then theres the less occasion to name it but some notice should be taken of the behaviour yesterday evening  it was very sad interposed clement but when once set off by the christening they could not stop themselves  scarcely a valid excuse said mr smith severely as he made his parting bow you know this was not all  clement shrugged his shoulders exclaiming so he made that into a personality you must know there was an unusually squalling baby whose godmother went on giving its name as huggeny and there was a five minutes exchange of what on mr smiths side and huggeny on hers till a whisper came all alongforwarded from the mother i supposesame as they does their air and then mr smith looked more mystified than ever some one suggested same as the empress of the french  something might be excused on such provocation owned wilmet laughing  if that had been all said clement but angel and bernard choose to go and sit by themselves and i could see from felixs place in the choir that they were tittering long after i shook my head but nares must needs make up an odious imitation and bernard not only touches angel to make her look but grins impudently at me i found myself growing burning hot with shame and whenever they looked at me their heads went down and their shoulders worked  naughty children said wilmet but with more than usual lenience to the combined effects of huggeny and of clements severe countenance in producing one of those paroxysms of giggle that seem invincible in proportion to their unbecomingness the door was reached and instantly opened stella springing into her arms in ecstasy sisters comeo sister sister sister dont ever go away any more  there was a great deal of confused kissing and embracing as she made her way upstairs but oh my tedo what has happened for she beheld a fine sample of bill harewoods violet eye  it was bernards stick went into his eye when we were playing at hockey said stella he did cry terribly but sister constance put such nice stuff  sister constance oh thank you but hockey in the garden  i thought it rather a remarkable proceeding quietly observed the sister  i must hear more about it said wilmet my poor dear little man cant he let sister go for one instantcherry dear how are you  all right now you are come but dear little lance how is he looking  not much worse than you do my cherry said wilmet as she saw that the wizened old fairy look was come back you have been worse than i knew  oh i am all right now and i have had such a treat of sister constance  i want to take her back with me said the sister dr lee would like to have her under his eye and if you can spare her i would write today and she could go with me tomorrow  it is very kind it might be better for her  of course interrupted alda it is good for any one to be away from this horrid smell of baked earth and all these riotous children  ah said wilmet didnt i see the shade of the lamp in the landingplace broken how was that  oh the children of course said alda  but neither child spoke and wilmet perceived that only the twins were in the room both hanging upon her while she swallowed her hurried second breakfast  no one will tell said clement it was done the day i went over to minsterham i did all i could to find out  yes and made them more obstinate than before said alda  another catastrophe here suddenly struck wilmet namely a long and very badlymended rent in stellas spotted pink frock which to say the truth did not look as if it were monday morning  yes said stella i did try to mend it as well as i could sister but there wasnt another workaday frock clean  your mending exclaimed wilmet but how did you tear it  when i tumbled into the brambles and was lost  lost my dear what does she mean  it is quite true said cherry angela and bernard took her out fishing to balls hatch on saturday and lost her only luckily we did not know anything about it till she was safe at home again dear little darling  but stella how was it cried the horrified wilmet clasping her the closer  i could not bear to see the poor worms said stella bear would cut them up to stick on his hook so i got away out of sight of them and gathered the dear little wild roses and honeysuckles and when i wanted to find them again i couldnt and nobody heard me when i called and a robin looked at me and i thought he wanted to bury me and i ran away and a great bush caught hold of me and scratched my legs and tore out a great piece of the rim of my hat and just then a good lady came by and helped me up and to look for them but we could not see them anywhere so she took me to her housesuch a dear little house all over rosesand she mended my hat and i mended my frock and she gave me some tea and plumcake and two dear little ponies came to the door and a carriage and she brought me home  who was she  miss crabbe she is new to the place said cherry mr froggatt said she had only been once in the shop before tell sister how you told her about yourself stella  she asked my name said the child and she said it was a very funny one and she could not understand it and then she wanted to know whose little girl i was and i said brother felixs and then she said have you no papa or mamma so i told her i hadnt a papa or mamma but a father and mother up in heaven and she said i should think so poor little dear if there is no one to take more care of you i really did think she wanted to take me and keep me for an adopted child so i told her that i had lots of dear good brothers and sisters that wanted me very much indeed and i must go home to h froggatt and f c underwood high street bexley  i fancy said cherry that she thought mr froggatt was stellas grandfather for she made him quite a speech about the neglect of the childsuch a nicemannered little girl she said but she would not come in nor let alda be called  nor should i have gone down if mr froggatt had thought proper to call me said alda imagine me in his office  i cant imagine not going anywhere to thank the person that brought home my little star said wilmet holding her arm close round the child and kissing her repeatedly but what became of the other two  i went out after them said clement and found them rushing wildly about after her afraid to come home to do them justice i believe they were almost out of their minds thinking she must have tumbled into the river  oh indeed said alda thats your account of it  yes said cherry eagerly all that pretending not to care and that it was a trick of stellas was nothing but reaction and then you know clem you did improve the occasion  there exclaimed alda you see how it is wilmet nothing but vindication of those two intolerable children now just come wilmet and see if they are to be backed up in this  but as wilmet perfectly bewildered and feeling no hope of comprehension among so many followed alda from the room and up the stairs stella came plunging after with a cry alda alda dont hurt them just as from a housemaids closet half way up alda was bringing to light a basin containing a dozen tadpoles twirling their shadowy tails  now wilmet she solemnly said do you approve of all those horrid brutes swimming in my bath  they arent in the well i hope said wilmet  how can you be so absurd wilmet thats the way those children showed their sorrow that clement talks about ill never believe but he helped them  to weep them said a voice above and angelas face was seen looking out of her bush of hair over the balusters of the top storey they are just like black heraldic tears  you dont mean that they put them in asked wilmet  what else should i mean  and didnt she squall shouted bernard and then came a duet        dame dame what makes your ducks to squall       duck to squall duck to squall duck to squall       meeting o pollywogs meeting wi pollywogs   hush children this is shocking said wilmet in the low impressive voice by which she could always still a tumult how could you take advantage of my absence to do this  because alda deserved it cried angela bouncing downstairs there alda i said i should tell of you if you told of us  angela that is not the way to speak to your elder sister  she isnt like an elder sister exclaimed angel stella would be ashamed to do like her eating up the strawberries mr froggatt brought for poor cherry when she was ill  im sure you had your share retorted alda  you would have them in for dessert and you helped us only sister constance and clem left all theirs for cherry and then you went by yourself and ate them all up  the very fact of shouting out such a charge showed a state of insubordination such as might make wilmets hair stand on end and she simply disbelieved so childish an accusation against her own equal in age you should not say such things angela she answered in her low tone of reproof there must be a mistake  i am afraid it is quite true said clements quiet voice as he stood arrested on his way by the block upon the landingplace  the children make such an uproar said the exasperated alda im sure i thought geraldines had been taken long before and in this parching weather fruit is quite a necessity to me  wilmet was too much aghast at the admission to speak it was a strange tangle clement standing straight and still on the landing place wilmet with theodore humming to himself as innocent of the fray as the tadpoles that stella was cherishing in the cupboard doorway alda flushed and angry and on the upper flight angela and bernard dancing and roaming in vehement excitement between anger and alarm well that lance was not in this hubbub thought deafened and amazed wilmet  what has this to do with the tadpoles she asked in an endeavour to comprehend  we said she should be served out sung bernard with a polly pollypollywog bath  but bernard hushangel dont you see it was no business of yours if alda did forget  she was unprepared for the outbreak this brought on her you too wilmet every one backs up those children in their behaviour to me lady herbert somerville and clement and all if only ferdinand saw it  just step up wilmet said clement gently and see whether the children are in league with me  he followed wilmet up to the door of the barrack an attic that he shared with lance and bernard and showed the long beam that crossed it pasted with a series of little figures cut out in paper representing a procession in elaborate vestments and at the end a longbacked individual kneeling before the chair of a confessor who bore a painful resemblance to the vicar of st matthews  we only wanted to make tina feel at home giggled angela  it would be no matter pursued clement if it were merely quizzing myself i am used to that but this is trenching on sacred ground  bless me your old white beam exclaimed angela with an affected start  it is exceedingly improper and irreverent said wilmet i am ashamed that such a thing should have been done in this house  really said alda it seems to me very droll and clever with no harm in it at all only people like clement never can take a joke  you cant mean to justify such a one as this said wilmet but to her still greater astonishment alda broke out  there you are turning against me you are taking clements part though you didnt care what they did to menot if it had been snakes and adders  this decidedly in mrs thomas underwoods style elicited a peal of laughter from the two naughty children and the corners of clements mouth relaxed bringing alda to a gush of tears you never used to be like this to me wilmet  i never saw you like this dear alda said wilmet low and gently but in decided repression come into our room and let me try to understand  so began a morning of mutual complaints as if everybody were against everybody agreeing in nothing but in appealing to the elder sister first there was aldas story never had there been such a miserable timewith geraldine interfering fussy fretful faultfinding clement intolerable in primness and conceit only making the children worse when he pretended to keep them in order and making such a fuss about geraldine when nothing ailed her but change of weather incurring the expense of the dearport doctor and bringing down the sister upon them so awkward to have her in the drawingroom in that dress but sisters always thrust themselves into families she hoped she had shown my lady that she was not to be overawed by a title such affectation not using it no consideration for her the servants regularly spoilt both of them martha a vulgar insolent creature and sibby disgustingly familiar and slovenly no good at all not even to keep theodore out of the way at which theodore knowing no more than his own name and aldas displeasure set up a dismal howl and as wilmet chose to coax and fondle him into silence instead of scolding and turning him out alda went off in a huff muttering about asylums and proper places and wilmet descended to the kitchen the little weak hand clasped tight into hers  a sore sight awaited her below the bills of this month for luxuries of sinful extravagance in her economical eyes chicken and asparagus ducks and peas even in the height of their season were enormities to such housekeeping as hers and had raised the sum total to four times the amount that her foreboding soul had dreaded it exceeded her present supplies and was a grave addition to the expenses of the two illnesses that were serious enough already  martha was eloquent not to say defiant in selfdefence you see miss underwood if id been let alone or miss cherry had been the one to take my orders from which we could have made it out to your satisfaction but with miss halder which expects everything to be just like what it was in the fammerly up in london which it stands to reason as it cant which she hasnt got no more notion than a baby of prices nor seasons nor nothink which is very determined too which wont suffer a word from nobody which if you hadnt been coming home miss underwood id have given warning which have always given you satisfaction  wilmets satisfaction was not increased when she encountered sibby ah my darling missie dear yere the jewel thats been longed for the whole house has been mad entirely and lost widout you the children rampaging and playing pranks and miss cherry dwining and pining to a skeleton so that but for master clem and that holy woman the sisther tis scarce alive yed have found her miss alda shes the very wonder of the worruld for jealousy and unfeelingness i up and told her at last there was wellnigh as much differ between you and she as between stella and this blessed lamb that she spites for if you have not carried off all the wit and understanding sure tis you that has got all the heart and the head and the hands  and the partial old nursey sibby you see i had no time nor thought but for poor lance and alda was so new to it  ah missie dear you were always the one to vindicate her but tis no use newness twasnt newness that makes her turn the back of her hand to this darling innocent till he cries if hes left a moment with heray my precious what would have become of you and me but for masther clemi tell you miss wilmet i never thought that long boy the aquil of his brothers till i saw him in time of need yer father himselfheaven be his bedcouldnt have been tenderer with theodore nor miss cherry by night or by day an never a cross word when he was bothered past his life with miss aldas ugliness an the childrens boldness  oh those children what is come to them sibby  only funning and merriment missie dear theyd never have had to be faulted if miss alda had let miss cherry deal with them but she could neither rule them herself nor bear to see them ruled and though she was like a mad cow if they played their pranks on her she backs them up if miss cherry or master clem or even the sisther do but say a word to them so tis no wonder if the poor dears have been a bit off their heads but theyll be as quiet as doves now yere back again oh missie dear my own child but its you that are the light of my eyes looking the blooming beauty that you are  the fostermothers genuine compliment could not lighten the load that had grown every moment heavier and more compunctious for the deaf ear she had turned to clement wilmet said a word or two of apology to him when she met him on the stairs loaded with books to study in the garden  never mind he magnanimously answered it is all right now you are come and it was impossible before only please do say something warm to sister constance for alda is barely civil to her  i am very sorry i did not think alda had that sort of prejudice said wilmet whose instinct of defence of alda had wonderfully diminished  the chief prejudice came of my sending for her said clement  besides sister constance spoke out very sharply about the strawberries and when we had a couple of chickens and alda scolded me for helping her to a leg instead of a wing sister constance said oh i supposed you had them on geraldines account and she gives the children leave to do anything sister constance objects to these things are hardly their fault but i say mettie now you are come and it is all right do you think i might go to st matthews the vicar and mr sterling are alone while the other curates are holidaymaking and they say i could really be of some use to them and they would give me some help with this reading for my examination somers is there too and i have not seen him since christmas  indeed said wilmet no one has deserved a holiday more than you clement you have done your best  thisalmost the first home praise or thanks that had fallen to his lotelicited that real grace of humility for which poor self conscious clement really strove i have tried mettie he said with tears in his eyes but it was not as if it had been one of the others there must be something very wrong about me to make me so disagreeable  you have gained two hearts said wilmet sibbys and this little fellows  for theodore had attached himself limpet fashion to clement who with difficulty piled his books so as to leave a hand free for him  he had better come with me said wilmet your reading must have been dreadfully interrupted  it has rather said clement whose examination was in alarming proximity but i dont mind him i can work to his tunes as well as felix can and all is right now you are come  that was the burthen of every ones song it came next from cherry whom she found in her own room there was so much bustle in the sittingroom she said  my dear you have gone through a great deal  theres nae luck about the house when our gude mans awa said cherry clem played and whistled that so often that alda begged never to hear it again but unluckily tedo had caught it and i dont think she quite believes he doesnt hum it on purpose but now how delicious it is to have got at least our gude woman and oh dear wilmet i beg your pardon but you do look so lovely i cant help telling you so or is it the pleasure of seeing you  my poor cherry i did not think half enough about you  that would have done no good most of this rose out of my own crossness and horridness if i could only be anxious without being peevish  now cherry dont waste time in telling me it was your own fault i know all about that i really want to understand how it has all been with alda and clement i am afraid alda has not been behaving nicely  to hear wilmet allow alda to be other than impeccable so amazed cherry that she could scarcely answer o mettle i never knew what you and felix must be i have so often thought of a house divided against itself one against two and two against three we have been all to wrongs and clem and i have said we would not be a party and yet we could not help it for we always had to stand up together then angel and bear were against every one and alda set them against clem and fancied he did against her which was not true i should have minded nothing if alda had not been so angry at clements sending for sister constance you did give him leave though  yes and i should have done so much more decidedly if i had known  at that moment sister constance knocked at the door with her work in her hand and wilmet inferred that this was the refuge from alda and the drawingroom to cherrys surprise wilmet instead of ignoring everything unsatisfactory began at once please come in sister constance i wanted to thank you and tell you how sorry and ashamed i am i am afraid you have not been treated as  dont say any more my dear as the tears were in her eyes dont think about it  i ought to think said wilmet i have been trying to understand things ever since i came home but everybody except cherry and clem blames everybody and they only blame themselves i cant understand the rights of anything  my dear said sister constance i think it would be impossible to go into the details of all that has happened shall i tell you how it seemed to me  pray do  i thought that the authority of an elder reared in so different a school necessarily was producing a few collisions there was some ignorance and a good deal of dislike of interference and the younger ones would not have been human not to take advantage of it but it is over now you are come home and i strongly recommend an act of oblivion  oh i dont want to punish the poor children said wilmet  oblivion i said not only amnesty and as she did not see perfect comprehension in wilmets face she added i mean not only that the children should be forgiven but that their elders should not go hunting for causes and thinking how this or that could have been prevented  i suppose not said wilmet it is all plain enough and the sigh that followed quite amazed cherry who smiled up in her face saying plain enough that we cant do without you  no said wilmet kissing cherrys uplifted face ere leaving the room but it was with such an effort at a responding smile that cherry exclaimed oh dear how dreadfully we have vexed her and sister constance thought the more  yet again wilmet had to hear another testimony to the anarchy in her absence those formidable bills had obliged her to apply to alda for an advance of the sum she had offered for lances journey and this after some petulance and faltering elicited that some old forgotten london bills had come down and swamped this midsummer quarters allowance so that the promise must stand over tilltill michaelmas or it might be that ferdinands matters were arranged and then what would such a paltry sum be wilmet turned away in shame and disgust at having trusted for a moment to such offers she could only do what she had never done beforeapply to mr froggatt for an advance on felixs account and she detained him after dinner for the purpose  he was as kind as possible assuring her that he should have been hurt if she had not come to him and then in his blandest way he thought it right to hint that young people were sometimes a little unguarded she was prepared for the story of the loss of stella but she was not prepared to hear of a gossipping intercourse over the newly arrived punches etc carried on in the early morning with redstone not only by bernard but angela she was but eleven years old so it was no worse than the taste of childish underhand coquetry and giggling there was no fear of its continuance after felixs return and indeed good old mr froggatt had kept guard by coming in two hours earlier ever since the discovery but the propensity dismayed wilmet more than all that had yet happened and on this head she thought it right to reprove angela seriously  dear me wilmet you are always telling us not to think ourselves above our station mr redstone is just as fit to speak to as felix was before he was a partner  should you like felix to have found you gossipping in the reading room  well said audacious angela half the fun in things is the chance of being caught  my dear you dont know what you are saying replied wilmet dejectedly as if exhausted beyond the power of working out her reproof and angela had to fight hard against any softening telling bernard that w w was a tremendous old maid who had no notion of a lark  robina who stood in the peculiar position of neither accusing nor being accused would not add her voice to the chorus of welcome and did not wonder that every hour wore off something from the radiance of the beautiful bloom brought from the bailey indeed the unusual gravity and reserve of the younger sister struck cherrys observant eyes and made her think at first that she had been much pained by having to part with lance in his weak halfrecovered state but when at teatime the whole history of the illness was inquired into in detail by the assembled family the downcast eyes and cheeks with which robin encountered every mention of captain harewoods good offices led to the inference that she had in her excitement forgotten the bounds where the brook and river meet and was in an anguish of shame wilmet meantime looking flushed with the fag of her vexatious day and speaking plentifully of this same captain proving to herself all the while that she was doing so with ordinary gratitude and composure  robina was quartered upon geraldine in the holiday crowding of the house and somewhere about four oclock on the summer morning cherry wakening as usual and reaching for her book heard a voice from the corner asking if she wanted anything no thank you bobbie go to sleep again  i cant ive been thinking about it all night i think hes coming today  who  captain harewood he promised to come and tell us how lance and felix are  i am very glad but wilmet never said so  no but o cherry i wish we could contrive some nice quiet place but nothing is ever quiet in this house  no said geraldine who was but too well aware of the fact though i cant imagine that any harewood can be distressed on that score  oh but said robina to whom the communication began to feel so momentous that she could not help toying round it before coming to the pointi know at least i am sure he will want to see her particularly  you robin what have you got into your head said cherry trying to misunderstand but feeling a foreboding throb of consternation  it is not my head willie told me and as she detected a sigh of relief and it is no nonsense of his either he did it on sunday evening by the riverside  he did it repeated geraldine willing to take a moments refuge in the confusion of antecedents though too well aware what must be coming  you know what i mean hejackjohncaptain harewood had it out with her when we were all walking together  my dear impossible  i mean we were out of hearing but we saw them at it and walked up and down till lance got tired out and willie and i stayed to make it proper  geraldine relieved herself by a little laugh and said in a superior tone of elderly wisdom but my dear there might be a walk even without what you call doing it  yes reiterated robina but i know for the captain shut himself up with mr harewood when we came in and bill heard his father telling his mother about it at night through the wall  for shame robin  oh he told them long ago that he could hear and they dont care besides mrs harewood told him himself when he went in to wish her good morning and she kissed me and lance too about it and said they hadnt their equals and poor mettie thinks no one knows of it but their two selves and maybe mr harewood  but robin i dont know how to understand it i think she would have told alda at least  perhaps she has tonight said robina but you see she didnt accept him  oh then it doesnt signify  not out and out i mean and it is only because of us at least we are sure she likes him  we you and willie  and lance he saw it all the time he was getting well besides the captain told his father that she wouldnt listen to him and would have hindered his going to felix if lance had been fit to travel alone  then it is not an engagement now  no she wont let it be  and he is coming today  yes after he has seen felix o cherry he is so nice kind and bright like all the harewoods and not ridiculous and lance does like him so  does wilmet  we are almost sure as lance says she has never looked so bright or so sweet or so pretty do you think it is love cherry  we shall see said cherry if she tells us nothing we can judge and ifif  her voice died away into contemplation and after waiting in vain for more robina somewhat resentfully decided that she had fallen asleep in her very face  no more was said till dressingtime when there were a few speculations whether alda knew and cherry could not help auguring that something had opened wilmets eyes to her twins possible deficiencies sister constance came and seeing her patients paleness accused the sisters of untimely bedroom colloquies and as they pleaded guilty robin was struck by the air of fixed resolution on cherrys thin white face  there was no sign of any confidence having been made to alda wilmet plunged into her longdeferred holiday task of inspecting the family linen and when she came back with a deep basket an announcement that every one must mend and adapt and portions of darning and piecing for geraldine and robina they began to feel as if the mornings conversation was a dream  but just as dinner was near its close there were steps on the stairs the drawingroom door was opened and shut and sibby unnecessarily coming through the folding leaves announced over the head of clement captain harewood  come to tell about lance cried angela leaping up and followed by bernard alda and even mr froggatt indeed in the existing connection of chairs tables and doors a clearance of that side of the table was needful before any one else could stir wilmet moved after them and clement was heard exclaiming you are pinning me down bobbie  i know oh shut the door there are more than enough there already  true said sister constance signing to clement to obey i meant to go to my room but cherry wants to hear of her brothers  no she doesnt cried robina at least oh will nobody get the others out and leave them to themselves  why bobbie what nonsense is this said clement one would think you took them for ferdinand and alda  it is all the samestella you run out to the gardenby that door you child and then it all came out to the two fresh auditors who listened with conviction and now concluded robina there is not a place where he can so much as speak to her what shall we do to get them away  you do not know yet that she wishes it said sister constance who had been a wife before she was a sister and saw that it was matronly tact and tenderness that the crisis needed but ill tell you what you can safely and naturally do go in and fetch cherrys folding chair and call the children to carry her appurtenances down to the garden that will make a break and wilmet can take advantage of it if she sees fit  alda is worse than ten children said clement she has an inordinate appetite for captains in the absence of her own  it cant be helped better do too little than too much  and finding robina shy and giggling and clement shy and irresolute sister constance herself made the diversion by opening the door when wilmets nervous look and manner was confirmation strong lady herbert somervillecaptain harewood was aldas formal introduction in her bad taste while the sister after shaking hands bade bernard take geraldines chair to the lawn  oh are we to go out said alda a good move of all things i detest in summer a town house is the worst ill just fetch a hat i want to show my pet viewour brothers are always fighting about their churches captain harewood  the thing was done mr froggatt was already gone and as aldas trappings were never quickly adjusted it needed very little contrivance to leave a not unwilling pair on one side of the doors and cut off the rest robina too much excited to stand still flew about the stairs till alda appeared in a tiny hat fluttering with velvet tails  are they gone out  yes for quite enough to constitute a they were gone and when alda reached them they sedulously set themselves to detain her and thereby betrayed the reason  nonsense how absurd that horrid little fright of a redhaired man no doubt poor dear wilmet only wants me to go and put an end to it  strictly speaking this was selfassertion she had not the assurance to intrude and she contented herself with keeping cherry on thorns by threatening to go in and declaring that the whole must be untrue since wilmet had not told her  time went on very slowly and at last wilmet about four oclock was seen advancing with theodore in one hand and her great basket of mending in the other and before alda had time to rise from her chair robina darted across the grass with flaming cheeks and low hurried frightened confessionwilmet please it is honest to tell you willie harewood knows and told me and i couldnt help it i told them to keep away  it always happens so said wilmet less discomposed than robina expected though she had evidently been shedding tears not that there is anything to tell  nothing cried robina looking blank  of course not he came to bring me a note from felix i hope no one knows but those three  and sister constance  then take care no one does  but o wilmet please you have not put an end to it all  no said wilmet they will not let me though i think it would have been wiser i do not know how it is to be except that it is utterly impossible for the present  with this much from the fountainhead robina was forced to content herself and she had tact enough not to join the trio under the tree but to betake herself to clement who had gone off with his books  so said alda lightly you have cheated us of another view of your conquest mettie  he wanted to catch the 345 train said wilmet gravely  you must have been very unmerciful to despatch him so soon i thought you must want me to come to your rescue but those romantic children wouldnt let me  thank you said wilmet  my dear you dont mean that you are smitten well i cant flatter you as to his beauty and yet after all situated as you are it is a catchthat is if he has anything but his pay but of course he hasnt  yes said wilmet abstractedly his father told me he hadwhat did he call ita fair independent competence of his own oh they are so kind  then o wilmet is it really so asked geraldine with eager eyes clasped hands and quivering frame infinitely fuller of visible emotion than either of the handsome twins  idont know  my dear wilmet cried alda excited you cant surely have anything better in view  no said wilmet even now keeping herself blind to the offensiveness of aldas suggestion but as it is utterly impossible for me to think ofleaving home i did think it would have been wiser to put a stop to it while there wais time and the tears began to gather again  and have you  they wont let me  who  heand his father and felix said wilmet speaking steadily but the tears rolling down her cheeks  felix oh what does he say  you may see and she held out a letter which alda and cherry read together while she rested her elbow on her knee her brow on her hand and let fall the tears which with her were always soft free and healthy outlets of emotion not disabling but rather relieving   mrs pettigrews lodgings north beach east ewmouth 20th july 10 pm  my dearest wilmetwhat i have heard today is a great satisfaction i had hardly hoped that you could have been brought within the reach of any one so worthy of you my only fear is that you are too scrupulous and selfsacrificing to contemplate fairly and without prejudice what is best for us all you will imagine yourself blinded by inclination and not attend to common sense harewood tells me he trusts you have no objection on personal grounds i hope this does not sound as if he were presuming if so it is my fault remember i am more used to writing summaries for the week than letters on delicate subjects but at any rate my mettie i see there is much worth and weight in his affection and that you could not manage to snub him as entirely as you wanted to do didnt you now it seems to me that if you two are really drawn to one another both being such as you are it is the call of a voice that you have no right to reject or stifle i do not mean by this that anything immediate need take place but granting your preference i think it would be wrong not to avow it or to refuse because you scruple to keep him waiting while you may be necessary at home if you imagine that by such rejection you would be doing better for the children and me i beg leave to tell you it is a generous blunder remember that as things have turned out i am quite as much the only dependence for the others as i was seven years ago i felt this painfully in the spring when i was doubtful what turn my health would take and the comfort of knowing you would all have such a man to look to would be unspeakableindeed he has already lightened me of much care and anxiety do not take this as pressing you between this and the end of his leave there will be time for consideration nothing need be done in haste least of all the crushing your liking under the delusion of serving us so do not forbid him the house and unless your objection be on any other score do not make up your mind till you have seen me i should of course have been with you instead of writing if it were not for lance till i saw the dear little fellow i had no notion how very ill he has been the five hours journey had quite knocked him up and he was fit for nothing but his bed when he came but he revived in the evening i only hope i shall take as good care of him as the firstrate nurses he describes so enthusiastically that month must have been worth years of common acquaintance i wish i knew what more to say to show you how glad i am of this days work and to persuade you to see matters as i do ever your loving brother                                         f c underwood  pslance is quite himself this morning and was up to watch us bathing before six oclock   oh what did captain harewood say of felix was cherrys cry almost with shame and pain at not having asked before  you know he had never seen him said wilmet but he said he did not seem to him in the least unwelland he watched carefully as i had begged him he said he struck him as naturally delicatelooking but that those blue veins in his temples do not show and he has no cough at all nor any difficulty in swimming or walking up a steep cliff he made me laugh for he said he hardly believed his eyes when lance tumbled himself out of the train on something so little bigger or older than himself he says the way we all talk of my eldest brother made him expect something taller than clement and more imposing than the senior verger but he understood it all when he saw him and lance together they have two very nice rooms and felix has put lance into the bedroom which is luckily cool and sleeps on a sofa bed in the parlour and the landlady will do anything for them  but how is it to be broke in alda crossly you and felix seem to be encouraging him to come dangling here when we all agreed that ferdinand must keep away in felixs absence though matters are in such a different state  so i told him dear alda gently said wilmet but he declared he would bring his sisters or poor mrs harewood herself if nothing else would satisfy me and what could i do after all their kindness  umph muttered alda they are a queer set  now alda said wilmet earnestly you must not talk without knowing till i went there i never understood how much goodness and principle there could be without my stiffness and particularity i know i have often been very unnecessarily disagreeable and disapproving and i hope i am shaken out of it in time  dear mettie no one is like you cried cherry with a little effusion stretching out her hand and laying it on her sisters shoulder oh if we had not all been so vile while you were away  it would not have made any difference my dear it would be impossible to leave felix without help and think of theodore  alda muttered something that no one would hear about asylums and the telltale tears coming again wilmet sprang up and bending down to kiss cherry declared in her most authoritative voice that nothing should be said to the younger children nor to any one out of the house then picked up the teacups and carried them in  excitements were however not yet over for the day a telegram was put into aldas hands containing the words   a t is an unmitigated brute i sail for n y tonight all will be right when i come back   the mysterious hint restored alda at once to all the privileges of the reigning heroine     chapter xx  vale leston    the way to make thy son rich is to fill  his mind with rest before his trunk with riches  for wealth without contentment climbs a hill  to feel those tempests that fly over ditches  but if thy son can make ten pounds his measure  then all thou addest may be called his treasure                                         george herbert   i say felix youve not told me about vale leston  the two brothers were established under the lee of an old boat beneath the deep shadow of the red earth cliffs festooned with ivy wild clematis everlasting pea thrift and samphire not far off niched beneath the same cliff were two or three cottage lodging houses twostoried with rough grey slate roofs glaring white walls and green shutters to the windows that looked out over the shingly beach to the lazily rippling summer sea  ewmouth was a lazy place felix had felt half asleep through the earlier days of his stay and lance seemed to be lulled into a continual doze whenever he was unoccupied and that was almost always it had grieved his elder brother to see this naturally vivacious being so inert and content with inaction only strolling about a little in early morning and late evening and languid and weary if not actually suffering during the heat and glare of the day he was now with his airpillow and a railway rug lying on the beach beside felix who with his safety inkstand planted in the sand was at work condensing the parliamentary debates for the pursuivant and was glad to perceive that he was so far alive as to be leaning on his elbow slowly shovelling the sand or smaller pebbles with the frail tenement of a late crab and it was another good sign to hear his voice in a voluntary inquiry about vale leston  i have not been there yet  not there  no old abednego tripp comes over here every market day and hes the only person i wanted to see  i thought you came here because you wanted to see the place  yes but i was not up to the walk when i came here and while you were ill i never durst go out of reach of the telegraph and latterly i waited for you after all i have not much mind to it i dont see the good of setting oneself a coveting ones neighbours house  it wouldnt be my house any way said lance quaintly how far is it  rather more than three miles well get a boat some day and do it  that will be jolly and after shovelling a little longer lance added how came we to be turned out  thats just what i cant tell i was only seven you know and my father never would talk of it sibby used to revile the mane nagur misther fulbert till it was current in the nursery that he was a black man who expelled us vi et armis one day my father found four or five of us in a row slashing at an old black doll by way of killing misther fulbert and prohibited such executions i think too that he quashed an attempt to call our own fulbert by his other name  i wonder what the nagur did  by the light of maturer nature i imagine that he may have succeeded as heiratlaw and that his maneness may have consisted in not giving the living to my father but i cannot tell it always seemed my fathers great desire to put it out of our minds i remember before we left the place his catching me in a furious rage with some one who told me my pony was to be sold he carried me off and told me it was all true and we were going away and he trusted to me to be brave and make it as little hard to mamma and the little girls as could be he said the place had belonged to old uncle underwood and that we had no right to stay there after his death that was all the explanation he gave me first or last and i dont think we thought much about it after the neck of the change was broken  you remember it though  i believe i know every step of the house and garden i have never ceased to dream of them and i am as much afraid of disturbing old impressions as of reviving wishes  holloa whats up exclaimed lance as the landlady was seen coming in quest of them i thought i saw a tidy little tiger going in there just now  a note from mr staples if you please sir and they wait for an answer  i didnt know you had any acquaintance here  mr staples is the solicitor who did the business about admiral chesters legacy he is retired now and only holds some county office he found me out last week i believe from some letters of mine going woolgathering to the other f underwood he called and said he knew my father and was very civil and friendly he sent to inquire after you the day you came this is what he says   my dear mr felix underwoodyour relative at vale leston wishes me to dine with him tomorrow evening if you and your brother would like to accompany me on the drive meet me at six oclock on the top of the cliff if you would prefer to return earlier than i do i can direct you to a boatman to take you down by the riverbelieve me yours truly                                          c staples   hurrah thats not half a bad fellow for an attorney cried lance  shall not you be tired will it not be too hot for you  not a bit of it he indicating the sun can only get at me asquint by that time and im a match for him with my blue umbrella come fire away you tardy norseman say we are good for it fancy boating back  and lance whistled a few bars of the hardy norseman the liveliest thing he had done since his illness  at the appointed hour the brothers were standing on the top of the cliff with a broad estuary before them on the opposite side of which lay the town of ewmouth at the foot of the old castle with fresh modern fortifications towards the sea the town with its church towers and gas chimneys sloped away from it vessels thronged the harbour and a long weirdlooking thready suspensionbridge spanned the broad tideriver to east ewmouth the village fast growing into a suburb there had not been more than time to point out the details to lance before a waggonet drove up from one of the roads that branched among pleasant villa residences and in it appeared a whitehaired but heartylooking gentleman prepossessing and merry very unlike lances notion of attorneys who shook hands with them warmly and took care to put the boy under the shade of the driving seat  it was a pretty drive through rich meadows shut in by the sloping wooded hills which gradually closed nearer and by and by over the shoulder of one looked a very tall church tower whereat felix started with a thrill of responsive recognition and suddenly faltered in the political discussion mr staples had started but dropped at once looking at the young mans face with kindly interest  at the same time road and river both made a sudden turn into a much narrower and wilder valley the hills beyond more rough and rocky but the river still broad and smooth and crossed by a handsome high backed fivearched bridge the centre arch grandly high and broad the other two rapidly diminishing on either side over this the carriage turned and from the crown lance beheld an almost collegiatelooking mass of grey building enclosing sunny lawns and flowerbeds and surrounded by parklike grounds and trees all sloping towards the river and backed by steep hills of wood and moorland whence a little brook danced with much impetus down to the calm steady main stream of ewe the church and remnants of the old priory occupied the forefront of a sort of peninsula the sweep of the ewe on the south and east and the little lively leston on the north there was slope enough to raise the buildings beyond damp and display the flowerbeds beautifully as they lay falling away from the house the churchyard lay furthest north skirted by the two rivers and the east end with the lovely floriated window of the lady chapel rising some thirty yards from the bank of the ewe the outline a little broken by an immense willow tree that wept its fountainlike foliage into the river the south transept was cloistered and joined to the building beyond a long low grey house with one row of windows above the sloping roof of the cloister and this again connected with a big family mansion built of the same gray stone with the rest but in the style of the seventeenth century and a good deal modernised upon that a great plateglass window looked out on the river in the east front which projected nearly as far as did the lady chapel the space between being as before said laid out in a formal parterre with stone steps leading down to the river  oh what a place what a place shouted lance starting up in the carriage its like the minster and the jolly old river besides two of them oh what fishing there must be  i did not know it was really so beautiful said felix in a low voice  you remember it said mr staplesi suppose you cant to lance  oh no i wasnt born mores the pity do the salmon come up here sir  yes since the fisheries have been protected but young mr underwood is a great fisherman and i fear it is not easy to get a card  oh i wasnt thinking about leave sir thank you ive got no tackle nor anything but i am glad we have salmon said lance as though he had acquired an accession of dignity  descending from the bridge they were in a road skirting the river and on which presently opened the lodge gates of the rectory here mr staples got out telling his servant to drive the young gentlemen round to the village  i say felix said lance as they were whirled on along the lane which swept round the long wall overhung by trees that old party must know all about it  most likely said felix but if there had been any good in my hearing my father could have told me himself how well i remember his giving me my first ride along this lane do you smell the bean field i dont believe i have thought of the scent since  felix seemed absorbed in the pleasures of recognition and lance amazed at the beauty and what seemed to him the splendour of the place looked up at his brother with a kind of romantic feeling for a disinherited knight as he contrasted the scene with the counter and printingoffice  the lane led to the village street a very pretty one sloping upwards and lying on each side of the leston which rippled along as clear as crystal crossed every here and there by footbridges some wooden some a single stone while the cottages on the opposite side were perched on a high shelf or terrace and were approached by charming irregular flights of stairs with low walls or balustrades over the rail of one smoking a pipe in summer evening enjoyment was seen abednego tripp with long nose brown parchment cheeks and lank hair not yet greyone of the genuine almost extinct species of parish clerk as the carriage stopped he began to descend keys in hand for the church was a lion and many carriages did stop there but it was not till felix jumped out and hailed him that he knew who were his visitors  bless me if it is not master felix after all i did think you was never coming sir and this is the young gentleman as has been so ill youre kindly welcome sir i think hed favour poor master eddard if he didnt look so nesh  i shall get well here said lance if it is not my native air it ought to be  will you come and rest a bit sir or would you like to go to the church  the church they said felix first explained what he knew would give pleasurethat they had come depending on him for a cup of tea and a cast in his boat which was wont to convey the marketables of vale leston twice a week to ewmouth  abednego sped up his stairs like a lamplighter to cause his grand daughter to make preparations and was speedily down again delighted to hear felix prove his memory by inquiries after the inhabitants of the old dwellings  ha the miss hepburns said felix looking at a tall narrow house completely embowered in trailing roses and with the rails of the bridge of entrance wreathed with clematis are they there still  oh yes sir all the four on em and a sight of good they does to the poor  i wonder whether i ought to call said felix they used to be very kind to me  what is that robs godmother that never gave her anything but that queer name asked lance  i shouldnt think they were rich said felix i fancy they used to be very fond of my mother and made her promise that the next girl should be named for one of them there was miss bridget and miss martha and something else as bad and robina was the least objectionable of the lot i think they used to write to my mother but it is late in the day for calling  here comes miss bridget said the clerk as there appeared in sight a tall rigid angular figure with a big brown hat and long straight cloak and a decidedly charitylooking basket in her hand  felix stepped forward with his hand to his hat miss hepburn i believe i must introduce myselffelix underwood  the ladys first move had been a startled shy drawing herself up and into herself at being addressed by a stranger then she looked up with an amazed felix underwood little felix and as he smiled and bowed she rumbled and put out a hesitating hand  yes tripp did tell us somethingsomething of your being at ewmouth but we were not sure  we had not been able to come over before said felix thinking she meant to imply that he ought to have called we came for health and have not been equal to the walk  oh indeed nothing infectious i hope  oh no he said explaining in a few words the total want of connection between his case and lances  i am glad illill tell my sisters im glad to have seen you  there was something faltering and illassured in her manner and in a moment she turned back with mr underwood where are you stopping  he answered and with ill tell my sisters she parted with them again  thats miss bridget commented old tripp shes the one as allys says ill tell my sisters they do say as miss isabella she be the master on em all  felix and lance smiled to one another the assurance that every family had its wilmet but while the younger brother shrugged his shoulders the elder felt a certain chill in the contrast with those days of old when the sugarplums and picturebooks of the whole sisterhood were all at his service and bethought him that times were changed  they entered the churchyard by a little sidegate the church was a grand pile of every style of architecture that had prevailed since the cistercians had settled in vale leston and of every defacement that the alternate neglect and goodwill of the underwoods could perpetrate the grand tower at the west end was however past their power to spoil and they had not done much damage to the exterior except in a window or buttress here and there but within the brothers used to the heavy correctness of the st oswalds restoration stood aghast when abednego admitted them by the door of excommunication straight into the chancel magnificently deep but with the meanest of rails a reredos where moses and aaron kept guard over the commandments in black and gold and walls bristling with genii and angels of all descriptions weeping over underwoods of different generations lance stood openmouthed before a namesake of his own whose huge monumental slab was upborne by the exertions of a kind of tartarean cherub solely consisting of a skull and a pair of bats wings  my stars where did that brute come from muttered lance under his breath hes got no trifle of a piece of work  however felix had taken in that the chancel had respectable poppy headed benches though the lower part of the church was completely emparoked in pues such as surprised lance out of all bounds when he withdrew his eyes from the white marble deaths head  my stars again he said this is what ive heard of but never saw  ay sir said mr tripp every one that come here do be crying out upon the pews and to be sure i see the folk sleepin in them as is shameful  well he might for his place was the lowest in a lofty threedecker against one pier of the chancel arch surmounted by a golden angel blowing a trumpet and with lettering round the soundingboard recording it to have been the gift of the reverend lancelot underwood rector and vicar of this parishthe owner of the mural slab before mentioned that angel recalled to felix that the sight of it had been his great pleasure in going to church only marred by the fact that he was out of sight of it in the chancel  why you werent in the choir then said lance  choir no sir said the clerk they sits in the gallery the chancel is for mr underwoods familythe rector sir they seats was just put up instead of the red baize pew before old mr underwood as was then died and your poor papa went away and that there font was put as tis there just when the twin young ladies was christened  where was i christened then  in the bowl as we used to have on the communion sir  it was plain how far edward underwood had dared to work at renovation and that nothing had since been done the ladychapel with a wonderful ceiling of tudor fans and pendants was full of benches and ragged leaves of books for such sunday schooling as took place there the national school having been built half a mile off that the children might not be obnoxious to the rectory the church was a good way behind the ordinary churches of 1861 and struck the two brothers the more from the system in which they had been brought up  what a state clem would be in uttered lance as they came out  it is of no use to think about it said felix let us enjoy the beautiful exterior  ay sir said old tripp parties do be saying as how it is a mortial pity to see such a church go to wrack and i do believe the squire wouldnt be so hard to move if it warnt for the passon thats young mr fulbert the vicar  i dont understand all these rectors and vicars said lance i thought they never hung out together  why you see master lancelot as how this is what they calls a lay rectory as goes like a landed estate from father to son without there being any call for em to be clergy and the vicar he is just put in to do passons work only he gets his situation for life like i do not like them curates  i see said felix and the rectors have generally taken holy orders and presented themselves to the vicarage  yes sir thats how it ought to be only this here squirenot being no passon though rector he behe puts in a gentleman to keep it warm till his son young mr fulbert our vicar as is was growed up and hard work they say it was to get him to bend his mind to it nor hed not have done it at last but for his fathers paying of his bills and giving consent to his marrying miss shaw and since that bless you sir the curates have done nothing but change change change till tis enough to ruin a good clerk you knows what that is master felix you that be one of the cloth for felix allowed himself no unprofessional coats  it is only the cloth mr tripp dont you see i sport a blue tie i am a bookseller  a bookseller the old man recoiled youll not be passing your jokes on me sir a bookwriteri understands  no a bookseller in earnest i have a share in a very good business at bexley ive been at it ever since i was sixteen  the old clerk was quite overcome he leant upon a headstone and stared at felix without speaking and then it was a sort of soliloquy to think of poor dear master eddards son being come to that and he looking a dozen times more like a clergyman and a gentleman than ever this young mr fulbert will  never mind mr tripp said felix theres one of us on the way to be a clergymanedward clement you know that i wrote to you about and maybe this fellow too dont look so angry with me i was obliged to do the best i could to bring in something for the thirteen of us   and were as proud of him as can be added lance affectionately and indignantly  ah well said the old aristocrat that may be for you never knew them he came of there was my old lady geraldine as was his great grandmother who gave a new coat or new gown to every poor body in the parish at christmas and as much roast beef as they could eat and wore a shawl as come from the injies and cost two hundred pounds she was a lady bless me what would she have said to see the day  that she was glad to have a greatgrandson good for something stoutly answered lance i declare mr tripp youd have liked him better if he had come a begging  so i do said felix and whats more mr tripp is going to refuse me because he is too fine to sit down to tea with a tradesman  no no sir said old tripp with tears in his eyes youll not go for to say that if it was the last morsel i had id be proud to share it with one of master eddards sons but i cant but think as how we rung the bells and drunk your health when you was born just as we did for the prince of wales and how proud poor master eddard looked no doubt he was spared the knowing of it  no said felix it was settled with his full consent  abednego seemed more distressed than ever poor master eddard he must have been brought very low such a gentleman as he was never spoke a proud or rude word sir but used to hold up his head like the first lord in the land and fire and colour up and start like one of young mr fulberts thoroughbreds if any one said an impudent word  that no one ever ventured said felix he was as much respected at bexleyyes and is stillas ever he could be here i wish you could see my brother edgar he is more like him than either of us ah heres the old garden gate i wish we could go into the shrubbery  tripp was rather for trying it he said the gardeners would be gone home and the elder master at dinnerthe younger with his wife was absent but felix could not bear the sense of spying though he did not withhold lance from a rush into the garden paths where he did not discover much then they looked into the eddy at the meeting of the waters and turning back to tripps neatest of kitchens were there regaled upon shrimps rashers hissing from the fire and the peculiar native species of hotbuttered cake which felix recollected as viewed in the nursery as the ne plus ultra of excellence probably because it was an almost prohibited dainty lance was in his element delighting himself and miss kerenhappuch tripp by assisting her to toast to butter and even to wash up calling felix to witness that he always helped cherry in the holidays when just as they were rising to seek the boat mr staples came climbing up the steps  i thought i should find you here he said mr underwood very much wishes you would come and spend the rest of the evening with him  the old humbug burst out lance you wont go will you felix  felix thought a moment then walked with mr staples to the corner of the narrow ledge in front of the cottage mr staples he said i know nothing about it i trust to you to tell me whether this man treated my father so that i ought not to accept attention from him  hm ha i should not say so he treated him unkindly ungenerously but he hardly knew how much so and he had the letter of the law on his side i verily believe he regrets it and that your father being what he was would be the last to wish you to hold aloof  most likely said felix i am sure he forgave whatever there was to forgive  it is not my doing i assure you he spoke of your letters that had gone astray and that led to more till when he found you were in the village he said he should like to see you he is breaking up his son has given him a good deal of trouble and i believe he is altogether concerned for what has passed  and he will not suppose we want anything from him said felix with something of the almost unavoidable pride of independent poverty  certainly not i have guarded against that  then i suppose we mustthat is how is your head are you too much tired lance  no said lance almost sulkily for he was much inclined to make fatigue a plea for escaping the mane nagur and enjoying the boat and was rather unreasonably disposed to think it all a plot on the part of mr staples for spoiling the evening felix might have been equally glad of the excuse but he believed his father would have thought this act of conciliation a duty and followed mr staples across the churchyard where all the little boys in the place seemed to be playing marbles on the flagged paths its neglected state was a painful contrast to the exquisitely laidout shrubbery as trim as gardeners could make it and improved and altered beyond felixs recognition  entering the house mr staples led the way to the diningroom where there was a large empty table in the middle of the room and in the deep bay of the window a smaller one laid out with wine and dessert where sat old fulbert having always heard him so called the brothers were surprised to find him no more than elderly he must have been originally a thorough florid handsome underwood and had the remains of military bearing though with an air of feebleness and want of health and a good deal of asthmatic oppression on his breath he did not rise but held out his hand saying good evening thank you for coming to see a sick man  i am sorry to see you so unwell sir  thank you im on the mend sit down take a glass of wineclaret  felix accepted wondering if his father would regard it as an act of pardon  and you  no thank you sir  no wine you are the one that has been so ill no objection to melon eh  and lancelot whose illness had left a strong hankering for fruit was considerably appeased by the first cut into the cool buff flesh  is he the next brother to you  oh no there are three brothers and three sisters between us  and what are they doing there were one or two with tom underwood didnt the young fellow offend him and turn out idle  not that sir said felix his colour rising but he had no turn for a clerkship and a good deal for art he is studying at the royal academy but there never was any quarrel he is often at thomas underwoods  and the rest  one has the ewshire scholarship at st cadocs and theres one in australia  and this ladwhats his name  lancelot he is in the choir school at minsterham cathedral and hopes to get a scholarship  is that all of you  two more boys quite little and the six girls  any of them able to do anything for themselves  the eldest is a teacher in a school at bexley said felix not delighted with the crossexamination and alda the one that lived with the tom underwoods is engaged to a man of good fortune then two of the younger ones are at schools where an allowance is made for poor clergymans daughters  how long has your mother been dead  four years and a half  and you have managed all singlehanded  with my eldest sisters help sir  taken to the press have you mr staples must have made the best of his vocation whats your paper  the bexley pursuivant most likely you never heard of it it is only a little county paper and then feeling that to stop there was a subterfuge he added our main business is the retail trade  mr underwood was chiefly intent on the next question the politics of the paper though he said he need hardly ask all you young stuckup fellows run in one teamall destructives  no no sir broke in mr staples eagerly mr felix is staunch to the backbone  felix was never more tempted to deny his principles than when he found them brought forward as a recommendation but he could only explain that the pursuivant was an old established county gentlemans style of paper in the agricultural interest whereupon the squire mounted his political hobby in such sort and with such abusive violence especially as to the local representatives of the adverse party that felix could not help feeling that if such were indeed the opinions of his own side he should certainly be on the other one good effect was the sparing him any more personal catechising mr underwood shouted himself weary without requiring any reply save what mr staples local knowledge supplied and when the carriage was announced the guests were dismissed with a hearty shake of the hands and invitation to call againit was a comfort to talk of public matters to a young man of sense and lance found a sovereign in his hand he was not sure that he was obliged  well said mr staples rubbing his hands with satisfaction as they drove off what do you think of the squire  he talks very loud said felix who had for some time been watching the increase of lances headache and now was trying to give him a rest on shoulder and arm  mr staples gave what help he could towards making the tired boy comfortable and then returned to the subject in all their minds so your father never told you those particulars  no i think it was his great object not to dwell on them nor let us look back with regret or anger  just like him i never saw such a case never ill show you a remarkable letter of his but first you ought to understand the way the matter stood to begin with the relationship  i know nothing about them only that my father and mother were second cousins but i dont even know to which of them my greatuncle underwood was really uncle  to your mother he had very strong feelings as to the duty of the head of a family and made his house a home for all that needed it when miss mary was sent home an orphan from indiajamess his favourite brothers childhe asked his cousins widow mrs edward underwood to bring her boy superintend the house and look after the little girl and she was glad enough for the captain had died of his wounds at waterloo and she had little but her widows pension  i know said felix then whose son is the squire  the son of lancelot who was the second brother between the reverend fulbert your greatuncle and james your mothers father so he was heiratlaw but he was a wildish sort of lad unfit to take holy orders and there came to be an understanding that if his uncle would buy his commission and purchase his steps he would not look for the rectory and the estate on that understanding your father took orders and married but on old mr underwoods death there was only a draught of a will which he had not been in a state to execute leaving a handsome legacy to fulbert but the whole property to your father and mother it seemed a matter of course that as the only compensation fulbert should have presented his cousin edward to the vicarage400 pounds a year but as illluck would have it he took offence at some sermona lent one about selfindulgence i believe it wasswore he wouldnt have a puseyite parson preaching at him and went into such a rage that it is thought to be partly by way of getting off giving him the living and getting it held for his son  i see said felix  it was a dirty trick and i was a younger man at the time and it struck me that if your father chose to try the case the testators intentions being clear and instructions in his own hand extant it was ten to one it might be given in his favour i even took a counsels opinion thinking that at any rate an intimation that the case was to be tried before possession was given up might bring fulbert to terms with regard to the living  and he would not  no i should like to show you his letter would you do me the honour of dining with me tomorrow  felix was obliged to mutter something about ladies and no dress coats but this was silenced and he made a promise contingent on lances fitness he was puzzled by the relations in which mr staples seemed to stand with the layrector but he found that they were not of business only that elections and county affairs brought them together and that mr underwood was regarded with a sort of compassion by the men of his own standing who used to go and visit him whenever they could be secure of not encountering the cold welcome and illbreeding of his daughterinlawthe grievance of his life  did you see any one you remembered further asked mr staples  one of the miss hepburns who did not seem very well to know whether to acknowledge me or not  ha ha chuckled mr staples queer old girls they are very high very good to the poor all the good that is done in vale leston is by them but anything between a swell and a pauper dont exist for them theyre as poor as job and their pride is all they have so they make the most of it  so after all the day had not been quite without mortification and felix felt it a little more than he thought it was worth  lance was a good deal excited by the sight of his ancestral home he had an eye for scenery and longed to bask in it again boating seemed delightful and he was amazed not to say elated by the grandeur of the house which exceeded anysave centry parkin his limited experience his mind was set on explorations there and on the whole history while felix to whom all was less new and more sorrowful was inclined to hang back from any unwise awakening of unsettling regrets but there was no declining mr staples kindness and he had much desire to see the letter so the two youths put on their sunday coats assisted one anothers ties and looked each other well over before encountering the formidable mass of ladies felix had seen in church and about whom he was far more shy than lance who had seen a good deal more of the species at minsterham  it turned out very pleasant the frank goodnatured mother and daughters made themselves very agreeable and though no one was as pretty as alice knevett they were all so far superior to her in manner and cultivation that the mixing with them could not fail to soften any sting of disappointment that might remain lance was made much of as an invalid and very much liked the privileges that did not hinder an evening game of croquet since mr staples evidently intended his conference with felix to be teteatete  it took place in a pleasant little study fitted with green morocco and walnut that spoke well for the solicitors taste and prosperity and looking out on the pretty lawn with the long shadows of the trees the croquet players flitting about and the sea glittering in the distance  the letter was ready folded up lengthwise and docketed business fashion but when opened the familiar handwriting seemed to bring back the father even to the sound of his voice   vale leston rectory 18th january  my dear staplesmy wife and i feel greatly obliged to you for your goodwill and zeal on our behalf and have not for a moment justified your dread of being thought officious in other circumstances i might be tempted to fight the battle but it is impossible for several reasons were we the losers we should be totally unable to pay the costs and a load either of debt or obligation would be a burthen we have no right to assume moreover the uncertainty of our position pending the decision would be as mischievous to myself as to the parishioners it would destroy any fitness to be their vicar whether we gained or not the holding the rectory is in itself an abuse and now that the grapes are sour i am glad not to encounter the question of conscience and so shall not adopt any meansto my mind doubtfulfor bringing it on myself this being the case you will see that the idea of alarming fulbert underwood falls to the ground supposing he were coerced into the compromise what a pleasing pairsquire and parsonwould be the result no my kind friend be content to see things remain as they are we carry with us the certainty of our good uncles kindness and the nonfulfilment of his intentions is clearly providential i have heard of a promising curacy where i shall get the training i need after feeling my wilful way as i have done here my wife being the expectant heiress and layrectoress shall write to satisfy you that she is not suffering from my coercionyours most sincerely obliged                                                   e f underwood   and on another sheet followed   dear mr staplesi think my husband is quite right and that to go to law would only make things much worse it is very kind in you but i really do not care about anything so long as i have my husband and children and can feel that my dear uncle meant all that was kind indeed i really think my husband enjoys the prospect of a new and more active kind of work he is sure to be happy anywhere and as long as that is the case all will be right and he says that it will be much better for the children not to grow up in luxury with many warm thanks yours very truly                             m w underwood   may i copy them asked felix looking up with his eyes fuller of tears than suited his reserved disposition  his fathers letter full of his constant brave cheerfulness in self abnegation had not overcome him like the few words that brought back the lovely young mamma he now remembered at vale leston but whom he had too soon known only as the patient overtasked drudging mother and latterly in the faded helpless invalid how little she had guessed the life that was before her  mr staples readily supplied him with the materials adding i will take care you have the letters by and by i value them too much to part with them in my lifetime and presently he interrupted felixs writing by saying i much wished to have seen mr and mrs edward underwood again but it seemed to me that they were unwilling to keep up a correspondence  they were so busy said felix  no doubt and i thought they might feel a visit an intrusion otherwise i often thought of running down from town  my father would have been very glad  i did wish to have seen him againand your mother almost a child as she was even at that time with her flock of pretty children i shall never forget herthe beauty and darling of all the neighbourhood as she used to be all we young men used to rave about her long before she was out mr staples smiled at some recollection and added i never spoke to her four times in my life but i was as bad as any of thempresumptuous as you may think it  i am glad you did not see her again burst from felix the tears starting forth as he copied her hopeful words she altered sadly  ah indeed  the concerned tone forced felix to add it came so much more heavily on her than on any of us care and work and years of seeing my fathers health failing and in the last week of his life she had a fall that brought on softening of the brain  somehow the whole had never struck him as so piteous before as in the contrast with her youthful brightness and when he saw mr staples greatly affected  he could only write on through a mist of tears while the solicitor walked about the room blowing his nose violently and muttering sentences never developed till at last he came behind felixs chair and laying his hand on his shoulder said after all it will come round you are next heir  heir theres fulbert underwood exclaimed felix  true but hes been some years married and theres no sign of a family depend upon it we shall see vale leston come back yet  it would make no difference now muttered felix as he traced his mothers fearless lines nay if he had a personal thought it was of what he might have ventured towards alice knevett  not to them said mr staples but a good deal to you my young friend  now mr staples said felix smiling arent you doing our best to unsettle a young man in business  well well you are too reasonable a contingencyonly a contingency but i should like to show you and he hastily sketched a pedigree that had at least the advantage of showing felix his relationships   rev lancelot

                                         underwood    there through your mother you stand next in the lineare heirat law you see may i live to see that day thats all  the thought did not affect felix much at the moment he was too full of what might have been and the contingency was such a remote one so after answering to the best of his ability whether any of his sisters were like his mother he was glad to get out and forget it all in croquet his musical capacities were discovered too but the attempt to profit by them proved quite too much for lance to whose brain the notes of the piano were absolute and severe pain  a formal little note came on the ensuing morning in which the misses hepburnin the third personrequested the favour of the company of mr felix underwood and his brother at luncheon felix felt a little stung he could recollect warm passages between the ladies and his mother and had been their pet long enough to wonder at this cold reception and question whether it were not more dignified to reject advances made in such a manner but his heart yearned towards those who had been kind to him in his youth and he believed that his mother would have wished him to renew the intercourse and therefore decided upon going but it was too hot and sunny a day for lance to walk and felix so entirely expected the visit to be wearisome and disagreeable if not mortifying that he could only resolve on it as a duty and would not expose his brother to it  so he plodded off alone and a curious visit he had it was not easy for him to guess at the sacredness of those traditions of gentility and superiority that the misses hepburn heldnot so much for their own sakes as in faithful loyalty to the parents many years dead and to the family duty that imposed a certain careful exclusiveness on them in deference to the noble lineage they could reckon and the head of the house whom none of them had ever seen he could not have guessed the warm feeling towards dear mary that had struggled so hard with the sense of duty and had gained the victory over the soreness at the dropping of correspondence and the idea that it was a dereliction to bend to one who had lowered himself as mrs fulbert underwood said he had  what he saw was a tiny drawingroom full of flowers and gimcracks and fuller of four tall angular women in dark dresses in the rear of the fashion and sandy hair they had decided in council or rather miss isabella had decided for them that since he was to be received they would remember only his gentle blood and therefore they shook hands with him and the difference of the clasp alone could have shown the difference of characterthe patronising the nervous the tenderly agitated the hearty  he found them better informed than the squire had been as to the condition of the familyat least so he presumed from the text of their inquiries not a word did they say of his own employmentit was to be treated as a thing not to be spoken of but the welfare of the others was inquired after and especially of robinawho was the namechild of the eldest sister the gentlest of the set and the most in the background quiet and tearfulpleased to hear that her godchild was at school and as felix emphatically said a very good girl anxious that he should take charge of a little token for her  the little token turned out to be ministering children and this gave felix a further hint which prepared him for the tone in which some of his information was received when he had only mentioned geraldine as gone for healths sake to the st faiths sisterhood  the ladies looked at one another miss isabella cleared her throat and he knew a warning was coming so he quickly said one of the ladies a clergymans widow was very kind to my father in his illness and is really the best friend we have left in england  your dear father was too much inclined to those specious doctrines that are only too fascinating to youth i hope you do not outrun him  i hope not said felix very sincerely and he then succeeded in interesting his monitor by speaking of fulbert and using him as a bridge to lead to an account of mr audleys australian doings  it was altogether a stiff uncomfortable visit the very politeness of the good ladies made felix feel that they viewed his position as altered and he could not but feel a strong hope that he should never again have to make this offering at the shrine of ancient friendship  on coming home in the evening felix found a note on the table  croquet to wit asked lance as felix tried to read it by the almost vanished twilight  whats this   we hope you and your brother will join us in a picnic at kitts head on saturday  having discharged my ladies commission i proceed to that which i have authority from your relation for intimating to younamely that failing heirs of his own son he has entailed the vale leston property upon you thus rendering its alienation by the reverend fulbert impossible i believe the arrangement was made within the last week congratulations would hardly be suitable but i cannot refuse myself the pleasure of saying how sincerely i rejoice   whatwhat cried lance jumping up you to have that splendiferous river and the salmon and all wont you get a magnificent organ for that church  my dear lance dont you see that all this means is that if young fulbert has no children i shall come after him  oh he wont im sure he wont things always do come right oh what a coup detat mine was after all things always do come right you that were born to it didnt old tripp say how they had had the bells rung for you i should like to set them going this minute  they should be on your own cap then said felix laughing and yet sharing in a castle or twohow cherry should have a ponycarriage how clement should be turned loose upon the church how lance should pursue the salmon at home and the humanities at the university how bernard should have a real good gentlemans educationbut felix soon brought himself back again remember lance not a word of this at home or anywhere else  not tell any one  cried the boy crestfallen  dont you see lance besides the impropriety of talking of what involves two deaths it would be the most senseless thing in the world to let this make the least difference old fulbert may change his mind or young fulbert have a son at any rate he is not five andthirty and just as likely as not to outlive me  fee fee you are quite well you wretched norseman  oh i didnt mean that but anybody may outlive anybody for that matter anyway theres no chance of any of these schemes coming to pass while we are young enough to care even if they ever do and if they unsettle us now it would be unmitigated damage  i see that said lance but as by good luck im no 8 it cant do me much harm to think about it and i dont see why the others should not  do you think some of them would be content to go on as we are doing with this in their heads and if any one in the town knew it whatever i might do people would think i was getting above my business i doubt whether even froggy himself would have the same reliance on me  then shant you even tell wilmet and cherry  i hope not i dont think wilmet could keep it from alda or cherry from edgar and just imagine what it would be to have it come round through kensington palace gardens that we were reckoning on it besides it will make no earthly difference to anybody unless maybe to edgars son  the mention of such a being brought felix somehow to a sudden silence and in the meantime supper and a candle were brought in revealing a thick letter from geraldine which had at first escaped notice there were two enclosures but as felix read her writing he broke out with an exclamation of consternation that startled lance  hollo what is it and as he received no answerwilmets not given up jack eh nor cherry fallen in love next clem hasnt turned barefooted friar crowding together the wildest suggestions he could think of to force answer  hush that dear child  she doesnt want to be a sister youll tell her youd see her at jericho first  no it is about her foot  not worse  no but dear little thing she wants to have it taken off because she fancies if she was more effective it might be one difficulty out of wilmets way  shes a blessed little brick but would it be so  well i remember in the time of the measles the last time i ever let that fellow rugg come near her he thought proper to tell somebody in her hearing that if she was in a fit state of health it would be the only remedy she wasnt and it was quite uncalled for and it put the poor little thing in such an agony that at last sibby came and wrapped me up in a blanket to sit by her and talk very big about nobody being able to do it without my leave and my not intending to consent to any such thing i thought she had forgotten all about it but it seems that she has not and she imagines that as she says with a cork foot that i could stand upon instead of always keeping this one up in fear of hurting it i could get about the house with only a stick and be of some use and then dear metties happiness might not be so far off  and what does mettie say  she knows nothing cherry implores me not to tell her for she says that it would be impossible for mettie to come and nurse her and she would rather have sister constance than any one  than mettie deluded child cried lance  her great wish is to have it done now at st faiths she told clement before she left home because she thought they would insist on some one at home knowing but dont think me very sly she says i would not tell sister constance what was in my head till i came here for fear she should think it her duty to speak to wilmet and now they will not hear of it without your knowing i did wish to have surprised you all about the cost i have thought you know dr lee attends me for nothing while i am here and i told you that sister constance has sent up all my book of illustrations of queen isabel and some of the watercoloured drawings to her sister lady liddesdale and how much she has been getting for themquite enough to set me up with a foot that will not be half such a nuisance as this old deadalive one which has never let me have any peace these twelve years i am trying to be good but indeed i feel as if it might be wrong to try to be rid of my cross so i abide by your decision dear felix you are my king and i put myself in your hands only you must not be anxious you should have known nothing if i could have helped it  go on grunted lance with his face hidden as felix paused  thats all but here are notes from sister constance and dr lee  the sisters explanation was that it had been entirely geraldines own thought and that her willingness and eagerness made a great difference in such a nature as hers she told felix not to think of comingthe fewer the better and he could come in a few hours in case of need it was advisable that the decision should be made quickly since to nervous sensitiveness like cherrys the very effort to bear suspense reacted on the bodily frame if you know what i mean concluded sister constance heroism is likely to carry the little creature through what would be far more trying if this were proposed to her for her own sake  and dr lees letter gave the medical view decidedly inclining to the opinion that the probabilities were in favour of the operation and that the conditions were never likely to be more promising than at present  dear child i wish i were there  cant we go  what you think of the train  lance shook his head couldnt i stay by myself and you run up  i dont think i can help it  but the excitement of the evening broke lances sleep and the next day he was quite ill while felix not only saw that he must not be left but perceived after the first that sister constances warning ought to be respected and that an arrival would only agitate cherrys nerves so he wrote his sanction with a very heavy heart betraying as little emotion as was consistent with the tenderness so essential to support brave but fragile little geraldine  the anxiety seemed to have swallowed up the recollection of mr staples message indeed it was not willingly that felix answered his note and made a half engagement to the picnic  felix was struck by seeing how much under the circumstances lance missed the daily service to which he had been used all his life  i didnt mind it at first said the chorister it seemed a part of the holiday but somehow the day seems all stupid and astray without it  but there was no church with it to be heard of and indeed one attempt on sunday at east ewmouth resulted in lances collapsing into some of his most distressing symptoms caused as he declared by the overpowering might and untuneableness of the singing but quite bad enough to make felix resolve against permitting further experiments and thus walk off by himself on the next wednesday forenoon when he heard the bell  there was a long lecture that he had not bargained for and when he came out with a slightly impatient impulse the first thing he saw was a blue umbrella a white hat and a hand waving a paper in silence felix read  constance somerville to felix underwood1130 favourably over no cause for anxiety  they were rather grave and awestruck and scarcely spoke all the way homeindeed felix was chiefly thinking how to get lance home out of the sun without hurrying or overheating him but after dinner came a reaction the boy went frantic with admiration of a beautiful yacht that was standing into the bay and felix with his letter to sister constance to write one to australia to finish and his leading articles to draw up was forced to command peace in something of the old roughandready style and even when lance vanished he was to be heard singing scraps of comic songs in the distance  by and by he came in carrying a board taller than himself please your majesty ill be as mute as a mole but i must do this here for mrs pettigrew is baking  what in the name of wonder have you got there asked felix as lance proceeded to lay his board on the sofa his day and felixs nightbed and place on it a white and soppy mass  a little dab out as sibby calls it said lance its my puggery ever since it fell overboard it has been a disgrace to human nature so i have been washing it and now ive got an iron heating  what a mess you will make of it observed felix with a grimace of disgust as lance returned again from the kitchen holding the iron scientifically near his cheek  thats all you know about it why ive ironed dozens of pocket handkerchiefsat least not dozens but my own dozens of timesin the harewood tubs  i thought the chapter washed you  so it does in reason but last spring there was a doom on my pockethandkerchiefs the harewood puppy ate up one one dropped into the canal i tied up a fellow that had got a cut with one and the beggar never returned it and two or three more went i dont know how i knew w w would be in a dreadful state if i asked for a fresh lot so i used to wash out the last two by turns till i got some tip and bought some fresh onessuch jolly ones all over acrobats and british flags and after all didnt i catch it wilmet was no end of disgusted to miss her little stupid speckotty ones vowed these werent decent for the cathedral and boned them all for theodore now hush or i shall come to grief  felix held his pen suspended to watch the dexterity that reduced the crude mass to smooth muslin which in its expanded state looked as impracticable as before  now do you mean to get mrs pettigrew to put it on in those elegant festoons  you just mind your leader blunderbore a man who has had women to do for him all his life is a pitiable being  and lance according to instructions obtained from john harewood wreathed his hat triumphantly in the white drapery and completed felixs surprise and amusement by producing a needle and thread and setting to work on various needful repairs of his own buttons and his brothers over which he shook his head in amusement as he chuckled at the decay which had befallen the garments of so neat a personage as felix and which had been very distressing to himself  ah thank you i never knew what robinson crusoe felt like before said felix as lance came on a wristband minus button  robinson crusoe youd soon have been like man friday before he caught him  but doesnt the matron mend for you  she pretends but i should like to see her face if one brought her a chance thing to do my eyes if that isnt old staples i must absquattilate  which after all he had no time to effect with all his works before their friend came to ask whether they were relieved about their sister and was amused at the handy little schoolboys ingenious preparations after all i find it is to be more of an affair than i expected i thought it was to be only ourselves and the brandons but they are the kind of people who always pick up every one  does that yacht belong here eagerly asked lance  that it is the kittiwakecaptain audleys  ha thats what fulbert went to alexandria in what fun  he is the son of sir robert audley do you know him  his brother was my fathers fellowcurate said felix and is our guardian and kindest friend i have seen this one in london will he be at this picnic  not likely he is shy and uncertain very hearty and friendly when you do meet him but reluctant to go into society and often taking no notice one day when he has seemed like ones best friend the day before they say he has never got over the loss of his wife but i dont like such manners  does he live here then  he rents the little tudor cottage under the cliff year by year for the sake of his yachtingfor he wont go near the regular stations hes got his boy at school at stoneborough and stays here all the winter  when the brothers were walking part of the way back with their visitor they met the gentleman in question with three boys after him and he was evidently in a cordial mood for after shaking hands with mr staples he exclaimed i am sure i ought to know you  felix underwood said the owner of that name  indeed not staying with your worthy relations  no i am down here with my brother who has been laid up by a sunstroke and wanted sea air  i wish i had been at home said the captain who had taken a great fancy to felix when they had been together in london two years before but ive been giving my boy and his cousins the two young somervilles a trip to the hebrides and now just as i am come home i fall upon mrs brandon hounding me out to an abominable picnic and my youngsters are wild to go are you in for it i believe we shall go round to the cove in the yacht can i take you two  felix gladly accepted aware that their transport was a difficulty to the stapleses and that the kittiwake would be felicity to lance who had fraternised with the boys and went off with them to see the vessel he returned brimful of delight and fatigue only just in time to tumble into bed as fast as possible and felix was thus able to get his work off his mind by midnight  the mornings letters set them quite at rest sister constance and clement both wrote geraldine had been calm and resolute from the time felixs consent arrived and doubt was over and clement though tender and striving hard to be firm had been chiefly useful in calling out her words of encouragement he had spent the time of the operation in the oratory and there had been so entirely overcome by the tidings that all was safely over that he was hardly fit to go to cherry when he was sent for and that was not soon for the effect of chloroform on her had indeed been to annihilate pain but only half to make her unconscious for she went on talking to felix about the expedience all the time ever repeating the old motto under wode under rode and the trance had lasted for a good while though when once over she remembered nothing of it and was only so rejoiced and thankful that it was difficult to keep her calm enough she sent her brothers her love and entreated them not to say a word at home lady liddesdale had contrived the sale of the book of illustrationsa work that had been cherrys delight of many years so that she could feel that she herself had earned what would cover the expense incurred all but the medical attendance freely given to an inmate of st faiths tell felix i am as happy as a queen was the final message tell him to give thanks for me  felixs voice trembled shook and gave way as he read and at last he sprang up and walked about the room saying that no one ever had such brothers and sisters as himself there was something almost oppressive in the relief from so much anxiety and it was some time before he roused his ordinary senses to say well we must finish breakfast or we shant be ready for the captain how round the world is those boys must be sister constances nephewslady liddesdales sons  those boys said lance what sum and frank well i did think it queer that the sailors on board the kittiwake called every one my lord  sum i imagine must mean lord somerville what did you think of them  nicish chaps of eleven and twelve nothing like such swells as tom bruce the little one wanted to know where i was at school and his senior snubbed him so i supposed he saw by the looks of me that i wasnt uppercrust public school and when i said i was a choirboy the othercharley audleysaid oh then youre one of the awful lot my father always jaws about when hes out of sorts i told him i was very sorry and it wasnt my fault but yours and then we got on like a house on fire     chapter xxi  a kettle of fish    our pursuivant at arms will show  both why we came and when we go                                scott   the place of the picnic was a good way off being the point of the promontory that shut in the mouth of the river a great crag with a long reef of rocks running out into the sea playfully called the kittens tail though the antiquarians always deposed that the head had nothing to do with cats or kits but with the disposition to erect chapels to st christopher on the points of land where they might first greet the mariners eyes beneath this crag sheltered by the first and larger joints of the kittens tail was a delightful sandy nook where appeared a multitude of smart hats male and female a great many strangers even to captain audley who would fain have recognised none of them in a strong access of his almost morbid silence he devoted himself to felix and kept aloof from almost every one even at the dinner spread on a very sloping bit of beach picnic exigencies enabled him to be nearly teteatete with felix who found himself almost back to back to a lady in a brilliant foreign pheasants plume with glass dewdrops at the points  in a pause of their own conversation they heard the inquiry do you know who that boy isthat fair delicatelooking lad just opposite with the white muslin round his hat  ohthat answered the pheasant lady that is young lord somerville son to the marquess of liddesdale he and his brother lord francis have been out yachting with captain audley  the captain smiled as he looked at the boys ay he observed with a flash of his bright dark eyes he has the advantage over sum  for lance had resumed his larklike air and it was perhaps the more striking from the fragility and transparency that remained about his looks and he was full of animation as he with a reinforcement of boys clustered round a merry sunnyfaced girl full of joyous drollery  very queer and eccentricquite a bear was the next thing they heard whereat captain audley nodded and smiled to felix after the general turmoil caused by the change of courses had subsided that penetrating voice was heard again yes we came home sooner than we had intended the fact was we found that old mr underwood was being beset by some of those relations you remember oh yes they have sunk very lowgot into trade absolutely got into trade one of them a mere common singingboy mr underwood is getting agedquite past and we did not know what advantage might be taken of him  your turn now murmured captain audley with a look of diversion calculated to allay the wounded flush on his neighbours cheek  do you mean mr edward underwoods sons said a voice on the other side i always understood them to be very respectable and well conducted  oh very likely only i do happen to know that one of them has been a great trouble and vexation to tom underwood and we didnt want the same over again with the poor old squire  did i understand you that any of them were here added the other voice for i had just been struck by the likeness of that boy opposite talking to my sister to poor mr edward underwood as i remember him  oh no mrs rivers i assure you thats young lord somerville  captain audley made an effort rather difficult in his turkish position to crane his head beyond the interposing figures recognised and bowed to the speaker who greeted him by name and thus diminished the flow of mrs fulbert underwoods conversation by her awe of the high and mighty bear whom she scarcely knew by sight he had no taste for scenes and did not put either her or felix to pain by mentioning his name but when the last act of the meal was over and people began to move he made his way in the direction of the inquiring voice mrs rivers let me introduce mr felix underwood  i am very happy and there was a cordial smile and a hand held out are you here for long my father would be so much pleased to see you  it was a rather worn pale face but the ease and sweetness of manner and the perfect fitness of the dress made a whole that gave felix a sense of the most perfect lady he had met with except his mother and sister constance  i am at ewmouth with one of my brothers who has been ill  lord somerville and all three burst out laughing my sister has found him out i see she and your little boy are old friends captain audley  yes you have been very kind to him but i am as much surprised to see you here as you can be to see my friend are you from home  we go back this evening we slept at the crewes last night my husband had business there and when they asked us to this picnic it was a good opportunity for gertrude to learn the beauties of her county  which she seems to be doing under full escort laughed captain audley as the young lady and the young boy flock were seen descending to the rocks  she has a strong taste for little boys said the elder sister  you have the somerville boys here havent you though  yes there had been scarlatina or something or other in their school and their mother was afraid of them among their sisters till i had purified them by a sea voyage  probably mrs fulbert never found out her mistake for lord somerville reported that he had never been so pitched into in his life as by an old girl in a stunning tile who found him washing out an empty piedish for the benefit of some maritime monsters that he wanted to carry home to his sisters but that when lance came up she was as meek as a mouse certainly the two boys were little sturdy fellows burnt lobsterlike up to the roots of their bleached and rough hair and their costumes were more adapted to the deck of the kittiwake in all weathers than to genteel society their sisters were in an aquarium fever and their sport all through their expedition had been researches for what they had learnt in scotland to call beasts and now the collection was to be completed from the mouth of the ewe and the scrambling and tumbling it involved were enchanting  kate staples who usually considered lance her charge was not sorry to see a croquet player disposed of among his own congeners for the game seemed such a necessary of life that it was actually prepared for on the sands to the extreme contempt of the anemone hunters play at croquet forsooth when rocks arent to be had to scramble on every day and scramble ecstatically they did up and over slippery stone and rock festooned with olive weed peeping into pools of crystal clearness and admiring rosy fans of weed and jewellike actinias embellished by the magic beauty of intense clear brightness the boys took off shoes and stockings turned up trousers and scrambled and paddled like creatures to the manner born  o dear i wish i might sighed the young lady  why dont you said charlie audley kate and em and annie always dodont they frank  of course they do or how would they ever get on  come along then miss gertrude said charlie you cant think how jolly it is  and soon another pair of little white feet were dancing on the rocks oh dear what a blunder of civilisation it is to wear shoes at all how delicious a hold one gets  i cant think why people do wear them they never are anything but a bother said lance  to play at football with suggested somerville from the top of a rock  but women dont said gertrude  i think women do it and make us that they may have something to worrit about said frank damp stockings are the bother of creation till one goes to school and then isnt it jolly  except the chilblains called out charlie  i believe said lance chilblains come of shoes  no they cant argued charlie for one has them on ones hands  well said gertrude lets form ourselves into a society for the suppression of shoes and stockings  hurrah cried lance i know one person at least that it would be a blessing to  the question was how the five bold reformers were to begin frank suggested drowning all the present stock and pretended to be about to begin but was of course prevented by a scream  public opinion must be prepared first said lance  and that said gertrude wed better do by a great example here well show what can be done why shouldnt we get out to the end of the kittens tail  one cant to the end said charlie theres a place big enough for a gig to go through half way out  and about the tide said lance  tide said charlie looking at his watchtide wouldnt think of playing us such a dirty trick as turning for an hour and a half  and the jolliest beasts of all always live in places like that added somerville come on president of the society for the suppression of shoesesto the front  on moved the august society now scrambling to a dry flat now threading a mauvais pas clinging to festoons of seaweed the three little boys climbed like monkeys or sailors but lance agile as he was had not had the same amount of training and felt besides that it was requisite to be ready to give a helping hand to miss gertrude she got on very well being full of lightness and springiness only she was a little inclined to be adventurous and to chatter at critical moments  we must have got out a quarter of a mile  oh no not that  no im sure it is how small they look on the beach i wonder if they can see us hark theyre singing  drink to me only with thine eyes thats felixs crack glee said lance what fun for him  this is much better fun cried the general voice theyll never see us if we wave now  no no dont lets wave now wait till we get to the farthest point  and there well plant our ensign  what shall we do for a flag we havent got the britisher here  no it must be the flag of the sssss  that ought to be a bit of bare skin  no noa pair of feetmotto off vile lendings  i say i dont think you can get any farther interposed somerville ive been on four rocks farther and im sure you will never get back again if you go on  oh thats base im sure this one isnt so hard  she was creeping along a ledge holding the seaweed with one hand and lance by the other  i really dont think it passable he said theres scarcely the width of ones foot beyond  hurrah shouted frank heres the father of all the daisianas  oh oh hes my cousin i must see him cried gertrude with a scramble and a laugh which ended in a sudden slipluckily not into the open sea but into a very steepsided bathlike pool and lance whom of course she gripped hard was pulled after her both over head and ears and though they scrambled on their feet in a moment there they stood up to their shoulders in water  get the daisiana now you are there shouted frank  how are we ever to get out said gertrude looking up the walls six feet at least on the lowest side  if we had a rope said charlie  make signalscall said somerville all suiting the action to the word no they dont hear they are all singing away you franky youre too little to be any good make the best of your way to call somebody  the tide will come in said frank mamma and aunt emmie were once shut in by the tide and uncle edwin and there was a fellow who was quite drowneddeadand that was why i was named francis  thats what you may call a cheering reminiscence at a happy moment said lance recollecting that he was far more nearly a man than any one present and instinctively feeling the need of brightening all into cheerful activity for the girl looked thoroughly frightened yes lord frank the best thing you can do is to go for somebody but well be out long first cant we make a rope have you a sash or anything miss gertrude dont fear well soon be out  happily she had both a sash and a broad ribbon round her hat and lance tore off his puggery  i can do it best called charlie i know all the sailors knots  it will never bear said gertrude  oh yes it will youll not trust your whole weight to it is it done  besides how can they draw me up  wed best get behind that rock sum suggested charlie then she wont pull us in  charlies sailor experience was very useful and he shouted advice to lance who was tying the extemporary rope round gertrude not very easily owing to the material and to its being done under water  now then you do your best at climbinghere he said theyll pull you and look there first my kneeyesnow my shoulder now and standing for a moment on his shoulder gertrude was really able with a desperate grapple to surmount the wall of her prison and scramble out beside the two cousins whose pulls had been very helpful  lances clambering was a harder matter for he did not venture to trust much to the rope though the girls strength was added to that of the two boys and it was a severe climb up the scarcely indented slippery moist slimy rock where his hands and feet could hardly find any hold and when at length he reached the top he was so panting and dizzy that somerville at first held him to hinder his slipping backward into the sea no one could get at king or queen daisiana so it was left in its glory while the young people struggled back over rocks that seemed much steeper and pools far deeper than in their advance lance still trying to be helpful but with a mazed sense of the same sort of desperate effort with which he had run back with bills verses for not only had his small strength been overtaxed but the immersion in water was affecting his head  lord francis had made much quicker progress and boy as he was showed his breeding by not rushing openmouthed on the party with his intelligence but seeking the captain who was smoking the pipe of solitude upon a rock apart he at once sent frank to the servants who were enjoying the relics of the feast to fetch some wine and tell the boats crew to make ready at once and then went off himself to seek mrs rivers felix who had spied the little messenger speeding up to the captain was already on his way to the rocks and reached the party in good time for draggled drenched and with clinging garments they were so slow in getting on that it was no delusion that the water was higher and the rocks lower and even gertrude had neither breath nor spirits to gabble when that grave anxious face met her and a strong careful hand lifted and helped first her then lance up and down every difficulty and when she perceived how the newcomer avoided pointblank looking at the bare ancles that had sometimes to make long stretches a burning red came up into her face half of shame half of indignation at being made ashamed and after all when the place where her hose and shoon had been left was reached the niched shelf in the rock turned out to have been surrounded by the tide so that they were quite unattainable either by herself or the little boys and felix putting the arm by which lance had held by him over somervilles shoulder told them to go on before and himself made two long strides and a scramble before he could reach the boots and stockings and give them to the young lady unable to help looking nearly as grave and vexed as if it had been angela herself indeed he was vexed for he had an ideal of the young ladyhood of his mothers old native region and did not like it to be disturbed he moved away far enough for her to think he had left her to her fate till she was on her feet and coming on and then there he was again in a moment the attentive squire revived by her short rest and on less perilous ground she glanced at his face in readiness to disperse her discomfort with something saucy but somehow it would not do and she was tamely conducted to terra firma where her sister saluted her with o daisy what a child you are to have charge of  that restored her enough to answer im quite delighted something should have happened under your keeping no harm done salt water never gives cold  i dont mind it for you said the elder sister you have not been illbut indeed mr underwood i am very sorry she added what will be best for your brother  here said captain audley taking from frank a flask of sherry and overruling the objection made by the brothers that stimulants were forbidden he further insisted on taking lance at once to his own berth on board the yacht while mrs rivers meant to conduct her sister to the preventive house  so said lance rather ruefully as he shook hands there ends the ssss  not at all its use is proved we should have been cooked by this time in the daisiana cauldron if we had had great cumbrous boots on  it was a valiant effort and she cast a glance out of the corner of her eye at the elder brother but it had not relaxed a muscle of his grave anxious face which was in truth chiefly bent on watching lances involuntary shiverings and she again turned crimson perhaps from her share of the chill and was dragged off muttering what intolerable folks guardian brothers are henry ward was a mild specimen compared to this one  about noon on the following day mrs pettigrews little girl abruptly opened the parlour door and with please yere wanted turned in a tall thin greyhaired spectacled gentleman who as lance started up from the sofa exclaimed dont disturb yourself i came to thank you and inquire after you after the adventure my mad cap daughter led you into  i hope she is all right said lance solicitously  as right as daisiana himself more so than i fear you are let me see you comfortable lie down again pray  oh i dont care about lying down thank you sir i only sleep for want of something to do but though he did not put his feet up he was feeling far too languid not to relax his boltupright attitude and lean back on his pillows  that will do bad headache  it is nearly gone off now thank you sir it was bad all night but it is much better since i have been asleep  let me see laying his left hand on the wrist that hung over the edge of the sofa ay i hope that wicked little siren has done no great damage pulled you below true mermaid fashioneh  i meant to have pulled her out  instead of which she made a lad into a ladder to climb out on which bad pun served the purpose of making the boy laugh enough to be at his ease she is much indebted and so am i i like to meet an old friends son are you alone  my brother is only gone to the postoffice he will be in before long but it saves a post to take the letters before twelve and he ought to be out as much as he can  is he here on his own account or yours  he came down first before i was ill it was bother and overwork and a cough everything always does come to worry him whenever he ought to have rest or pleasure and lance who was thoroughly weary and dispirited was nearly ready to cry  even when he goes out for a picnic young ladies must needs drown themselves  this made lance smile but he added with a quivering lip he would not go to bed till i could go to sleep last night and that was not till past two and he looks quite done up this morning  is any one attending you  dr manby did at minsterhamnobody here  whats been amiss with youfever  plenty of fever but it was from sunstroke  ah you boys have thinner skulls than we used to have how long ago  seven weeks yesterday said lance wearily  and you are sadly weary of weakness  i dont mind that so much and the kindness of face voice and gesture made the poor boys eyes overflow but im no good and i cant tell whether i ever shall be again  it is a great deal too soon to trouble yourself about that  thats what they all tell me cried lance impatiently and the tears rushed forth again manby only laughs and tells me i shall be a solon yet if i dont vex myself and how can i tell whether he means it  well dear boy have it all out i promise to mean whatever i say  you are a doctor then sir  what the boy doesnt know me as sure as my names dick may  oh cried lance that was what i heard felix saying to captain audleythat he did so wish dr may could look at me  thats all right then come then what is weighing on you weakness  just not weakness said lance i didnt care so much when i could scarcely get about but now i can walk any distance and still i have not a bit more sense  is your memory gone  i dont think so only if i fix my mind to recollect and it doesnt come by chance im all abroad and perfectly senseless and idiotic  and it brings on pain  yes if i try five minutes together  you dont try to read or write  i cantand then came the tears again music is just like red hot hammers to me there was a great fight with sobs rather puzzling to one who did not know what music was to the chorister and what is to be the end of it  that rest and patience will make you as well as ever  do you really think so but sir i have a little brother seven and a half years old with no understanding at allnot able to speak and if there were two of us on felixs hands like that if i could only be put away somewhere so that felix should not have the burthen of me  my poor little fellow is this what is preying on you all this time  not alwaysonly when i am doing nothing and that is most times he said dejectedly but the doctor smiled  then you may take the very anxiety as a proof that your brain is recovering you cannot expect to shake off the effects quickly but if you are only patient with yourself you will do perfectly well are you a son of the clergy  no i am a chorister at minsterham i have another year there when i can go back if ever  dont say if ever you will if you only will keep from fretting and hurrying and will accept that beautiful motto of the underwoods  lance smiled responsively and said more cheerfully you are quite sure sir  as sure as any man can be that there is no reason to anticipate what you dread it is quite possible that you may be more or less liable to bad headaches and find it needful to avoid exposure to summer sunshine but i should think you as likely to do your work in the world as any one i ever saw  the light on lances face did not wholly spring from this reply with theres felix he had bounded out of the room the next moment and his incautious voice could be heard through the windowfee fee heres her father that brick of a miss gertrudes i mean hes as jolly as he ought to be and knew all our people but justi say hows cherry  all well heres a note from the dear little thing herself said felix and in another moment with his bag strapped over his shoulder he had brought the bright sedateness of his face into the little parlour dr may how very kind in you  not kindness but common propriety to come and see how much mischief my naughty child had done  i dont think theres any real mischief said the elder brother looking at the muchrefreshed face  i think not and so am free to be glad of the catastrophe that has brought me in the way of an old friend yes i may say so for i must have known you  yes said felix we used to watch for you when you came to my uncle you always had some fun with us  i remember a pair of twins who were an irresistible attraction i hope they have grown up accordingly you look as if you ought to have pretty sisters  felix laughed and said the twins were reckoned as very pretty  how many of you are therewas it not thirteen did not those boys get the clergyorphan  one did thank you he is on a farm in australia now and i am thinking whether to try for little bernard but i am afraid his case would be a stale one being of seven years standing  if you want it done my daughter mrs rivers is a dragon of diplomacy in canvassing but why not send him to stoneborough cheviot takes a selection of clerics sons at 30 pounds and we would have an eye to him  thank you if we can only manage it but i must see what my sister saysour financier  one of those little appleblossom twins let me look at you do you mean to tell me that this fellow has been the whole standby of that long family these seven years he added turning to lance  to be sure he has cried lance eagerly  lance said felix rather indignantly you forget wilmet and thomas underwood entirely educated two of us  and said the doctor looking oddly but searchingly from one to the other youve been the bundle of sticks in the fable never gone together by the ears ah as both brothers burst out laughing at the question id not have asked if i had not seen how you could answer ive seen what makes me so afraid of brothers in authority that it does me good to look at you two  felix looked up the stoneborough murder case was about two years old and of course he had to study and condense the details and had come on the names of dr may and his son in the evidence  the further words met his sudden conjecture ay boys you little know what you may be spared by home peace and confidence well and what may you be doing felix your bag looks as if you had turned postman to the district  theres my chief business sir coupled with bookselling and stationery said felix as he pushed across a copy of the pursuivant that lay on the table i have been well paid from the first and am in partnership now so we have got along very well  ay ay very good trade i should think you must send me your paper felix i want one i can trust to lie about the house  you will find it very stupid and local sir  it was curious how what from mr staples was answered with an effort seemed from dr may to draw out confidence one point was that mr staples never seemed sure how to treat him and often betrayed a tear of hurting his feelings while with dr may he was himself and nothing else the doctor stayed to share their dinner such as it was in consideration of their being lodgers as didnt give troubleie some plain boiled fish fresh indeed but of queer name and quality and without sauce and some steak not distantly related to an old shoe but both seemed to think so little about it that the doctor who was always mourning over the daintiness of the present day approved them all the more  just as they had finished captain audley came in with his boys on their way to start off the somervilles by the train and it was agreed that when he took his son back to school at stoneborough felix and lance should come with him and spend the day  and a pleasant day it was as pleasant as the unsettled wanderings of a long day in a strange place could be and memorable for one curious factnamely that for the first time in her life gertrude may was shy  not with lance she had a good deal of pastime with him in the cool garden while felix was being walked over the schoolyards in the sun and they were excellent friends though ethel certainly had a certain repugnance to the discovery of how big a boy it was with whom gertrude had danced barefooted on the rocks of course ethel was the kindly mistress of the house as usual but she was worn and strained in spirits just then and disinclined to exert herself beyond the needful welcome to her fathers guests so she let them all go out and went on with her own occupations thinking that it was well that daisy should take her part in entertaining guests since that boy was evidently a thorough little gentleman and then shrinking a little as she heard their voices over aubreys museum including the coombe hole curiosities  no it was not towards lance that daisy was shy but when all sat round the dinnertable she was unusually silent and listened to the conversation far more than was her wont though it was chiefly political when felix spoke to her she absolutely coloured rosy red and faltered unable to conquer the shamefacedness that their encounter had left her and when the party had taken leave and she was standing in the twilight ethel to her great surprise found the child quietly crying  nothing she said angry at being detected  it cant be nothing  yes it is only i do so hatehate myself for being a tomboy  one often does go on with that a little too long and then comes the horrible feel  and that it should have happened with him of all people in the world  ah daisy i wish i had come out with you  fudge ethel not today do you think i care about that boy i should think not butbuti wanted to think him a nasty prig but i cant  who  why that eldest brother when he found me scrambling about with my stockings off he didnt speak but he looked as richard might surprised and sorry i thought it was impertinentat least i wanted to but and now hell always think menasty  my dear if one must have a lesson of that kind it is as well it should be from some one that one is never likely to see or hear of again  oh but not from the very best and noblest of people one ever will hear of yes ethel im not gone mad that boy has been telling me all about his brother and indeed i never did hear or know about any one who was a real hero in a quiet way no whenever i hear of a hero i shall think of mr underwood and oh dear that i should have made such a goose of myself  it was quite unaffecteda spark of real reverence had lighted at last on gertrudes mind to turn tradesman for the sake of ones brothers and sisters that i do call heroic she said and maintained his cause even to putting down f u as her favourite hero in lists of likes and dislikes  but there was no great chance of gertrude again encountering her hero for the morning after their day at stoneborough lance was beginning to experiment on his powers by skimming newspapers especially the pursuivant because he knew it before all but the last local items that could only be added at the moment of going to press suddenly he broke out holloa you never told me this mowbray smith has put his foot in it this time  what said felix pausing in the act of opening an envelope from mr froggatt  pocketing the coal and school moneyay and the alms  eh impossible let me look  there a letter signed scrutator theres a great deal more than i can read all about underpaid curates and sycophants my lady is catching it i should say it must be true or froggy would not have put it in  he never admitted that said felix tearing open his letter he is in utter dismay asks whether i could have seen the thing tells me to telegraph yes or no that he may know whether to speak to redstone whats this about tribute to my father  here once it was deemed well that the ecclesiastical staff should be by birth and character if not by pecuniary fortune above suspicion but the universal application of the general screw system has warned off all who had a predilection for an unfettered tongue and we all know what hands accompany one in chains  libellous cried felix running his eye over the article it looks as if it had strayed out of the dearport hermes id not have had this happen for ten thousand pounds claptrap about fat rectors and starved curates jackmans writing id lay any wager  you dont think he did it  smith muddled his accounts nothing more likely charges like this are not got up without some grounds of some sort but as to intentional fraud thats utter nonsense well im off to the station and i hope in half an hours time master redstone will be quaking  ten days of the holiday still remained and captain audley with boat and yacht greatly added to its pleasures which both brothers were able thoroughly to enjoy living almost entirely out of doors and valuing each hour as they became fewer  this matter however made felix very uneasy he wrote to the curate offering all the amends in his power and undertaking that if mr smith would send him an explanatory letter he would back it up with a strong leading article and he waited anxiously for further intelligence  mr froggatts letter came first redstone fond of dabbling in editorship had taken reproof in great dudgeon affecting great surprise at being blamed for inserting a letter from a respectable gentleman without submitting it to mr froggatt who had entirely dropped the editorship or delaying it to another issue by sending it to ewmouth the respectable gentleman was young jackman who was no doubt delighted to have such a firebrand to cast it was a great grief and annoyance to mr froggatt who had always steered clear of personalities and been inoffensive if sometimes dull and both assault and defence were distressing to himie if defence were possible for he seemed doubtful whether silence would not lead to the least scandal even wilmet wrote every one seems to think mr smith is to blame and he is so huffy that it looks only too much as if he were afraid of inquiry  this was too true a character of his replies that intended for the paper had not a line of real defence but was a mere tirade on the dignity of his office and the impudence of the charges felix dashed it away enraged at its useless folly nor was the private one more satisfactory it was but a half acceptance of felixs total disclaimer and the resentful wording made it difficult to discern whether the imputation were bona fide regarded as not worth refuting or whether indignation were made an excuse for denial instead of proof a separate sheet seemed to have been added the whole is to be subjected to the scrutiny of a parish meeting on tuesday when though the minute accuracy of a professional accountant is not to be expected of one whose province is not to serve tables it will be evident that only malignity to the church could have devised the attack to which your paper has given currency  well broke out lance as felix with a voice of ineffable disgust read the final sentence if that is not being a knave it is very like a longeared animal  ill tell you what lance theyll take him between their teeth and worry him till theres not an inch left whole of him jackman and his pack will tear him down and even bruce and jones and our own good old froggy will give him up when they see his books wont balance  serve him right cried lance what fun to see his airs taken down when hes served with the sauce hes so fond of for other people i only wish theyd got my lady too  i must go home thats all said felix if i got there on wednesday i might see if i could not get his accounts into presentable order  what  if i dont i am afraid no one else will  he will not let you  i think i can make him  but such a cur as he has always been to you  i dont think he will object now i know he cant do the thing himself and if little bisset could depend upon it his mother would not let him stir a finger for fear of being implicated now i do know the ways of those accounts ive done them with my father and with mr audley any way i must be at home for the meeting imagine redstone reporting it but you can stay out the week and come home in the yacht  for captain audley had promised to take the brothers round to dearport but lance could not bear to be left behind and it ended in their walking up to the tudor cottage to make their excuses when the goodnatured captain declared that he could put to sea that very night and land them at dearport in good time  so after a hurried grateful farewell to the staples family the holiday closed with a voyage that both were able to enjoy to the utmost before they sailed into the harbour at dearport and walked up to st faiths captain audley who had not seen sister constance since her husbands death had an access of shyness and would not encounter the lady abbess as he called her but his last words to felix were a promise that if bernard went to stoneborough he would have him out now and then for a holiday with his own boy  there had been time to send notice to geraldine and her brothers had hoped to have taken her home with them but though she looked clear and bright she was not out of the doctors hands and was under orders to stay another week the sight of her brothers made her very homesick in spite of being the spoilt child of the sisterhood in the pleasant matted room with its sea view its prints and photographs but then she wanted to have her way prepared with wilmet her vision had been to walk in imposingly and take them all by surprise but that notion had vanished as the time drew nearer and she found that her new art required practice while the dread of making a sensation grew upon her she was ashamed of having even thought of compensating for wilmets absence and entreated felix to communicate the fact without a word of the presumption that had nerved her courage  the three looked over one another as if each had undergone much since the last meeting but the sight of felix greatly relieved cherry he was sunburnt and vigorous and his voice had resumed its depth of quiet content instead of having that unconsciously weary sound of patience and exertion that had often gone to her heart lance whom she had not seen since easter had assumed a look of rapid growth his features had lost their childish form and were disproportionate and his complexion still had the fitful colouring of convalescence but his eyes were dancing and his talk ecstatic as to vale leston and the kittiwake where he was ready at that moment to become a cabinboy  o cherry cherry you never dreamt of anything so delicious as that nights fishing  that i will answer for she never did said felix when i saw the exquisite delight it afforded not only to this lance but to captain audley to fill the boat with slimy flapping uncomfortable dying fishes i felt that i was never made for a gentleman  do you mean that you didnt like it exclaimed lance turning round aghast  i should have been much happier balancing the books  and he wasnt even sick said lance holding up his hands  he hadnt that excuse laughed cherry however midnight fishing is not indispensable i should like to have seen how he looked at vale leston  lance was in great hopes that felix would betray the possibilities and mayhap but for his presence prudence might have evaporated beneath the warm breath of cherrys sympathy but the answer was only a discreet laugh and reply like a man who wanted his sister i wish i could just fill your eyes with the loveliness of it cherry and in the midst of his description in came sister constance bringing with her sister emmeline sister in blood as well as religion wanting to hear about the nephews and the kittens tail adventure and amused to find lance a little shy about itcertainly not disposed to dwell on it with his usual unceremonious drollery of narrative they would not let felix go without an inspection by dr lee which was perfectly satisfactory as to the rally of the constitution from the depression that had threatened disease though it was impressed both on him and on cherry that he must be careful next winter and never neglect a cold and with this promise the brothers took the train and in half an hour were at homerather an empty home for the schools were all in operation again and wilmet was not at liberty for some little time after their arrival  when she did come in she was disappointed not to find geraldine and that felix had become so absorbed in the business that had brought him home that he only sent in word that he was obliged to go into the town and tea must not wait for him lance remained but the burthen of two secrets rendered him uncommunicative when wilmet tried to understand the cause of cherrys delay at st faiths and alda was curious about vale leston and mrs fulbert whom she had seen at kensington palace gardens it did not take much acumen to exclaim still no children then there must be a chance for us  that is not likely said wilmet it must be all in their own power and the vicar must be quite a young man is he not lance  how should i know  didnt you see him  i saw his wife and that was enough  about fiveandthirty said alda of course it will all go to uncle tom money always goes to money  how flushed you are lance said wilmet are you tired  rather i am going out into the garden  there however he was pursued by bernard with a warwhoop and by theodore with his concertina and stella presently reported that he was gone up to bed  and i am afraid his room is very hot and noisy sighed wilmet  he is only tired and cross after his two nights at sea said alda  lance cross  my dear wilmet it is very bad taste in families always to maintain each others impeccability  alda was still the only person capable of defeating wilmet and she managed to render her very uncomfortable before the end of the evening when hours passed and still felix did not come in and alda suggested in the intervals of yawning that wilmet would soon learn how green it was to sit up now that felix had got out of leading strings and set up bachelor habits  at first wilmet was highly indignant but when alda persisted that she was rather glad to see felix like other young men and that wilmet would know better when she was married and then yawned herself off to bed there was a sense of great discomfort to accompany the solitary vigil which not only involved fancies of possible accidents but was harassed by this assault on faith in the virtue and sincerity of man could it really be the part of a wise woman to wink at being deceived as an inferior creature with impossible expectations of truth and purity yet alda knew the world  how much heartsickness was darned into lances impossible heel before the clock chimed two a step and not a policemans came along the pavement and paused at the door as while the bell was cautiously pulled down she flew  my dear mettie i am so sorry so ashamed of not having sent home to tell you but if i had made the least move it might have upset everything  what have you been about  going over mowbray smiths accounts  oh  i am very sorry how tired you must be i was vexed not to be able to give you notice but you know what poor smith is  i dont know why you had to do it all and at this time of night said wilmet still a little hurt  it is the only chance for him tomorrow at the meeting to have his accounts clear so i called under the plea of seeing about the letter in pur and with much ado got him to realise a little more of his position and let me look at the books that was at five  and you have been at it ever since o felix as he stretched his arms and gave a vast yawn  ay if i had shown any consciousness of the time he would have shut up at once and he would not let me take them home to do tomorrow morning  it is tomorrow morning  so it is i must make haste for i must try to see mr ryder and jones before the meeting goodnight dear old w w i meant to have had other talk  but oh you must have some supper  ive had itsumptuous stilton cheese  so wilmets faith in masculine nature rebounded as high as alda had striven to sink it  patience was a good deal needed the next day for felix had to rush away from breakfast and never appeared at all at dinner he had to be present at the very stormy meeting though only to take notes and thus had the annoyance of seeing mr smith destroying his own cause by his incapacity to understand the statement so carefully drawn up until mr ryder on whom the enemy had reckoned as a champion took the papers out of the helpless hand comprehended felixs figures at a glance and set them lucidly forth such as they were but even then there were blots which there were plenty of persons ready to hit the truth was that between lady prices economies and the unwillingness to call vestry meetings moneys intended for one purpose had been used for another and articles not within the denomination of charities had been charged on funds raised for that exclusive object  the assembly comprised the usual variety the malicious foes of religion headed by jackman the more numerous enemies not of what they supposed religion but of the church the adversaries not of the church but of the curate and the few loyally unwilling to condemn a clergyman but disgusted at the affair and staggered by his management perhaps the rabid and ribald violence of the hostile party did mr smith good with the respectable and there were many too whose dictum wasfelix underwood says it is all right at any rate though the bishop was memorialised it was in a much better spirit than had been likely at first and it was not to be done without notice to the rector and when this was over every one as usual went to the rendezvous at froggatts either to discuss or inquire and the release of both partners on that summer evening was later than ever it had been before  but then what a welcome upstairs what a clamour of happy tongues what an ecstatic humming of the hardy norseman what a clinging to and climbing on him if he had the cares he had much of the joys of the goodman of the house but presently he missed the voice usually blithest of all and asked for lance  he was here a little while ago said wilmet drinking his tea he must have gone up to bed  no said bernard ive just been up to the barrack and he isnt there  youve not let him sleep in the attic exclaimed felix why under the leads it is like an oven  i am very sorry said wilmet but i could not see how to help it your room is worse with the glare of the setting sun and so is cherrys at this time of the evening  then he must have mr froggatts  i thought said alda that you never took liberties with mr froggatt  nonsense said felix there are only two bedrooms in this house fit for that boy in his present stateyours and mr froggatts which shall we have wilmet  mr froggatts she answered at once if you will not have another cup ill get it ready for him at once  ive just done ill come and help you but where can the boy be in the garden  no said wilmet taking a survey from the window  i have hardly seen him all day added alda i suppose he has pursuits of his own  pursuits said felix looking really anxious poor little chap he cant do without constant care and quiet  wilmet made no answer but rose and left the room alda muttered something about his looking quite well which felix did not stay to hear following his sister out with a word about looking for him at the same moment a little soft hand was thrust into his and stella as soon as the door was shut said please i know where lance is but its a secret  not from me i hope said felix catching her up in his arms  i think not said stella meditatively he only told me not to let bear and tedo know because they make a row he is only up over the back warehouse where he used to play the fiddle to us last easter  the only cool quiet place he could find said felix with more of a look of reproach than he had ever given wilmet  it went to her heart i did not know what to do she said meekly i wanted very much to go into the barrack ourselves but alda said it would kill her and you know it has always been a sore subject that we would not let her have mr froggatts room i ought not to have given way  aldas selfishness is a great power muttered felix and wilmet was too much ashamed to contradict him except by she is vexed because she has not heard from ferdinand as they hastily made their way to the warehouse which being on the north side of higher buildings never did get scorched through  felix went up a stepladder wilmet following and there sure enough was lance lying in a nest of paper shavings with head on his airpillow oh youve unearthed me have you i wish youd let me stay here all night he said with some weary fretfulness but the next moment burst into a peal of laughter as wilmets head appeared above the floor pallas athene ascends oh what a place it would be to act a playonly then all the fry would find it out i hope they havent i told the star not to tell  my poor dear lance is this the only quiet place you could find and you let us all neglect you and never complained exclaimed wilmet kissing his hot forehead  why its only my stupidity said lance wearily but gratefully and you cant make places quiet or cool if you would just let me sleep here  no but you shall have mr froggatts room he will not want it now come along lance well bring your things down the barrack is a great deal too hot for you to go into  he did not make any resistance but as they landed from the ladder threw his arm round wilmet and leant against her with a sort of lazy mischievous tenderness as he said isnt the froggery wanted for somebody else and tried to look up in her face  ferdinand always goes to the fortinbras arms answered wilmet with admirable composure  oh thats a precedent said lance ostentatiously winking at felix who was very glad the ice was broken when is he coming mettie  i think alda hoped he might have run down tonight on hearing of your return  there they paused while entering the house and going upstairs but no sooner were they in the barrack which was certainly insufferably hot than lance returned to the charge  but when is he coming not fernanhes an old story  yes said felix walking up to wilmet to fold together the corners of the sheets they were stripping from lances bed and looking into her eyes so archly as to bring up an incarnadine blush i want particularly to improve my acquaintance if you dontwhat shall we do lance  advertise in pur suggested lance the editor returned young men may apply  dont boys exclaimed wilmet in tones belonging to bygone days when neither she nor felix had been too serious to tease or be teased he is much better than you she added with a pretty confused petulance when felix put on a pleading inquisitive face when he found we didnt like it he went away to visit his uncle  better than we there lance said felix in a gratified provoking tone of discovery  in one sense said wilmet walking down before him  i am very glad you have found it out added felix as they entered mr froggatts cool wellblinded bedroom the only wellfurnished one in the house  it is no laughing matter said wilmet seriously  thats well was the dry answer  but there felix perceived that she was on the verge of tears and he kindly and quietly helped her to despatch her arrangements for lance before any more was said only as they turned to bid the tired boy goodnight he said where does the uncle live i shall telegraph to morrow you cruel person  hush silly boygoodnight said wilmet with a quivering voice then as she shut the door please dont go on this way felixi wouldnt have had it happen for any consideration  i suppose not said felix as they returned to the twilight garden but as it haswhy my mettie dear as she pressed close to him and hid her face on his shoulder with a strong craving for the help and sympathy from which the motherless girl had hitherto been debarred  o felix i wish he would not be so good and kind i wish you would not try to make me give in  my dear girl said felix with his arm round her you know i would not if i did not see that you had given in  no i havent she cried why should you want to persuade me isnt it very cruel and hard to let him give all himself to one that cant come to him he will have to go out and live all dreary and lonely for years and years and come home to find nothing but a stupid old wornout drudge with all these pretty looks gone off felix be reasonable please cant you see that i ought not to let things go that way  do you mean said felix that you would be quite content to put an end to all thislet harewood go away believing you indifferent and never see him again  felix why do you with tears in her eyes  because i am quite sure that the consideration you want to show him would be no kindness the pain of having his affection thrown over he spoke with a spasm in the throat would be greater than you would like to inflict if you were forced by truth to own you did not care for him and if he be what i think the carrying away security of your feeling for him will be gladness enough and as for the looks i have a better opinion of yours than to think they wont wear any way dearest it seems to me that you have won the heart of a good man and that if you like him it is your duty to give him the comfort of knowing it without thinking about tomorrows  but i know so much more would come if i did just allow that much and i might get to wish to leave you all she said in an appalled voice and there seems to me not the slightest chance you see alda and cherry never will get on together and cherry seems glad of an excuse to stay from home i thought she would have cared to come back when you did  poor cherry said felix hesitating with a little of her own nervous awe of broaching the subject  you dont mean that there is anything seriously amiss she cried startled  wilmet do you remember what rugg said would be the very best thing for that poor child  she stood still dismayed and angered they arent tormenting the poor little thing about that  it is not their doing  it cant have become necessary sister constance would have told me felix say she is not worse  no much better but wilmet what we could not bear to think of she thought of for herself and begged to have it done  then i must go to her  there is no occasion she knew you could not be spared it was done on the 10th and she will soon walk better than she has done all these years  done without our knowledge  she wished to spare us all but that was not allowed i was written to and told that her strong desire was such a favourable condition that i had better consent so as not to protract the strain of spirits she made a point of no one else knowing except clement  ah wilmet spoke as if under a weight that was the day clement went down to dearport and came home so late how could sister constance consent not to tell me  you must forgive her for it was the little ones desire of course we should have been fetched if anything had gone wrong but she has done perfectly well and there she is very happy and so full of fun that the sisters say she keeps them all alive  done i cannot fancy it said wilmet do you know i believe it has been my bugbear for years past to think i might have to persuade her to this  to tell you the truth so it has to me  little nervous timid thing i cant even understand her thinking of it  she wanted me not to tell you but i would not promise she could not rest without trying not to be an obstacle to  wilmet interrupted with a cry of pain  isnt it a noble little thing  but it is so silly broke out wilmet not choosing her words amid her tears  so she thinks now poor child she is quite ashamed of the presumptuous notion that did brace and carry her through  i dont like her to be disappointed said wilmet but it is quite ridiculous  only comfort her a little mettie dear for she is very much afraid you will think she has taken a great liberty with your property  i only wish i could kiss her this moment  well run down by the train tomorrow they would all be delighted  no no felix impossible think of the cost  half a crown sinful waste said felix in a tone of alarming levity  felix if you only knew what the housekeeping mounted up in that unhappy month that i was away i did not like to tell you before but  well at the dreadful pause  i had to get fifteen pounds from mr froggatts and alda finds after all that she cannot advance the money for lances journey  so you are pinching it out by pence my poor w w  nothing extra must be done till this is made up  yet it seems needful that bernard should go to school i wrote about  no she resolutely interrupted bernard must wait over this year thirty pounds utterly out of the question  her tone gave felix an unusual sense of chill penury and brought vale leston before his eyes  he laughed rather bitterly saying perhaps some day neither thirty pence nor thirty pounds may have so direful a sound  i never mean to learn to waste  you may have to learn to spend  thats enough to set me against it she exclaimed with a good deal of pain and he found how nearly he had broken his resolution and how her application of his words to herself had saved him he followed the lead  nay you were glad of aldas prosperity  oh yes but poor alda has been hindered from being like one of us she said we have fought it out together and i should not mind so much if he were poor like us and had to wait on his own account  i appreciate that said felix but at least you will let the poor fellow come and judge for himself  ifif only felix you will promise not to try to tempt me into deserting you all when i know it would be wrong  if i will promise you not to cut my own throat eh come w w put out of your head what it may lead to confess that you are afraid of getting connected with such a mad harumscarum set  it isnt broke out wilmet i never saw any one so thoughtful and considerate they are all so kind and warmhearted that i grew quite ashamed of my own fidgetiness and hehe always knew the right thing at the right time you cant think how his look seemed to hold me up when poor lance was moaning and talking nonsense  having thus let herself out as she had never dared nor indeed been tempted to do since the first dawn of the courtship wilmet at last relieved herself of some of the vast sense of emotion that she had been forcing back for the last month hitherto the mistress of the house had seemed older than the master but now the elder brother took the place of both parentsay and of sisteras all her fencing over she poured out her heart and let him sympathise cheer soothe and encourage more by kind tones than actual words the harvestmoon shone over the housetops as a month before she had shone by the riverside and the pillars of the house walked up and down till alda grew desperate and sallied out to tell them that it was past eleven  it was only such snatches of time that felix could give to home affairs for his hands were full of arrears of business and the excitement respecting mr smith necessarily occupied him pending the arrival of letters from the rector every tongue was in commotion and the readingroom was a focus of debate and centre of intelligence so many letters either in assault or defence were addressed to the editor of the pursuivant that only a supplement as big as the times could have contained them every poor person who had not had every demand supplied from the charities was running about adding to the grievance at every encounter with tenderhearted lady or justiceloving gentleman whose blood boiled over into a letter for the pursuivant which when sifted and refused was transferred to the dearport hermes or erms as most of its supporters termed it     chapter xxii  the real thing and no mistake    with asses all his time he spent  their clubs perpetual president  he caught their manners looks and airs  an ass in everything but ears                                   gay   the master of the house was unable to contribute much more than his name to the propriety of the arrival of the suitors and this made wilmet the more determined that geraldine should precede them nor since the halfcrown must be disbursed on an escort for her did the housewifely conscience object to the expedition for wilmet could not but long to thank the superior and sister constance and to obtain dr lees advice as to future management her coming was great joy to cherry who had dreaded the meeting almost with a sense of guilt though still hoping felix had been silent on her motive and wilmet did not betray him but only treated her sister with a mixture of almost shy tenderness and reverence nor did cherry dare to ask a question as to wilmets own affairs nor even about ferdinand travis lest she should seem to be leading in that direction however wilmet in a persuasive tone communicated that ferdinand had been long without writing and though cherry tried to be sorry for alda her spirit quailed at the state of temper her sister evidently meant to prepare her for  but fate was more kind than she expected that very saturday brought both gentlemen and by the same train they made each other out as they were leaving their bags at the fortinbras arms and arrived together in marked contrastthe tall dark regularfeatured soft eyed lifeguardsman and the little sandy freckled sundried engineer and thus two courtships had to be carried on in the two rooms only supplemented by the narrow parallelogram of a garden for ferdinand travis was back again rather amused at the family astonishment at the rapidity of his journey to america which to his transatlantic notions of travel was as nothing and indeed had been chiefly performed in a big steamer where he could smoke to his hearts content  for the first few days there was a good deal of restraint wilmet was more shy than in the unconscious days of bexley while john harewood was devoid of his familys assurance and bonhomie and so thoroughly modest and diffident as to risk nothing by precipitation in begging for a decision felix inexperienced and strongly sensible of his office as guardian of his sisters dignity would not hint at the result of his investigations into wilmets sentiments and it was to geraldine that captain harewoods attentions were chiefly paid knowing aldas resolute monopoly of her cacique cherry at first held back and restrained her keen enjoyment of real conversation but she found wilmet thankful to have the talk done for her and content to sit at work listening almost in silence but proud that her captain should be interested in her sister and pleased to see cherrys expressive face flash and sparkle all over for him while wilmet was at miss pearsons cherry was his chief resource they read drew and talked and in that halfhours out ofdoor exercise which dr lee had so strongly enjoined his arm was at her service they were soon on the borders of confidence though never quite plunging over them perhaps the broad openmouthed raillery at his home made the gentle reticence of the underwoods the more agreeable to him at any rate he did not try to break through it nor to presume beyond the step he had gained alda who could best perhaps have acted as helper had her own affairs to attend to and they were evidently unsatisfactory for ferdinand was more than ever the silent melancholy don and she was to domestic eyes visibly cross and her halfyear at home had rendered her much less capable of concealing illhumour something was owing to wear and suspense together with the effects of the summer heat and confined monotonous life without change or luxury but much was chargeable on the manifestations of temper to which she had given way in the home circle she told wilmet the trouble which ferdinand wished to have kept from open discussion till he had received a final statement of his means to lay before felix he had received no remittances since the spring and on demanding his own share of the capital and investments had found it instead of the lions a ridiculously small portion the whole fortunes of the house of travis had been built on his mothers inheritance but the accounts laid before him represented all the unprosperous speculations undertaken by his father william while the small ventures of his uncle alfred had alongside of them swelled into the huge wealth of which ferdinand had been bred to believe himself the heir so palpably outrageous was this representation that he had persuaded himself that personal investigation on the spot would clear it up or perhaps more truly his blood was up and he could not bear to be inactive he had rushed over to new york and of course he had been baffled exposure was of no use where sympathy was for the lucky rather than the duped and luckless and where the anglicised lifeguardsman could expect it least of allat a time too when all business affairs were convulsed by the uncertainties of civil war alda could not believe at first that he had done his utmost and seemed to have reproached him with weakness and mismanagement but by her own account she had roused the innate lion he would not tell her what had passed in the interview with his uncle but he had shuddered over the remembrance and when she upbraided him with not having gone far enough he terrified her by the fierceness with which he had turned upon her bidding her never recur to what she knew nothing about and muttering to himself far enoughthank god i went no further or i should not be here now and then falling into deep gloom he had certainly made alda afraid of him and she burst into tears as she told wilmet declaring herself the most miserable girl in the world  no that you cant be alda while he is so good and true  but he says he must sell out think of that never was anybody so taken in as i have been  dont talk so alda it is just as if you had engaged yourself to a lifeguardsman and nothing else  i wonder how you would like to be buried in some horrid wild place in america where you would never see anybody  one would not want to see anybody but him  thats your nonsense how tired of it one would be  there would be no time it would be so nice to do everything for him oneself  in some horrid uncivilised place with no servants im not going to be a drudge it is all very well for you who like it and have no notion of society but for me and there he is furious to take me out men grow so wild and rough too in such places you never saw anything blaze like his eyes  i dont understand you could not you trust yourself anywhere with him  you have no right to say such things pouted alda only because i have a little common prudence some one must have it  there was no denying that life in the far west would be a foolish thing either for or with alda and felix thought so when ferdinand came to him for consultation over the letters that made it finally clear that alfred travis had appropriated everything available but half a block of unreclaimed land on the wrong side of america and a few thousands invested in peter browns firm and what was worse the sudden failure of the supplies had occasioned serious debts ferdinands own plan was to clear these off with the price of his commission and take alda out with him to rule in american luxury over the unbounded resources of the magnificent land the very name and scent of which had awakened in him his old prairieland instincts and her absolute refusal and even alarm at his enjoyment had greatly mortified him she should not even have to rough it he said i could make her like a queen out there if she would only believe it  felix could not but think alda might be wise though it was not pretty wisdom go out alone and make the fortune ferdinand did not seem to think the separation possible he said he would rather go to work in peter browns office where he had already a hold and his familiarity with spanish would secure him usefulness and promotion and five or six years would bring them into a position to marry he did not look fit for deskwork in london but his mind was made up to any privation so that he could be in reach of alda and hope to give her what he had once thought easily within his grasp  hearing this felix propounded an old longing of hisnamely to make the pursuivant a daily paper and use means for promptitude of intelligence such as might neutralise the unpopularity it was incurring on behalf of mr smith rumours of a rival paper were afloat but if ferdinand would throw in his capital and undertake the joint editorship and proprietorship the hold that the pursuivant already had warranted quite success enough to permit an immediate marriage there would be no need to be concerned with the shop they might take a cottage in the country and he need not ride in so often as every day in fact it was his capital rather than his personal assistance that was wanted he caught at the notion he was too transatlantic to have any dignities to stand upon and he said almost with tears in his eyes that he could never be so happy as in working with felix and he went off to the fortinbras arms only lamenting that it was too late to tell alda while felix on his side could not help knocking at geraldines door within he found another auditor wilmet who still always helped cherry to bed it will be the making of the pursuivant he said  how often i have sighed if i had but capital or mr froggatt enterprise  ah felicissimo mio that pursuivant is as dear to you as any brother or sister of us all  so it ought to be for it has been the making of uscome cherry confess that you had rather see pur triumph than  than you at vale leston said cherry not knowing what a bolt she shot it would be grand to steal a march on the enemy  and safe asked wilmet  felix demonstrated to the comprehending ears of his sisters the circulation that he could securely reckon upon  there would be an immense deal more to do said cherry but at that he smiled full of vigour  true but we should have a larger staff there would be fernan  for the racing articles said cherry dryly  and a good deal besides which only needs application and that he has  he has great resolution said cherry but he always seems to me a sort of christian panther of the wilderness and you seem to be getting him into a cage  not such a cage as peter browns office and besides it is only when he is lashed up that the panther leaps about his den generally he is a quiet determined animal with the practical yankee element strong in him it may be true as edgar says that he does not see an inch on either side of his nose but that only makes him go right away in the line he does see i know he will work well  if alda said cherry  oh she will be willing a cottage in the country besides it is the only reasonable possibility  i should think it would satisfy her said wilmet  and then  everybody understood that and then it was aldas pretension to be at the head of the family that was the chief obstacle to wilmets abdicating that post without her geraldine stronger and less lame might undertake the charge of the comparatively few permanently at home might indeed hardly expressed the amount of uncertainty as to her capability and yet but for that and then wilmet would hardly have yielded as she did the next day  stella had a blackberry fever possibly wilmets frugal regimen engendered a hankering for fruit or it might have been the mere love of enterprise that rendered her eagerly desirous of an expedition to a lane where splendid blackberries were reported to grow since the day she bad been lost she had never been allowed to go out with bernard but in lance she had acquired a much more complaisant playfellow who not only promised his escort to the lane but the purchase of the sugar and aid in the concoction of the jam but he durst not venture till late in the day and thereupon john harewood suggested would not your sister be at liberty by that time  lance can take care of me said stella but in her eyes the whole romance of the expedition was destroyed by his acquiescence well catch her as she comes out and make her go with us  among all the girls laughed cherry and captain harewood coloured shook his head and shuddered  the girls wont hurt me said lance not if there were twenty hundred ill bring her from the very teeth of them jack may wait round the corner if he likes  the party waited till their patience was worn to a thread for the opening of the tall olive door until lance valiantly resolved on a singlehanded assault and had just mounted the steps when it suddenly opened and he found himself obstructing the path of a swarm of little girls and big who all stared most giggled and some greeted him to the least of these he confided that he wanted his sister when she innocently piloted him to the schoolroom where wilmet with her hat on was keeping guard over three victims detained by unfinished tasks every one gazed at him as if he had been a sort of actaeon but nothing daunted he answered his sisters anxious exclamation nothing is the matter but we are going for a walk and want youmiss maria he cried as the sound of the unfeminine step and voice brought in one of the heads please do let off these impositions we do so want her  what you here this is an invasion she added goodhumouredly am i to take it as a convalescents privilege  thank you maam said lance bowing with his audacious sweetness and please let me have wilmet id do the impositions myself only i dont know french  the victims tittered uncontrollably and miss maria laughed as one who like her neighbours descried why wilmet was in request i will attend to these exercises miss underwood she said you must not lose this fine evening for the idleness of these young ladies  indeed maam began wilmet in a blaze of colour i never thought of such a thing  i daresay not my dear said miss maria but now you had better do it i wish you a pleasant walk  lance how could you broke out wilmet as they descended the steps i never was so ashamed in my life  never mind we are going to get blackberries at mile end lane and i shall lose stella to a dead certainty if you dont come and look after her  my dear lance i cant go all that way without their knowing it at home  oh thats all settled with cherry  and wheres alda  off somewhere with her don come w w or who knows whether stel and i shall ever come home  by this time they had reached the corner where captain harewood and stella were lying perdu and wilmet made no more resistance only keeping the little girls not altogether willing hand till they came to the stile leading to the field and woodland and then stellas durance ended and her adventures with lance became as free as though no grave sister had been near  perhaps since wilmet had perceived that surrender was her fate she was willing that the summons should be over and a mutual understanding reached so as to waste no more of the time already so short however that might be though the talk began with lances health and cherrys talents there was a tendency towards topics closer still nor did she start aside but rather listened pensively as to a strain that touched her quiet soul more deeply than she showed in word or gesture  the blackberry lane was deep and hollow the brambles outstretching their arching wreaths laden with heavy clusters of shining fruit glossy black scarlet or green sometimes with a lingering pearly flower a stepladder stile led down into it from the field and on the topmost step her back against the rail sat wilmet on the lowest turned at right angles to the first was john harewood looking up to her while scrambling on the bank contending with the brambles were the younger ones lance unable to help now and then sending a furtive glance through the tangle  it was a pretty sight sitting aloft wilmet was framed by an archway of meeting branches with nothing but the pale opal of the evening sky behind the beautifullyshaped head and shoulders and the clear cut features drooping just enough to enhance her own peculiar modest dignity and give it a soft graciousness that had once been wanting her dress was the same in which captain harewood had first seen her a plain black hat a pale fawncoloured skirt and a loose open jacket over a white cambric vest and sleeves only that now there had been a budding forth of dainty fresh knots of rosecoloured ribbon at the throat and down the front as though a slight sensibility to the vanities as well as the cares of life had begun to dawn on the grave young housemother  leaning back against the rough rail to assist the hand of the climber john harewood looked up with as much worship in his countenance as ever good man feels for the being he loves in all her maiden glory thus they had been for some moments only broken by the childrens distant calls till the fervent words broke from him may i not speak now  no word of reply sounded but the delicate lips quivered and parted the eyes were cast down and seemed to swim in a soft mist of brightness the queenly head bent and the roseate tint on the cheek deepened and spread while something came over the face that caused the low glad exclamation you sweetest i do believe you can love me  a tremulous smile a glitter of tears on the eyelashesa whisper you wont let me be able to help it  then the hands were clasped and no words but thank you would come to the young mans lips  and then and the sound reminded him he bowed his head adding thank god  thank god echoed wilmet softly for indeed she added as she let her eyes fully meet his ardent gaze i know you will help me to do whatever may be his will  he helping me said john harewood and there was a reverent silence of untold peace and bliss first interrupted by his long sigh of infinite relief and joy and then as he looked and looked with all his soul in his eyes an exclamation almost in spite of himself you beautiful creature you are mine indeed  her colour deepened but her lips moved into an odd little smile out of which came the words isnt that rather foolish  i couldnt help iti beg your pardon said he reddening you do look so lovely but indeed it is not the externals only but what looks through  and that is what makes me afraid said wilmet as the dew gathered on her eyelashes i dont think im so nice as you take me for  probably you dont he said smiling  but just hear me she said laying her hand on his as if to silence him you ought to know what all the others would tell you if they were not too kind i know they all feel me strict and managing and domineering yes it makes you laugh but i really am i dont think you would have liked me at all if you had not seen me out of my usual life with only lance and as all she said only made him press her hand the closer you see ive always had to do things ever since i was a little girl i have had to keep order great boys and all and i know it has made me disagreeable then in answer to some sound more incredulously negative than words yes indeed felix and all go to cherry with whatever comes very near them she hasnt been hardened and sharpened and dried like me and wasnt stupid to begin with  cherry is very clever but she isnot  now dont i know how it is i know im horribly pretty and ive been a wonder always for keeping the house going and doing for them all and so you fancy me everything charming but i do so wish you could really know as my brothers do how it takes out of one all that is nice and sweet and that people like  people said john smiling but seeing that a mirthful even though a loving answer was not what she wanted he gravely said i do understand dearest that you have had to be too much of an authority to be altogether the companion and confidante that geraldine is free to be but perhaps i feel that this renders you more wholly and altogether my own  oha strange half sobdo you know i had just begun to know how solitary i was when lance was so happy to get robina when you  and if i told you all you would know that i was feeling a certain loneliness at home and that if you had asked my sisters they would have said that jack was not the harmonious element he appeared theretheres a pleasing prospect  but youll not let me be masterful said wilmet earnestly  just as much as is good for mefor us he said smiling  then after a moments silence he took out of his pocket a little box and making a table of her lap took out a ring of twined ruby and diamonds such as could not but startle the instincts of wilmets soul  oh it is a great deal too beautiful please i couldnt  you must it was my mothers  then she cannot like to part with it  did you not know that she died when i was five years old look and he showed where within the lid of the box was written for my little johnnys wife august 1839 l h  ought you not to keep it till faltered wilmet growing crimson as she found what she was saying  no he said decidedly not after this when i spoke to my father that sunday evening he unlocked his desk and gave me this which i had not seen since i remember playing with it on my mothers bed you will wear it dearest you will let me have the pleasure of knowing you have it on  the answer was the drawing off of her glove and he fitted it on but it was rather loose i am afraid it will want a guard he said  ill ask felix whether i may take one of mammas she said  for the shapely notable fingers had never worn a ring before this almost sacred pledge and the few jewels either too valuable or not valuable enough for the parents to have parted with in times of need had never been touched  do he said i shall like that the year 1839 was not that the year a certain little girl was born  the month our birthday is on the 19th and the coincidence gave all the foolish delight such facts do under the circumstances  was this long before she died asked wilmet  the last day of that august you never saw her brass in the cloister  no i never guessed that you were not mrs harewoods son though i wondered at your being so unlike the rest  she has been kindness itself he warmly said my father did well both for himself and me in marrying  tell me of your own mother said wilmet looking from the sparkling stones to the initials l what was her name  lucy lucy oglandby my father was tutor at oglandby hall there was a long attachment through much opposition and even when he was made priestvicar after waiting six years her father could not consent after six years more when her health was failing he gave a sort of sanction on his deathbed the rest of the family contrived to get her fortune so tied up that after her death it was of no use to any one till i came of age she only lived seven years after her marriage and then the oglandbys wanted to take possession of me and i fancy that drove my father into marrying  was it with them you went to stay  yes my father makes a point of it and they have a turn for patronising me if i would turn my back on home  now i understand better said wilmet  you understand how much you were wanting to me he said rightly interpreting the words after five years absence while my sisters were growing up you can perceive that dear fond and hearty as our house is it did not fulfil all that perhaps i had been rather unreasonable in expecting o wilmet this time of leave would have been very different if you had not come to the precincts  and so they fell back on the exquisite time present which neither wished to disturb by looking beyond and perhaps john felt as though his bird had scarcely perched and any endeavours to hold it might make it flutter loose while she was too glad of the calm and repose to renew the struggle between conflicting claims  at last with basket laden with dark fruit and lips vying with the babes in the wood stella was launched on them by lance when his sense of time overpowered his half shy half diverted respect for their bliss he was very curious but had to be satisfied with captain harewoods manner of tossing stella over the style and bright look at himself  they did not get into the town till the chimes of halfpast seven were pealing captain harewood hurried into the hotel to prepare for the evening and wilmet was mounting the stairs still under the spell of her newlyfound joy when she was startled by aldas voice in a key of querulous anger  exactly like you always laying out for attention  whats this said wilmet as she saw alda in her habit standing with her back to the open door and geraldine leaning on the table trembling and tearful crimson and burning even to passion in her panting reply i dont knowexcept that he helped me in from the garden  thats what i say retorted alda she is always putting herself forward to be interesting and get waited on all affectation i dont know such a flirt anywhere  hush alda you are insulting cherry said wilmet in her tone of command  take care of yourself wilmet cried alda it is the way she goes on all day with captain harewoodreading poetry and drawing and all  captain harewood knows said wilmet coming to the support of the quivering geraldine that the kinder he is to cherry the better i like it  oh if you do it is your own concern i only spoke for your sake and alda marched off while wilmets strong tender arms helped cherry into her own room and tended her through one of those gusts part repentant part hysterical which had belonged to her earlier girlhood though the present was now enhanced by the tumult of insulted maidenliness formerly wilmet had not treated these attacks on the soft system but now all her bracing severity was gone greatly incensed with alda she gave her whole self to sympathy with the victim showing herself so ineffably sweet and loving that cherry felt a thrill of delicious surprise and as her eye lit on the glittering ring a little ecstatic cry still slightly hysterical welcomed the token  o wilmet oh you have you have  to be sure i have answered wilmet not in the lest heeding what she said in her anxiety to calm her sister it is all right if only you will not go and be silly about it  the woman was so much more than her words that their odd simplicity coming from the grandlooking figure bending over her in tender solicitude touched cherry the more and she threw her arms round her sisters neck whispering oh i am so glad  poor wilmet at that moment all her gladness had gone into a weight like lead on her heart though it only made her more gentle dear cherry she softly said dont talk of anything to upset you will you be good and lie quite still while i take off my things and then ill come and dress you you must not be knocked up tonight  oh i had much rather stay here  no indeed john would be so disappointed he does like you so much and i always depend on you to make it pleasant for him you cant send word that alda has been scolding you  oh dear why cant i behave decently to her the moment we are alone together  dont begin on that for pitys sake or youll get crying again broke out wilmet in her natural voice tis she cant behave properly to anybodythats all so dont think any more about anything like a good child but lie still till i come back   so up went wilmet not rejoicing in her roommate whom she found as usual all injured innocence and selfjustification  you have been petting cherry all this time she is quite spoilt among you it is quite true what i said though she didnt like it in society i never saw a more arrant flirt with her pathetic ill used airs why ferdinand actually found fault today with my manner to her  save for the effects wilmet was glad to hear it well alda it is not always kind  i only dont fuss and coax her i see through her better than you do she is the sharp one as i told ferdinand it is i who have reason to complain of his manner to her only i know it is not his fault if there were no other objection to this preposterous scheme of felixs she would be a reason against it  for shame alda you dont consider what you are saying of your sister  i do said alda i have been more in the world than you wilmet and i know what comes of sticking oneself down close to ones family especially when there is that sort of spoilt invalid backed up in all kinds of unreasonable expectations i advise you to take care wilmet you dont know what goes on in your absence i should not wonder if it never came to an engagement after all  at that moment felixs step and knock were at the door wilmet went to it and both her hands were clasped in her brothers my wilmet my dear this is well  then alda turned from her glass and understood what he has spoken o wilmet and you never told me  i had not time  and what a splendid ring but it is not a proper engagedring you cant wear it  i must he wishes it it was his mothersfelix may i have one of mammas for a guard  may you said felix smiling  i should like you to give it to me come in  he came to inspect the unlocking of the ponderous old inlaid dressingcase with velvetlined compartments mostly empty or only with little labelled papers of first curls down as far as edward clement 1842 after which stern reality had absorbed sentimenta sad declension from the blue enamel shrine with a pearl cypher where felixs downy flax reposed  to do alda justice there was no greed in her nature and she even offered wilmet a turquoise hoop of her own instead of a little battered ring of three plaited strands of gold which their mother had worn till her widowhood and they believed to be the ring of her betrothal and when wilmet suggested that the locket would delight cherry aldas ready assent inspired the hope that she felt some compunction for her jealous unkindness  the locket did prove a soothing charm coupled with the little consultation as to the ribbon and the capture of a smooth brown lock of the present to add to the original and as the manly fingers dealt with the hasp and the kind smile welcomed her pleasure cherrys heart felt that while she had her felix alda need little comprehend her craving for attention from any one  yet her greeting to john harewood was shy tame and frightened compared with aldas pretty graceful cordiality as she told him that she was delighted and envied lance his powers of diplomacy in fact it was alda who kept up the conversation and made things pleasant with the ease of society while felix was shy wilmet longed for silence and ferdinand looked like a picture of spanish melancholy such as had almost infected the whole table  i believe i must ask you to bestow a little time on me he said as soon as the meal was over and alda made it evident that she meant to be in the conclave which took place in the back drawingroom it was at once made evident that the pursuivant proposal was abhorrent to her not that she behaved to felix nor indeed did she ever do so to any of his sex as she permitted herself to do to geraldine but she showed great displeasure at the idea having been started  things are unfortunate enough already she said with something like wilmets dignity but i should never forgive such hopeless ruin to dear ferdinands prospects  have i not told you that no prospect is anything to me if you can only be mine  we know all that said alda drawing herself away rather sharply from the caressing hand and therefore i must think for you and i will not be the means of lowering your position in life  alda dearest cried ferdinand glancing at felix in such genuine distress as made him interfere in pity  we understand about position ferdinand and you and alda have been able to observe how far life is enjoyable in this lowered position  felix said alda who had evidently wound herself up for this crisis you know very well that you stand quite out of common rules but i am sure you can see that however valuable your work may be it would be wrong to draw ferdinand to the same level   as for that said ferdinand moodily yet with the air of a banished prince felix knows what my father was and if i knew that my grandfather was an honest man it would be well a stray wanderer cast up at your door has no right to talk of levels  you are not to talk said alda more affectionately you are too generous to be allowed to think  in plain english alda said her brother the objection is yours  i cannot see him sacrifice himself for my sake said alda  as though it could be a sacrifice exclaimed ferdinand when it opens the way to make you my own at once my peerless beauty if you  come we have had all this over before said alda shrinking a little petulantly as he hovered over her speaking with the fervour of his mexican nature and his eyes glowing with eagerness if you will not have common sense i must  common sense it is not common sense i want it is love  if you doubt my affection said alda with dignity drawing back  no no no i never was so profane only it drives me frantic to hear you so coolly willing to keep us apart for  because my affection is less selfish and narrow than yours said alda raising her voice as his became like a roll of distant thunder i tell you i will not be the means of binding you to a petty provincial paper that may give an immediate pittance but will lead to nothing would that be love worth having i appeal to felix his scheme though it was  felix was a very uncomfortable third party especially as aldas appeal implied a certain accusation of himself i own he said that this situation is not likely to lead to promotion but it would be competence ferdinand would be satisfied but you  i who know what he is used to cannot be satisfied for him  as if you gasped the lover but alda would not let him go on  no she said we must be patient for him to remain in the life guards would be madness but a few years at mr browns with the interest he already has in the business will open a career to him  and i can run down every sunday said ferdinand it is her determination i suppose she is right felix but i wish if i could wish her otherwise she should be less prudent  i cannot see that she has any right to ask it of you indignantly exclaimed felix  but he found this was putting his head into a hornets nest ferdinand would not have contested her right to send him down among the lions and would never have given her back her troth like knight des lorges no he hotly contended that alda had a perfect right to make her own terms and still more hotly though most inconsistently that to work at peter browns was his own free choice  it was incontestable that a south american merchants career offered more possibilities of rising into opulence and consideration than the proprietorship of a country paper and though felix privately doubted whether deskwork would suit ferdinand half as well as the work where he himself could have contributed wits he could say no more ferdinand was greatly disappointed but there was no sacrifice that he would not make and persist in with his silent spanish perseverance for aldas sake indeed he could not bear not to begin at once he would return at once to his regiment send in his papers and dispose of his horses and equipments making arrangements with peter brown to enter his house he seemed to be in a fever till the matter was in train and was entirely past remonstrance and felix recognised that the lovers must act for themselves and could only feel thoroughly vexed with alda and equally vexed with himself for the consternation with which he thought of having her at home three years longer  it was the next evening and not only had aldas own lover departed but captain harewood was missing and with him lance and the only explanation was from bernard that they were gone to minsterham no doubt wilmet was sensible of a blank when she came home though she would not allow it and stoutly defended her captains right of going where and when he pleased without notice she had to fight his battles till late in the evening he walked in here we are it is later than i expected  wheres lance  he came in with me gone to his room thenhere geraldine this little gentleman requests the honour of your leaning on him  oh what a beauty what a dear little ivory monster turbaned head serpents tail and such a fascinating face  is the cane the right length i measured yours  you dont mean that he is for me so smooth and so steady where does he come from  from benaresi bought him at the great fair and from the moment i saw you it was plain that in the eternal fitness of things he was destined to you  to make a pagan of her said felix see her worshipping her little idol  not my idol but my prop and companion for life  your lord gerald laughed felix as she walked triumphantly round the room perhaps her first unnecessary promenade since she was seven years old  this is just the time i didnt expect you said wilmet is the seven oclock train put on again  we didnt come by the train and felix and cherry smiled at one another as they detected that wilmets economical soul was vexed i wanted lance to see his doctor again and the railway seems so bad for his head that i drove  how very kind exclaimed wilmet  i am afraid i have not managed it well i would not make an appointment lest it should be a glaring day so manby was out and we could only leave a message before going to the precincts lance was in wild spirits and the boys gave him such an uproarious welcome that old canon burley sent in to know what was the matter and was told it was only little underwood come back he dined with us but i am afraid i was off guard for i never thought of his going and taking a place in the cathedral  i should think not said wilmet except that it is in the nature of boys to be provoking even about churchgoing then it has knocked him up  he was forced to come out in the psalms and poulter one of the layvicars got anxious about him and went after him when the lesson began found him with his head down on the table in the sacristy and thought he had fainted but he was only crying and entirely done up manby came just as poulter brought him in and gave him a proper good lecture  a very good thing said wilmet if one could only get him to believe there is any need of care when his head is not actually painful what did mr manby think of him  he says he is as well as could reasonably be hopedquite recovered from the fever but the sunstroke was as severe as any he has seen in england and coming on the top of all that overwork both study and music it has left an amount of irritability and excitability of brain that must not be trifled with he made poor lance confess all the little experiments he has been trying on himself and ordered him to leave off whatever he is about at the first threatening of dizziness or pain  then theres not much chance of his going back  not before christmas at soonest one would think the poor little fellow must have been aware of that but the verdict cut him up very much i thought he had better be quiet till the heat of the day was past so he lay on my bed till six oclock and then he said he was better but he hardly spoke all the way home  wilmet went at once to see after him and found him already in bed but whether sleepy suffering or sorrowful she could not make out for he hid his eyes from the candle and only muttered no thank you in reply to whatever she offered till she yielded to his evident longing for darkness and silence  he was up and about in the morning but when at noon bernard rushed in from school he was neither in the drawingroom garden nor office and the door of hisor rather mr froggattsbedroom was locked bernard bounced at it calling let me in i say ill not make a row  there arent any more of you parleyed lance  no let me in i saykicking at the panelsi must speak to you  im coming hold your din and lance revealed himself without coat or boots  holloahow dark you were never asleep i came because one can never catch you without a string of girls and babies after you  cut on said lance resignedly shaking up his horsehair pillow while bernard seated himself on the table and in the halflight of the shuttered room began to disentangle some knotted twine  did you come here to do that said lance wanting to finish his nap and chiefly restrained by the trouble of the thing from kicking the intruder out  only i say lance have you any tin  not the valley of a brass farthing the last pence of the vale leston sovereign had gone into stellas jam  wouldnt felix give you some  i dont know very gruffly  i wish youd ask  you have as many tongues as i  well you see felix is not half a bad fellow for ones governor but he doesnt know whats what and sims says hell go to him if i dont come down with something before tomorrow  sims sims in smokejack alley is that your sort demanded lance in ineffable disgust  hes been keeping a dog for me said bernard sulkily  a dog lance sat up in astonishment immeasurable  yes its the thing and no mistake said bernard eagerly  his name is stingo only we are not quite sure whether he is a bull terrier or a shorthaired king charles  lance dropped back wriggling in suppressed convulsions as he demanded where did you steal this unmistakeable animal  i bought him said bernard with a certain magnificence intended to be overawing  then where did you steal the money  travis said bernard who considered christian names unworthy of male lips he always used to tip me a sovereign and ben bowyer the dogfancier said stingo was worth thirty shillings any day only he let me have him for eight and six because he wanted to sell off his stock  i thought as much and sims keeps him for you  at ninepence a week but the brute is at me for ever and says it is twelve weeks  pray how were you to raise ninepence a week by waiting on providence or turning coachwheels  i had some then and froggy sometimes gives one half a crown but the old beast hasnt lately just because i wanted itnor travis either bad luck to him quoth this grateful young man i put them all off making sure of him and now hes cut and never tipped me at all its an abominable sell and they are all at me  all what more have it out grunted lance with a sound of bodily pain in his tone such as would have silenced any one above ten years old and a bored contemptuous manner that would have crushed any attempt at confidenceif he had been the right person to confess to  nevertheless bernard mumbled shootinggallery and mother goldie vowed she would lug me up to wilmet if i dont fork out  mother goldie you little disgusting ape youve been tucking in what you owed in pies and tarts cried lance who was too constitutionally heedless of the palate to have any charity for its temptations  its all wilmets fault said bernard she never gives one anything fit to eat there was that beastly lamp out there went and got broke and what does she do but crib it out of our grub  now lance was any living soul served like that before she gave us only that beastly stirabout at breakfast bernard worked his single adjective hard no butter nor sugar at tea and no pudding except when theres that beastly mess of rice  im sure ive seen pudding  oh she came round when felix came home she knew he wouldnt stand it alda used to buy marmalade and anchovy on her own hook so i dont see why i shouldnt  alda didnt go on tick i suppose  serve wilmet right if we all did i dont believe theres a beggar so badly fed nares says  you unnatural little sneak you havent been and gone and complained to him  no but all the town is crying out upon her shabbiness they say it is a perfect shame how little butchers meat she gets naress mother and sisters do nothing but laugh at it and nares says nothing will make us comfortable but a bankruptcy hollo  for a wellaimed swing of the bolster laid him sprawling on the floor  take that for mentioning such a word  my eyes lance is it swearing said bernard with a little affectation of innocence how you have been and bumped my knees and he sat on the floor pulling up his trousers to gain a view therell be a bruise as big as half a crown well but nares says it was a real blessing to them for before it old nares was always in a rage and his mother boohooing and now it is over they live like fightingcocks on champagne and lobstersalad and mulliwhats his namefirst chop and the women dress in silks and velvets and feathers no end of swells and they say it is regular stoopid to pinch like that for no one will believe we aint going to smash while she is such a screw  if you werent nothing but a little donkey said lance sitting coiled up with his head on his knee grimly contemplating him youd be a show specimen of precocious depravity  i declare persisted bernard nares says it is coming as sure as fate for his governor and jackman and collis are going to stump up the old pursuivant with their new bexley tribune and redstone is to be subeditor  the blackhearted rascal cried lance bounding on his feet in a rage he ought to be kicked out of the shop this instant  now dont lance entreated bernard for nares will pitch into me for telling he says theyve got an opening through the pur backing up that mean beggar smith and collis and jackman will find the cash and naress father is to be editor and they vow froggatt and underwood will be beat out of the field  catch them said lance and he stood leaning against the solid old carved bedpost in silence till bernard returned to the insolvency at present far more pressing  wont you help me about stingo he said  do you want me to send him to the dogshow ticketted the real animal and no mistake  dont lance said the boy peevishly i thought you were good natured and would lend me some tin or at least stop the blackguard from being such a baboon hes found out that travis has cut and he says hell come to felix this very day ended he not far from crying  i cant anyhow today bear said lance more kindly my head is very bad and youve not mended it  it was well enough when you broke my knees grumbled bernard come lance you used to be a fellow to help one  i cant i tell you said lance hastily throwing himself back on the bed and shutting his eyes it isnt that i wont but i cant i couldnt walk straight down the street for giddiness and if i did i dont suppose i could talk sense  bernard was startled by the tone as well as the words but he had not arrived at much pity for any one but himself and he whined but what shall i do then repeating it dolefully as lance lay for some moments silent and with closed eyes  bother he broke out angrily at last look here tell the blackguardlet me seei dont well know what im saying tell him youve spoken to meno to your brothermind you neednt say whichand that hell come and see about it now give me that bolster and take yourself off tell them i want no dinner and dont let any one come get along and shut the door  bernard could extract no more and departed as the dinnerbell rang leaving him without energy even to lock the door presently felix was standing anxiously over him but he reiterated that he could not bear to think of food and only wanted to be left alone but just as his brother was leaving him he said fee do you know that redstone is going over to the enemy  the opposition paper nothing more likely how did you hear  bear picked it up i say wasnt that little beggar to have gone to stoneborough  not possible lance ive gone into it with wilmet she is in trouble about household expenses as it is and with this rival paper on our hands i cant undertake anything extra has he been bothering you im very sorry but we must keep him here  lance shut his eyes without reply but no sooner was he left alone than he rolled over gave vent to a heavy groan from the bottom of his heart and clenched his hands as he lay then followed some heavy sobs and a few great tears but gradually a look of purpose and hope came over his face and he slept he was lying between sleeping and waking when a quiet step and cautious knock made him call out come in jack  your sister wants to know if you are better and ready for some tea  thank you im mending is wilmet come home  yes but only to become the prey of an ancient female  mrs bisset come to inspect you  she wont then shall i get you some tea  no thank you but i say jack do you see my big box that we brought home yesterday would you just dig into it for me  john harewood applied himself to disentangle a frightful knot observing this looks like bills handiwork  ay bill put all my traps together when our other fellows came back  together indeed said the captain looking at the heterogeneous collection  theres nothing to hurt said lance do you see a green box  a fiddlecase you boy  a violincase said lance with dignity give it me and taking out his purse he produced its only contentsnamely the keytried to sit up to unlock his treasure but was forced by giddiness to lie back again with a gasp and hold out the key to his friend  come i should think a fiddle the last thing you could want just now said john  just so im afraid it is only just let me see if she is all right ay and then after a gaze a fond touch or two an irrepressible sigh strangled in the midst lock her up again you aint by any chance going home tomorrow  do you want anything  why when i got her at old spicers sale for twentytwo and sixpence poulter was beside himself at my luck and said she was worth double that any day and he would give it me if i got tired of her now if id only known yesterday i could have done it myself but i cant go and i cant writebut if you could but send or take it to poulter and get the money for me  do you feel bound to give poulter the refusal for if it is really a good instrument it ought to be worth more than that  poulter has been very good to me he taught me to play on it said lance that is he showed me a little but robin made me lock it up and give her the key all last spring for fear of hindering my mugging and i cant touch her now so she has been very little use to me i promised poulter and i think he should have her besides i want the money slick at once its no good sticking it in a window to wait for some one to give what it is worth  john marvelled what need of money could have come upon the boy in the last twentyfour hours but he was too discreet a friend to take advantage of necessity to ask questions and said the fact was i was thinking of running up to town to get a sewingmachine for your sister but if i start by the earlier train i can see poulter on the way and if he does not want it himself he can tell me where to dispose of it to the best advantage  only it must be ready money said lance it must be owned with scarcely the alacrity of gratitude john deserved if it didnt make much difference i wish poulter could have her for then i should sometimes see her and handle her again and i think he would use her well  very well ill tell him  and dont tell any one here added lance you dont go and tell w w everything do you he added wistful and perplexed  not other peoples secrets said john now i am going to fetch you some food you are looking quite faint you have had nothing since yesterdays dinner  poor lance when john was gone he turned with another groan once more took the violin in his arms laid it on his shoulder and made the motions of playing then kissed it and whispering poulter will be good to you my pretty its not for that little beggar of a bear its for felix for felix and then at a sound of steps hastily replaced it shut the box and fell back again dizzy and exhausted  the next day he betook himself to a refuge more impregnable to bernard than even mr froggatts bedroom namely the office which suited his sociable nature and where he was always welcome he found employment there too in cutting out extracts from newspapers labelling library books and packing parcels and sometimes also it must be owned in drawing caricatures of the figures he spied through the chinks of the door     chapter xxiii  smokejack alley    launce it is no matter if the tyd were lost for it is the unkindest tyd that ever man tyd  panthino whats the unkindest tyd  launce why he thats tyd herecrab my dog                                             shakespeare   john harewood returned bringing with him what alda took for a dressingcase and cherry for a drawingbox but which proved to contain a wonderful genie to save the wellworn fingers many a prick to lance he first administered the magical words all right and then making an opportunity he put five sovereigns into his hand lances first impulse was however not to thank but to exclaim then poulter has not got it  no poulters conscience had forbidden him to purchase little underwoods treasure at what he knew to be so much beneath its value but he had given captain harewood his best advice and recommendations and by that means the violin had been taken at a london shop still at a price beneath his estimate but the utmost that could be expected where ready money was the point lance ought to have been delighted and his native politeness made him repeat thank you but he could not quite keep down his regretnow i shall never see or hear her again  however the next day when bernard flew upon him at twelve oclock asseverating that there was shade all the way he allowed himself to be persuaded prudently carrying with him only ten shillings and trusting to his blue umbrella rather than to bernards shade which could hardly have been obtained by sidling against the walls  bernard did not seem to have enjoyed much more of stingos society than lance of his violinsthe produce of the same bounty he confessed that he had only ventured on taking the dog out three times in a string and on one of these occasions he had broken loose after a cat on another had fought with naress dog and on the third had snapped at angela  you didnt take angel into these places  no she came to meet me  thats a sign of grace but bear i cant stand these diggings at all ive a great mind to turn back  you wont cried bernard you must have been here often when you were a grammarschool fellow  not we this is a cut below us fulbert would never have been caught here  but you are going to get me out of this fix  havent i said i will only hold your tongue and let me alone to manage the rascal if you open your mouth ive done with it  bernard was forced to acquiesce though lances manner vexed and irritated him popular and valuable as lance had been with the choristers he was not dealing as well with his brother perhaps partly because he was more consciously trying to influence him and likewise because the state of his health and his prospects so far affected his manner that though never illhumoured it had lost some of the easy careless sweetness of high spirits and assumed an ironical tone exasperating to a child who could not brook ridicule he was ashamed and dismayed at the place where bernard was leading him so low and disreputable that the boys of his time had never haunted it and his own gamin propensities had never extended so far it was a tumbledown quarter the houses deplorable hovels run up hastily for the workmen at the potteries and every third or fourth a beershop and in the midst dwelt mr sims a maimed poacher who kept a large livestock with which to trade on the sporting tastes of the youth of bexley  probably he was gratified to see that my brother meant nothing more imposing than the chorister but lance had so cultivated his opportunities at dick graemes home as to be more knowing on the subject than felix would have been indeed it did not take much science to estimate the value of the real animal whose market price seemed to have fallen considerably lance as he looked at the pied bandylegged longnosed cur felt it impossible to set his cost against his keep nor was he designed by nature for driving bargains but sims expectations were founded on the probable and the debt was annulled for threeandsixpence and stingo himself much civility was expended on lance dogs rabbits and other curiosities were exhibited and an invitation given to come with the other young gents to admire the favourite terriers exploits upon a cage of rats shortly expected admission free  you will come wont you cried bernard eagerly as they went out  what to all the vilest sports in the place  but lance you told me about the rat hunt at mr graemes  what turning out the barn with mr graeme himself and bill and all the rest do you think thats like letting a lot of wretched beasts out of a trap to be snapped up by a cur of a dog with no end of drinking foulmouthed blackguards betting on him   you are always so savage lance and now youve gone and paid away all the money  what more  theres the shootinggallery you see  lance did see a publichouse called the flying stag where bernard had contrived to incur a debt of a few shillings under naress patronage while inquiring after the amount he saw mr mowbray smith coming along the alley and was more amused than shocked at the amazement his own presence there would cause the curate but just then he perceived that men were standing scowling at their doors and slovenly women thronging out like ants when their hill is disturbed and asking an explanation from the damsel in earrings who attended to him he heard that the chaps are determined that that there smith shall not have the impudence to show his face here again for a hypocrite defrauding of the poor youd best be away young gents there will be a fracaw  a row cried bernard between excitement and alarm shall we stay and see it wont smith spy us  lance deigned no reply but seeing the roughlooking men gathering as if to obstruct the curates way he shot across the street to shake hands with him  you i am sorry to see you said mr smith severely at which lance gave what under other circumstances would have been an impudent smile and asked have you anywhere here to go  i am just come away from a sick man but you know how wrong it is to bring your little brother here take him away he added trying to prevent them from joining him and at the same time a voice shouted let him alone young gents he aint your sort and a hissing and hooting broke out all round a parson as ought to have his gown pulled over his head  whats gone of the coals how about the blankets  bernard got a tight grip out of sight of lances coat mr smith grew red and bit his lips but lance walked close to him and as they began to be jostled took his arm holding the blue sunshade over both their heads unsavoury missiles began to fly but a woman screeched bad luck to ye ye vagabone yeve ruinated the young gentlemans purty blue umberella  down with it young chap called another or yell be served with the same sauce  serve un right too was the rejoinder tis they underwoods as never stands up for poor mens rights and is all for the tyrants all this full of abusive epithets  who said that broke out lance beginning hastily to close his umbrella and trying to wrench his arm from mr smith im ready for him  but mr smith with an angry are you mad held him fast and his struggles provoked a goodhumoured laugh at the little champion still so white and slight  no no said a big powerful man collaring a great lad who had been thrusting forward at lances defiance we dont have no mills with natomies like you go home and mind yer own business your father was another guess sort of parson and ill not see a finger laid on you be off till weve given that other bad lot a bit of our mind  not i growled lance ill have it out with that rascal there nonsense mr smith i can i sayand i will  but the big man and mr smith were perfectly in accordance this time and without a word between them the impulse of the coalheavers weight somehow opened a path where shoved by the one and dragged by the other lance was at the cornerthen round itthe crowd followed no farther  a plucky little chap that quoth the coalheaver to mr smith you may thank your stars that hes his fathers son or it would have been the worse for you and if ever you show the face of you here again you know what to expect  i expect nothing but what i am willing to receive in my masters service said mr smith firmly meeting his eyes meantime thank you for the help you have given me with these boys good morning you will judge me more fairly another time  the man added another contemptuous oath to those with which he had freely laden his discourse but lance paused a moment to say thank you too you meant it well but i wish youd have let me have it out with that foulmouthed cad  wait till yere a match for him and welcome said the man bless ye what could that fist do with black bill  for shame boys come away said the infinitely disgusted curate and not a word was spoken down the first street bernard was still trembling with excitement and lance conscious perhaps that though his interference had answered his purpose he had been betrayed into what he now saw to have been absurd  at last the curate spoke his naturally harsh voice wavering a little between reproach and acknowledgment i am very sorry for all this lancelot underwood i believe you joined me out of a kind and generous feeling of which i am sensible otherwise i should feel it my duty to report to your brother where i met you  you are quite welcome said lance coolly  and i must say continued mr smith that if your whole training as well as your recent severe illness do not withhold you from such associations at least i entreat you to pause before leading your little brother into them  lance made no answer except to halt at a public drinking fountain to wash away the damage his umbrella had sustained and there with a serious take care the curate left the brothers  catch me going to his help again exclaimed bernard entirely unconscious that his own gratitude to lance was on a par with mr smiths he may get out of the next row as he can  ah bear you see how you are corrupting my innocent youth  a meddling donkey i wish he had a rotten egg in each eye now it will all come out  what will  where we have been  thats the best thing that could happen  you dont mean that you mean to let it out  if you expect me to tell lies for you you are out there  but lance lance in an agony you wouldnt be such a sneak when i trusted you  lance laughed the bare idea of betrayal seemed so absurd that he scarcely thought it worth removing  the two were slackening their pace as they saw felix at the carriage door of a lady customer and lance said gravely ill  see to mother goldie but now bear that you are out of this scrape i give you fair warning that if i find you grubbing your nose into that sort of thing again ill put a stop to it one way or another  im not a bit worse than the rest all the other fellows do it  oh i suppose if you think stingo the right thing in dogs you think nares the right thing in fellows  at that moment the customer drove off and felix having spied the blue sunshade tarried at the door to administer a remonstrance to lance on being so foolish as to venture into the noonday sun he was not able to come in to dinner till it was half over and then it was with a merry look and question whats this boys about mowbray smith being mobbed in smokejack alley and your making in to the rescue  oh said lance there was an attempt at getting up a shindy but it was of the meanest description no one knew how to set about it there was only one irishman there and he was a woman this with a wink to sibby  and you didnt offer to fight big ben blake  ben blake on the contrary elbowed us all safe out because my father was another guess sort of parson  and there was a horrible little cad making faces exclaimed bernard unable to resist claiming part of the glory and i was just going to have pitched into him  whatyou saw the row getting up and went to stand by smith said felix  yes said bernard boldly and nobody durst lay a finger on him when we were on each side of him  at which everybody burst out laughing including mr froggatt and lance most of all who was it then he struggled to say gravely that pulled so hard at the back of my coat i suppose it must have been some little cad i thought it had been you  well it was time to hold you back when you were going to fight that great lout  for my part said lance i think it must have been smith and i that were holding the great bear back by his tail from fighting big ben blake eh  bernard never able to bear being laughed at looked intensely sulky and a true description of the affair being asked by mr froggatt lance gave it exactly enough but with so much of the comic side that every one was in fits of merriment all of which in his present mood the younger boy imagined to be aimed at him he was too full of angry selfconsequence really to attend so as to see how entirely disconnected with himself the laughter was all he cared for was that lance should not betray him and to assure himself on this head it must be confessed that he hovered on the upper stairs out of sight while felix was lingering on the lower to say to lance of course it was only smiths affair that took you into smokejack alley  not exactly said lance  bernard trembled with resentment and alarm  i dont want to ask questions but you know it is not a nice place for yourself or for bernard  my dear governor i know that as well or better than you do and it wont be my fault if i go there again  dont let it be anybodys fault returned felix and vanished through the office door while lance sighing wearily was heard repairing to his refuge in his own room and bernard grimly and moodily swung himself downstairs on his way to afternoon school believing himself a much aggrieved party here was lance whom he had believed a fellowinhabitant of the alsatia of boyhood turned into one of those natural enemies moral police who wanted to do him good true lance had helped him out of his scrape and guarded his secret but bernard could not forgive either his own alarm or the not exactly and the terms of confidence so evident between him and felix seemed to place them in the same hateful category worse than all lance had laughed at him and bernard was far too proud and selfimportant not to feel every joke like so many nettlestings he had expected an easy careless helper he had found what he could not comprehend whether boy or man but at any rate a thing with that intolerable possession a conscience and a strong purpose of keeping him out of mischief  to detect which purpose was to be resolved on thwarting it nor it must be allowed was lances management perfect he wanted to make himself a companion such as would content the boy instead of the nareses but to cross the interval of amusement between sixteen and ten required condescension that could not but be perceived and rejected nor did he perceive that ridicule was an engine most fatal in dealing with bernard of course nothing like all this passed through the boys mind lance simply saw that his little brother was getting into mischief and tried to play with him to keep him out of it but was neither well nor happy enough to do so naturally and therefore did not succeed yet if he had abstained from showing bernard a picture in the style of punch of the real animal and no mistake and bernard himself pointing to felix and observing that the governor didnt know whats what he might have prevailed to prevent the boy from eluding him and going to mr sims rathunt  of all this felix knew nothing he still had much leeway to make up in consequence of his absence and the excitement in the town told upon the business  mr bevans reply had been a timid endeavour at peacemaking which foes called shuffling and friends could only call weakness so that it added to the general exasperation then came the archdeacons investigation which elucidated the curates moral integrity but showed how money subscribed for charity had gone in the church expenses that ought to have been otherwise provided for it was allowed that the rector had been only to blame in leaving the whole administration to the curate under his wifes dominion and as the lady could not be put forward mr smith was left to bear the whole brunt of the storm  his obsequiousness to lady price had alienated his brother clergy and his fellowcurate allowed himself to be kept aloof by his mother in a manner that became ungenerous half petulant and wholly ungracious as mr smiths manner was in receiving assistance only strong principle could lead any one to befriend him and his few advisers found it difficult to hinder him from making a public exposure of my lady or from throwing up his work suddenly and leaving the town which would of course have been fatal to his prospects  the pursuivant had a difficult course to steer mr froggatt would fain have ignored the strife altogether but the original note of defiance having been sounded by his trumpet this was not possible and the border line between justice and partisanship was not easy to keep whether the young editor did keep it was a question to mr smith he seemed a tame lukewarm supporter to mr froggatt a dangerously conscientious and incautious champion and the vociferous public despised the dull propriety and narrow partisanship of the old country paper finally on the first saturday in october there appeared the first sheet of the bexley tribune with a cutting article on bloated dignitaries and bloodsucking parasites and an equally personal review of all the proudie literature on the monday morning one hundred and twentynine pursuivants remained on hand redstone took the trouble to count them and to look into the office to ask mr underwood where they should be stowed away  i wish he was smothered in them the malicious brute said lance grinding his teeth when felix had given a summary answer what a blessing to see the ugly back of him on the 1st of november  im not so sure of that said felix as he sorted the letters of the sunday post  do you think he can do us any harm  no but he seems a specimen of an article hard to supply at the same price  are those answers to your advertisement  yes and very unpromising  lance came to look them over with him and to put aside those worth showing to mr froggatt but it seemed that an assistant suitable in appearance and intelligence was so costly as to alarm their old fashioned notions he must be efficient for mr froggatt was equal to little exertion and never came in on bad days and to give an increased salary when the paper was struggling with a rival was serious yet the only moderate proposal was from a father at dearport who wanted his son boarded lodged and treated as one of the family  that is impossible said felix unless the froggatts would do it  eighteen said lance im sixteen and up to the ways of the place why dont you set me to work before i have eaten my head off  it would not do for you afterwards said felix i dont like your rushing out to serve  but really felix i mean it i can do all redstone does except lifting some of the weights and i am as old as you when you began  no no lance your line is cut out for you  it was said lance but im off it and no good as i am and if you could save redstones salary you might send bear to stoneborough instead of letting him stay here and go to the dogs  ah groaned felix it is hard that all this should come to upset his chances  are you really afraid those rascals can do us much harm  we have a sound county circulation beyond their reach but every copy they sell is so much out of our pockets and there are so many people possessed with a love of the low and scurrilous as well as so many who differ in politics that it must thrive unless they stultify themselves dont look so appalled lancey boy we aint coming to grief only it will be a close shave at home this winter  then felix let me help you dont know the comfort it would be  not so loud said felix stepping into the shop lance stood thoughtful then hearing more footsteps ran out and found two or three boys come for school materials and some maids waiting to change volumes for their ladies he gave his ready help and there ensued a lull for it was a wet day such as to make mr froggatts coming doubtful felix took a second survey of the applications  now fee do think about this i am in earnest  so am i lance i am very thankful to you but it is not to be thought of  why not am i too small for thats mending theres one good thing in being ill it sets one growing my thick gotomeeting trousers that i left at minsterham are gone up to my ancles i must ask wilmet if clem hasnt left a pair that have got too seedy for cambridge  it is not that lance but the disadvantage it might be to you in afterlife  if i took to it for good  no no lance one is enough  stay dont shut me up that way recollect what this horrid donothingness is doing for me i am losing all chance of the exhibition and they cant keep me on at the cathedral without for my voice has got like an old crows and besides if i cant read whats the good of standing for scholarships  you will feel very differently when your head is stronger besides if there should be anything in what we were told at ewmouth it would be a pity to get more involved with trade  i thought that was never to be spoken of  and this is my first time dont take it as a licence  i could see the sense of that if it were you said lance but not for no 5  no 1 would have his place and work found for him but no 5 might not find it easy to turn to something else  well said lance considering you said that possibility was not to make any difference to us wouldnt it be making the wrong sort of difference to let it keep a great lout like me in idleness while bernard is going to the bad  what do you mean about bernard said felix now thoroughly roused is it worse than you and fulbert were in your gamin days  i am afraid so said lance ful took better care of himself than he seemed to do and his friends were decent fellows not like the lot that have hooked in poor little bear  i suppose it was some scrape of his that took you into smokejack alley i thought you would get him out best without me  the little dog he was always after me when i didnt want him but now i cant get at him in short theres nothing for it but cutting the connection between him and jem nares  just tell me how far it goes what has he been doing with him  taking him to see ratkilling at sims in smokejack alley  you couldnt hinder it  no indeed felix i did my best and the tears sprang into the boys eyes i did all but go after him for i knew that would be worse than no good  you need not apologise to me said felix laying down his pen i have been very wrong between this business of smiths and all the rest of it i have hardly known which way to turn i knew that i had not taken the right line with fulbert and interference made him worse and i thought you had taken bear in hand why lancey i never meant to upset you you have done all you could  i did think i was good for that said lance ruefully after all our old swells at minsterham said about influence on the choir and bosh that when it comes to ones own brother  the tears were almost girllike and felixs comfort was in the tone that suited them indeed lance you may be doing him more good than you know i thank you with all my heart you are a much more real help and comfort to us all than you guess  thats what you say to cherry said lance impatiently now i can be real help if you would only let me and then bernard could go out of the way of these fellows  that he shall do if i have to dip into the chester legacy again  better take my way said lance reviving a young man with good references only wants board and lodging  it is not possible lance it would not be respectful to the bishop or the dean who have strained a point to keep you therei hear mr kenyons voice in the shop i must go  only one thing felix will you hear what jack harewood says to it  to this felix readily assented he was hurried and harassed nearly to the extent of his time and capacity he could not pause to give full consideration to his young brothers project and was glad that the ungracious task of silencing it should be imposed on one less immediately interested  john harewood was always at wilmets side after four oclock before that time he sometimes went to his home he often spent the afternoon with geraldine but he was not usually about the house in the morning so lance in a fever of impatience wandered till he hunted him down writing letters in the coffeeroom at the fortinbras arms  jack i say come and have a walk  pleasant weather  you want to be watered after all that parching in india it isnt raining now and such a jolly cool day  jollier for you than a finer day mayhap said the goodnatured soldier who greatly commiserated lances enforced idleness and only wondered at his not making it a greater misery to every one else he also understood what the inured ears of the family never guessed since lance never complained the distress of theodores constant hum and concertina to sensitive ears and excited nerves and had observed that lance had flagged ever since the journey to minsterham with less of vigour and more of sharpness sure that something was preying on the boy he deferred his least important letters to splash away with him in mud and mist and hear him explain his views with the fullness often more possible towards friend than family  john was greatly surprised but did not make any crushing objection and listened with thorough sympathy he doubted however whether lance would be doing any real good and not only throwing more instead of less work upon felix sensibly enough the boy went into the matter he said that when felix began the staff had also consisted of mr froggatt redstone a lad called stubbs and a boy now felix did much more than mr froggatt had then done and stubbs was a useful piece of mechanism without a head and lance believed himself quite able to fill the place felix had taken at the same age indeed he had far less either to learn or to overcome and though his arithmetical powers were still in abeyance he had rather excelled in that line at the cathedral school  i know of course said lance that a man from a london house would be of more use but theres this awful salary and he would never care to look after felix  i allow that but even if you can be of much present use is it not at the expense of greater usefulness by and by  i am sick of that edgar and clem both mean to be of use by and by and what comes of it edgar has spent felixs two hundred pounds that he borrowed and now has got his own all to repay when he is a great painter and he is six years older than i am now if i earned my guinea a week as felix did it would be real good now and i should be learning the trade for the future  thats the question first would the guinea a week make so much appreciable difference  is that all you know about it jack first i should be earning my keep not eating my head off and then bernard might be sent safe off to school  you dont mean to say that otherwise he could not  it has been a terribly costly year theres edgar then clem couldnt settle in at cambridge for nothing theres been alda turned back on felixs hands theres been illness and goodness knows what the doctors may charge and theres felixs outing and mine  john answered by opening his pocketbook and showing dr manbys account receipted  o jack you dont mean  considering that will was the sole cause of the doctor being wanted at all we could only wish to bear the damages  i hope you have told wilmet it would be a ton weight off her mind  i hope she would think the chapter did it but if you think she is anxious let her know that it is all right  you are a brick john but felix himself said it would be a close shave i wish i could throttle that bexley tribune and all its dirty supporters  do you know lance i am very much struck with your brothersay and old froggatts conduct in this matter  lance flushed with pleasure go ahead jack  of course for a paper to keep its politics is nothing but to take up the cause of an unpopular man whose slights have been marked  who has been a malicious little cad chimed in the chorister  to take up his cause simply as a matter of justice and therewith of the church without truckling to public opinion at absolute risk and loss seems to me generosity and principle quite out of the common way  youre about right there said lance intensely gratified and doesnt it make one burn to help the old fellow  quite true the question is which way to help him and while i grant you that the being idle at home just now is a terrible trial whether it might not be better to be patient under it than to disqualify yourself for a line in which you might do morethat is if it does disqualify you  what line do you mean said lance  scholarship the university  that wasnt what i wanted most said lance and as for that im disqualified enough by all this waste of time  what was your wish then  ill tell you said lance with lowered voice when i used to lie catching notes of the chanting and knowing that the organ was quiet for me i used to feel that if i got well i must give up my life to it and study music in full earnest so as to be a real lift to peoples praise perhaps in our own cathedral i thought maybe i could get in as a layvicar when my year is up and work at harmony under miles and take a musical degree but then came that day when the organ seemed to be crushing and grinding my head to bitsand of all psalms in the world it was the fortysecond and manby telling me on my life not to try to do anything for i cant tell how long  was that the reason you sold your violin  no of course not except that it was a sin and a shame to keep it for no good when i thought a pound might pull that little ape bernard out of the mire and ive been asking questions and find it would take huge time and cost to study music so as to be worth anything and here am i a great lout not doing that or any other good on the face of the earthas much worse than theodore as i am bigger so if i can help felix when he is fighting the fight in the pursuivant for gods honour and good and right wouldnt that be a sort of service  so undertaken said john with a huskiness in his voice well lance i will talk it over with felix if you like  for john harewood not having any strong musical bias did not greatly appreciate the career that lance had chalked out for himself and while thrilled by the boys devotional feeling thought it tinged by enthusiasm and had seen enough of cathedral singingmen to have no wish to see him among them if the loss of time was to prevent a university career he thought bookselling under felixs eye the preferable occupation  discussion was however deferred by the arrival of a home friend who had sought him out at the hotel and lance had to go home without him and wear through the day between dawdling drawing and playing with stella as best he might till after schoolhours when eager to turn to the account of his wardrobe these moments when wilmet was free from her captain he drew her into his room  presently after felix heard the most amazing noises to which his family had ever treated him and thankful that the wet day had reduced the denizens of the readingroom to one deaf old gentleman he hurried upstairs and beheld through the open door of mr froggatts room bernard raying roaring dancing and stamping in an overmastering passion and tearing some paper up with teeth and hands just then lance grasped his collar and tried in vain to rescue the paper but he fought with fists bites and kicks like something frantic until felix with a bound forward suddenly captured him and dragged him back still tearing and crunching the paper  for shame be quiet you are heard all over the placeshut the door  the door was shut by wilmet while bernard stood quailing under the stern face strong hand and tone of displeasure in which felix demanded what is the meaning of this  that bernard refuses to wear lances outgrown clothes said wilmet  do you mean that this is the cause of this disgraceful outbreak  idont see why growled bernard why i should wear everybodys beastly old things  it is right you should hear the whole felix said wilmet when i showed him that lance would have some still shabbier clothes of clements altered for him he said if lance chose to be a snob he would not lance answered that it was a choice between that and petticoats and then he fell into this extraordinary state when i can only hope he did not know what he was saying or doing  he was drawing me bellowed bernard drawing me in his brute of a book and he was so infuriated that words never before heard by his sister followed as he quivered and stamped even under felixs grasp which at length forced him into desisting but the command go up to your room this instant could only be carried out by main force amid tremendous kicking and struggling felix carrying him and wilmet following to unfasten the hands that clutched at the rail while lance stood aghast at one door and cherry in an agony at another and stella crept into a corner and hid her face in terror  well we never had the like of this before said felix coming down having locked him in and heard him begin to bounce about the barrack like prisoners in the breakingout frenzy can it be all about the clothes  i dont think you know what a grievance the having to take to old ones has always been to him poor little boy said cherry very nearly crying for bernard was so much her own child that in spite of his having cast her off she was in full instinct of defence and he dislikes lances most of all because of the cathedral peculiarities  ah you have always humoured him by taking off that choristers frill said wilmet but there could be no objection to those trousers they were almost new when fulbert left them and lance has only had them for best one winter  felix could not help laughing long had she worn and now belinda wears he quoted my dear mettle the effect is better than the detail you should spare us the pedigree however respectable  well i said nothing about it said wilmet was it what you said about petticoats lance  lance does tease and aggravate that child unbearably exclaimed cherry too much vexed not to be relieved to turn her blame upon somebody and it is very unkind of him for he knows bernard cannot bear to be laughed at  hush cherry said wilmet if lance did he didnt mean it it has been quite too much  indeed it has said felix you had better lie down at once lance  a good deal more than bernards outbreak had gone to the pain and dizziness that prevented lance from even attempting to reply to cherrys accusation but made him turn quietly back into his room while felix was obliged to hurry downstairs again and alda made her frequent remark that those boys were really unbearable  poor lance it was not his fault said wilmet  you dont know wilmet said cherry indignantly i did hope that when he came home my poor little bernard might get better managed he used to be so fond of him but he has done nothing but worry and laugh at him and i dont at all wonder it has come to this i shall go up and see about the poor little fellow  do you mean to let her go and pet him after such outrageous naughtiness asked alda as cherry moved to begin the difficult ascent  i should not do it myself said wilmet but i daresay she will do him good  alda held up her hands in wonder how many quarrels might have been going on at that moment if three of the family at least had not exercised the forbearance she so little understood  cherry and her lord gerald mounted the attic stairs it was for the first time in her life and she was so imperfect in the geography of the upper floor that she had to open one or two doors before she found the barrack with bernard lying kicking his heels fiercely at the beam across the low room the amazing presence of geraldine suspended this occupation how did you come here he gasped  i came to see you bear my poor bear i am so sorry said cherry sitting down on one of the beds how could you go on so  there was rebuke and pain in her voice and bernard resented it theyve no business to bait me he said ive no peace in my life  but that doesnt make it right to fly into such dreadful passions  i wouldnt do it if theyd let me alone i dont see why i should be the one to wear every ones nasty old clothes  why felix and clement couldnt well wear yours  it was all lances doing lance has bothered me out of existence ever since he came home  but you should try to bear it if he is a little cross and tiresome you know he is not at all well yet and all this has quite knocked him up  im glad of it said bernard viciously served him right for setting wilmet on and then drawing his abominable pictures as if it wasnt enough to have spoilt all my pleasure and sold stingo  what was stingo  oh just a dog  a dog  yes my dog and lance went and sold him and then drew a beastly picture of him and me  but bernard how could you have a dog  oh i bought him with some money travis gave me and a cad down in the town kept him for me but then travis didnt give me any more  but bernard you must have known you ought not did you get into debt  ay just for a few shillings and the brute threatened me so that i just asked lance  was he such a dangerous dog o bear  no nothe man that kept him i thought lance would tackle him without making a row  and did he  ay he said he hadnt got a penny and he kept me waiting ever so long but i fancy he got it from harewood he might as well have let me keep stingo  cherrys views of the relations between lance and bernard had begun to adjust themselves and she began to reason on the impropriety of keeping the dog but she soon perceived that this was only ranging herself on the side of the enemy and exciting the obduracy of her favourite who was determined to be a victim in truth bernard was not repentant enough to treat her with confidence and his world was so entirely beyond her knowledge that she did not possess the threads that would have led to it all that she did perceive was that much of bernards irritation was at the endeavour to keep him out of mischief and that her own gentle persuasions were almost as distasteful as lances jests she sat on arguing talking entreating till it had long been quite dark and wilmet at last came up to say that she must not stay any longer in the cold and to ask bernard whether he would say he was sorry  i didnt want her to come here bothering was bernards grateful remark  well i advise you to take care you are in a better mood before felix comes said wilmet come cherry it is not safe for you to go down alone  cherry could only entreat do bear do and try to kiss the averted cheek  she did not know that as soon as the door was shut on him and the little flicker of gas bernard fell into an anguish of sobs and tears the work of her persevering love softening and lessening the obstinate pride so far that the next visitors met with a much better reception than they might have done the first came stumbling up with a weary step and pushed open the door saying here bear dont bear malice im awfully sorry i ever drew that thing ill never do you again so shake hands and have done with it  all right returned bernard outstretching his hand as one who felt that amends were made him but could not receive them graciously and lances weary and confused senses were satisfied he never perceived hard lumps of offence unless he ran his head very hard against them and even now little guessed the amount of annoyance his raillery had given  and next came a quick resolute tread that made the little fellow shiver with apprehension never guessing at his brothers selfdebate whether obstinate impenitence ought not to bring the rod and wondering recollection of his own displeasure when mr audley recommended its disuse in the fatherless household felix held by the spirit rather than the letter and had decided that unless he found submission signal punishment must ensue  it was an immense relief to him to detect by eye and ear that the child had been crying and to be able to say that seeing that he was sorry made it possible to attend to lances kind entreaty not to be hard upon him absolute words of penitence felix did not try to exact but after a few words of sympathy which bernard had by no means expected on the hardship of the secondhand wardrobe and a reminder of the necessity he proceeded to rebuke for the passionate behaviour and above all for the language bernard had used expressing to the full how much it had shocked and appalled him by showing what sort of associates the boy must have chosen since he had learnt such words at all and what a shame and disgrace he felt it that one of the brothers should ever have uttered them and bernard who had learnt that satanic primer with a certain shame and repugnance under the strong desire to show himself neither girl muff nor choirboy and certainly would never in his right senses have betrayed his proficiency at homewas a good deal impressed and finally began to cry again and to promise to cure himself  believed to have thus fulfilled the least pleasing of all his duties felix went down to his longdelayed evening meal and therewith to a family council lance was gone to bed and his proposal was the more freely discussed as well as his relations with bernard  that boy must go at once to stoneborough said felix i shall write to dr cheviot tonight  wilmet sighed i suppose i ought not to have objected she said but i did think lance would have kept him in order  he has tried said felix  o felix cried cherry turning to him with tears in her eyes i am afraid i was unjust to lance just now and i am so sorry do you know the naughty little fellow had been keeping a dog and got into debt and lance paid alli cant think how  that i believe i can tell said john harewood though i am afraid it is a breach of confidence he sold his violin  that violin that i was so angry with him for buying said wilmet well he is a dear little fellow  and i scolded him for being unkind cried cherry in despair oh is he asleep i should like to beg his pardon and her hand clasped lord gerald  about the worst thing you could do to the poor boy cherry said felix when he is only lying there trying to get his head quiet enough to let him sleep  nor must you betray me added john smiling at poor conscience stricken cherry  and it is a mercy the fiddle is gone said alda i used to hear him playing it somewhere among the outhouses in the spring and it was enough to distract one added to theodores dronings  it must have been like parting with a bit of his life sighed cherry and yet bernard would not mind him and they did quarrel  boys who deal well with juniors at school do sometimes fail with little brothers said john besides i observe that where there is pride there is always a distaste and dread of those who have much power of ridicule  i suspect too said felix that lance has made the turn in life when one gets superfluously earnest and nothing so upsets influence i have felt it myself  so all this trouble and vexation has been weighing on the dear little fellow said wilmet no wonder he is not half so well as when he came home  no said felix i wonder whether the froggatts would let him come to them for a week or two or whether it would be too dull to be good for him  if his mind were settled about the future it would be rest rather than dullness said john but i think a good deal of his trouble is caused by manbys verdict and for that perhaps the best cure would be letting him have his wish  you john exclaimed felix i thought you would have put that out of his head  on the contrary he made me think there was a good deal in his arguments first as regards you would he be of any real use  never mind that said felix i heard something today that would make it practicable but i cant have that boy wasted  the point is what is waste now his strongest aptitude never was for classical work and if he is not to touch a latin book till christmas and then only cautiously i do not see what chance he would have even if will were out of the way  and if not at minsterham so much the less anywhere else said wilmet besides it might be a dreadful risk if his head were to be overstrained  and in the meantime the being kept here doing nothing and vexing himself is wearing his spirits and hurting him more than any light occupation especially what he felt to be a labour of love  that is quite true again said felix i quite believe he would be much happier if he began working with me tomorrow but it might be letting a mere fit of impatience and despondency fix him for life in an uncongenial business  i thought you preferred it exclaimed wilmet  oh yes said felix with a sort of half contempt in his tone but these boys of ours are a different sort of stuff and we have seen that it will never answer to pin them down to plod  lance would never be like edgar exclaimed wilmet as if edgar ever thought of doing anything so unselfish in his life  o wilmet indeed he thought cried cherry  yes but always of five or six years hence said wilmet  lance is very like edgar said felix he has what i believe belongs to the artist temperament and that he is the bravest the most uncomplaining little fellow i ever came across and probably would never break off what he had begun makes me the more anxious not to let this access of generosityay and tediumlead to taking any decided step while he is so young  when you come to artist temperament i dont understand said wilmet lance doesnt even draw anything like cherry or edgarmuch good does that do and as to his music it would not be much of a living  i believe he thinks that the alternative said john  for goodness sake cried alda he doesnt want to get taken on in london to have him singing and fiddling in public would be worse than anything you put that out of his head i hope john even if he changed his name  it never was in his head said john he never thought of anything but his old linecathedral music and the sacrifice to him is of that not of the chance of the university  thats not so bad said alda because it is a great chance whether any one ever heard of it  but i doubt if it be a very desirable life as things are at present constituted said john i am not sure that it is not better to give the musical talent freely for that service than to make it ones trade and livelihood  i think you are right there said felix i suppose there is always some degree of disenchantment  what did you say made his notion practicable said wilmet  ive had mr lamb with me this evening  mr bruces managing clerk explained wilmet to the captain does he want you to have ernest  yes he has missed the exhibition from the grammarschool and as he cant go to oxford fancies deluded youth that he will get more reading in this line than any other he is ready to give a premium with him and spoke what mr froggatt would call very handsomely about our house being one where he could trust him i believe mr froggatt will be gratified and accept him  ernest lambserious mutton repeated cherry doesnt he look very heavy  yes he is bookish without being quick i dont expect he will be of much use just yet but he is as steady as old time and though he and lance would neither of them do alone yet together i think we could get on  then said john does it not seem to you wilmet that it would be a greater positive benefit to accept lances offer for the present on trial as one may saythan to leave him to the depression that is certainly doing him harm  and if lance was there said wilmet i should have some comfort that felix would be properly looked after  whatever happens said felix i shall send lance out to marshlands for a fortnight and see if he is in the same mind when he comes back after all it depends on mr froggatt and he will be afraid people will say we have turned in the whole grammarschool behind the counter i wonder if lance is safe not to laugh in the old ladies faces when they askwhat number of what magazine how many years ago had a receipt for washing antimacassars  by which they knew him to be very much exhilarated that fortnight at marshlands was not wasted lance had faculties for never being dull he pottered about with mr or mrs froggatt fed their chickens gathered their apples and nuts petted their cats tried to teach words to their parrot and tricks to their dogs played cribbage and backgammon with them in the evening never had a headache never was at a loss or upon their hands gained their hearts completely and came home wonderfully benefited by the respite from noise and harass and quite decided to stand by his proposal to which the partners with some hesitation had finally acceded    end of vol i
