answer my question amy            frontispiece      mrs somers pouring a cup of tea that        makes it a little more difficult          facing page 32     five oclock tea  i  mrs somers mr willis campbell   mrs amy somers in a lightly floating teagown of singularly becoming texture and color employs the last moments of expectance before the arrival of her guests in marching up and down in front of the mirror which fills the space between the long windows of her drawingroom looking over either shoulder for different effects of the drifting and eddying train and advancing upon her image with certain little bobs and bows and retreating from it with a variety of fan practice and elaborated courtesies finally degenerating into burlesque and a series of grimaces and mouths made at the responsive reflex in the fascination of this amusement she is first ignorant and then aware of the presence of mr willis campbell who on the landing space between the drawingroom and the library stands hat in hand in the pleased contemplation of mrs somerss manoeuvres and contortions as the mirror reports them to him mrs somers does not permit herself the slightest start on seeing him in the glass but turns deliberately away having taken time to prepare the air of gratification and surprise with which she greets him at half the length of the drawingroom  mrs somers giving her hand why mr campbell how very nice of you how long have you been prowling about there on the landing so stupid of them not to have turned up the gas  campbell i wasnt much incommoded that sort of pitchdarkness is rather becoming to my style of beauty i find the only objection was that i couldnt see you  mrs somers do you often make those pretty speeches  campbell when i can found them on fact  mrs somers what can i say back oh that im sorry i couldnt have met you when you were looking your best  campbell um do you think you could have borne it we might go out there  mrs somers on second thoughts no i shall ring to have them turn up the gas  campbell no let me he prevents her ringing and going out into the space between the library and drawingroom stands with his hand on the key of the gasburner now how do i look  mrs somers beautiful  campbell turning up the gas and now  mrs somers not half so well decidedly pitchdarkness is becoming to you better turn it down again  campbell rejoining her in the drawingroom no it isnt so becoming to you and im not envious whatever i am  mrs somers you are generosity itself  campbell if you come to phrases i prefer magnanimity  mrs somers well say magnanimity wont you sit downwhile you have the opportunity she sinks upon the sofa and indicates with her fan an easychair at one end of it  campbell dropping into it are there going to be so many  mrs somers you never can tell about five oclock tea there maynt be more than half a dozen there may be thirty or forty but i wished to affect your imagination  campbell you had better have tried it in some other kind of weather its snowing like  mrs somers running to the window and peeping out through the side of the curtain it is likecats and dogs  campbell oh no you cant say that it only rains that way i was going to say it myself but i stopped in time  mrs somers standing before the window with clasped hands no matter there will simply be nobody but bores they come in any sort of weather  campbell thank you mrs somers im glad i ventured out  mrs somers turning about what then realizing the situation oh poor mr campbell  campbell oh dont mind me i can stand it if you can i belong to a sex thank you that doesnt pretend to have any tact i would just as soon tell a man he was a bore as not but i thought it might worry a lady perhaps  mrs somers worry im simply aghast at it did you ever hear of anything worse  campbell well not much worse  mrs somers what can i do to make you forget it  campbell i cant think of anything it seems to me that i shall always remember it as the most fortunate speech a lady ever made to meand they have said some flattering things to me in my time  mrs somers oh dont be entirely heartless wouldnt a cup of tea blot it out with a peak  frean she advances beseechingly upon him come i will give you a cup at once  campbell no thank you i would rather have it with the rest of the bores theyll be sure to come  mrs somers resuming her seat on the sofa you are implacable and i thought you said you were generous  campbell no merely magnanimous i cant forget your cruel frankness but i know you can and i ask you to do it he throws himself back in his chair with a sigh and who knows perhaps you were right  mrs somers about what  campbell my being a bore  mrs somers i should think you would know  campbell no thats the difficulty nobody would be a bore if he knew it  mrs somers oh some would i think  campbell do you mean me  mrs somers well no then i dont believe you would be a bore if you knew it is that enough or do you expect me to say something more  campbell no its quite enough thank you he remains pensively silent  mrs somers after waiting for him to speak bores for bores dont you hate the silent ones most  campbell desperately rousing himself mrs somers if you only knew how disagreeable i was going to make myself just before i concluded to hold my tongue  mrs somers really what were you going to say  campbell do you actually wish to know  mrs somers oh no i only thought you wished to tell  campbell not at all you complained of my being silent  mrs somers did i i was wrong i will never do so again she laughs in her fan  campbell and i complain of your delay you can tell me now just as well as two weeks hence whether you love me enough to marry me or not  mrs somers you promised not to recur to that subject without some hint from me you have broken your promise  campbell well you wouldnt give me any hint  mrs somers how can i believe you care for me if you are false in this  campbell it seems to me that my falsehood is another proof of my affection  mrs somers very well then you can wait till i know my mind  campbell id rather know your heart but ill wait after a pause why do you carry a fan on a day like this i ask to make general conversation  mrs somers spreading the fan in her lap and looking at it curiously i dont know after a moment oh yes for the same reason that i shall have icecream after dinner today  campbell thats no reason at all after a moment are you going to have icecream today after dinner  mrs somers i might if i had company  campbell oh i couldnt stay after hinting im too proud for that he pulls his chair nearer and joins her in examining the fan in her lap what is so very strange about your fan  mrs somers nothing i was just seeing how a fan looked that was the subject of gratuitous criticism  campbell i didnt criticise the fan he regards it studiously  mrs somers oh not the fan  campbell no i think its extremely pretty i like big fans  mrs somers so good of you its spanish thats why its so large  campbell its handpainted too  mrs somers leaning back and leaving him to the inspection of the fan youre a connoisseur mr campbell  campbell oh i can tell handpainting from machinepainting when i see it tisnt so good  mrs somers thank you  campbell not at all now that fellowcavalier i suppose in spainmaking love in that attitude you can see at a glance that hes handpainted no machinepainted cavalier would do it in that way and look at the ladys hand who ever saw a hand of that size before  mrs somers unclasping the hands which she had folded at her waist and putting one of them out to take up the fan you said you were not criticising the fan  campbell quickly seizing the hand with the fan in it ah im wrong heres another one no bigger let me see which is the largest  mrs somers struggling not very violently to free her hand mr campbell  campbell dont take it away you must listen to me now amy  mrs somers rising abruptly and dropping her fan as she comes forward to meet an elderly gentleman arriving from the landing mr bemis how very heroic of you to come such a day isnt it too bad     ii  mr bemis mrs somers mr willis campbell   bemis not if it makes me specially welcome mrs somers discovering campbell oh mr campbell  campbell striving for his selfpossession as they shake hands yes another hero mr bemis mrs somers is going to brevet everybody who comes today she didnt say heroes to me but  mrs somers you shall have your tea at once mr bemis she rings i was making mr campbell wait for his you dont order up the teapot for one hero  bemis ha ha ha no indeed but im very glad you do for two the fact isrubbing his handsim half frozen  mrs somers is it so very cold to campbell who presents her fan with a bow oh thank you to mr bemis mr campbell has just been objecting to my fan he doesnt like its being handpainted as he calls it  bemis that reminds me of a california gentleman whom i found looking at an andrea del sarto in the pitti palace at florence one daybytheway youve been a californian too mr campbell but you wont mind he seemed to be puzzled over it and then he said to mei was standing near himhandpainted i presume  mrs somers ah ha ha ha how very good to the maid who appears the tea lizzie  campbell you dont think he was joking  bemis with misgiving why no it never occurred to me that he was  campbell you cant always tell when a californians joking  mrs somers with insinuation cant you not even adoptive ones  campbell adoptive ones never joke  mrs somers not even about handpainted fans what an interesting fact she sits down on the sofa behind the little table on which the maid arranges the tea and pours out a cup then with her eyes on mr bemis cream and sugar both yes holding a cube of sugar in the tongs how many  bemis one please  mrs somers handing it to him im so glad you take your tea au naturel as i call it  campbell what do you call it when they dont take it with cream and sugar  mrs somers au unnaturel theres only one thing worse taking it with a slice of lemon in it you might as well draw it from a bothersome samovar at once and be done with it  campbell the samovar is picturesque  mrs somers it is insincere like californians natives  campbell well i can think of something much worse than tea with lemon in it  mrs somers what  campbell no tea at all  mrs somers recollecting herself oh poor mr campbell two lumps  campbell one thank you your pity is so sweet  mrs somers you ought to have thought of the milk of human kindness and spared my creamjug too  campbell you didnt pour out your compassion soon enough  bemis who has been sipping his tea in silent admiration are you often able to keep it up in that way i was fancying myself at the theatre  mrs somers oh dont encore us mr campbell would keep saying his things over indefinitely  campbell presenting his cup another lump its turned bitter two  bemis ha ha ha very goodvery good indeed  campbell thank you kindly mr bemis  mrs somers greeting the new arrivals and leaning forward to shake hands with them as they come up without rising mrs roberts how very good of you and mr roberts     iii  mr and mrs roberts and the others   roberts not at all  mrs roberts of course we were coming  mrs somers will you have some tea you see im installed already mr campbell was so greedy he wouldnt wait  campbell mr bemis and i are here in the character of heroes and we had to have our tea at once youre a hero too roberts though you dont look it any one who comes to tea in such weather is a hero or a  mrs somers interrupting him with a little shriek ugh how hot that handles getting  campbell ah i dare say let me turn out my sisters cup pouring out the tea and handing it to mrs roberts i dont see how you could reconcile it to your no eleven conscience to leave your children in such a snowstorm as this agnes  mrs roberts in vague alarm why what in the world could happen to them willis  campbell oh nothing to them but suppose roberts got snowed under have some tea roberts he offers to pour out a cup  mrs somers dispossessing him of the teapot with dignity thank you mr campbell i will pour out the tea  campbell oh very well i thought the handle was hot  mrs somers its cooler now  campbell and you wont let me help you  mrs somers when there are more people you may hand the tea  campbell i wish i knew just how much that meant  mrs somers very little as little as an adoptive californian in his most earnest mood while they talkcampbell bending over the teapot on which mrs somers keeps her handthe others form a little group apart  bemis to mrs roberts i hope mr robertss distinguished friend wont give us the slip on account of the storm  roberts oh no hell be sure to come he may be late but hes the most amiable of englishmen and i know he wont disappoint mrs somers  bemis the most unamiable of englishmen couldnt do that  roberts ah i dont know did you meet mr pogis  bemis no what did he do  roberts why he cameto the hibbenss dinnerin a sack coat  mrs roberts i thought it was a cardigan jacket  bemis i heard a norfolk jacket and knickerbockers  mrs somers ah there is mrs curwen to campbell aside and without her husband  campbell or any one elses husband  mrs somers for shame  campbell you began it  mrs somers to mrs curwen who approaches her sofa you are kindness itself mrs curwen to come on such a day the ladies press each others hands     iv  mrs curwen and the others   mrs curwen you are goodness in person mrs somers to say so  campbell and i am magnanimity embodied let me introduce myself mrs curwen he bows and mrs curwen deeply courtesies  mrs curwen i should never have known you  campbell melodramatically to mrs somers tea ho for mrs curwenimpenetrably disguised as kindness  mrs curwen what shall i say to him  mrs somers pouring the tea anything you like mrs curwen arent we to see mr curwen today  mrs curwen taking her tea no im his insufficient apology hes detained at his officebusiness  campbell then you see they dont all come mrs somers  mrs curwen all what  campbell oh all theheroes  mrs curwen is that what he was going to say mrs somers  mrs somers you never can tell what hes going to say  mrs curwen i should think you would be afraid of him  mrs somers with a little shrug oh no hes quite harmless its just a little way he has to mr and mrs miller mr and mrs alfred bemis and dr lawton who all appear together ah how do you do so glad to see you so very kind of you i didnt suppose you would venture out and you too doctor she begins to pour out tea for them one after another with great zeal     v  dr lawton mr and mrs miller young mr and mrs bemis and the others   dr lawton yes i too it sounded very much as if i were brutus also he stirs his tea and stares round at the company it seems to me that i have met these conspirators before thats what makes boston insupportable youre always meeting the same people  campbell we all feel it as keenly as you do doctor  lawton looking sharply at him oh you here i might have expected it where is your aunt     vi  mrs crashaw and the others   mrs crashaw appearing if you mean me dr lawton  lawton i do my dear friend what company is complete without you  mrs somers reaching forward to take her hand while with her disengaged hand she begins to pour her a cup of tea none in my house  mrs crashaw very pretty taking her tea i hope it isnt complete either without the english painter you promised us  mrs somers no indeed and a great many other people besides but havent you met him yet i supposed mrs roberts  mrs crashaw oh i dont go to all of agness fandangoes i was to have seen him at mrs wheelershe is being asked everywhere of coursebut he didnt come he sent his father and mother instead they were very nice old people but they hadnt painted his pictures  lawton they might say his pictures would never have been painted without them  bemis it was like heines going to visit rachel by appointment she wasnt in but her father and mother were and when he met her afterwards he told her that he had just come from a show where he had seen a curious monster advertised for exhibitionthe offspring of a hare and a salmon the monster was not to be seen at the moment but the showman said here was monsieur the hare and madame the salmon  mrs roberts what in the world did rachel say  lawton ah thats what these brilliant anecdotes never tell and i think it would be very interesting to know what the victim of a witticism has to say  mrs curwen i should think you would know very often doctor  lawton ah now i should like to know what the victim of a compliment says  mrs curwen he bows his thanks dr lawton makes a profound obeisance to which mrs curwen responds in burlesque  miller we all envy you doctor  mrs miller oh yes mrs curwen never makes a compliment without meaning it  mrs curwen i cant say that quite my dear i should be very sorry to mean all the civil things i say but i never flatter gentlemen of a certain age  mrs miller tittering ineffectively i shall know what to say to mr miller after this  mrs crashaw well if you havent got the man mrs somers you have got his picture havent you  mrs somers yes its on my writingdesk in the library let me  lawton no no dont disturb yourself we wish to tear it to pieces without your embarrassing presence will you take my arm mrs crashaw  mrs bemis oh let us all go and see it  roberts arent you coming willis  campbell without looking round thank you ive seen it  mrs somers whom the withdrawal of her other guests has left alone with him how could you tell such a fib  campbell i could tell much worse fibs than that in such a cause  mrs somers what cause  campbell a lost one im afraid will you answer my question amy  mrs somers did you ask me any  campbell you know i didbefore those people came in  mrs somers oh that yes i should like to ask you a question first  campbell twenty if you like  mrs somers why do you feel authorized to call me by my first name  campbell because i love you now will you answer me  mrs somers dreamily i didnt say i would did i  campbell rising sadly no  mrs somers mechanically taking the hand he offers her oh what  campbell im going thats all  mrs somers so soon  campbell yes but ill try to make amends by not coming back soonor at all  mrs somers you mustnt  campbell mustnt what  mrs somers you mustnt keep my hand here come some more people ah mrs canfield miss bayly so very nice of you mrs wharton will you have some tea     vii  mrs canfield miss bayly mrs wharton and the others   mrs wharton no thank you the only objection to afternoon tea is the tea  mrs somers im so glad you dont mind the weather with her hand on the teapot glancing up at miss bayly and do you refuse too  miss bayly i can answer for mrs canfield that she doesnt and i never do we object to the weather  mrs somers pouring a cup of tea that makes it a little more difficult i can keep from offering mrs wharton some tea but i cant stop its snowing  miss bayly taking her cup but youre so amiable we know you would if you could and thats quite enough were not the first and only are we  mrs somers dear no there are multitudes of flattering spirits in the library stopping the mouth of my portrait with pretty speeches  miss bayly vividly not your bramford portrait  mrs somers my bramford portrait  miss bayly to the other ladies oh let us go and see it too they flutter out of the drawingroom where mrs somers and campbell remain alone together as before he continues silent while she waits for him to speak  illustration mrs somers pouring a cup of tea that makes it a little more difficult     viii  mrs somers mr campbell   mrs somers finally well  campbell well what  mrs somers nothing only i thought you wereyou were going to  campbell no ive got nothing to say  mrs somers i didnt mean that i thought you were going togo she puts up her hand and hides a triumphant little smile with it  campbell very well then ill go since you wish it he holds out his hand  mrs somers putting hers behind her youve shaken hands once besides who said i wished you to go  campbell do you wish me to stay  mrs somers i wish you tohand tea to people  campbell and you wont say anything more  mrs somers it seems to me thats enough  campbell it isnt enough for me but i suppose beggars mustnt be choosers i cant stay merely to hand tea to people however you can say yes or no now amy as well as at any other time  mrs somers well no thenif you wish it so much  campbell you know i dont wish it  mrs somers you gave me my choice i thought you were indifferent about the word  campbell you know better than that amy  mrs somers amy again arent you a little previous mr campbell  campbell with a sigh ah thats for you to say  mrs somers wouldnt it be impolite  campbell oh not for you  mrs somers if youre so sarcastic i shall be afraid of you  campbell under what circumstances  mrs somers dropping her eyes i dont know he makes a rush upon her oh here comes mrs curwen shake hands as if you were going     ix  mrs curwen mrs somers mr campbell   mrs curwen what is mr campbell going too  mrs somers too youre not going mrs curwen  mrs curwen yes im going the likeness is perfect mrs somers its a speaking likeness if there ever was one  campbell did it do all the talking  mrs curwen it wouldif mrs roberts and dr lawton hadnt been there well i must go  campbell so must i  mrs somers in surprise must you  campbell yes these drifts will be over my ears directly  mrs curwen you poor man you dont mean to say youre walking  campbell i shall be in about half a minute  mrs curwen indeed you shall not you shall be drivingwith me ive a vacancy in the coupé and ill set you down wherever you like  campbell wont it crowd you  mrs curwen not at all  campbell or incommode you in any way  mrs curwen it will oblige me in every way  campbell then i will go and a thousand thanks goodby again mrs somers  mrs curwen goodby mrs somers poor mrs somers it seems too bad to leave you here alone bowed in an elegiac attitude over your teaurn  mrs somers oh not at all remember me to mr curwen  mrs curwen i will well mr campbell  mrs somers mr campbell  campbell well  mrs curwen to which  campbell both  mrs somers neither  mrs curwen ah ha ha ha mr campbell do you know much about women  campbell i had a mother  mrs curwen oh a mother wont do  campbell well i have an only sister who is a woman  mrs curwen a sister wont do eithernot your own you cant learn a womans meaning in that way  campbell i will sit at your feet mrs curwen if youll instruct me  mrs curwen i shall be delighted ill begin now oh you neednt really prostrate yourself she stops him in a burlesque attempt to do so and ill concentrate the wisdom of the whole first lesson in a single word  campbell with clasped hands of entreaty speak blessed ghost  mrs curwen stay ah ha ha ha she flies at mrs somers and kisses her you cant say im illnatured my dear whatever i am  mrs somers pursuing her exit with the word no merely atrocious a pause ensues in which campbell stands irresolute     x  mrs somers mr campbell   campbell finally did you wish me to stay amy  mrs somers airily i oh no it was mrs curwen  campbell then i think ill accept her kind offer of a seat in her coupé  mrs somers oh i thought of course youd stayat her request  campbell no i shall only stay at yours  mrs somers and i shall not ask you in fact i warn you not to  campbell why  mrs somers because if you urge me to speak now i shall say  campbell i wasnt going to urge you  mrs somers no matter i shall say it now without being urged yes ive made up my mind i cant marry a flirt  campbell i can amy  mrs somers sir  campbell you know very well you sent those people into the other room to keep me here and torment me  mrs somers now youve insulted me and all is over  campbell to tantalize me with your loveliness your beauty your grace amy  mrs somers softening oh thats all very well  campbell im glad you like it i could go on at much greater length but you know i love you dearly amy and why should you delight in my agonies but only marry me and you shall delight in them as long as you live and  mrs somers you must hold me very cheap to think i would take you from that creature  campbell confound her i wasnt hers to give i offered myself first  mrs somers she offered you last andno thank you please  campbell do you really mean it  mrs somers i shall not say or yes i will say if that woman who seems to have you at her beck and call had not intermeddled i might have made you a very different answer but now my eyes are opened and i see what i should have to expect andno thank you please  campbell and if she hadnt offered me  mrs somers drawing out her handkerchief and putting it to her eyes i was feeling kindly towards youi was such a little fool  campbell amy  mrs somers and you knew how much i disliked her  campbell yes i saw by the way you kissed each other  mrs somers nonsense you knew that meant nothing but if it had been anybody else in the world but her i shouldnt have minded it and now  campbell now  mrs somers now all those geese are coming back from the other room and theyll see that ive been crying and everybody will know everything willis  campbell willis  mrs somers let me go i must bathe my eyes you stay here and receive them ill be back at once she escapes from the arms stretched towards her and out of the door just before her guests enter from the library and campbell remains to receive them the ladies in returning call over one anothers heads and shoulders     xi  mr campbell and the others   mrs roberts amy its lovely but it doesnt half do you justice  young mrs bemis its too sweet for anything mrs somers  mrs crashaw why did you let the man put you into that ridiculous seventeenthcentury dress cant he paint a modern frock  mrs wharton but what exquisite coloring mrs somers  mrs miller hes got just your lovely turn of the head  miss bayly and the way you hold your fanwhat character hes thrown into it  mrs roberts and that fall of the skirt amy that skirt is full of character she discovers mr campbell behind the teaurn he has mrs somerss light wrap on his shoulders and her fan in his hand and he alternately hides his blushes with it and coquettishly folds it and pats his mouth in a gross caricature of mrs somerss manner in rising he twitches his coat forward in a similar burlesque of a ladys management of her skirt why where is amy willis  campbell gone a moment some trouble aboutthe hot water  lawton hot water that youve been getting into ah young man look me in the eye  campbell your glass one doctor  young mr bemis why my dear has your father got a glass eye  mrs bemis of course he hasnt what an idea i dont know what mr campbell means  lawton ive no doubt he wishes i had a glass eyetwo of them for that matter but that isnt answering my question where is mrs somers  campbell that was my sisters question and i did answer it have some tea ladies im glad you like my portrait and that you think hes got my lovely turn of the head and the way i hold my fan and the character of my skirt but i agree with you that it isnt half as pretty as i am  the ladies oh what shall we do to him prescribe for us doctor  campbell no no i want the doctors services myself i dont want him to give me his medicines i want him to give me away  lawton youre tired of giving yourself away then  campbell its of no use they wont have me  lawton who wont  campbell oh ill leave mrs somers to say     xii  mrs somers and the others   mrs somers radiantly reappearing say what she has hidden the traces of her tears from every one but the ladies by a light application of powder and she knows that they all know she has been crying and this makes her a little more smiling say what she addresses the company in general rather than campbell  campbell with caricatured tenderness say yes  mrs somers what does he mean doctor  lawton oh im afraid hes past all surgery i give him over to you mrs somers  campbell there now she wasnt the last to do it  mrs somers with the resolution of a widow well i suppose theres nothing else for it then ill see what can be done for your patient doctor she passes her hand through campbells arm where he continues to stand behind the teatable  mrs roberts falling upon her and kissing her amy you dont mean it  mrs bemis embracing her in turn i never can believe it  mrs crashaw it is ridiculous what willis  mrs miller it does seem too nice to be true  bemis you astonish us  roberts we never should have dreamed of it  young mr bemis you must give us time to realize it  mrs wharton is it possible  miss bayly is it possible they all shake hands with mrs somers in turn  roberts isnt this rather sudden willis  campbell well it isfor mrs somers perhaps but ive found it awfully gradual  mrs somers nonsense its an old story for both of us  campbell well what i like about it is its true founded on fact  mrs roberts really i cant believe it  campbell well i dont know whom all this charming incredulitys intended to flatter but if its i i say no not really at all its merely a little coup de théâtre weve been arranging  lawton patting him on the shoulder one ahead as usual  mrs somers oh thank you doctor there are two of us ahead now  lawton i believe you at any rate bravo he initiates an applause in which all the rest join while campbell catches up mrs somerss fan and unfurls it
