50757490	susy a story of the plains   by bret harte   from argonaut edition of the works of bret harte vol 7  p f collier  son  new york     susy a story of the plains     chapter i   where the san leandro turnpike stretches its dusty hot and interminable length along the valley at a point where the heat and dust have become intolerable the monotonous expanse of wild oats on either side illimitable and the distant horizon apparently remoter than ever it suddenly slips between a stunted thicket or hedge of scrub oaks which until that moment had been undistinguishable above the long misty quivering level of the grain the thicket rising gradually in height but with a regular slope whose gradient had been determined by centuries of western trade winds presently becomes a fair wood of liveoak and a few hundred yards further at last assumes the aspect of a primeval forest a delicious coolness fills the air the long shadowy aisles greet the aching eye with a soothing twilight the murmur of unseen brooks is heard and by a strange irony the enormous widelyspaced stacks of wild oats are replaced by a carpet of tinyleaved mosses and chickweed at the roots of trees and the minutest clover in more open spaces the baked and cracked adobe soil of the now vanished plains is exchanged for a heavy red mineral dust and gravel rocks and boulders make their appearance and at times the road is crossed by the white veins of quartz it is still the san leandro turnpikea few miles later to rise from this canada into the upper plains againbut it is also the actual gateway and avenue to the robles rancho when the departing visitors of judge peyton now owner of the rancho reach the outer plains again after twenty minutes drive from the house the canada rancho and avenue have as completely disappeared from view as if they had been swallowed up in the plain  a cross road from the turnpike is the usual approach to the casa or mansiona long low quadrangle of brown adobe wall in a bare but gently sloping eminence and here a second surprise meets the stranger he seems to have emerged from the forest upon another illimitable plain but one utterly trackless wild and desolate it is however only a lower terrace of the same valley and in fact comprises the three square leagues of the robles rancho uncultivated and savage as it appears given over to wild cattle and horses that sometimes sweep in frightened bands around the very casa itself the long south wall of the corral embraces an orchard of gnarled peartrees an old vineyard and a venerable garden of olives and oranges a manor formerly granted by charles v to don vincente robles of andalusia of pious and ascetic memory it had commended itself to judge peyton of kentucky a modern heretic pioneer of bookish tastes and secluded habits who had bought it of don vincentes descendants here judge peyton seemed to have realized his idea of a perfect climate and a retirement halfstudious halfactive with something of the seignioralty of the old slaveholder that he had been here too he had seen the hope of restoring his wifes healthfor which he had undertaken the overland emigrationmore than fulfilled in mrs peytons improved physical condition albeit at the expense perhaps of some of the languorous graces of ailing american wifehood  it was with a curious recognition of this latter fact that judge peyton watched his wife crossing the patio or courtyard with her arm around the neck of her adopted daughter suzette a sudden memory crossed his mind of the first day that he had seen them togetherthe day that he had brought the child and her boycompaniontwo estrays from an emigrant train on the plainsto his wife in camp certainly mrs peyton was stouter and stronger fibred the wonderful californian climate had materialized her figure as it had their eastern fruits and flowers but it was stranger that susythe child of homelier frontier blood and parentage whose wholesome peasant plumpness had at first attracted themshould have grown thinner and more graceful and even seemed to have gained the delicacy his wife had lost six years had imperceptibly wrought this change it had never struck him before so forcibly as on this day of susys return from the convent school at santa clara for the holidays  the woman and child had reached the broad veranda which on one side of the patio replaced the old spanish corridor it was the single modern innovation that peyton had allowed himself when he had broken the quadrangular symmetry of the old house with a wooden annexe or addition beyond the walls it made a pleasant loungingplace shadowed from the hot midday sun by sloping roofs and awnings and sheltered from the boisterous afternoon trade winds by the opposite side of the court but susy did not seem inclined to linger there long that morning in spite of mrs peytons evident desire for a maternal teteatete the nervous preoccupation and capricious ennui of an indulged child showed in her pretty but discontented face and knit her curved eyebrows and peyton saw a look of pain pass over his wifes face as the young girl suddenly and halflaughingly broke away and fluttered off towards the old garden  mrs peyton looked up and caught her husbands eye  i am afraid susy finds it more dull here every time she returns she said with an apologetic smile i am glad she has invited one of her school friends to come for a visit tomorrow you know yourself john she added with a slight partisan attitude that the lonely old house and wild plain are not particularly lively for young people however much they may suit your ways  it certainly must be dull if she cant stand it for three weeks in the year said her husband dryly but we really cannot open the san francisco house for her summer vacation nor can we move from the rancho to a more fashionable locality besides it will do her good to run wild here i can remember when she wasnt so fastidious in fact i was thinking just now how changed she was from the day when we picked her up  how often am i to remind you john interrupted the lady with some impatience that we agreed never to speak of her past or even to think of her as anything but our own child you know how it pains me and the poor dear herself has forgotten it and thinks of us only as her own parents i really believe that if that wretched father and mother of hers had not been killed by the indians or were to come to life again she would neither know them nor care for them i mean of course john she said averting her eyes from a slightly cynical smile on her husbands face that its only natural for young children to be forgetful and ready to take new impressions  and as long dear as we are not the subjects of this youthful forgetfulness and she isnt really finding us as stupid as the rancho replied her husband cheerfully i suppose we mustnt complain  john how can you talk such nonsense said mrs peyton impatiently but i have no fear of that she added with a slightly ostentatious confidence i only wish i was as sure  of what  of nothing happening that could take her from us i do not mean death johnlike our first little one that does not happen to one twice but i sometimes dread  what shes only fifteen and its rather early to think about the only other inevitable separationmarriage come ally this is mere fancy she has been given up to us by her familyat least by all that we know are left of them i have legally adopted her if i have not made her my heiress it is because i prefer to leave everything to you and i would rather she should know that she was dependent upon you for the future than upon me  and i can make a will in her favor if i want to said mrs peyton quickly  always responded her husband smilingly but you have ample time to think of that i trust meanwhile i have some news for you which may make susys visit to the rancho this time less dull to her you remember clarence brant the boy who was with her when we picked her up and who really saved her life  no i dont said mrs peyton pettishly nor do i want to you know john how distasteful and unpleasant it is for me to have those dreary petty and vulgar details of the poor childs past life recalled and thank heaven i have forgotten them except when you choose to drag them before me you agreed long ago that we were never to talk of the indian massacre of her parents so that we could also ignore it before her then why do you talk of her vulgar friends who are just as unpleasant please let us drop the past  willingly my dear but unfortunately we cannot make others do it and this is a case in point it appears that this boy whom we brought to sacramento to deliver to a relative  and who was a wicked little impostoryou remember that yourself john for he said that he was the son of colonel brant and that he was dead and you know and my brother harry knew that colonel brant was alive all the time and that he was lying and colonel brant was not his father broke in mrs peyton impatiently  as it seems you do remember that much said peyton dryly it is only just to him that i should tell you that it appears that he was not an impostor his story was true i have just learned that colonel brant was actually his father but had concealed his lawless life here as well as his identity from the boy he was really that vague relative to whom clarence was confided and under that disguise he afterwards protected the boy had him carefully educated at the jesuit college of san jose and dying two years ago in that filibuster raid in mexico left him a considerable fortune  and what has he to do with susys holidays said mrs peyton with uneasy quickness john you surely cannot expect her ever to meet this common creature again with his vulgar ways his wretched associates like that jim hooker and as you yourself admit the blood of an assassin duelist andheaven knows what kind of a pirate his father wasnt at the lastin his veins you dont believe that a lad of this type however much of his fathers illgotten money he may have can be fit company for your daughter you never could have thought of inviting him here  im afraid thats exactly what i have done ally said the smiling but unmoved peyton but im still more afraid that your conception of his present condition is an unfair one like your remembrance of his past father sobriente whom i met at san jose yesterday says he is very intelligent and thoroughly educated with charming manners and refined tastes his fathers money which they say was an investment for him in carsons bank five years ago is as good as any ones and his fathers blood wont hurt him in california or the southwest at least he is received everywhere and don juan robinson was his guardian indeed as far as social status goes it might be a serious question if the actual daughter of the late john silsbee of pike county and the adopted child of john peyton was in the least his superior as father sobriente evidently knew clarences former companionship with susy and her parents it would be hardly politic for us to ignore it or seem to be ashamed of it so i intrusted sobriente with an invitation to young brant on the spot  mrs peytons impatience indignation and opposition which had successively given way before her husbands quiet masterful good humor here took the form of a neurotic fatalism she shook her head with superstitious resignation  didnt i tell you john that i always had a dread of something coming  but if it comes in the shape of a shy young lad i see nothing singularly portentous in it they have not met since they were quite small their tastes have changed if they dont quarrel and fight they may be equally bored with each other yet until then in one way or another clarence will occupy the young ladys vacant caprice and her school friend mary rogers will be here you know to divide his attentions and added peyton with mock solemnity preserve the interest of strict propriety shall i break it to heror will you  noyes hesitated mrs peyton perhaps i had better  very well i leave his character in your hands only dont prejudice her into a romantic fancy for him and judge peyton lounged smilingly away  then two little tears forced themselves from mrs peytons eyes again she saw that prospect of uninterrupted companionship with susy upon which each successive year she had built so many maternal hopes and confidences fade away before her she dreaded the coming of susys school friend who shared her daughters present thoughts and intimacy although she had herself invited her in a more desperate dread of the childs abstracted discontented eyes she dreaded the advent of the boy who had shared susys early life before she knew her she dreaded the ordeal of breaking the news and perhaps seeing that pretty animation spring into her eyes which she had begun to believe no solicitude or tenderness of her own ever again awakenedand yet she dreaded still more that her husband should see it too for the love of this recreated woman although not entirely materialized with her changed fibre had nevertheless become a coarser selfishness fostered by her loneliness and limited experience the maternal yearning left unsatisfied by the loss of her firstborn had never been filled by susys thoughtless acceptance of it she had been led astray by the childs easy transference of dependence and the forgetfulness of youth and was only now dimly conscious of finding herself face to face with an alien nature  she started to her feet and followed the direction that susy had taken for a moment she had to front the afternoon trade wind which chilled her as it swept the plain beyond the gateway but was stopped by the adobe wall above whose shelter the stunted treetopsthrough years of exposureslanted as if trimmed by gigantic shears at first looking down the venerable alley of fantastic knotted shapes she saw no trace of susy but half way down the gleam of a white skirt against a thicket of dark olives showed her the young girl sitting on a bench in a neglected arbor in the midst of this formal and faded pageantry she looked charmingly fresh youthful and pretty and yet the unfortunate woman thought that her attitude and expression at that moment suggested more than her fifteen years of girlhood her golden hair still hung unfettered over her straight boylike back and shoulders her short skirt still showed her childish feet and ankles yet there seemed to be some undefined maturity or a vague womanliness about her that stung mrs peytons heart the child was growing away from her too  susy  the young girl raised her head quickly her deep violet eyes seemed also to leap with a sudden suspicion and with a halfmechanical secretive movement that might have been only a schoolgirls instinct her right hand had slipped a paper on which she was scribbling between the leaves of her book yet the next moment even while looking interrogatively at her mother she withdrew the paper quietly tore it up into small pieces and threw them on the ground  but mrs peyton was too preoccupied with her news to notice the circumstance and too nervous in her haste to be tactful susy your father has invited that boy clarence brantyou know that creature we picked up and assisted on the plains when you were a mere babyto come down here and make us a visit  her heart seemed to stop beating as she gazed breathlessly at the girl but susys face unchanged except for the alert questioning eyes remained fixed for a moment then a childish smile of wonder opened her small red mouth expanded it slightly as she said simply  lor mar he hasnt really  inexpressibly yet unreasonably reassured mrs peyton hurriedly recounted her husbands story of clarences fortune and was even joyfully surprised into some fairness of statement  but you dont remember him much do you dear it was so long ago andyou are quite a young lady now she added eagerly  the open mouth was still fixed the wondering smile would have been idiotic in any face less dimpled rosy and piquant than susys after a slight gasp as if in still incredulous and partly reminiscent preoccupation she said without replying  how funny when is he coming  day after tomorrow returned mrs peyton with a contented smile  and mary rogers will be here too it will be real fun for her  mrs peyton was more than reassured half ashamed of her jealous fears she drew susys golden head towards her and kissed it and the young girl still reminiscent with smilingly abstracted toleration returned the caress     chapter ii   it was not thought inconsistent with susys capriciousness that she should declare her intention the next morning of driving her pony buggy to santa inez to anticipate the stagecoach and fetch mary rogers from the station mrs peyton as usual supported the young ladys whim and opposed her husbands objections  because the stagecoach happens to pass our gate john it is no reason why susy shouldnt drive her friend from santa inez if she prefers it its only seven miles and you can send pedro to follow her on horseback to see that she comes to no harm  but that isnt pedros business said peyton  he ought to be proud of the privilege returned the lady with a toss of her head  peyton smiled grimly but yielded and when the stagecoach drew up the next afternoon at the santa inez hotel susy was already waiting in her pony carriage before it although the susceptible driver expressman and passengers generally charmed with this goldenhaired vision would have gladly protracted the meeting of the two young friends the transfer of mary rogers from the coach to the carriage was effected with considerable hauteur and youthful dignity by susy even mary rogers two years susys senior a serious brunette whose goodhumor did not however impair her capacity for sentiment was impressed and even embarrassed by her demeanor but only for a moment when they had driven from the hotel and were fairly hidden again in the dust of the outlying plain with the discreet pedro hovering in the distance susy dropped the reins and grasping her companions arm gasped in tones of dramatic intensity  hes been heard from and is coming here  who  a sickening sense that her old confidante had already lost touch with herthey had been separated for nearly two weeksmight have passed through susys mind  who she repeated with a vicious shake of marys arm why clarence brant of course  no said mary vaguely  nevertheless susy went on rapidly as if to neutralize the effect of her comrades vacuity  you never could have imagined it never even i when mother told me i thought i should have fainted and all would have been revealed  but hesitated the still wondering confidante i thought that was all over long ago you havent seen him nor heard from him since that day you met accidentally at santa clara two years ago have you  susys eyes shot a blue ray of dark but unutterable significance into marys and then were carefully averted mary rogers although perfectly satisfied that susy had never seen clarence since nevertheless instantly accepted and was even thrilled with this artful suggestion of a clandestine correspondence such was the simple faith of youthful friendship  mother knows nothing of it of course and a word from you or him would ruin everything continued the breathless susy thats why i came to fetch you and warn you you must see him first and warn him at any cost if i hadnt run every risk to come here today heaven knows what might have happened what do you think of the ponies dear theyre my own and the sweetest this ones susy that one clarencebut privately you know before the world and in the stables hes only birdie  but i thought you wrote to me that you called them paul and virginie said mary doubtfully  i do sometimes said susy calmly but one has to learn to suppress ones feelings dear then quickly i do so hate deceit dont you tell me dont you think deceit perfectly hateful  without waiting for her friends loyal assent she continued rapidly and hes just rolling in wealth and educated papa says to the highest degree  then began mary if hes coming with your mothers consent and if you havent quarreled and it is not broken off i should think youd be just delighted  but another quick flash from susys eyes dispersed these beatific visions of the future hush she said with suppressed dramatic intensity you know not what you say theres an awful mystery hangs over him mary rogers continued the young girl approaching her small mouth to her confidantes ear in an appalling whisper his father wasa pirate yeslived a pirate and was killed a pirate  the statement however seemed to be partly ineffective mary rogers was startled but not alarmed and even protested feebly but she said if the fathers dead whats that to do with clarence he was always with your papaso you told me dearor other people and couldnt catch anything from his own father and im sure dearest he always seemed nice and quiet  yes seemed returned susy darkly but thats all you know it was in his blood you know it always isyou read it in the booksyou could see it in his eye there were times my dear when he was thwartedwhen the slightest attention from another person to me revealed it i have kept it to myselfbut think dearest of the effects of jealousy on that passionate nature sometimes i tremble to look back upon it  nevertheless she raised her hands and threw back her lovely golden mane from her childish shoulders with an easy untroubled gesture it was singular that mary rogers leaning back comfortably in the buggy also accepted these heartrending revelations with comfortably knitted brows and luxuriously contented concern if she found it difficult to recognize in the picture just drawn by susy the quiet gentle and sadly reserved youth she had known she said nothing after a silence lazily watching the distant wheeling vacquero she said  and your father always sends an outrider like that with you how nice so picturesqueand like the old spanish days  hush said susy with another unutterable glance  but this time mary was in full sympathetic communion with her friend and equal to any incoherent hiatus of revelation  no she said promptly you dont mean it  dont ask me i darent say anything to papa for hed be simply furious but there are times when were alone and pedro wheels down so near with such a look in his black eyes that im all in a tremble its dreadful they say hes a real brionesand he sometimes says something in spanish ending with senorita but i pretend i dont understand  and i suppose that if anything should happen to the ponies hed just risk his life to save you  yesand it would be so awfulfor i just hate him  but if i was with you dear he couldnt expect you to be as grateful as if you were alone susy she continued after a pause if you just stirred up the ponies a little so as to make em go fast perhaps he might think theyd got away from you and come dashing down here it would be so funny to see himwouldnt it  the two girls looked at each other their eyes sparkled already with a fearful joythey drew a long breath of guilty anticipation for a moment susy even believed in her imaginary sketch of pedros devotion  papa said i wasnt to use the whip except in a case of necessity she said reaching for the slender silverhandled toy and setting her pretty lips together with the added determination of disobedience glongand she laid the lash smartly on the shining backs of the animals  they were wiry slender brutes of mojave indian blood only lately broken to harness and still undisciplined in temper the lash sent them rearing into the air where forgetting themselves in the slackened traces and loose reins they came down with a succession of bounds that brought the light buggy leaping after them with its wheels scarcely touching the ground that unlucky lash had knocked away the bonds of a few months servitude and sent the halfbroken brutes instinctively careering with arched backs and kicking heels into the field towards the nearest cover  mary rogers cast a hurried glance over her shoulder alas they had not calculated on the insidious levels of the terraced plain and the faithful pedro had suddenly disappeared the intervention of six inches of rising wild oats had wiped him out of the prospect and their possible salvation as completely as if he had been miles away nevertheless the girls were not frightened perhaps they had not time there was however the briefest interval for the most dominant of feminine emotions and it was taken advantage of by susy  it was all your fault dear she gasped as the forewheels of the buggy dropping into a gopher rut suddenly tilted up the back of the vehicle and shot its fair occupants into the yielding palisades of dusty grain the shock detached the whiffletree from the splinterbar snapped the light pole and turning the now thoroughly frightened animals again from their course sent them goaded by the clattering fragments flying down the turnpike half a mile farther on they overtook the gleaming white canvas hood of a slowly moving wagon drawn by two oxen and swerving again the nearer pony stepped upon a trailing trace and ingloriously ended their career by rolling himself and his companion in the dust at the very feet of the peacefully plodding team  equally harmless and inglorious was the catastrophe of susy and her friend the strong elastic stalks of the tall grain broke their fall and enabled them to scramble to their feet dusty disheveled but unhurt and even unstunned by the shock their first instinctive cries over a damaged hat or ripped skirt were followed by the quick reaction of childish laughter they were alone the very defection of pedro consoled them in its absence of any witness to their disaster even their previous slight attitude to each other was forgotten they groped their way pushing and panting to the road again where beholding the overset buggy with its wheels ludicrously in the air they suddenly seized and shook each other and in an outburst of hilarious ecstasy fairly laughed until the tears came into their eyes  then there was a breathless silence  the stage will be coming by in a moment composedly said susy fix me dear  mary rogers calmly walked around her friend bestowing a practical shake there a pluck here completely retying one bow and restoring an engaging fullness to another yet critically examining with her head on one side the fascinating result then susy performed the same function for mary with equal deliberation and deftness suddenly mary started and looked up  its coming she said quickly and theyve seen us  the expression of the faces of the two girls instantly changed a pained dignity and resignation apparently born of the most harrowing experiences and controlled only by perfect good breeding was distinctly suggested in their features and attitude as they stood patiently by the wreck of their overturned buggy awaiting the oncoming coach in sharp contrast was the evident excitement among the passengers a few rose from their seats in their eagerness as the stage pulled up in the road beside the buggy four or five of the younger men leaped to the ground  are you hurt miss they gasped sympathetically  susy did not immediately reply but ominously knitted her pretty eyebrows as if repressing a spasm of pain then she said not at all coldly with the suggestion of stoically concealing some lasting or perhaps fatal injury and took the arm of mary rogers who had in the mean time established a touching yet graceful limp  declining the proffered assistance of the passengers they helped each other into the coach and freezingly requesting the driver to stop at mr peytons gate maintained a statuesque and impressive silence at the gates they got down followed by the sympathetic glances of the others  to all appearance their escapade albeit fraught with dangerous possibilities had happily ended but in the economy of human affairs as in nature forces are not suddenly let loose without more or less sympathetic disturbance which is apt to linger after the impelling cause is harmlessly spent the fright which the girls had unsuccessfully attempted to produce in the heart of their escort had passed him to become a panic elsewhere judge peyton riding near the gateway of his rancho was suddenly confronted by the spectacle of one of his vacqueros driving on before him the two lassoed and dusty ponies with a face that broke into violent gesticulating at his masters quick interrogation  ah mother of god it was an evil day for the bronchos had run away upset the buggy and had only been stopped by a brave americano of an oxteam whose lasso was even now around their necks to prove it and who had been dragged a matter of a hundred varas like a calf at their heels the senoritasah had he not already said they were safe by the mercy of jesuspicked up by the coach and would be here at this moment  but where was pedro all the time what was he doing demanded peyton with a darkened face and gathering anger  the vacquero looked at his master and shrugged his shoulders significantly at any other time peyton would have remembered that pedro as the reputed scion of a decayed spanish family and claiming superiority was not a favorite with his fellowretainers but the gesture half of suggestion half of depreciation irritated peyton still more  well where is this american who did something when there wasnt a man among you all able to stop a childs runaway ponies he said sarcastically let me see him  the vacquero became still more deprecatory  ah he had driven on with his team towards san antonio he would not stop to be thanked but that was the whole truth he incarnacion could swear to it as to the creed there was nothing more  take those beasts around the back way to the corral said peyton thoroughly enraged and not a word of this to any one at the casa do you hear not a word to mrs peyton or the servants or by heaven ill clear the rancho of the whole lazy crew of you at once out of the way there and be off  he spurred his horse past the frightened menial and dashed down the narrow lane that led to the gate but as incarnacion had truly said it was an evil day for at the bottom of the lane ambling slowly along as he lazily puffed a yellow cigarette appeared the figure of the erring pedro utterly unconscious of the accident attributing the disappearance of his charges to the inequalities of the plain and in truth little interested in what he firmly believed was his purely artificial function he had even made a larger circuit to stop at a wayside fonda for refreshments  unfortunately there is no more illogical sequence of human emotion than the exasperation produced by the bland manner of the unfortunate object who has excited it although that very unconcern may be the convincing proof of innocence of intention judge peyton already influenced was furious at the comfortable obliviousness of his careless henchman and rode angrily towards him only a quick turn of pedros wrist kept the two men from coming into collision  is this the way you attend to your duty demanded peyton in a thick suppressed voice where is the buggy where is my daughter  there was no mistaking judge peytons manner even if the reason of it was not so clear to pedros mind and his hot latin blood flew instinctively to his face but for that he might have shown some concern or asked an explanation as it was he at once retorted with the national shrug and the national halfscornful halflazy quien sabe  who knows repeated peyton hotly i do she was thrown out of her buggy through your negligence and infernal laziness the ponies ran away and were stopped by a stranger who wasnt afraid of risking his bones while you were limping around somewhere like a slouching cowardly coyote  the vacquero struggled a moment between blank astonishment and inarticulate rage at last he burst out  i am no coyote i was there i saw no runaway  dont lie to me sir roared peyton i tell you the buggy was smashed the girls were thrown out and nearly killedhe stopped suddenly the sound of youthful laughter had come from the bottom of the lane where susy peyton and mary rogers just alighted from the coach in the reaction of their previous constrained attitude were flying hilariously into view a slight embarrassment crossed peytons face a still deeper flush of anger overspread pedros sullen cheek  then pedro found tongue again his native one rapidly violently half incoherently ah yes it had come to this it seems he was not a vacquero a companion of the padrone on lands that had been his own before the americanos robbed him of it but a servant a lackey of muchachas an attendant on children to amuse them orwhy notan appendage to his daughters state ah jesus maria such a state such a muchacha a pickedup foundlinga swineherds daughterto be ennobled by his pedros attendance and for whose vulgar clownish trickstricks of a swineherds daughterhe pedro was to be brought to book and insulted as if she were of hidalgo blood ah caramba don juan peyton would find he could no more make a servant of him than he could make a lady of her  the two young girls were rapidly approaching judge peyton spurred his horse beside the vacqueros and swinging the long thong of his bridle ominously in his clenched fingers said with a white face  vamos  pedros hand slid towards his sash peyton only looked at him with a rigid smile of scorn  or ill lash you here before them both he added in a lower voice  the vacquero met peytons relentless eyes with a yellow flash of hate drew his reins sharply until his mustang galled by the cruel bit reared suddenly as if to strike at the immovable american then apparently with the same action he swung it around on its hind legs as on a pivot and dashed towards the corral at a furious gallop     chapter iii   meantime the heroic proprietor of the peaceful oxteam whose valor incarnacion had so infelicitously celebrated was walking listlessly in the dust beside his wagon at a first glance his slouching figure taken in connection with his bucolic conveyance did not immediately suggest a hero as he emerged from the dusty cloud it could be seen that he was wearing a belt from which a large dragoon revolver and hunting knife were slung and placed somewhat ostentatiously across the wagon seat was a rifle yet the other contents of the wagon were of a singularly inoffensive character and even suggested articles of homely barter culinary utensils of all sizes tubs scullery brushes and clocks with several rolls of cheap carpeting and calico might have been the wares of some traveling vender yet as they were only visible through a flap of the drawn curtains of the canvas hood they did not mitigate the general aggressive effect of their owners appearance a red bandanna handkerchief knotted and thrown loosely over his shoulders a slouched hat pulled darkly over a head of long tangled hair which however shadowed a round comfortable face scantily and youthfully bearded were part of these confusing inconsistencies  the shadows of the team wagon were already lengthening grotesquely over the flat cultivated fields which for some time had taken the place of the plains of wild oats in the branch road into which they had turned the gigantic shadow of the proprietor occasionally projected before it was in characteristic exaggeration and was often obliterated by a puff of dust stirred by the plodding hoofs of the peaceful oxen and swept across the field by the strong afternoon trades the sun sank lower although a still potent presence above the horizon line the creaking wagon lumbered still heavily along yet at intervals its belligerent proprietor would start up from his slouching silent march break out into violent disproportionate but utterly ineffective objurgation of his cattle jump into the air and kick his heels together in some paroxysm of indignation against theman act however which was received always with heavy bovine indifference the dogged scorn of swaying repudiating heads or the dull contempt of lazily flicking tails  towards sunset one or two straggling barns and cottages indicated their approach to the outskirts of a country town or settlement here the team halted as if the belligerentlooking teamster had felt his appearance was inconsistent with an effeminate civilization and the oxen were turned into an open waste opposite a nondescript wooden tenement half farmhouse and half cabin evidently of the rudest western origin he may have recognized the fact that these shanties were not as the ordinary traveler might infer the first rude shelter of the original pioneers or settlers but the later makeshifts of some recent western immigrants who like himself probably found themselves unequal to the settled habits of the village and who still retained their nomadic instincts it chanced however that the cabin at present was occupied by a new england mechanic and his family who had emigrated by ship around cape horn and who had no experience of the west the plains or its people it was therefore with some curiosity and a certain amount of fascinated awe that the mechanics only daughter regarded from the open door of her dwelling the arrival of this wild and lawlesslooking stranger  meantime he had opened the curtains of the wagon and taken from its interior a number of pots pans and culinary utensils which he proceeded to hang upon certain hooks that were placed on the outer ribs of the board and the sides of the vehicle to this he added a roll of rag carpet the end of which hung from the tailboard and a roll of pink calico temptingly displayed on the seat the mystification and curiosity of the young girl grew more intense at these proceedings it looked like the ordinary exhibition of a traveling peddler but the gloomy and embattled appearance of the man himself scouted so peaceful and commonplace a suggestion under the pretense of chasing away a marauding hen she sallied out upon the waste near the wagon it then became evident that the traveler had seen her and was not averse to her interest in his movements although he had not changed his attitude of savage retrospection an occasional ejaculation of suppressed passion as if the memory of some past conflict was too much for him escaped him even in this peaceful occupation as this possibly caused the young girl to still hover timidly in the distance he suddenly entered the wagon and reappeared carrying a tin bucket with which he somewhat ostentatiously crossed her path his eyes darkly wandering as if seeking something  if youre lookin for the spring its a spell furder onby the willows  it was a pleasant voice the teamster thought albeit with a dry crisp new england accent unfamiliar to his ears he looked into the depths of an unlovely bluecheck sunbonnet and saw certain small irregular features and a sallow check lit up by a pair of perfectly innocent trustful and wondering brown eyes their timid possessor seemed to be a girl of seventeen whose figure although apparently clad in one of her mothers gowns was still undeveloped and repressed by rustic hardship and innutrition as her eyes met his she saw that the face of this gloomy stranger was still youthful by no means implacable and even at that moment was actually suffused by a brickcolored blush in matters of mere intuition the sex even in its most rustic phase is still our superior and this unsophisticated girl as the trespasser stammered thank ye miss was instinctively emboldened to greater freedom  dad aint tu hum but ye kin have a drink o milk if ye keer for it  she motioned shyly towards the cabin and then led the way the stranger with an inarticulate murmur afterwards disguised as a cough followed her meekly nevertheless by the time they had reached the cabin he had shaken his long hair over his eyes again and a dark abstraction gathered chiefly in his eyebrows but it did not efface from the girls mind the previous concession of a blush and although it added to her curiosity did not alarm her he drank the milk awkwardly but by the laws of courtesy even among the most savage tribes she felt he was at that moment at least harmless a timid smile fluttered around her mouth as she said  when ye hung up them things i thought ye might be havin suthing to swap or sell that iswith tactful politenessmother was wantin a new skillet and it would have been handy if youd had one butwith an apologetic glance at his equipmentsif it aint your business its all right and no offense  ive got a lot o skillets said the strange teamster with marked condescension and she can have one theyre all thats left outer a heap o traders stuff captured by injuns tother side of laramie we had a big fight to get em back lost two of our best menscalped at bloody creekand had to drop a dozen redskins in their tracksme and another manlyin flat in er wagon and firin under the flaps o the canvas i dont know ez they waz wuth it he added in gloomy retrospect but ive got to get rid of em i reckon somehow afore i work over to deadmans gulch again  the young girls eyes brightened timidly with a feminine mingling of imaginative awe and personal pitying interest he was after all so young and amiable looking for such hardships and adventures and with all this hethis indian fighterwas a little afraid of her  then thats why you carry that knife and sixshooter she said but you wont want em now here in the settlement  thats ez mebbe said the stranger darkly he paused and then suddenly as if recklessly accepting a dangerous risk unbuckled his revolver and handed it abstractedly to the young girl but the sheath of the bowieknife was a fixture in his bodybelt and he was obliged to withdraw the glittering blade by itself and to hand it to her in all its naked terrors the young girl received the weapons with a smiling complacency upon such altars as these the skeptical reader will remember that mars had once hung his battered shield his lance and uncontrolled crest  nevertheless the warlike teamster was not without embarrassment muttering something about the necessity of looking after his stock he achieved a hesitating bow backed awkwardly out of the door and receiving from the conquering hands of the young girl his weapons again was obliged to carry them somewhat ingloriously in his hands across the road and put them on the wagon seat where in company with the culinary articles they seemed to lose their distinctively aggressive character here although his cheek was still flushed from his peaceful encounter his voice regained some of its hoarse severity as he drove the oxen from the muddy pool into which they had luxuriantly wandered and brought their fodder from the wagon later as the sun was setting he lit a corncob pipe and somewhat ostentatiously strolled down the road with a furtive eye lingering upon the still open door of the farmhouse presently two angular figures appeared from it the farmer and his wife intent on barter  these he received with his previous gloomy preoccupation and a slight variation of the story he had told their daughter it is possible that his suggestive indifference piqued and heightened the bargaining instincts of the woman for she not only bought the skillet but purchased a clock and a roll of carpeting still more in some effusion of rustic courtesy she extended an invitation to him to sup with them which he declined and accepted in the same embarrassed breath returning the proffered hospitality by confidentially showing them a couple of dried scalps presumably of indian origin it was in the same moment of human weakness that he answered their polite query as to what they might call him by intimating that his name was red jima title of achievement by which he was generally known which for the present must suffice them but during the repast that followed this was shortened to mister jim and even familiarly by the elders to plain jim only the young girl habitually used the formal prefix in return for the miss phoebe that he called her  with three such sympathetic and unexperienced auditors the gloomy embarrassment of red jim was soon dissipated although it could hardly be said that he was generally communicative dark tales of indian warfare of night attacks and wild stampedes in which he had always taken a prominent part flowed freely from his lips but little else of his past history or present prospects and even his narratives of adventure were more or less fragmentary and imperfect in detail  you woz saying said the farmer with slow matter of fact new england deliberation ez how you guessed you woz beguiled amongst the injins by your mexican partner a powful influential man and yet you woz the only one escaped the genral slarterin how came the injins to kill himtheir friend  they didnt returned jim with ominously averted eyes  what became of him continued the farmer  red jim shadowed his eyes with his hand and cast a dark glance of scrutiny out of the doors and windows the young girl perceived it with timid fascinated concern and said hurriedly  dont ask him father dont you see he mustnt tell  not when spies may be hangin round and doggin me at every step said red jim as if reflecting with another furtive glance towards the already fading prospect without theyve sworn to revenge him he added moodily  a momentary silence followed the farmer coughed slightly and looked dubiously at his wife but the two women had already exchanged feminine glances of sympathy for this evident slayer of traitors and were apparently inclined to stop any adverse criticism  in the midst of which a shout was heard from the road the farmer and his family instinctively started red jim alone remained unmoveda fact which did not lessen the admiration of his feminine audience the host rose quickly and went out the figure of a horseman had halted in the road but after a few moments conversation with the farmer they both moved towards the house and disappeared when the farmer returned it was to say that one of them frisco dandies who didnt keer about stoppin at the hotel in the settlement had halted to give his critter a feed and drink that he might continue his journey he had asked him to come in while the horse was feeding but the stranger had guessed hed stretch his legs outside and smoke his cigar he might have thought the company not fine enough for him but he was civil spoken enough and had an allfired smart hoss and seemed to know how to run him to the anxious inquiries of his wife and daughter he added that the stranger didnt seem like a spy or a mexican was as young as him pointing to the moody red jim and a darned sight more peacefullike in style  perhaps owing to the criticism of the farmer perhaps from some still lurking suspicion of being overheard by eavesdroppers or possibly from a humane desire to relieve the strained apprehension of the women red jim as the farmer disappeared to rejoin the stranger again dropped into a lighter and gentler vein of reminiscence he told them how when a mere boy he had been lost from an emigrant train in company with a little girl some years his junior how when they found themselves alone on the desolate plain with the vanished train beyond their reach he endeavored to keep the child from a knowledge of the real danger of their position and to soothe and comfort her how he carried her on his back until exhausted he sank in a heap of sagebrush how he was surrounded by indians who however never suspected his hidingplace and how he remained motionless and breathless with the sleeping child for three hours until they departed how at the last moment he had perceived a train in the distance and had staggered with her thither although shot at and wounded by the trainmen in the belief that he was an indian how it was afterwards discovered that the child was the longlost daughter of a millionaire how he had resolutely refused any gratuity for saving her and she was now a peerless young heiress famous in california whether this lighter tone of narrative suited him better or whether the active feminine sympathy of his auditors helped him along certain it was that his story was more coherent and intelligible and his voice less hoarse and constrained than in his previous belligerent reminiscences his expression changed and even his features worked into something like gentler emotion the bright eyes of phoebe fastened upon him turned dim with a faint moisture and her pale cheek took upon itself a little color the mother after interjecting du tell and i wanter know remained openmouthed staring at her visitor and in the silence that followed a pleasant but somewhat melancholy voice came from the open door  i beg your pardon but i thought i couldnt be mistaken it is my old friend jim hooker  everybody started red jim stumbled to his feet with an inarticulate and hysteric exclamation yet the apparition that now stood in the doorway was far from being terrifying or discomposing it was evidently the strangera slender elegantlyknit figure whose upper lip was faintly shadowed by a soft dark mustache indicating early manhood and whose unstudied ease in his wellfitting garments bespoke the dweller of cities goodlooking and welldressed without the consciousness of being either selfpossessed through easy circumstances yet without selfassertion courteous by nature and instinct as well as from an experience of granting favors he might have been a welcome addition to even a more critical company but red jim hurriedly seizing his outstretched hand instantly dragged him away from the doorway into the road and out of hearing of his audience  did you hear what i was saying he asked hoarsely  well yesi think so returned the stranger with a quiet smile  ye aint goin back on me clarence are yeaint goin to gimme away afore them old pard are ye said jim with a sudden change to almost pathetic pleading  no returned the stranger smiling and certainly not before that interested young lady jim but stop let me look at you  he held out both hands took jims spread them apart for a moment with a boyish gesture and looking in his face said half mischievously half sadly yes its the same old jim hookerunchanged  but youre changedreglar war paint big injin style said hooker looking up at him with an awkward mingling of admiration and envy heard you struck it rich with the old man and was mister brant now  yes said clarence gently yet with a smile that had not only a tinge of weariness but even of sadness in it  unfortunately the act which was quite natural to clarences sensitiveness and indeed partly sprang from some concern in his old companions fortunes translated itself by a very human process to hookers consciousness as a piece of rank affectation he would have been exalted and exultant in clarences place consequently any other exhibition was only airs nevertheless at the present moment clarence was to be placated  you didnt mind my telling that story about your savin susy as my own did ye he said with a hasty glance over his shoulder i only did it to fool the old man and womenfolks and make talk you wont blow on me ye aint mad about it  it had crossed clarences memory that when they were both younger jim hooker had once not only borrowed his story but his name and personality as well yet in his loyalty to old memories there was mingled no resentment for past injury of course not he said with a smile that was however still thoughtful why should i only i ought to tell you that susy peyton is living with her adopted parents not ten miles from here and it might reach their ears shes quite a young lady now and if i wouldnt tell her story to strangers i dont think you ought to jim  he said this so pleasantly that even the skeptical jim forgot what he believed were the airs and graces of selfabnegation and said lets go inside and ill introduce you and turned to the house but clarence brant drew back im going on as soon as my horse is fed for im on a visit to peyton and i intend to push as far as santa inez still tonight i want to talk with you about yourself jim he added gently your prospects and your future i heard he went on hesitatingly that you wereat workin a restaurant in san francisco im glad to see that you are at least your own master herehe glanced at the wagon you are selling things i suppose for yourself or another is that team yours come he added still pleasantly but in an older and graver voice with perhaps the least touch of experienced authority be frank jim which is it never mind what things youve told in there tell me the truth about yourself can i help you in any way believe me i should like to we have been old friends whatever difference in our luck i am yours still  thus adjured the redoubtable jim in a hoarse whisper with a furtive eye on the house admitted that he was traveling for an itinerant peddler whom he expected to join later in the settlement that he had his own methods of disposing of his wares and darkly that his proprietor and the world generally had better not interfere with him that with a return to more confidential lightness he had already worked the wild west injin business so successfully as to dispose of his wares particularly in yonder house and might do even more if not prematurely and wantonly blown upon gone back on or given away  but wouldnt you like to settle down on some bit of land like this and improve it for yourself said clarence all these valley terraces are bound to rise in value and meantime you would be independent it could be managed jim i think i could arrange it for you he went on with a slight glow of youthful enthusiasm write to me at peytons ranch and ill see you when i come back and well hunt up something for you together as jim received the proposition with a kind of gloomy embarrassment he added lightly with a glance at the farmhouse it might be near here you know and youd have pleasant neighbors and even eager listeners to your old adventures  youd better come in a minit before you go said jim clumsily evading a direct reply clarence hesitated a moment and then yielded for an equal moment jim hooker was torn between secret jealousy of his old comrades graces and a desire to present them as familiar associations of his own but his vanity was quickly appeased  need it be said that the two women received this fleck and foam of a supercivilization they knew little of as almost an impertinence compared to the rugged gloomy pathetic and equally youthful hero of an adventurous wilderness of which they knew still less what availed the courtesy and gentle melancholy of clarence brant beside the mysterious gloom and dark savagery of red jim yet they received him patronizingly as one who was like themselves an admirer of manly grace and power and the recipient of jims friendship the farmer alone seemed to prefer clarence and yet the latters tacit indorsement of red jim through his evident previous intimacy with him impressed the man in jims favor all of which clarence saw with that sensitive perception which had given him an early insight into human weakness yet still had never shaken his youthful optimism he smiled a little thoughtfully but was openly fraternal to jim courteous to his host and family and as he rode away in the faint moonlight magnificently opulent in his largess to the farmerhis first and only assertion of his position  the farmhouse straggling barn and fringe of dusty willows the white dome of the motionless wagon with the hanging frying pans and kettles showing in the moonlight like black silhouettes against the staring canvas all presently sank behind clarence like the details of a dream and he was alone with the moon the hazy mystery of the level grassy plain and the monotony of the unending road as he rode slowly along he thought of that other dreary plain white with alkali patches and brown with rings of deserted campfires known to his boyhood of deprivation dependency danger and adventure oddly enough with a strange delight and his later years of study monastic seclusion and final ease and independence with an easy sense of wasted existence and useless waiting he remembered his homeless childhood in the south where servants and slaves took the place of the father he had never known and the mother that he rarely saw he remembered his abandonment to a mysterious female relation where his natural guardians seemed to have overlooked and forgotten him until he was sent an all too young adventurer to work his passage on an overland emigrant train across the plains he remembered as yesterday the fears the hopes the dreams and dangers of that momentous journey he recalled his little playmate susy and their strange adventuresthe whole incident that the imaginative jim hooker had translated and rehearsed as his ownrose vividly before him he thought of the cruel end of that pilgrimage which again left him homeless and forgotten by even the relative he was seeking in a strange land he remembered his solitary journey to the gold mines taken with a boys trust and a boys fearlessness and the strange protector he had found there who had news of his missing kinsman he remembered how this protectorwhom he had at once instinctively lovedtransferred him to the house of this newfound relation who treated him kindly and sent him to the jesuit school but who never awakened in him a feeling of kinship he dreamed again of his life at school his accidental meeting with susy at santa clara the keen revival of his boyish love for his old playmate now a pretty schoolgirl the petted adopted child of wealthy parents he recalled the terrible shock that interrupted this boyish episode the news of the death of his protector and the revelation that this hard silent and mysterious man was his own father whose reckless life and desperate reputation had impelled him to assume a disguise  he remembered how his sudden accession to wealth and independence had half frightened him and had always left a lurking sensitiveness that he was unfairly favored by some mere accident above his less lucky companions the rude vices of his old associates had made him impatient of the feebler sensual indulgences of the later companions of his luxury and exposed their hollow fascinations his sensitive fastidiousness kept him clean among vulgar temptations his clear perceptions were never blinded by selfish sophistry meantime his feeling for susy remained unchanged pride had kept him from seeking the peytons his present visit was as unpremeditated as peytons invitation had been unlooked for by him yet he had not allowed himself to be deceived he knew that this courtesy was probably due to the change in his fortune although he had hoped it might have been some change in their opinion brought about by susy but he would at least see her again not in the pretty halfclandestine way she had thought necessary but openly and as her equal  in his rapid ride he seemed to have suddenly penetrated the peaceful calm of the night the restless irritation of the afternoon trade winds had subsided the tender moonlight had hushed and tranquilly possessed the worried plain the unending files of wild oats far spaced and distinct stood erect and motionless as trees something of the sedate solemnity of a great forest seemed to have fallen upon their giant stalks there was no dew in that light dry air the heavier dust no longer rose beneath the heels of his horse whose flying shadow passed over the field like a cloud leaving no trail or track behind it in the preoccupation of his thought and his breathless retrospect the young man had ridden faster than he intended and he now checked his panting horse the influence of the night and the hushed landscape stole over him his thoughts took a gentler turn in that dim mysterious horizon line before him his future seemed to be dreamily peopled with airy graceful shapes that more or less took the likeness of susy she was bright coquettish romantic as he had last seen her she was older graver and thoughtfully welcome of him or she was cold distant and severely forgetful of the past how would her adopted father and mother receive him would they ever look upon him in the light of a suitor to the young girl he had no fear of peytonhe understood his own sex and young as he was knew already how to make himself respected but how could he overcome that instinctive aversion which mrs peyton had so often made him feel he had provoked yet in this dreamy hush of earth and sky what was not possible his boyish heart beat high with daring visions  he saw mrs peyton in the porch welcoming him with that maternal smile which his childish longing had so often craved to share with susy peyton would be there toopeyton who had once pushed back his torn straw hat to look approvingly in his boyish eyes and peyton perhaps might be proud of him  suddenly he started a voice in his very ear  bah a yoke of vulgar cattle grazing on lands that were thine by right and law neither more nor less than that and i tell thee pancho like cattle to be driven off or caught and branded for ones own ha there are those who could swear to the truth of this on the creed ay and bring papers stamped and signed by the governors rubric to prove it and not that i hate thembah what are those heretic swine to me but thou dost comprehend me it galls and pricks me to see them swelling themselves with stolen husks and men like thee pancho ousted from their own land  clarence had halted in utter bewilderment no one was visible before him behind him on either side the words in spanish came from the air the sky the distant horizon he knew not which was he still dreaming a strange shiver crept over his skin as if the air had grown suddenly chill then another mysterious voice arose incredulous half mocking but equally distinct and clear  caramba what is this you are wandering friend pancho you are still smarting from his tongue he has the grant confirmed by his brigand government he has the possession stolen by a thief like himself and he has the corregidors with him for is he not one of them himself this judge peyton  peyton clarence felt the blood rush back to his face in astonishment and indignation his heels mechanically pressed his horses flanks and the animal sprang forward  guarda mira said the voice again in a quicker lower tone but this time it was evidently in the field beside him and the heads and shoulders of two horsemen emerged at the same moment from the tall ranks of wild oats the mystery was solved the strangers had been making their way along a lower level of the terraced plain hidden by the grain not twenty yards away and parallel with the road they were now ascending to join their figures were alike formless in long striped serapes and their features undistinguishable under stiff black sombreros  buenas noches senor said the second voice in formal and cautious deliberation  a sudden inspiration made clarence respond in english as if he had not comprehended the strangers words eh  goodanighta repeated the stranger  oh goodnight returned clarence they passed him their spurs tinkled twice or thrice their mustangs sprang forward and the next moment the loose folds of their serapes were fluttering at their sides like wings in their flight     chapter iv   after the chill of a dewless night the morning sun was apt to look ardently upon the robles rancho if so strong an expression could describe the dry ovenlike heat of a californian coastrange valley before ten oclock the adobe wall of the patio was warm enough to permit lingering vacqueros and idle peons to lean against it and the exposed annexe was filled with sharp resinous odors from the oozing sap of unseasoned redwood boards warped and drying in the hot sunshine even at that early hour the climbing castilian roses were drooping against the wooden columns of the new veranda scarcely older than themselves and mingling an already faded spice with the aroma of baking wood and the more material fragrance of steaming coffee that seemed dominant everywhere  in fact the pretty breakfastroom whose three broad windows always open to the veranda gave an al fresco effect to every meal was a pathetic endeavor of the southernbred peyton to emulate the soft luxurious and openair indolence of his native south in a climate that was not only not tropical but even austere in its most fervid moments yet although cold draughts invaded it from the rear that morning judge peyton sat alone between the open doors and windows awaiting the slow coming of his wife and the young ladies he was not in an entirely comfortable mood that morning things were not going on well at robles that truculent vagabond pedro had the night before taken himself off with a curse that had frightened even the vacqueros who most hated him as a companion but who now seemed inclined to regard his absence as an injury done to their race peyton uneasily conscious that his own anger had been excited by an exaggerated conception of the accident was now like most obstinate men inclined to exaggerate the importance of pedros insolence he was well out of it to get rid of this quarrelsome hangeron whose presumption and illhumor threatened the discipline of the rancho yet he could not entirely forget that he had employed him on account of his family claims and from a desire to placate racial jealousy and settle local differences for the inferior mexicans and indian halfbreeds still regarded their old masters with affection were in fact more concerned for the integrity of their caste than the masters were themselves and the old spanish families who had made alliances with americans and shared their land with them had rarely succeeded in alienating their retainers with their lands certain experiences in the proving of his grant before the land commission had taught peyton that they were not to be depended upon and lately there had been unpleasant rumors of the discovery of some unlookedfor claimants to a division of the grant itself which might affect his own title  he looked up quickly as voices and light steps on the veranda at last heralded the approach of his tardy household from the corridor but in spite of his preoccupation he was startled and even awkwardly impressed with a change in susys appearance she was wearing for the first time a long skirt and this sudden maturing of her figure struck him as a man much more forcibly than it would probably have impressed a woman more familiar with details he had not noticed certain indications of womanhood as significant perhaps in her carriage as her outlines which had been lately perfectly apparent to her mother and mary but which were to him now for the first time indicated by a few inches of skirt she not only looked taller to his masculine eyes but these few inches had added to the mystery as well as the drapery of the goddess they were not so much the revelation of maturity as the suggestion that it was hidden so impressed was he that a halfserious lecture on her yesterdays childishness the outcome of his irritated reflections that morning died upon his lips he felt he was no longer dealing with a child  he welcomed them with that smile of bantering approbation supposed to keep down inordinate vanity which for some occult reason one always reserves for the members of ones own family he was quite conscious that susy was looking very pretty in this new and mature frock and that as she stood beside his wife far from ageing mrs peytons good looks and figure she appeared like an equal companion and that they mutually became one another this and the fact that they were all including mary rogers in their freshest gayest morning dresses awakened a halfhumorous halfreal apprehension in his mind that he was now hopelessly surrounded by a matured sex and in a weak minority  i think i ought to have been prepared he began grimly for this addition totothe skirts of my family  why john returned mrs peyton quickly do you mean to say you havent noticed that the poor child has for weeks been looking positively indecent  really papa ive been a sight to behold havent i mary chimed in susy  yes dear why judge ive been wondering that susy stood it so well and never complained  peyton glanced around him at this compact feminine embattlement it was as he feared yet even here he was again at fault  and said mrs peyton slowly with the reserved significance of the feminine postscript in her voice if that mr brant is coming here today it would be just as well for him to see that she is no longer a child as when he knew her  an hour later goodnatured mary rogers in her character of a dearwhich was usually indicated by the undertaking of small errands for her friendwas gathering roses from the old garden for susys adornment when she saw a vision which lingered with her for many a day she had stopped to look through the iron grille in the adobe wall across the open windswept plain miniature waves were passing over the wild oats with glittering disturbances here and there in the depressions like the sparkling of green foam the horizon line was sharply defined against the hard steelblue sky everywhere the brandnew morning was shining with almost painted brilliancy the vigor spirit and even crudeness of youth were over all the young girl was dazzled and bewildered suddenly as if blown out of the waving grain or an incarnation of the vivid morning the bright and striking figure of a youthful horseman flashed before the grille it was clarence brant mary rogers had always seen him in the loyalty of friendship with susys prepossessed eyes yet she fancied that morning that he had never looked so handsome before even the foppish fripperies of his ridingdress and silver trappings seemed as much the natural expression of conquering youth as the invincible morning sunshine perhaps it might have been a reaction against susys caprice or some latent susceptibility of her own but a momentary antagonism to her friend stirred even her kindly nature what right had susy to trifle with such an opportunity who was she to hesitate over this gallant prince  but prince charmings quick eyes had detected her and the next moment his beautiful horse was beside the grating and his ready hand of greeting extended through the bars  i suppose i am early and unexpected but i slept at santa inez last night that i might ride over in the cool of the morning my things are coming by the stagecoach later it seemed such a slow way of coming ones self  mary rogerss black eyes intimated that the way he had taken was the right one but she gallantly recovered herself and remembered her position as confidante and here was the opportunity of delivering susys warning unobserved she withdrew her hand from clarences frank grasp and passing it through the grating patted the sleek shining flanks of his horse with a discreet division of admiration  and such a lovely creature too and susy will be so delighted and oh mr brant please youre to say nothing of having met her at santa clara its just as well not to begin with that here for you see with a large maternal manner you were both so young then  clarence drew a quick breath it was the first check to his vision of independence and equal footing then his invitation was not the outcome of a continuous friendship revived by susy as he had hoped the peytons had known nothing of his meeting with her or perhaps they would not have invited him he was here as an impostorand all because susy had chosen to make a mystery of a harmless encounter which might have been explained and which they might have even countenanced he thought bitterly of his old playmate for a brief momentas brief as marys antagonism the young girl noticed the change in his face but misinterpreted it  oh theres no danger of its coming out if you dont say anything she said quickly ride on to the house and dont wait for me youll find them in the patio on the veranda  clarence moved on but not as spiritedly as before nevertheless there was still dash enough about him and the animal he bestrode to stir into admiration the few lounging vacqueros of a country which was apt to judge the status of a rider by the quality of his horse nor was the favorable impression confined to them alone peytons gratification rang out cheerily in his greeting  bravo clarence you are here in true caballero style thanks for the compliment to the rancho  for a moment the young man was transported back again to his boyhood and once more felt peytons approving hand pushing back the worn straw hat from his childish forehead a faint color rose to his cheeks his eyes momentarily dropped the highest art could have done no more the slight aggressiveness of his youthful finery and picturesque good looks was condoned at once his modesty conquered where selfassertion might have provoked opposition and even mrs peyton felt herself impelled to come forward with an outstretched hand scarcely less frank than her husbands then clarence lifted his eyes he saw before him the woman to whom his childish heart had gone out with the inscrutable longing and adoration of a motherless homeless companionless boy the woman who had absorbed the love of his playmate without sharing it with him who had showered her protecting and maternal caresses on susy a waif like himself yet had not only left his heart lonely and desolate but had even added to his childish distrust of himself the thought that he had excited her aversion he saw her more beautiful than ever in her restored health freshness of coloring and mature roundness of outline he was unconsciously touched with a mans admiration for her without losing his boyish yearnings and halffilial affection in her new materialistic womanhood his youthful imagination had lifted her to a queen and goddess there was all this appeal in his still boyish eyeseyes that had never yet known shame or fear in the expression of their emotions there was all this in the gesture with which he lifted mrs peytons fingers to his lips the little group saw in this act only a spanish courtesy in keeping with his accepted role but a thrill of surprise of embarrassment of intense gratification passed over her for he had not even looked at susy  her relenting was graceful she welcomed him with a winning smile then she motioned pleasantly towards susy  but here is an older friend mr brant whom you do not seem to recognizesusy whom you have not seen since she was a child  a quick flush rose to clarences cheek the group smiled at this evident youthful confession of some boyish admiration but clarence knew that his truthful blood was merely resenting the deceit his lips were sealed from divulging he did not dare to glance at susy it added to the general amusement that the young girl was obliged to present herself but in this interval she had exchanged glances with mary rogers who had rejoined the group and she knew she was safe she smiled with gracious condescension at clarence observed with the patronizing superiority of age and established position that he had grown but had not greatly changed and it is needless to say again filled her mothers heart with joy clarence still intoxicated with mrs peytons kindliness and perhaps still embarrassed by remorse had not time to remark the girls studied attitude he shook hands with her cordially and then in the quick reaction of youth accepted with humorous gravity the elaborate introduction to mary rogers by susy which completed this little comedy and if with a womans quickness mrs peyton detected a certain lingering glance which passed between mary rogers and clarence and misinterpreted it it was only a part of that mystification into which these youthful actors are apt to throw their mature audiences  confess ally said peyton cheerfully as the three young people suddenly found their tongues with aimless vivacity and inconsequent laughter and started with unintelligible spirits for an exploration of the garden confess now that your bete noir is really a very manly as well as a very presentable young fellow by jove the padres have made a spanish swell out of him without spoiling the brant grit either come now youre not afraid that susys style will suffer from his companionship pon my soul she might borrow a little of his courtesy to his elders without indelicacy i only wish she had as sincere a way of showing her respect for you as he has did you notice that he really didnt seem to see anybody else but you at first and yet you never were a friend to him like susy  the lady tossed her head slightly but smiled  this is the first time hes seen mary rogers isnt it she said meditatively  i reckon but whats that to do with his politeness to you  and do her parents know him she continued without replying  how do i know i suppose everybody has heard of him why  because i think theyve taken a fancy to each other  what in the name of folly allybegan the despairing peyton  when you invite a handsome rich and fascinating young man into the company of young ladies john returned mrs peyton in her severest manner you must not forget you owe a certain responsibility to the parents i shall certainly look after miss rogers     chapter v   although the three young people had left the veranda together when they reached the old garden clarence and susy found themselves considerably in advance of mary rogers who had become suddenly and deeply interested in the beauty of a passion vine near the gate at the first discovery of their isolation their voluble exchange of information about themselves and their occupations since their last meeting stopped simultaneously clarence who had forgotten his momentary irritation and had recovered his old happiness in her presence was nevertheless conscious of some other change in her than that suggested by the lengthened skirt and the later and more delicate accentuation of her prettiness it was not her affectation of superiority and older social experience for that was only the outcome of what he had found charming in her as a child and which he still goodhumoredly accepted nor was it her characteristic exaggeration of speech which he still pleasantly recognized it was something else vague and indefinitesomething that had been unnoticed while mary was with them but had now come between them like some unknown presence which had taken the confidantes place he remained silent looking at her halfbrightening cheek and conscious profile then he spoke with awkward directness  you are changed susy more than in looks  hush said the girl in a tragic whisper with a warning gesture towards the blandly unconscious mary  but returned clarence wonderingly shes yourour friend you know  i dont know said susy in a still deeper tone that isoh dont ask me but when youre always surrounded by spies when you cant say your soul is your own you doubt everybody there was such a pretty distress in her violet eyes and curving eyebrows that clarence albeit vague as to its origin and particulars nevertheless possessed himself of the little hand that was gesticulating dangerously near his own and pressed it sympathetically perhaps preoccupied with her emotions she did not immediately withdraw it as she went on rapidly and if you were cooped up here day after day behind these bars pointing to the grille youd know what i suffer  butbegan clarence  hush said susy with a stamp of her little foot  clarence who had only wished to point out that the whole lower end of the garden wall was in ruins and the grille really was no prevention hushed  and listen dont pay me much attention today but talk to her indicating the still discreet and distant mary before father and mother not a word to her of this confidence clarence tomorrow ride out alone on your beautiful horse and come back by way of the woods beyond our turning at four oclock theres a trail to the right of the big madrono tree take that be careful and keep a good lookout for she mustnt see you  who mustnt see me said the puzzled clarence  why mary of course you silly boy returned the girl impatiently shell be looking for me go now clarence stop look at that lovely big maidensblush up there pointing to a pinksuffused specimen of rose grandiflora hanging on the wall get it clarencethat oneill show you wherethere they had already plunged into the leafy bramble and standing on tiptoe with her hand on his shoulder and head upturned susys cheek had innocently approached clarences own at this moment clarence possibly through some confusion of color fragrance or softness of contact seemed to have availed himself of the opportunity in a way which caused susy to instantly rejoin mary rogers with affected dignity leaving him to follow a few moments later with the captured flower  without trying to understand the reason of tomorrows rendezvous and perhaps not altogether convinced of the reality of susys troubles he however did not find that difficulty in carrying out her other commands which he had expected mrs peyton was still gracious and with feminine tact induced him to talk of himself until she was presently in possession of his whole history barring the episode of his meeting with susy since he had parted with them he felt a strange satisfaction in familiarly pouring out his confidences to this superior woman whom he had always held in awe there was a new delight in her womanly interest in his trials and adventures and a subtle pleasure even in her halfmotherly criticism and admonition of some passages i am afraid he forgot susy who listened with the complacency of an exhibitor mary whose black eyes dilated alternately with sympathy for the performer and deprecation of mrs peytons critical glances and peyton who however seemed lost in thought and preoccupied clarence was happy the softly shaded lights in the broad spacious comfortably furnished drawingroom shone on the group before him it was a picture of refined domesticity which the homeless clarence had never known except as a vague halfpainful boyish remembrance it was a realization of welcome that far exceeded his wildest boyish vision of the preceding night with that recollection came anothera more uneasy one he remembered how that vision had been interrupted by the strange voices in the road and their vague but ominous import to his host a feeling of selfreproach came over him the threats had impressed him as only mere braggadociohe knew the characteristic exaggeration of the racebut perhaps he ought to privately tell peyton of the incident at once  the opportunity came later when the ladies had retired and peyton wrapped in a poncho in a rockingchair on the now chilly veranda looked up from his reverie and a cigar clarence casually introduced the incident as if only for the sake of describing the supernatural effect of the hidden voices but he was concerned to see that peyton was considerably disturbed by their more material import after questioning him as to the appearance of the two men his host said i dont mind telling you clarence that as far as that fellows intentions go he is quite sincere although his threats are only borrowed thunder he is a man whom i have just dismissed for carelessness and insolencetwo things that run in double harness in this countrybut i should be more afraid to find him at my back on a dark night alone on the plains than to confront him in daylight in the witness box against me he was only repeating a silly rumor that the title to this rancho and the nine square leagues beyond would be attacked by some speculators  but i thought your title was confirmed two years ago said clarence  the grant was confirmed returned peyton which means that the conveyance of the mexican government of these lands to the ancestor of victor robles was held to be legally proven by the united states land commission and a patent issued to all those who held under it i and my neighbors hold under it by purchase from victor robles subject to the confirmation of the land commission but that confirmation was only of victors greatgrandfathers title and it is now alleged that as victors father died without making a will victor has claimed and disposed of property which he ought to have divided with his sisters at least some speculating rascals in san francisco have set up what they call the sisters title and are selling it to actual settlers on the unoccupied lands beyond as by the law it would hold possession against the mere ordinary squatters whose only right is based as you know on the presumption that there is no title claimed it gives the possessor immunity to enjoy the use of the property until the case is decided and even should the original title hold good against his the successful litigant would probably be willing to pay for improvements and possession to save the expensive and tedious process of ejectment  but this does not affect you who have already possession said clarence quickly  no not as far as this house and the lands i actually occupy and cultivate are concerned and they know that i am safe to fight to the last and carry the case to the supreme court in that case until the swindle is exposed or they drop it but i may have to pay them something to keep the squatters off my unoccupied land  but you surely wouldnt recognize those rascals in any way said the astonished clarence  as against other rascals why not returned peyton grimly i only pay for the possession which their sham title gives me to my own land if by accident that title obtains i am still on the safe side after a pause he said more gravely what you overheard clarence shows me that the plan is more forward than i had imagined and that i may have to fight traitors here  i hope sir said clarence with a quick glow in his earnest face that youll let me help you you thought i did once you rememberwith the indians  there was so much of the old clarence in his boyish appeal and eager questioning face that peyton who had been talking to him as a younger but equal man of affairs was startled into a smile you did clarence though the indians butchered your friends after all i dont know though but that your experiences with those spaniardsyou must have known a lot of them when you were with don juan robinson and at the collegemight be of service in getting at evidence or smashing their witnesses if it comes to a fight but just now money is everything they must be bought off the land if i have to mortgage it for the purpose that strikes you as a rather heroic remedy clarence eh he continued in his old halfbantering attitude towards clarences inexperienced youth dont it  but clarence was not thinking of that another more audacious but equally youthful and enthusiastic idea had taken possession of his mind and he lay awake half that night revolving it it was true that it was somewhat impractically mixed with his visions of mrs peyton and susy and even included his previous scheme of relief for the improvident and incorrigible hooker but it gave a wonderful sincerity and happiness to his slumbers that night which the wiser and elder peyton might have envied and i wot not was in the long run as correct and sagacious as peytons sleepless cogitations and in the early morning mr clarence brant the young capitalist sat down to his travelingdesk and wrote two clearheaded logical and practical business lettersone to his banker and the other to his former guardian don juan robinson as his first step in a resolve that was nevertheless perhaps as wildly quixotic and enthusiastic as any dream his boyish and unselfish heart had ever indulged  at breakfast in the charmed freedom of the domestic circle clarence forgot susys capricious commands of yesterday and began to address himself to her in his old earnest fashion until he was warned by a significant knitting of the young ladys brows and monosyllabic responses but in his youthful loyalty to mrs peyton he was more pained to notice susys occasional unconscious indifference to her adopted mothers affectionate expression and a more conscious disregard of her wishes so uneasy did he become in his sensitive concern for mrs peytons halfconcealed mortification that he gladly accepted peytons offer to go with him to visit the farm and corral as the afternoon approached with another twinge of selfreproach he was obliged to invent some excuse to decline certain hospitable plans of mrs peytons for his entertainment and at half past three stole somewhat guiltily with his horse from the stables but he had to pass before the outer wall of the garden and grille through which he had seen mary the day before raising his eyes mechanically he was startled to see mrs peyton standing behind the grating with her abstracted gaze fixed upon the windtossed level grain beyond her she smiled as she saw him but there were traces of tears in her proud handsome eyes  you are going to ride she said pleasantly  yees stammered the shamefaced clarence  she glanced at him wistfully  you are right the girls have gone away by themselves mr peyton has ridden over to santa inez on this dreadful land business and i suppose youd have found him a dull riding companion it is rather stupid here i quite envy you mr brant your horse and your freedom  but mrs peyton broke in clarence impulsively you have a horsei saw it a lovely ladys horseeating its head off in the stable wont you let me run back and order it and wont you please come out with me for a good long gallop  he meant what he said he had spoken quickly impulsively but with the perfect understanding in his own mind that his proposition meant the complete abandonment of his rendezvous with susy mrs peyton was astounded and slightly stirred with his earnestness albeit unaware of all it implied  its a great temptation mr brant she said with a playful smile which dazzled clarence with its first faint suggestion of a refined womans coquetry but im afraid that mr peyton would think me going mad in my old age no go on and enjoy your gallop and if you should see those giddy girls anywhere send them home early for chocolate before the cold wind gets up  she turned waved her slim white hand playfully in acknowledgment of clarences bared head and moved away  for the first few moments the young man tried to find relief in furious riding and in bullying his spirited horse then he pulled quickly up what was he doing what was he going to do what foolish vapid deceit was this that he was going to practice upon that noble queenly confiding generous woman he had already forgotten that she had always distrusted him what a fool he was not to tell her halfjokingly that he expected to meet susy but would he have dared to talk halfjokingly to such a woman on such a topic and would it have been honorable without disclosing the whole truththat they had met secretly before and was it fair to susydear innocent childish susy yet something must be done it was such trivial purposeless deceit after all for this noble woman mrs peyton so kind so gentle would never object to his loving susy and marrying her and they would all live happily together and mrs peyton would never be separated from them but always beaming tenderly upon them as she did just now in the garden yes he would have a serious understanding with susy and that would excuse the clandestine meeting today  his rapid pace meantime had brought him to the imperceptible incline of the terrace and he was astonished in turning in the saddle to find that the casa corral and outbuildings had completely vanished and that behind him rolled only the long sea of grain which seemed to have swallowed them in its yellowing depths before him lay the wooded ravine through which the stagecoach passed which was also the entrance to the rancho and there too probably was the turning of which susy had spoken but it was still early for the rendezvous indeed he was in no hurry to meet her in his present discontented state and he made a listless circuit of the field in the hope of discovering the phenomena that had caused the ranchos mysterious disappearance when he had found that it was the effect of the different levels his attention was arrested by a multitude of moving objects in a still more distant field which proved to be a band of wild horses in and out among them circling aimlessly as it seemed to him appeared two horsemen apparently performing some mystic evolution to add to their singular performance from time to time one of the flying herd driven by the horsemen far beyond the circle of its companions dropped suddenly and unaccountably in full career the field closed over it as if it had been swallowed up in a few moments it appeared again trotting peacefully behind its former pursuer it was some time before clarence grasped the meaning of this strange spectacle although the clear dry atmosphere sharply accented the silhouettelike outlines of the men and horses so great was the distance that the slender fortyfoot lasso which in the skillful hands of the horsemen had effected these captures was completely invisible the horsemen were peytons vacqueros making a selection from the young horses for the market he remembered now that peyton had told him that he might be obliged to raise money by sacrificing some of his stock and the thought brought back clarences uneasiness as he turned again to the trail indeed he was hardly in the vein for a gentle tryst as he entered the wooded ravine to seek the madrono tree which was to serve as a guide to his ladys bower  a few rods further under the cool vault filled with woodland spicing he came upon it in its summer harlequin dress of scarlet and green with hanging bells of polytinted berries like some personified sylvan folly it seemed a fitting symbol of susys childish masquerade of passion its bizarre beauty so opposed to the sober gravity of the sedate pines and hemlocks made it an unmistakable landmark here he dismounted and picketed his horse and here beside it to the right ran the little trail crawling over mossy boulders a narrow yellow track through the carpet of pine needles between the closest file of trees an almost imperceptible streak across pools of chickweed at their roots and a brown and ragged swath through the ferns as he went on the anxiety and uneasiness that had possessed him gave way to a languid intoxication of the senses the mysterious seclusion of these woodland depths recovered the old influence they had exerted over his boyhood he was not returning to susy as much as to the older love of his youth of which she was perhaps only an incident it was therefore with an odd boyish thrill again that coming suddenly upon a little hollow like a deserted nest where the lost trail made him hesitate he heard the crackle of a starched skirt behind him was conscious of the subtle odor of freshly ironed and scented muslin and felt the gentle pressure of delicate fingers upon his eyes  susy  you silly boy where were you blundering to why didnt you look around you  i thought i would hear your voices  whose voices idiot  yours and marys returned clarence innocently looking round for the confidante  oh indeed then you wanted to see mary well shes looking for me somewhere perhaps youll go and find her or shall i  she was offering to pass him when he laid his hand on hers to detain her she instantly evaded it and drew herself up to her full height incontestably displaying the dignity of the added inches to her skirt all this was charmingly like the old susy but it did not bid fair to help him to a serious interview and looking at the pretty pink mocking face before him with the witchery of the woodland still upon him he began to think that he had better put it off  never mind about mary he said laughingly but you said you wanted to see me susy and here i am  said i wanted to see you repeated susy with her blue eyes lifted in celestial scorn and wonderment said i wanted to see you are you not mistaken mr brant really i imagined that you came here to see me  with her fair head upturned and the leaf of her scarlet lip temptingly curled over clarence began to think this latest phase of her extravagance the most fascinating he drew nearer to her as he said gently you know what i mean susy you said yesterday you were troubled i thought you might have something to tell me  i should think it was you who might have something to tell me after all these years she said poutingly yet selfpossessed but i suppose you came here only to see mary and mother im sure you let them know that plainly enough last evening  but you saidbegan the stupefied clarence  never mind what i said its always what i say never what you say and you dont say anything  the woodland influence must have been still very strong upon clarence that he did not discover in all this that while susys general capriciousness was unchanged there was a new and singular insincerity in her manifest acting she was either concealing the existence of some other real emotion or assuming one that was absent but he did not notice it and only replied tenderly  but i want to say a great deal to you susy i want to say that if you still feel as i do and as i have always felt and you think you could be happy as i would be ififwe could be always together we need not conceal it from your mother and father any longer i am old enough to speak for myself and i am my own master your mother has been very kind to meso kind that it doesnt seem quite right to deceive herand when i tell her that i love you and that i want you to be my wife i believe she will give us her blessing  susy uttered a strange little laugh and with an assumption of coyness that was however still affected stooped to pick a few berries from a manzanita bush  ill tell you what shell say clarence shell say youre frightfully young and so you are  the young fellow tried to echo the laugh but felt as if he had received a blow for the first time he was conscious of the truth this girl whom he had fondly regarded as a child had already passed him in the race she had become a woman before he was yet a man and now stood before him maturer in her knowledge and older in her understanding of herself and of him this was the change that had perplexed him this was the presence that had come between thema susy he had never known before  she laughed at his changed expression and then swung herself easily to a sitting posture on the low projecting branch of a hemlock the act was still girlish but nevertheless she looked down upon him in a superior patronizing way now clarence she said with a halfabstracted manner dont you be a big fool if you talk that way to mother shell only tell you to wait two or three years until you know your own mind and shell pack me off to that horrid school again besides watching me like a cat every moment you are here if you want to stay here and see me sometimes like this youll just behave as you have done and say nothing do you see perhaps you dont care to come or are satisfied with mary and mother say so then goodness knows i dont want to force you to come here  modest and reserved as clarence was generally i fear that bashfulness of approach to the other sex was not one of these indications he walked up to susy with appalling directness and passed his arm around her waist she did not move but remained looking at him and his intruding arm with a certain critical curiosity as if awaiting some novel sensation at which he kissed her she then slowly disengaged his arm and said  really upon my word clarence in perfectly level tones and slipped quietly to the ground  he again caught her in his arms encircling her disarranged hair and part of the beribboned hat hanging over her shoulder and remained for an instant holding her thus silently and tenderly then she freed herself with an abstracted air a half smile and an unchanged color except where her soft cheek had been abraded by his coat collar  youre a bold rude boy clarence she said putting back her hair quietly and straightening the brim of her hat heaven knows where you learned manners and then from a safer distance with the same critical look in her violet eyes i suppose you think mother would allow that if she knew it  but clarence now completely subjugated with the memory of the kiss upon him and a heightened color protested that he only wanted to make their intercourse less constrained and to have their relations even their engagement recognized by her parents still he would take her advice only there was always the danger that if they were discovered she would be sent back to the convent all the same and his banishment instead of being the probation of a few years would be a perpetual separation  we could always run away clarence responded the young girl calmly theres nothing the matter with that  clarence was startled the idea of desolating the sad proud handsome mrs peyton whom he worshiped and her kind husband whom he was just about to serve was so grotesque and confusing that he said hopelessly yes  of course she continued with the same odd affectation of coyness which was however distinctly uncalled for as she eyed him from under her broad hat you neednt come with me unless you like i can run away by myselfif i want to ive thought of it before one cant stand everything  but susy said clarence with a swift remorseful recollection of her confidence yesterday is there really anything troubles you tell me dear what is it  oh nothingeverything its no useyou cant understand you like it i know you do i can see it its your style but its stupid its awful clarence with mamma snooping over you and around you all day with her dear child mammas pet and what is it dear and tell it all to your own mamma as if i would and my own mamma indeed as if i didnt know clarence that she isnt and papa caring for nothing but this hideous dreary rancho and the huge empty plains its worse than school for there at least when you went out you could see something besides cattle and horses and yellowfaced halfbreeds but herelord its only a wonder i havent run away before  startled and shocked as clarence was at this revelation accompanied as it was by a hardness of manner that was new to him the influence of the young girl was still so strong upon him that he tried to evade it as only an extravagance and said with a faint smile but where would you run to  she looked at him cunningly with her head on one side and then said  i have friends and  she hesitated pursing up her pretty lips  and what  relations  relations  yesan aunt by marriage she lives in sacramento shed be overjoyed to have me come to her her second husband has a theatre there  but susy what does mrs peyton know of this  nothing do you think id tell her and have her buy them up as she has my other relations do you suppose i dont know that ive been bought up like a nigger  she looked indignant compressing her delicate little nostrils and yet somehow clarence had the same singular impression that she was only acting  the calling of a faroff voice came faintly through the wood  thats mary looking for me said susy composedly you must go now clarence quick remember what i saidand dont breathe a word of this goodby  but clarence was standing still breathless hopelessly disturbed and irresolute then he turned away mechanically towards the trail  well clarence  she was looking at him half reproachfully half coquettishly with smiling parted lips he hastened to forget himself and his troubles upon them twice and thrice then she quickly disengaged herself whispered go now and as marys call was repeated clarence heard her voice high and clear answering here dear as he was plunging into the thicket  he had scarcely reached the madrono tree again and remounted his horse before he heard the sound of hoofs approaching from the road in his present uneasiness he did not care to be discovered so near the rendezvous and drew back into the shadow until the horseman should pass it was peyton with a somewhat disturbed face riding rapidly still less was he inclined to join or immediately follow him but he was relieved when his host instead of taking the direct road to the rancho through the wild oats turned off in the direction of the corral  a moment later clarence wheeled into the direct road and presently found himself in the long afternoon shadows through the thickest of the grain he was riding slowly immersed in thought when he was suddenly startled by a hissing noise at his ear and what seemed to be the uncoiling stroke of a leaping serpent at his side instinctively he threw himself forward on his horses neck and as the animal shied into the grain felt the crawling scrape and jerk of a horsehair lariat across his back and down his horses flanks he reined in indignantly and stood up in his stirrups nothing was to be seen above the level of the grain beneath him the trailing riata had as noiselessly vanished as if it had been indeed a gliding snake had he been the victim of a practical joke or of the blunder of some stupid vacquero for he made no doubt that it was the lasso of one of the performers he had watched that afternoon but his preoccupied mind did not dwell long upon it and by the time he had reached the wall of the old garden the incident was forgotten     chapter vi   relieved of clarence brants embarrassing presence jim hooker did not however refuse to avail himself of that opportunity to expound to the farmer and his family the immense wealth influence and importance of the friend who had just left him although clarences plan had suggested reticence hooker could not forego the pleasure of informing them that clar brant had just offered to let him into an extensive land speculation he had previously declined a large share or original location in a mine of clarences now worth a million because it was not his style but the land speculation in a country of unsettled titles and lawless men he need not remind them required some experience of border warfare he would not say positively although he left them to draw their own conclusions with gloomy significance that this was why clarence had sought him with this dark suggestion he took leave of mr and mrs hopkins and their daughter phoebe the next day not without some natural human emotion and peacefully drove his team and wagon into the settlement of fair plains  he was not prepared however for a sudden realization of his imaginative prospects a few days after his arrival in fair plains he received a letter from clarence explaining that he had not time to return to hooker to consult him but had nevertheless fulfilled his promise by taking advantage of an opportunity of purchasing the spanish sisters title to certain unoccupied lands near the settlement as these lands in part joined the section already preempted and occupied by hopkins clarence thought that jim hooker would choose that part for the sake of his neighbors company he inclosed a draft on san francisco for a sum sufficient to enable jim to put up a cabin and stock the property which he begged he would consider in the light of a loan to be paid back in installments only when the property could afford it at the same time if jim was in difficulty he was to inform him the letter closed with a characteristic clarencelike mingling of enthusiasm and older wisdom i wish you luck jim but i see no reason why you should trust to it i dont know of anything that could keep you from making yourself independent of any one if you go to work with a long aim and dont fritter away your chances on short ones if i were you old fellow id drop the plains and the indians out of my thoughts or at least out of my talk for a while they wont help you in the long run the people who believe you will be jealous of you those who dont will look down upon you and if they get to questioning your little indian romances jim theyll be apt to question your civilized facts that wont help you in the ranching business and thats your only real grip now for the space of two or three hours after this jim was reasonably grateful and even subduedso much so that his employer to whom he confided his good fortune frankly confessed that he believed him from that unusual fact alone unfortunately neither the practical lesson conveyed in this grim admission nor the sentiment of gratitude remained long with jim another idea had taken possession of his fancy although the land nominated in his bill of sale had been except on the occasion of his own temporary halt there always unoccupied unsought and unclaimed and although he was amply protected by legal certificates he gravely collected a posse of three or four idlers from fair plains armed them at his own expense and in the dead of night took belligerent and forcible possession of the peaceful domain which the weak generosity and unheroic dollars of clarence had purchased for him a martial campfire tempered the chill night winds to the pulses of the invaders and enabled them to sleep on their arms in the field they had won the morning sun revealed to the astonished hopkins family the embattled plain beyond with its armed sentries only then did jim hooker condescend to explain the reason of his warlike occupation with dark hints of the outlying squatters and jumpers whose incursions their boldness alone had repulsed the effect of this romantic situation upon the two women with the slight fascination of danger imported into their quiet lives may well be imagined possibly owing to some incautious questioning by mr hopkins and some doubts of the discipline and sincerity of his posse jim discharged them the next day but during the erection of his cabin by some peaceful carpenters from the settlement he returned to his gloomy preoccupation and the ostentatious wearing of his revolvers as an opulent and powerful neighbor he took his meals with the family while his house was being built and generally impressed them with a sense of security they had never missed  meantime clarence duly informed of the installation of jim as his tenant underwent a severe trial it was necessary for his plans that this should be kept a secret at present and this was no easy thing for his habitually frank and open nature he had once mentioned that he had met jim at the settlement but the information was received with such indifference by susy and such marked disfavor by mrs peyton that he said no more he accompanied peyton in his rides around the rancho fully possessed himself of the details of its boundaries the debatable lands held by the enemy and listened with beating pulses but a hushed tongue to his hosts illconcealed misgivings  you see clarence that lower terrace he said pointing to a farreaching longitudinal plain beyond the corral it extends from my corral to fair plains that is claimed by the sisters title and as things appear to be going if a division of the land is made it will be theirs its bad enough to have this best grazing land lying just on the flanks of the corral held by these rascals at an absurd prohibitory price but i am afraid that it may be made to mean something even worse according to the old surveys these terraces on different levels were the natural divisions of the propertyone heir or his tenant taking one and another taking anotheran easy distinction that saved the necessity of boundary fencing or monuments and gave no trouble to people who were either kinsmen or lived in lazy patriarchal concord that is the form of division they are trying to reestablish now well he continued suddenly lifting his eyes to the young mans flushed face in some unconscious sympathetic response to his earnest breathlessness although my boundary line extends half a mile into that field my house and garden and corral are actually upon that terrace or level they certainly appeared to clarence to be on the same line as the long field beyond if went on peyton such a decision is made these men will push on and claim the house and everything on the terrace  but said clarence quickly you said their title was only valuable where they have got or can give possession you already have yours they cant take it from you except by force  no said peyton grimly nor will they dare to do it as long as i live to fight them  but persisted clarence with the same singular hesitancy of manner why didnt you purchase possession of at least that part of the land which lies so dangerously near your own house  because it was held by squatters who naturally preferred buying what might prove a legal title to their land from these impostors than to sell out their possession to me at a fair price  but couldnt you have bought from them both continued clarence  my dear clarence i am not a croesus nor a fool only a man who was both would attempt to treat with these rascals who would now of course insist that their whole claim should be bought up at their own price by the man who was most concerned in defeating them  he turned away a little impatiently fortunately he did not observe that clarences averted face was crimson with embarrassment and that a faint smile hovered nervously about his mouth  since his late rendezvous with susy clarence had had no chance to interrogate her further regarding her mysterious relative that that shadowy presence was more or less exaggerated if not an absolute myth he more than half suspected but of the discontent that had produced it or the recklessness it might provoke there was no doubt she might be tempted to some act of folly he wondered if mary rogers knew it yet with his sensitive ideas of loyalty he would have shrunk from any confidence with mary regarding her friends secrets although he fancied that marys dark eyes sometimes dwelt upon him with mournful consciousness and premonition he did not imagine the truth that this romantic contemplation was only the result of marys conviction that susy was utterly unworthy of his love it so chanced one morning that the vacquero who brought the post from santa inez arrived earlier than usual and so anticipated the two girls who usually made a youthful point of meeting him first as he passed the garden wall the letter bag was consequently delivered to mrs peyton in the presence of the others and a look of consternation passed between the young girls but mary quickly seized upon the bag as if with girlish and mischievous impatience opened it and glanced within it  there are only three letters for you she said handing them to clarence with a quick look of significance which he failed to comprehend and nothing for me or susy  but began the innocent clarence as his first glance at the letters showed him that one was directed to susy here is  a wicked pinch on his arm that was nearest mary stopped his speech and he quickly put the letters in his pocket  didnt you understand that susy dont want her mother to see that letter asked mary impatiently when they were alone a moment later  no said clarence simply handing her the missive  mary took it and turned it over in her hands  its in a mans handwriting she said innocently  i hadnt noticed it returned clarence with invincible naivete but perhaps it is  and you hand it over for me to give to susy and aint a bit curious to know who its from  no returned clarence opening his big eyes in smiling and apologetic wonder  well responded the young lady with a long breath of melancholy astonishment certainly of all things you areyou really are with which incoherencyapparently perfectly intelligible to herselfshe left him she had not herself the slightest idea who the letter was from she only knew that susy wanted it concealed  the incident made little impression on clarence except as part of the general uneasiness he felt in regard to his old playmate it seemed so odd to him that this worry should come from herthat she herself should form the one discordant note in the arcadian dream that he had found so sweet in his previous imaginings it was the presence of mrs peyton which he had dreaded she whose propinquity now seemed so full of gentleness reassurance and repose how worthy she seemed of any sacrifice he could make for her he had seen little of her for the last two or three days although her smile and greeting were always ready for him poor clarence did not dream that she had found from certain incontestable signs and tokens both in the young ladies and himself that he did not require watching and that becoming more resigned to susys indifference which seemed so general and passive in quality she was no longer tortured by the sting of jealousy  finding himself alone that afternoon the young man had wandered somewhat listlessly beyond the low adobe gateway the habits of the siesta obtained in a modified form at the rancho after luncheon its masters and employees usually retired not so much from the torrid heat of the afternoon sun but from the first harrying of the afternoon trades whose monotonous whistle swept round the walls a straggling passion vine near the gate beat and struggled against the wind clarence had stopped near it and was gazing with worried abstraction across the tossing fields when a soft voice called his name  it was a pleasant voicemrs peytons he glanced back at the gateway it was empty he looked quickly to the right and left no one was there  the voice spoke again with the musical addition of a laugh it seemed to come from the passion vine ah yes behind it and half overgrown by its branches was a long narrow embrasured opening in the wall defended by the usual spanish grating and still further back as in the frame of a picture the half length figure of mrs peyton very handsome and striking too with a painted picturesqueness from the effect of the checkered light and shade  you looked so tired and bored out there she said i am afraid you are finding it very dull at the rancho the prospect is certainly not very enlivening from where you stand  clarence protested with a visible pleasure in his eyes as he held back a spray before the opening  if you are not afraid of being worse bored come in here and talk with me you have never seen this part of the house i thinkmy own sittingroom you reach it from the hall in the gallery but lola or anita will show you the way  he reentered the gateway and quickly found the halla narrow arched passage whose black tunnellike shadows were absolutely unaffected by the vivid colorless glare of the courtyard without seen through an opening at the end the contrast was sharp blinding and distinct even the edges of the opening were black the outer light halted on the threshold and never penetrated within the warm odor of verbena and dried rose leaves stole from a halfopen door somewhere in the cloistered gloom guided by it clarence presently found himself on the threshold of a lowvaulted room two other narrow embrasured windows like the one he had just seen and a fourth wider latticed casement hung with gauze curtains suffused the apartment with a clear yet mysterious twilight that seemed its own the gloomy walls were warmed by brightfringed bookshelves topped with trifles of light feminine coloring and adornment low easychairs and a lounge small fanciful tables a dainty desk gayly colored baskets of worsteds or mysterious kaleidoscopic fragments and vases of flowers pervaded the apartment with a mingled sense of grace and comfort there was a womanly refinement in its careless negligence and even the delicate wrapper of japanese silk gathered at the waist and falling in easy folds to the feet of the graceful mistress of this charming disorder looked a part of its refined abandonment  clarence hesitated as on the threshold of some sacred shrine but mrs peyton with her own hands cleared a space for him on the lounge  you will easily suspect from all this disorder mr brant that i spend a greater part of my time here and that i seldom see much company mr peyton occasionally comes in long enough to stumble over a footstool or upset a vase and i think mary and susy avoid it from a firm conviction that there is work concealed in these baskets but i have my books here and in the afternoons behind these thick walls one forgets the incessant stir and restlessness of the dreadful winds outside just now you were foolish enough to tempt them while you were nervous or worried or listless take my word for it its a great mistake there is no more use fighting them as i tell mr peyton than of fighting the people born under them i have my own opinion that these winds were sent only to stir this lazy race of mongrels into activity but they are enough to drive us anglosaxons into nervous frenzy dont you think so but you are young and energetic and perhaps you are not affected by them  she spoke pleasantly and playfully yet with a certain nervous tension of voice and manner that seemed to illustrate her theory at least clarence in quick sympathy with her slightest emotion was touched by it there is no more insidious attraction in the persons we admire than the belief that we know and understand their unhappiness and that our admiration for them is lifted higher than a mere mutual instinctive sympathy with beauty or strength this adorable woman had suffered the very thought aroused his chivalry it loosened also i fear his quick impulsive tongue  oh yes he knew it he had lived under this whip of air and sky for three years alone in a spanish rancho with only the native peons around him and scarcely speaking his own tongue even to his guardian he spent his mornings on horseback in fields like these until the vientos generales as they called them sprang up and drove him nearly frantic and his only relief was to bury himself among the books in his guardians library and shut out the worldjust as she did the smile which hovered around the ladys mouth at that moment arrested clarence with a quick remembrance of their former relative positions and a sudden conviction of his familiarity in suggesting an equality of experience and he blushed but mrs peyton diverted his embarrassment with an air of interested absorption in his story and said  then you know these people thoroughly mr brant i am afraid that we do not  clarence had already gathered that fact within the last few days and with his usual impulsive directness said so a slight knitting of mrs peytons brows passed off however as he quickly and earnestly went on to say that it was impossible for the peytons in their present relations to the natives to judge them or to be judged by them fairly how they were a childlike race credulous and trustful but like all credulous and trustful people given to retaliate when imposed upon with a larger insincerity exaggeration and treachery how they had seen their houses and lands occupied by strangers their religion scorned their customs derided their patriarchal society invaded by hollow civilization or frontier brutalityall this fortified by incident and illustration the outcome of some youthful experience and given with the glowing enthusiasm of conviction mrs peyton listened with the usual divided feminine interest between subject and speaker  where did this rough sullen boyas she had known himpick up this delicate and swift perception this reflective judgment and this odd felicity of expression it was not possible that it was in him while he was the companion of her husbands servants or the recognized chum of the scamp hooker no but if he could have changed like this why not susy mrs peyton in the conservatism of her sex had never been quite free from fears of her adopted daughters hereditary instincts but with this example before her she now took heart perhaps the change was coming slowly perhaps even now what she thought was indifference and coldness was only some abnormal preparation or condition but she only smiled and said  then if you think those people have been wronged you are not on our side mr brant  what to an older and more worldly man would have seemed and probably was only a playful reproach struck clarence deeply and brought his pentup feelings to his lips  you have never wronged them you couldnt do it it isnt in your nature i am on your side and for you and yours always mrs peyton from the first time i saw you on the plains when i was brought a ragged boy before you by your husband i think i would gladly have laid down my life for you i dont mind telling you now that i was even jealous of poor susy so anxious was i for the smallest share in your thoughts if only for a moment you could have done anything with me you wished and i should have been happyfar happier than i have been ever since i tell you this mrs peyton now because you have just doubted if i might be on your side but i have been longing to tell it all to you before and it is that i am ready to do anything you wantall you wantto be on your side and at your side now and forever  he was so earnest and hearty and above all so appallingly and blissfully happy in this relief of his feelings smiling as if it were the most natural thing in the world and so absurdly unconscious of his twentytwo years his little brown curling mustache the fire in his wistful yearning eyes and above all of his clasped hands and loverlike attitude that mrs peytonat first rigid as stone then suffused to the eyescast a hasty glance round the apartment put her handkerchief to her face and laughed like a girl  at which clarence by no means discomposed but rather accepting her emotion as perfectly natural joined her heartily and added  its so mrs peyton im glad i told you you dont mind it do you  but mrs peyton had resumed her gravity and perhaps a touch of her previous misgivings  i should certainly be very sorry she said looking at him critically to object to your sharing your old friendship for your little playmate with her parents and guardians or to your expressing it to them as frankly as to her  she saw the quick change in his mobile face and the momentary arrest of its happy expression she was frightened and yet puzzled it was not the sensitiveness of a lover at the mention of the loved ones name and yet it suggested an uneasy consciousness if his previous impulsive outburst had been prompted honestly or even artfully by his passion for susy why had he looked so shocked when she spoke of her  but clarence whose emotion had been caused by the sudden recall of his knowledge of susys own disloyalty to the woman whose searching eyes were upon him in his revulsion against the deceit was for an instant upon the point of divulging all perhaps if mrs peyton had shown more confidence he would have done so and materially altered the evolution of this story but happily it is upon these slight human weaknesses that your romancer depends and clarence with no other reason than the instinctive sympathy of youth with youth in its opposition to wisdom and experience let the opportunity pass and took the responsibility of it out of the hands of this chronicler  howbeit to cover his confusion he seized upon the second idea that was in his mind and stammered susy yes i wanted to speak to you about her mrs peyton held her breath but the young man went on although hesitatingly with evident sincerity have you heard from any of her relations sincesinceyou adopted her  it seemed a natural enough question although not the sequitur she had expected no she said carelessly it was well understood after the nearest relationan aunt by marriagehad signed her consent to susys adoption that there should be no further intercourse with the family there seemed to us no necessity for reopening the past and susy herself expressed no desire she stopped and again fixing her handsome eyes on clarence said do you know any of them  but clarence by this time had recovered himself and was able to answer carelessly and truthfully that he did not mrs peyton still regarding him closely added somewhat deliberately it matters little now what relations she has mr peyton and i have complete legal control over her until she is of age and we can easily protect her from any folly of her own or others or from any of the foolish fancies that sometimes overtake girls of her age and inexperience  to her utter surprise however clarence uttered a faint sigh of relief and his face again recovered its expression of boyish happiness im glad of it mrs peyton he said heartily no one could understand better what is for her interest in all things than yourself not he said with hasty and equally hearty loyalty to his old playmate that i think she would ever go against your wishes or do anything that she knows to be wrong but she is very young and innocentas much of a child as ever dont you think so mrs peyton  it was amusing yet nevertheless puzzling to hear this boyish young man comment upon susys girlishness and clarence was serious for he had quite forgotten in mrs peytons presence the impression of superiority which susy had lately made upon him but mrs peyton returned to the charge or rather to an attack upon what she conceived to be clarences old position  i suppose she does seem girlish compared to mary rogers who is a much more reserved and quiet nature but mary is very charming mr brant and i am really delighted to have her here with susy she has such lovely dark eyes and such good manners she has been well brought up and it is easy to see that her friends are superior people i must write to them to thank them for her visit and beg them to let her stay longer i think you said you didnt know them  but clarence whose eyes had been thoughtfully and admiringly wandering over every characteristic detail of the charming apartment here raised them to its handsome mistress with an apologetic air and a no of such unaffected and complete abstraction that she was again dumbfounded certainly it could not be mary in whom he was interested  abandoning any further inquisition for the present she let the talk naturally fall upon the books scattered about the tables the young man knew them all far better than she did with a cognate knowledge of others of which she had never heard she found herself in the attitude of receiving information from this boy whose boyishness however seemed to have evaporated whose tone had changed with the subject and who now spoke with the conscious reserve of knowledge decidedly she must have grown rusty in her seclusion this came she thought bitterly of living alone of her husbands preoccupation with the property of susys frivolous caprices at the end of eight years to be outstripped by a former cattleboy of her husbands and to have her french corrected in a matter of fact way by this recent pupil of the priests was really too bad perhaps he even looked down upon susy she smiled dangerously but suavely  you must have worked so hard to educate yourself from nothing mr brant you couldnt read i think when you first came to us no could you really i know it has been very difficult for susy to get on with her studies in proportion we had so much to first eradicate in the way of manners style and habits of thought which the poor child had picked up from her companions and for which she was not responsible of course with a boy that does not signify she added with feline gentleness  but the barbed speech glanced from the young mans smoothly smiling abstraction  ah yes but those were happy days mrs peyton he answered with an exasperating return of his previous boyish enthusiasm perhaps because of our ignorance i dont think that susy and i are any happier for knowing that the plains are not as flat as we believed they were and that the sun doesnt have to burn a hole in them every night when it sets but i know i believed that you knew everything when i once saw you smiling over a book in your hand i thought it must be a different one from any that i had ever seen and perhaps made expressly for you i can see you there still do you know quite confidentially that you reminded meof course you were much youngerof what i remembered of my mother  but mrs peytons reply of ah indeed albeit polite indicated some coldness and lack of animation clarence rose quickly but cast a long and lingering look around him  you will come again mr brant said the lady more graciously if you are going to ride now perhaps you would try to meet mr peyton he is late already and i am always uneasy when he is out aloneparticularly on one of those halfbroken horses which they consider good enough for riding here you have ridden them before and understand them but i am afraid thats another thing we have got to learn  when the young man found himself again confronting the glittering light of the courtyard he remembered the interview and the soft twilight of the boudoir only as part of a pleasant dream there was a rude awakening in the fierce wind which had increased with the lengthening shadows it seemed to sweep away the halfsensuous comfort that had pervaded him and made him coldly realize that he had done nothing to solve the difficulties of his relations to susy he had lost the one chance of confiding to mrs peytonif he had ever really intended to do so it was impossible for him to do it hereafter without a confession of prolonged deceit  he reached the stables impatiently where his attention was attracted by the sound of excited voices in the corral looking within he was concerned to see that one of the vacqueros was holding the dragging bridle of a blown dusty and foamcovered horse around whom a dozen idlers were gathered even beneath its coating of dust and foam and the halfdisplaced saddle blanket clarence immediately recognized the spirited pinto mustang which peyton had ridden that morning  whats the matter said clarence from the gateway  the men fell apart glancing at each other one said quickly in spanish  say nothing to him it is an affair of the house  but this brought clarence down like a bombshell among them not to be overlooked in his equal command of their tongue and of them ah come now what drunken piggishness is this speak  the padron has beenperhapsthrown stammered the first speaker his horse arrivesbut he does not we go to inform the senora  no you dont mules and imbeciles do you want to frighten her to death mount every one of you and follow me  the men hesitated but for only a moment clarence had a fine assortment of spanish epithets expletives and objurgations gathered in his rodeo experience at el refugio and laid them about him with such fervor and discrimination that two or three mules presumably with guilty consciences mistaking their direction actually cowered against the stockade of the corral in fear in another moment the vacqueros had hastily mounted and with clarence at their head were dashing down the road towards santa inez here he spread them in open order in the grain on either side of the track himself taking the road  they did not proceed very far for when they had reached the gradual slope which marked the decline to the second terrace clarence obeying an instinct as irresistible as it was unaccountable which for the last few moments had been forcing itself upon him ordered a halt the casa and corral had already sunk in the plain behind them it was the spot where the lasso had been thrown at him a few evenings before bidding the men converge slowly towards the road he went on more cautiously with his eyes upon the track before him presently he stopped there was a ragged displacement of the cracked and crumbling soil and the unmistakable scoop of kicking hoofs as he stooped to examine them one of the men at the right uttered a shout by the same strange instinct clarence knew that peyton was found  he was indeed lying there among the wild oats at the right of the road but without trace of life or scarcely human appearance his clothes where not torn and shredded away were partly turned inside out his shoulders neck and head were a shapeless undistinguishable mask of dried earth and rags like a mummy wrapping his left boot was gone his large frame seemed boneless and except for the cerements of his mudstiffened clothing was limp and sodden  clarence raised his head suddenly from a quick examination of the body and looked at the men around him one of them was already cantering away clarence instantly threw himself on his horse and putting spurs to the animal drew a revolver from his holster and fired over the mans head the rider turned in his saddle saw his pursuer and pulled up  go back said clarence or my next shot wont miss you  i was only going to inform the senora said the man with a shrug and a forced smile  i will do that said clarence grimly driving him back with him into the waiting circle then turning to them he said slowly with deliberate smileless irony and now my brave gentlemenknights of the bull and gallant mustang huntersi want to inform you that i believe that mr peyton was murdered and if the man who killed him is anywhere this side of hell i intend to find him good you understand me now lift up the bodyyou two by the shoulders you two by the feet let your horses follow for i intend that you four shall carry home your master in your arms on foot now forward to the corral by the back trail disobey me or step out of line andhe raised the revolver ominously  if the change wrought in the dead man before them was weird and terrifying no less distinct and ominous was the change that during the last few minutes had come over the living speaker for it was no longer the youthful clarence who sat there but a haggard prematurely worn desperatelooking avenger lank of cheek and injected of eye whose white teeth glistened under the brown mustache and thin pale lips that parted when his restrained breath now and then hurriedly escaped them  as the procession moved on two men slunk behind with the horses  mother of god who is this wolfs whelp said manuel  hush said his companion in a terrified whisper have you not heard it is the son of hamilton brant the assassin the duelisthe who was fusiladed in sonora he made the sign of the cross quickly jesus maria let them look out who have cause for the blood of his father is in him     chapter vii   what other speech passed between clarence and peytons retainers was not known but not a word of the interview seemed to have been divulged by those present it was generally believed and accepted that judge peyton met his death by being thrown from his halfbroken mustang and dragged at its heels and medical opinion hastily summoned from santa inez after the body had been borne to the corral and stripped of its hideous encasings declared that the neck had been broken and death had followed instantaneously an inquest was deemed unnecessary  clarence had selected mary to break the news to mrs peyton and the frightened young girl was too much struck with the change still visible in his face and the half authority of his manner to decline or even to fully appreciate the calamity that had befallen them after the first benumbing shock mrs peyton passed into that strange exaltation of excitement brought on by the immediate necessity for action followed by a pallid calm which the average spectator too often unfairly accepts as incongruous inadequate or artificial there had also occurred one of those strange compensations that wait on death or disrupture by catastrophe such as the rude shaking down of an unsettled life the forcible realization of what were vague speculations the breaking of old habits and traditions and the unloosing of halfconscious bonds mrs peyton without insensibility to her loss or disloyalty to her affections nevertheless felt a relief to know that she was now really susys guardian free to order her new life wherever and under what conditions she chose as most favorable to it and that she could dispose of this house that was wearying to her when susy was away and which the girl herself had always found insupportable she could settle this question of clarences relations to her daughter out of hand without advice or opposition she had a brother in the east who would be summoned to take care of the property this consideration for the living pursued her even while the dead mans presence still awed the hushed house it was in her thoughts as she stood beside his bier and adjusted the flowers on his breast which no longer moved for or against these vanities and it stayed with her even in the solitude of her darkened room  but if mrs peyton was deficient it was susy who filled the popular idea of a mourner and whose emotional attitude of a griefstricken daughter left nothing to be desired it was she who when the house was filled with sympathizing friends from san francisco and the few near neighbors who had hurried with condolences was overflowing in her reminiscences of the dead mans goodness to her and her own undying affection who recalled ominous things that he had said and strange premonitions of her own the result of her everpresent filial anxiety it was she who had hurried home that afternoon impelled with vague fears of some impending calamity it was she who drew a picture of peyton as a doting and almost too indulgent parent which mary rogers failed to recognize and which brought back vividly to clarences recollection her own childish exaggerations of the indian massacre i am far from saying that she was entirely insincere or merely acting at these moments at times she was taken with a mild hysteria brought on by the exciting intrusion of this real event in her monotonous life by the attentions of her friends the importance of her suffering as an only child and the advancement of her position as the heiress of the robles rancho if her tears were near the surface they were at least genuine and filmed her violet eyes and reddened her pretty eyelids quite as effectually as if they had welled from the depths of her being her black frock lent a matured dignity to her figure and paled her delicate complexion with the refinement of suffering even clarence was moved in that dark and haggard abstraction that had settled upon him since his strange outbreak over the body of his old friend  the extent of that change had not been noticed by mrs peyton who had only observed that clarence had treated her grief with a grave and silent respect she was grateful for that a repetition of his boyish impulsiveness would have been distasteful to her at such a moment she only thought him more mature and more subdued and as the only man now in her household his services had been invaluable in the emergency  the funeral had taken place at santa inez where half the county gathered to pay their last respects to their former fellowcitizen and neighbor whose legal and combative victories they had admired and whom death had lifted into a public character the family were returning to the house the same afternoon mrs peyton and the girls in one carriage the female houseservants in another and clarence on horseback they had reached the first plateau and clarence was riding a little in advance when an extraordinary figure rising from the grain beyond began to gesticulate to him wildly checking the driver of the first carriage clarence bore down upon the stranger to his amazement it was jim hooker mounted on a peaceful unwieldy plough horse he was nevertheless accoutred and armed after his most extravagant fashion in addition to a heavy rifle across his saddlebow he was weighted down with a knife and revolvers clarence was in no mood for trifling and almost rudely demanded his business  gord clarence it aint foolin the sisters title was decided yesterday  i knew it you fool its your title you were already on your land and in possession what the devil are you doing here  yesbut stammered jim all the boys holding that title moved up here to make the division and grab all they could and i followed and i found out that they were going to grab judge peytons house because it was on the line if they could and findin you was all away by gord they did and theyre in it and i stoled out and rode down here to warn ye  he stopped looked at clarence glanced darkly around him and then down on his accoutrements even in that supreme moment of sincerity he could not resist the possibilities of the situation  its as much as my lifes worth he said gloomily but with a dark glance at his weapons ill sell it dearly  jim said clarence in a terrible voice youre not lying again  no said jim hurriedly i swear it clarence no honest injin this time and look ill help you they aint expectin you yet and they think yell come by the road ef i raised a scare off there by the corral while youre creepin round by the back mebbe you could get in while theyre all lookin for ye in front dont you see ill raise a big row and they neednt know but what yeve got wind of it and brought a party with you from santa inez  in a flash clarence had wrought a feasible plan out of jims fantasy  good he said wringing his old companions hand go back quietly now hang round the corral and when you see the carriage climbing the last terrace raise your alarm dont mind how loud it is therell be nobody but the servants in the carriages  he rode quickly back to the first carriage at whose window mrs peytons calm face was already questioning him he told her briefly and concisely of the attack and what he proposed to do  you have shown yourself so strong in matters of worse moment than this he added quietly that i have no fears for your courage i have only to ask you to trust yourself to me to put you back at once in your own home your presence there just now is the one important thing whatever happens afterwards  she recognized his maturer tone and determined manner and nodded assent more than that a faint fire came into her handsome eyes the two girls kindled their own at that flaming beacon and sat with flushed checks and suspended indignant breath they were western americans and not over much used to imposition  you must get down before we raise the hill and follow me on foot through the grain i was thinking he added turning to mrs peyton of your boudoir window  she had been thinking of it too and nodded  the vine has loosened the bars he said  if it hasnt we must squeeze through them she returned simply  at the end of the terrace clarence dismounted and helped them from the carriage he then gave directions to the coachmen to follow the road slowly to the corral in front of the casa and tied his horse behind the second carriage then with mrs peyton and the two young girls he plunged into the grain  it was hot it was dusty their thin shoes slipped in the crumbling adobe and the great blades caught in their crape draperies but they uttered no complaint whatever ulterior thought was in their minds they were bent only on one thing at that momenton entering the house at any hazard mrs peyton had lived long enough on the frontier to know the magic power of possession susy already was old enough to feel the acute feminine horror of the profanation of her own belongings by alien hands clarence more cognizant of the whole truth than the others was equally silent and determined and mary rogers was fired with the zeal of loyalty  suddenly a series of bloodcurdling yells broke from the direction of the corral and they stopped but clarence at once recognized the wellknown warwhoop imitation of jim hookerinfinitely more gruesome and appalling than the genuine aboriginal challenge a half dozen shots fired in quick succession had evidently the same friendly origin  now is our time said clarence eagerly we must run for the house  they had fortunately reached by this time the angle of the adobe wall of the casa and the long afternoon shadows of the building were in their favor they pressed forward eagerly with the sounds of jim hookers sham encounter still in their ears mingled with answering shouts of defiance from strange voices within the building towards the front  they rapidly skirted the wall even passing boldly before the back gateway which seemed empty and deserted and the next moment stood beside the narrow window of the boudoir clarences surmises were correct the iron grating was not only loose but yielded to a vigorous wrench the vine itself acting as a lever to pull out the rusty bars the young man held out his hand but mrs peyton with the sudden agility of a young girl leaped into the window followed by mary and susy the inner casement yielded to her touch the next moment they were within the room then mrs peytons flushed and triumphant face reappeared at the window  its all right the men are all in the courtyard or in the front of the house the boudoir door is strong and we can bolt them out  it wont be necessary said clarence quietly you will not be disturbed  but are you not coming in she asked timidly holding the window open  clarence looked at her with his first faint smile since peytons death  of course i am but not in that way i am going in by the front gate  she would have detained him but with a quick wave of his hand he left her and ran swiftly around the wall of the casa toward the front the gate was half open a dozen excited men were gathered before it and in the archway and among them whitened with dust blackened with powder and apparently glutted with rapine and still holding a revolver in his hand was jim hooker as clarence approached the men quickly retreated inside the gate and closed it but not before he had exchanged a meaning glance with jim when he reached the gate a man from within roughly demanded his business  i wish to see the leader of this party said clarence quietly  i reckon you do returned the man with a short laugh but i kalkilate he dont return the compliment  he probably will when he reads this note to his employer continued clarence still coolly selecting a paper from his pocketbook it was addressed to francisco robles superintendent of the sisters title and directed him to give mr clarence brant free access to the property and the fullest information concerning it the man took it glanced at it looked again at clarence and then passed the paper to a third man among the group in the courtyard the latter read it and approached the gate carelessly  well what do you want  i am afraid you have the advantage of me in being able to transact business through bars said clarence with slow but malevolent distinctness and as mine is important i think you had better open the gate to me  the slight laugh that his speech had evoked from the bystanders was checked as the leader retorted angrily  thats all very well but how do i know that youre the man represented in that letter pancho robles may know you but i dont  that you can find out very easily said clarence there is a man among your party who knows memr hooker ask him  the man turned with a quick mingling of surprise and suspicion to the gloomy imperturbable hooker clarence could not hear the reply of that young gentleman but it was evidently not wanting in his usual dark enigmatical exaggeration the man surlily opened the gate  all the same he said still glancing suspiciously at hooker i dont see what hes got to do with you  a great deal said clarence entering the courtyard and stepping into the veranda hes one of my tenants  your what said the man with a coarse laugh of incredulity  my tenants repeated clarence glancing around the courtyard carelessly nevertheless he was relieved to notice that the three or four mexicans of the party did not seem to be old retainers of the rancho there was no evidence of the internal treachery he had feared  your tenants echoed the man with an uneasy glance at the faces of the others  yes said clarence with business brevity and for the matter of that although i have no reason to be particularly proud of it so are you all you ask my business here it seems to be the same as yoursto hold possession of this house with this difference however he continued taking a document from his pocket here is the certificate signed by the county clerk of the bill of sale of the entire sisters title to me it includes the whole two leagues from fair plains to the old boundary line of this rancho which you forcibly entered this morning there is the document examine it if you like the only shadow of a claim you could have to this property you would have to derive from me the only excuse you could have for this act of lawlessness would be orders from me and all that you have done this morning is only the assertion of my legal right to this house if i disavow your act as i might i leave you as helpless as any tramp that was ever kicked from a doorstepas any burglar that was ever collared on the fence by a constable  it was the truth there was no denying the authority of the document the facts of the situation or its ultimate power and significance there was consternation stupefaction and even a halfhumorous recognition of the absurdity of their position on most of the faces around him incongruous as the scene was it was made still more grotesque by the attitude of jim hooker ruthlessly abandoning the party of convicted trespassers he stalked gloomily over to the side of clarence with the air of having been all the time scornfully in the secret and a mien of wearied victoriousness and thus halting he disdainfully expectorated tobacco juice on the ground between him and his late companions as if to form a line of demarcation the few mexicans began to edge towards the gateway this defection of his followers recalled the leader who was no coward to himself again  shut the gate there he shouted  as its two sides clashed together again he turned deliberately to clarence  thats all very well young man as regards the title you may have bought up the land and legally own every square inch of howling wilderness between this and san francisco and i wish you joy of your dd fools bargain you may have got a whole circus like that pointing to the gloomy jim at your back but with all your money and all your friends youve forgotten one thing you havent got possession and we have  thats just where we differ said clarence coolly for if you take the trouble to examine the house you will see that it is already in possession of mrs peytonmy tenant  he paused to give effect to his revelations but he was nevertheless unprepared for an unrehearsed dramatic situation mrs peyton who had been tired of waiting and was listening in the passage at the mention of her name entered the gallery followed by the young ladies the slight look of surprise upon her face at the revelation she had just heard of clarences ownership only gave the suggestion of her having been unexpectedly disturbed in her peaceful seclusion one of the mexicans turned pale with a frightened glance at the passage as if he expected the figure of the dead man to follow  the group fell back the game was overand lost no one recognized it more quickly than the gamblers themselves more than that desperate and lawless as they were they still retained the chivalry of western men and every hat was slowly doffed to the three black figures that stood silently in the gallery and even apologetic speech began to loosen the clenched teeth of the discomfited leader  weweretold there was no one in the house he stammered  and it was the truth said a pert youthful yet slightly affected voice for we climbed into the window just as you came in at the gate  it was susys words that stung their ears again but it was susys pretty figure suddenly advanced and in a slightly theatrical attitude that checked their anger there had been a sudden ominous silence as the whole plot of rescue seemed to be revealed to them in those audacious words but a sense of the ludicrous which too often was the only perception that ever mitigated the passions of such assemblies here suddenly asserted itself the leader burst into a loud laugh which was echoed by the others and with waving hats the whole party swept peacefully out through the gate  but what does all this mean about your purchasing the land mr brant said mrs peyton quickly fixing her eyes intently on clarence  a faint colorthe useless protest of his truthful bloodcame to his cheek  the house is yours and yours alone mrs peyton the purchase of the sisters title was a private arrangement between mr peyton and myself in view of an emergency like this  she did not however take her proud searching eyes from his face and he was forced to turn away  it was so like dear good thoughtful papa said susy why bless me in a lower voice if that isnt that lying old jim hooker standing there by the gate     chapter viii   judge peyton had bequeathed his entire property unconditionally to his wife but his affairs were found to be greatly in disorder and his papers in confusion and although mrs peyton could discover no actual record of the late transaction with mr brant which had saved her the possession of the homestead it was evident that he had spent large sums in speculative attempts to maintain the integrity of his estate that enormous domain although perfectly unencumbered had been nevertheless unremunerative partly through the costs of litigation and partly through the systematic depredations to which its great size and long line of unprotected boundary had subjected it it had been invaded by squatters and jumpers who had sown and reaped crops without discovery its cattle and wild horses had strayed or been driven beyond its illdefined and hopeless limits against these difficulties the widow felt herself unable and unwilling to contend and with the advice of her friends and her lawyer she concluded to sell the estate except that portion covered by the sisters title which with the homestead had been reconveyed to her by clarence she retired with susy to the house in san francisco leaving clarence to occupy and hold the casa with her servants for her until order was restored the robles rancho thus became the headquarters of the new owner of the sisters title from which he administered its affairs visited its incumbencies overlooked and surveyed its lands andoccasionallycollected its rents there were not wanting critics who averred that these were scarcely remunerative and that the young san francisco fine gentleman who was only hamilton brants son after all yet who wished to ape the dignity and degree of a large landholder had made a very foolish bargain i grieve to say that one of his own tenants namely jim hooker in his secret heart inclined to that belief and looked upon clarences speculation as an act of farseeing and inordinate vanity  indeed the belligerent jim had partlyand of course darklyintimated something of this to susy in their brief reunion at the casa during the few days that followed its successful reoccupation and clarence remembering her older caprices and her remark on her first recognition of him was quite surprised at the easy familiarity of her reception of this forgotten companion of their childhood but he was still more concerned in noticing for the first time a singular sympathetic understanding of each other and an odd similarity of occasional action and expression between them it was a part of this monstrous peculiarity that neither the sympathy nor the likeness suggested any particular friendship or amity in the pair but rather a mutual antagonism and suspicion mrs peyton coldly polite to clarences former companion but condescendingly gracious to his present tenant and retainer did not notice it preoccupied with the annoyance and pain of susys frequent references to the old days of their democratic equality  you dont remember jim the time that you painted my face in the wagon and got me up as an indian papoose she said mischievously  but jim who had no desire to recall his previous humble position before mrs peyton or clarence was only vaguely responsive clarence although joyfully touched at this seeming evidence of susys loyalty to the past nevertheless found himself even more acutely pained at the distress it caused mrs peyton and was as relieved as she was by hookers reticence for he had seen little of susy since peytons death and there had been no repetition of their secret interviews neither had he nor she as far as he could judge noticed the omission he had been more than usually kind gentle and protecting in his manner towards her with little reference however to any response from her yet he was vaguely conscious of some change in his feelings he attributed it when he thought of it at all to the exciting experiences through which he had passed to some sentiment of responsibility to his dead friend and to another secret preoccupation that was always in his mind he believed it would pass in time yet he felt a certain satisfaction that she was no longer able to trouble him except of course when she pained mrs peyton and then he was half conscious of taking the old attitude of the dead husband in mediating between them yet so great was his inexperience that he believed with pathetic simplicity of perception that all this was due to the slow maturing of his love for her and that he was still able to make her happy but this was something to be thought of later just now providence seemed to have offered him a vocation and a purpose that his idle adolescence had never known he did not dream that his capacity for patience was only the slow wasting of his love  meantime that more wonderful change and recreation of the californian landscape so familiar yet always so young had come to the rancho the leaguelong terrace that had yellowed whitened and wasted for half a year beneath a staring monotonous sky now under sailing clouds flying and broken shafts of light and sharply defined lines of rain had taken a faint hue of resurrection the dust that had muffled the roads and byways and choked the low oaks that fringed the sunken canada had long since been laid the warm moist breath of the southwest trades had softened the hard dry lines of the landscape and restored its color as of a picture over which a damp sponge had been passed the broad expanse of plateau before the casa glistened and grew dark the hidden woods of the canada cleared and strengthened in their solitude dripped along the trails and hollows that were now transformed into running streams the distinguishing madrono near the entrance to the rancho had changed its crimson summer suit and masqueraded in buff and green  yet there were leaden days when half the prospect seemed to be seen through palisades of rain when the slight incline between the terraces became a tumultuous cascade and the surest hoofs slipped on trails of unctuous mud when cattle were bogged a few yards from the highway and the crossing of the turnpike road was a dangerous ford there were days of gale and tempest when the shriveled stalks of giant oats were stricken like trees and lay across each other in rigid angles and a roar as of the sea came up from the writhing treetops in the sunken valley there were long weary nights of steady downpour hammering on the red tiles of the casa and drumming on the shingles of the new veranda which was more terrible to be borne alone but for the servants and an occasional stormstayed tenant from fair plains clarence might have at such times questioned the effect of this seclusion upon his impassioned nature but he had already been accustomed to monastic seclusion in his boyish life at el refugio and he did not reflect that for that very reason its indulgences might have been dangerous from time to time letters reached him from the outer world of san franciscoa few pleasant lines from mrs peyton in answer to his own chronicle of his half stewardship giving the news of the family and briefly recounting their movements she was afraid that susys sensitive nature chafed under the restriction of mourning in the gay city but she trusted to bring her back for a change to robles when the rains were over this was a poor substitute for those brief happy glimpses of the home circle which had so charmed him but he accepted it stoically he wandered over the old house from which the perfume of domesticity seemed to have evaporated yet notwithstanding mrs peytons playful permission he never intruded upon the sanctity of the boudoir and kept it jealously locked  he was sitting in peytons business room one morning when incarnacion entered clarence had taken a fancy to this indian half steward half vacquero who had reciprocated it with a certain doglike fidelity but also a feline indirectness that was part of his nature he had been early prepossessed with clarence through a kinsman at el refugio where the young americans generosity had left a romantic record among the common people he had been pleased to approve of his follies before the knowledge of his profitless and lordly land purchase had commended itself to him as corroborative testimony of true hidalgo blood mark you he had said oracularly wherefore was his father sacrificed by mongrels as to the others believe mebah  he stood there sombrero in hand murky and confidential steaming through his soaked serape and exhaling a blended odor of equine perspiration and cigarette smoke  it was perhaps as the master had noticed a brigands own day bullying treacherous and wicked it blew you off your horse if you so much as lifted your arms and let the wind get inside your serape and as for the mudcaramba in fifty varas your forelegs were like bears and your hoofs were earthen plasters  clarence knew that incarnacion had not sought him with mere meteorological information and patiently awaited further developments the vacquero went on  but one of the things this beast of a weather did was to wash down the stalks of the grain and to clear out the trough and hollows between and to make level the fields andlook you to uncover the stones and rubbish and whatever the summer dust had buried indeed it was even as a miracle that jose mendez one day after the first showers came upon a silver button from his calzas which he had lost in the early summer and it was only that morning that remembering how much and with what fire don clarencio had sought the missing boot from the foot of the senor peyton when his body was found he incarnacion had thought he would look for it on the falda of the second terrace and behold mother of god it was there soaked with mud and rain but the same as when the senor was alive to the very spur  he drew the boot from beneath his serape and laid it before clarence the young man instantly recognized it in spite of its weatherbeaten condition and its air of grotesque and drunken inconsistency to the usually trim and correct appearance of peyton when alive it is the same he said in a low voice  good said incarnacion now if don clarencio will examine the american spur he will seewhat a few horsehairs twisted and caught in the sharp points of the rowel good is it the hair of the horse that senor rode clearly not and in truth not it is too long for the flanks and belly of the horse it is not the same color as the tail and the mane how comes it there it comes from the twisted horsehair rope of a riata and not from the braided cowhide thongs of the regular lasso of a vacquero the lasso slips not much but holds the riata slips much and strangles  but mr peyton was not strangled said clarence quickly  no for the noose of the riata was perhaps largewho knows it might have slipped down his arms pinioned him and pulled him off trulysuch has been known before then on the ground it slipped again or he perhaps worked it off to his feet where it caught on his spur and then he was dragged until the boot came off and behold he was dead  this had been clarences own theory of the murder but he had only half confided it to incarnacion he silently examined the spur with the accusing horsehair and placed it in his desk incarnacion continued  there is not a vacquero in the whole rancho who has a horsehair riata we use the braided cowhide it is heavier and stronger it is for the bull and not the man the horsehair riata comes from over the rangesouth  there was a dead silence broken only by the drumming of the rain upon the roof of the veranda incarnacion slightly shrugged his shoulders  don clarencio does not know the southern county francisco robles cousin of the sistershe they call panchocomes from the south surely when don clarencio bought the title he saw francisco for he was the steward  i dealt only with the actual owners and through my bankers in san francisco returned clarence abstractedly  incarnacion looked through the yellow corners of his murky eyes at his master  pedro valdez who was sent away by senor peyton is the fosterbrother of francisco they were much together now that francisco is rich from the gold don clarencio paid for the title they come not much together but pedro is rich too mother of god he gambles and is a fine gentleman he holds his head higheven over the americanos he gambles with truly they say he can shoot with the best of them he boasts and swells himself this pedro he says if all the old families were like him they would drive those western swine back over the mountains again  clarence raised his eyes caught a subtle yellow flash from incarnacions gazed at him suddenly and rose  i dont think i have ever seen him he said quietly thank you for bringing me the spur but keep the knowledge of it to yourself good nascio for the present  nascio nevertheless still lingered perceiving which clarence handed him a cigarette and proceeded to light one himself he knew that the vacquero would reroll his and that that always deliberate occupation would cover and be an excuse for further confidence  the senora peyton does not perhaps meet this pedro in the society of san francisco  surely not the senora is in mourning and goes not out in society nor would she probably go anywhere where she would meet a dismissed servant of her husband  incarnacion slowly lit his cigarette and said between the puffs and the senoritashe would not meet him  assuredly not  and continued incarnacion throwing down the match and putting his foot on it if this boaster this turkeycock says she did you could put him out like that  certainly said clarence with an easy confidence he was however far from feeling if he really said itwhich i doubt  ah truly said incarnacion who knows it may be another senorita silsbee  the senoras adopted daughter is called miss peyton friend nascio you forget yourself said clarence quietly  ah pardon said incarnacion with effusive apology but she was born silsbee everybody knows it she herself has told it to pepita the senor peyton bequeathed his estate to the senora peyton he named not the senorita eh what would you it is the common cackle of the barnyard but i say mees silsbee for look you there is a silsbee of sacramento the daughter of her aunt who writes letters to her pepita has seen them and possibly it is only that mees of whom the brigand pedro boasts  possibly said clarence but as far as this rancho is concerned friend nascio thou wilt understandand i look to thee to make the others understandthat there is no senorita silsbee here only the senorita peyton the respected daughter of the senora thy mistress he spoke with the quaint mingling of familiarity and paternal gravity of the spanish mastera faculty he had acquired at el refugio in a like vicarious position and which never failed as a sign of authority and now he added gravely get out of this friend with gods blessing and see that thou rememberest what i told thee  the retainer with equal gravity stepped backwards saluted with his sombrero until the stiff brim scraped the floor and then solemnly withdrew  left to himself clarence remained for an instant silent and thoughtful before the ovenlike hearth so everybody knew susys real relations to the peytons and everybody but mrs peyton perhaps knew that she was secretly corresponding with some one of her own family in other circumstances he might have found some excuse for this assertion of her independence and love of her kindred but in her attitude towards mrs peyton it seemed monstrous it appeared impossible that mrs peyton should not have heard of it or suspected the young girls disaffection perhaps she hadit was another burden laid upon her shouldersbut the proud woman had kept it to herself a film of moisture came across his eyes i fear he thought less of the suggestion of susys secret meeting with pedro or incarnacions implied suspicions that pedro was concerned in peytons death than of this sentimental possibility he knew that pedro had been hated by the others on account of his position he knew the instinctive jealousies of the race and their predisposition to extravagant misconstruction from what he had gathered and particularly from the voices he had overheard on the fair plains road it seemed to him that pedro was more capable of mercenary intrigue than physical revenge he was not aware of the irrevocable affront put upon pedro by peyton and he had consequently attached no importance to peytons own halfscornful intimation of the only kind of retaliation that pedro would be likely to take the unsuccessful attempt upon himself he had always thought might have been an accident or if it was really a premeditated assault it might have been intended actually for himself and not peyton as he had first thought and his old friend had suffered for him through some mistake of the assailant the purpose which alone seemed wanting might have been to remove clarence as a possible witness who had overheard their conspiracyhow much of it they did not knowon the fair plains road that night the only clue he held to the murderer in the spur locked in his desk merely led him beyond the confines of the rancho but definitely nowhere else it was however some relief to know that the crime was not committed by one of peytons retainers nor the outcome of domestic treachery  after some consideration he resolved to seek jim hooker who might be possessed of some information respecting susys relations either from the young girls own confidences or from jims personal knowledge of the old frontier families from a sense of loyalty to susy and mrs peyton he had never alluded to the subject before him but since the young girls own indiscretion had made it a matter of common report however distasteful it was to his own feelings he felt he could not plead the sense of delicacy for her he had great hopes in what he had always believed was only her exaggeration of fact as well as feeling and he had an instinctive reliance on her fellow poseurs ability to detect it a few days later when he found he could safely leave the rancho alone he rode to fair plains  the floods were out along the turnpike road and even seemed to have increased since his last journey the face of the landscape had changed again one of the lower terraces had become a wild mere of sedge and reeds the dry and dusty bed of a forgotten brook had reappeared a fullbanked river crossing the turnpike and compelling a long detour before the traveler could ford it but as he approached the hopkins farm and the opposite clearing and cabin of jim hooker he was quite unprepared for a still more remarkable transformation the cabin a threeroomed structure and its cattleshed had entirely disappeared there were no traces or signs of inundation the land lay on a gentle acclivity above the farm and secure from the effects of the flood and a part of the ploughed and cleared land around the site of the cabin showed no evidence of overflow on its black upturned soil but the house was gone only a few timbers too heavy to be removed the blighting erasions of a few months of occupation and the dull blackened area of the site itself were to be seen the fence alone was intact  clarence halted before it perplexed and astonished scarcely two weeks had elapsed since he had last visited it and sat beneath its roof with jim and already its few ruins had taken upon themselves the look of years of abandonment and decay the wild land seemed to have thrown off its yoke of cultivation in a night and nature rioted again with all its primal forces over the freed soil wild oats and mustard were springing already in the broken furrows and lank vines were slimily spreading over a few scattered but still unseasoned and sappy shingles some battered tin cans and fragments of old clothing looked as remote as if they had been relics of the earliest immigration  clarence turned inquiringly towards the hopkins farmhouse across the road his arrival however had already been noticed as the door of the kitchen opened in an anticipatory fashion and he could see the slight figure of phoebe hopkins in the doorway backed by the overlooking heads and shoulders of her parents the face of the young girl was pale and drawn with anxiety at which clarences simple astonishment took a shade of concern  i am looking for mr hooker he said uneasily and i dont seem to be able to find either him or his house  and you dont know whats gone of him said the girl quickly  no i havent seen him for two weeks  there i told you so said the girl turning nervously to her parents i knew it he hasnt seen him for two weeks then looking almost tearfully at clarences face she said no more have we  but said clarence impatiently something must have happened where is his house  taken away by them jumpers interrupted the old farmer a lot of roughs that pulled it down and carted it off in a jiffy before our very eyes without answerin a civil question to me or her but he wasnt there nor before nor since  no added the old woman with flashing eyes or hed let em have what ther was in his sixshooters  no he wouldnt mother said the girl impatiently hed changed and was agin all them ideas of force and riotin he was for peace and law all the time why the day before we missed him he was tellin me california never would be decent until people obeyed the laws and the titles were settled and for that reason because he wouldnt fight agin the law or without the consent of the law theyve killed him or kidnapped him away  the girls lips quivered and her small brown hands twisted the edges of her blue checked apron although this new picture of jims peacefulness was as astounding and unsatisfactory as his own disappearance there was no doubt of the sincerity of poor phoebes impression  in vain did clarence point out to them there must be some mistake that the trespassersthe socalled jumpersreally belonged to the same party as hooker and would have no reason to dispossess him that in fact they were all his clarences tenants in vain he assured them of hookers perfect security in possession that he could have driven the intruders away by the simple exhibition of his lease or that he could have even called a constable from the town of fair plains to protect him from mere lawlessness in vain did he assure them of his intention to find his missing friend and reinstate him at any cost the conviction that the unfortunate young man had been foully dealt with was fixed in the minds of the two women for a moment clarence himself was staggered by it  you see said the young girl with a kindling face the day before he came back from robles ther were some queer men hangin round his cabin but as they were the same kind that went off with him the day the sisters title was confirmed we thought nothing of it but when he came back from you he seemed worried and anxious and wasnt a bit like himself we thought perhaps hed got into some trouble there or been disappointed he hadnt had he mr brant continued phoebe with an appealing look  by no means said clarence warmly on the contrary he was able to do his friends good service there and was successful in what he attempted mrs peyton was very grateful of course he told you what had happened and what he did for us continued clarence with a smile  he had already amused himself on the way with a fanciful conception of the exaggerated account jim had given of his exploits but the bewildered girl shook her head  no he didnt tell us anything  clarence was really alarmed this unprecedented abstention of hookers was portentous  he didnt say anything but what i told you about law and order she went on but that same night we heard a good deal of talking and shouting in the cabin and around it and the next day he was talking with father and wanting to know how he kept his land without trouble from outsiders  and i said broke in hopkins that i guessed folks didnt bother a man with women folks around and that i kalkilated that i wasnt quite as notorious for fightin as he was  and he said also interrupted mrs hopkins and quite in his natral way toogloomy like you remember cyrus appealingly to her husbandthat that was his curse  the smile that flickered around clarences mouth faded however as he caught sight of phoebes pleading interrogating eyes it was really too bad whatever change had come over the rascal it was too evident that his previous belligerent personality had had its full effect upon the simple girl and that hereafter one pair of honest eyes would be wistfully following him  perplexed and indignant clarence again closely questioned her as to the personnel of the trespassing party who had been seen once or twice since passing over the field he had at last elicited enough information to identify one of them as gilroy the leader of the party that had invaded robles rancho his cheek flushed even if they had wished to take a theatrical and momentary revenge on hooker for the passing treachery to them which they had just discovered although such retaliation was only transitory and they could not hold the land it was an insult to clarence himself whose tenant jim was and subversive of all their legally acquired rights he would confront this gilroy at once his halfwild encampment was only a few miles away just over the boundaries of the robles estate without stating his intention he took leave of the hopkins family with the cheerful assurance that he would probably return with some news of hooker and rode away  the trail became more indistinct and unfrequented as it diverged from the main road and presently lost itself in the slope towards the east the horizon grew larger there were faint bluish lines upon it which he knew were distant mountains beyond this a still fainter white linethe sierran snows presently he intersected a trail running south and remarked that it crossed the highway behind him where he had once met the two mysterious horsemen they had evidently reached the terrace through the wild oats by that trail a little farther on were a few groups of sheds and canvas tents in a bare and open space with scattered cattle and horsemen exactly like an encampment or the gathering of a country fair as clarence rode down towards them he could see that his approach was instantly observed and that a simultaneous movement was made as if to anticipate him for the first time he realized the possible consequences of his visit singlehanded but it was too late to retrace his steps with a glance at his holster he rode boldly forward to the nearest shed a dozen men hovered near him but something in his quiet determined manner held them aloof gilroy was on the threshold in his shirtsleeves a single look showed him that clarence was alone and with a careless gesture of his hand he warned away his own followers  youve got a sort of easy way of droppin in whar you aint invited brant he said with a grim smile which was not however without a certain air of approval got it from your father didnt you  i dont know but i dont believe he ever thought it necessary to warn twenty men of the approach of one replied clarence in the same tone i had no time to stand on ceremony for i have just come from hookers quarter section at fair plains  gilroy smiled again and gazed abstractedly at the sky  you know as well as i do said clarence controlling his voice with an effort that what you have done there will have to be undone if you wish to hold even those lawless men of yours together or keep yourself and them from being run into the brush like highwaymen ive no fear for that neither do i care to know what was your motive in doing it but i can only tell you that if it was retaliation i alone was and still am responsible for hookers action at the rancho i came here to know just what you have done with him and if necessary to take his place  youre just a little too previous in your talk i reckon brant returned gilroy lazily and as to legality i reckon we stand on the same level with yourself just here beginnin with what you came for as we dont know where your jim hooker is and as we aint done anythin to him we dont exackly see what we could do with you in his place ez to our motiveswell weve got a good deal to say about that we reckoned that he wasnt exackly the kind of man we wanted for a neighbor his powful fightin style didnt suit us peaceful folks and we thought it rather worked agin this new law and order racket to have such a man about to say nuthin of it prejudicin quiet settlers he had too many revolvers for one man to keep his eye on and was altogether too much steeped in blood so to speak for ordinary washin and domestic purposes his hull get up was too deathlike and clammy so we persuaded him to leave we just went there all of us and exhorted him we stayed round there two days and nights takin turns talkin with him nuthin more only selecting subjects in his own style to please him until he left and then as we didnt see any use for his house there we took it away thems the cold facts brant he added with a certain convincing indifference that left no room for doubt and you can stand by em now workin back to the first principle you laid downthat well have to undo what weve donewe dont agree with you for weve taken a leaf outer your own book weve got it here in black and white weve got a bill o sale of hookers house and possession and were on the land in place of himas your tenants he reentered the shanty took a piece of paper from a soapbox on the shell and held it out to clarence here it is its a fair and square deal brant we gave him as it says here a hundred dollars for it no humbuggin but the hard cash by jiminy and he took the money  the ring of truth in the mans voice was as unmistakable as the signature in jims own hand hooker had sold out clarence turned hastily away  we dont know where he went continued gilroy grimly but i reckon you aint over anxious to see him now and i kin tell ye something to ease your mindhe didnt require much persuadin and i kin tell ye another if ye aint above takin advice from folks that dont pertend to give it he added with the same curious look of interest in his face youve done well to get shut of him and if you got shut of a few more of his kind that you trust to youd do better  as if to avoid noticing any angry reply from the young man he reentered the cabin and shut the door behind him clarence felt the uselessness of further parley and rode away  but gilroys parthian arrow rankled as he rode he was not greatly shocked at jims defection for he was always fully conscious of his vanity and weakness but he was by no means certain that jims extravagance and braggadocio which he had found only amusing and perhaps even pathetic might not be as provocative and prejudicial to others as gilroy had said but like all sympathetic and unselfish natures he sought to find some excuse for his old companions weakness in his own mistaken judgment he had no business to bring poor jim on the land to subject his singular temperament to the temptations of such a life and such surroundings he should never have made use of his services at the rancho he had done him harm rather than good in his illadvised and perhaps selfish attempts to help him i have said that gilroys parting warning rankled in his breast but not ignobly it wounded the surface of his sensitive nature but could not taint or corrupt the pure wholesome blood of the gentleman beneath it for in gilroys warning he saw only his own shortcomings a strange fatality had marked his friendships he had been no help to jim he had brought no happiness to susy or mrs peyton whose disagreement his visit seemed to have accented thinking over the mysterious attack upon himself it now seemed to him possible that in some obscure way his presence at the rancho had precipitated the more serious attack on peyton if as it had been said there was some curse upon his inheritance from his father he seemed to have made others share it with him he was riding onward abstractedly with his head sunk on his breast and his eyes fixed upon some vague point between his horses sensitive ears when a sudden intelligent forward pricking of them startled him and an apparition arose from the plain before him that seemed to sweep all other sense away  it was the figure of a handsome young horseman as abstracted as himself but evidently on better terms with his own personality he was dark haired sallow cheeked and blue eyedthe type of the old spanish californian a burntout cigarette was in his mouth and he was riding a roan mustang with the lazy grace of his race but what arrested clarences attention more than his picturesque person was the narrow flexible long coil of gray horsehair riata which hung from his saddlebow but whose knotted and silverbeaded terminating lash he was swirling idly in his narrow brown hand clarence knew and instantly recognized it as the ordinary fanciful appendage of a gentleman rider used for tethering his horse on lonely plains and always made the object of the most lavish expenditure of decoration and artistic skill but he was as suddenly filled with a blind unreasoning sense of repulsion and fury and lifted his eyes to the man as he approached what the stranger saw in clarences blazing eyes no one but himself knew for his own became fixed and staring his sallow cheeks grew lanker and livid his careless jaunty bearing stiffened into rigidity and swerving his horse to one side he suddenly passed clarence at a furious gallop the young american wheeled quickly and for an instant his knees convulsively gripped the flanks of his horse to follow but the next moment he recalled himself and with an effort began to collect his thoughts what was he intending to do and for what reason he had met hundreds of such horsemen before and caparisoned and accoutred like this even to the riata and he certainly was not dressed like either of the mysterious horsemen whom he had overheard that moonlight evening he looked back the stranger had already slackened his pace and was slowly disappearing clarence turned and rode on his way     chapter ix   without disclosing the full extent of jims defection and desertion clarence was able to truthfully assure the hopkins family of his personal safety and to promise that he would continue his quest and send them further news of the absentee he believed it would be found that jim had been called away on some important business but that not daring to leave his new shanty exposed and temptingly unprotected he had made a virtue of necessity by selling it to his neighbors intending to build a better house on its site after his return having comforted phoebe and impulsively conceived further plans for restoring jim to herhappily without any recurrence of his previous doubts as to his own efficacy as a special providencehe returned to the rancho if he thought again of jims defection and gilroys warning it was only to strengthen himself to a clearer perception of his unselfish duty and singleness of purpose he would give up brooding apply himself more practically to the management of the property carry out his plans for the foundation of a landlords protective league for the southern counties become a candidate for the legislature and in brief try to fill peytons place in the county as he had at the rancho he would endeavor to become better acquainted with the halfbreed laborers on the estate and avoid the friction between them and the americans he was conscious that he had not made that use of his early familiarity with their ways and language which he might have done if occasionally the figure of the young spaniard whom he had met on the lonely road obtruded itself on him it was always with the instinctive premonition that he would meet him again and the mystery of the sudden repulsion be in some way explained thus clarence but the momentary impulse that had driven him to fair plains the eagerness to set his mind at rest regarding susy and her relatives he had utterly forgotten  howbeit some of the energy and enthusiasm that he breathed into these various essays made their impression he succeeded in forming the landlords league under a commission suggested by him the straggling boundaries of robles and the adjacent claims were resurveyed defined and mutually protected even the lawless gilroy from extending an amused toleration to the young administrator grew to recognize and accept him the peons and vacqueros began to have faith in a man who acknowledged them sufficiently to rebuild the ruined mission chapel on the estate and save them the long pilgrimage to santa inez on sundays and saints days the san francisco priest imported from clarences old college at san jose and an habitual guest at clarences hospitable board was grateful enough to fill his flock with loyalty to the young padron  he had returned from a long drive one afternoon and had just thrown himself into an easychair with the comfortable consciousness of a rest fairly earned the dull embers of a fire occasionally glowed in the ovenlike hearth although the open casement of a window let in the soft breath of the southwest trades the angelus had just rung from the restored chapel and mellowed by distance seemed to clarence to lend that repose to the windswept landscape that it had always lacked  suddenly his quick ear detected the sound of wheels in the ruts of the carriage way usually his visitors to the casa came on horseback and carts and wagons used only the lower road as the sound approached nearer an odd fancy filled his heart with unaccountable pleasure could it be mrs peyton making an unexpected visit to the rancho he held his breath the vehicle was now rolling on into the patio the clatter of hoofs and a halt were followed by the accents of womens voices one seemed familiar he rose quickly as light footsteps ran along the corridor and then the door opened impetuously to the laughing face of susy  he came towards her hastily yet with only the simple impulse of astonishment he had no thought of kissing her but as he approached she threw her charming head archly to one side with a mischievous knitting of her brows and a significant gesture towards the passage that indicated the proximity of a stranger and the possibility of interruption  hush mrs mccloskys here she whispered  mrs mcclosky repeated clarence vaguely  yes of course impatiently my aunt jane silly we just cut away down here to surprise you auntys never seen the place and here was a good chance  and your mothermrs peyton has shedoes shestammered clarence  has shedoes she mimicked susy with increasing impatience why of course she doesnt know anything about it she thinks im visiting mary rogers at oakland and i amafterwards she laughed i just wrote to aunt jane to meet me at alameda and we took the stage to santa inez and drove on here in a buggy wasnt it real fun tell me clarence you dont say anything tell mewasnt it real fun  this was all so like her old childlike charming irresponsible self that clarence troubled and bewildered as he was took her hands and drew her like a child towards him  of course she went on yet stopping to smell a rosebud in his buttonhole i have a perfect right to come to my own home goodness knows and if i bring my own aunt a married woman with mealthough loftily there may be a young unmarried gentleman alone therestill i fail to see any impropriety in it  he was still holding her but in that instant her manner had completely changed again the old susy seemed to have slipped away and evaded him and he was retaining only a conscious actress in his arms  release me mr brant please she said with a languid affected glance behind her we are not alone  then as the rustling of a skirt sounded nearer in the passage she seemed to change back to her old self once more and with a lightning flash of significance whispered  she knows everything  to add to clarences confusion the woman who entered cast a quick glance of playful meaning on the separating youthful pair she was an ineffective blonde with a certain beauty that seemed to be gradually succumbing to the ravages of paint and powder rather than years her dress appeared to have suffered from an equally unwise excess of ornamentation and trimming and she gave the general impression of having been intended for exhibition in almost any other light than the one in which she happened to be there were two or three mudstains on the laces of her sleeve and underskirt that were obtrusively incongruous her voice which had however a ring of honest intention in it was somewhat overstrained and evidently had not yet adjusted itself to the lowceilinged conventuallike building  there children dont mind me i know im not on in this scene but i got nervous waiting there in what you call the salon with only those greaser servants staring round me in a circle like a regular chorus my but its anteek hereregular anteekspanish then with a glance at clarence so this is clarence brantyour clarence interduce me susy  in his confusion of indignation pain and even a certain conception of the grim ludicrousness of the situation clarence grasped despairingly at the single sentence of susys in my own home surely at least it was her own home and as he was only the business agent of her adopted mother he had no right to dictate to her under what circumstances she should return to it or whom she should introduce there in her independence and caprice susy might easily have gone elsewhere with this astounding relative and would mrs peyton like it better clinging to this idea his instinct of hospitality asserted itself he welcomed mrs mcclosky with nervous effusion  i am only mrs peytons major domo here but any guest of her daughters is welcome  yes said mrs mcclosky with ostentatious archness i reckon susy and i understand your position here and youve got a good berth of it but we wont trouble you much on mrs peytons account will we susy and now she and me will just take a look around the shantyit is real old spanish anteek aint itand sorter take stock of it and you young folks will have to tear yourselves apart for a while and play propriety before me youve got to be on your good behavior while im here i can tell you im a heavy old dooanna aint i susy schoolmams and mother superiors aint in the game with me for discipline  she threw her arms around the young girls waist and drew her towards her affectionately an action that slightly precipitated some powder upon the black dress of her niece susy glanced mischievously at clarence but withdrew her eyes presently to let them rest with unmistakable appreciation and admiration on her relative a pang shot through clarences breast he had never seen her look in that way at mrs peyton yet here was this stranger provincial overdressed and extravagant whose vulgarity was only made tolerable through her good humor who had awakened that interest which the refined mrs peyton had never yet been able to touch as mrs mcclosky swept out of the room with susy he turned away with a sinking heart  yet it was necessary that the spanish house servants should not suspect this treason to their mistress and clarence stopped their childish curiosity about the stranger with a careless and easy acceptance of susys sudden visit in the light of an ordinary occurrence and with a familiarity towards mrs mcclosky which became the more distasteful to him in proportion as he saw that it was evidently agreeable to her but easily responsive she became speedily confidential without a single question from himself or a contributing remark from susy in half an hour she had told him her whole history how as jane silsbee an elder sister of susys mother she had early eloped from the paternal home in kansas with mcclosky a strolling actor how she had married him and gone on the stage under his stage name effectively preventing any recognition by her family how coming to california where her husband had become manager of the theatre at sacramento she was indignant to find that her only surviving relation a sisterinlaw living in the same place had for a money consideration given up all claim to the orphaned susy and how she had resolved to find out if the poor child was happy how she succeeded in finding out that she was not happy how she wrote to her and even met her secretly at san francisco and oakland and how she had undertaken this journey partly for a lark and partly to see clarence and the property there was no doubt of the speakers sincerity with this outrageous candor there was an equal obliviousness of any indelicacy in her conduct towards mrs peyton that seemed hopeless yet he must talk plainly to her he must say to her what he could not say to susy upon her mrs peytons happinesshe believed he was thinking of susys alsodepended he must take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone  that opportunity came sooner than he had expected after dinner mrs mcclosky turned to susy and playfully telling her that she had to talk business with mr brant bade her go to the salon and await her when the young girl left the room she looked at clarence and with that assumption of curtness with which coarse but kindly natures believe they overcome the difficulty of delicate subjects said abruptly  well young man now whats all this between you and susy im looking after her interestssame as if she was my own girl if youve got anything to say nows your time and dont you shillyshally too long over it either for you might as well know that a girl like that can have her pick and choice and be beholden to no one and when she dont care to choose theres me and my husband ready to do for her all the same we mightnt be able to do the anteek spanish squire but weve got our own line of business and its a comfortable one  to have this said to him under the roof of mrs peyton from whom in his sensitiveness he had thus far jealously guarded his own secret was even more than clarences gentleness could stand and fixed his wavering resolution  i dont think we quite understand each other mrs mcclosky he said coldly but with glittering eyes i have certainly something to say to you if it is not on a subject as pleasant as the one you propose it is nevertheless one that i think you and i are more competent to discuss together  then with quiet but unrelenting directness he pointed out to her that susy was a legally adopted daughter of mrs peyton and as a minor utterly under her control that mrs peyton had no knowledge of any opposing relatives and that susy had not only concealed the fact from her but that he was satisfied that mrs peyton did not even know of susys discontent and alienation that she had tenderly and carefully brought up the helpless orphan as her own child and even if she had not gained her affection was at least entitled to her obedience and respect that while susys girlish caprice and inexperience excused her conduct mrs peyton and her friends would have a right to expect more consideration from a person of mrs mccloskys maturer judgment that for these reasons and as the friend of mrs peyton whom he could alone recognize as susys guardian and the arbiter of her affections he must decline to discuss the young girl with any reference to himself or his own intentions  an unmistakable flush asserted itself under the ladys powder  suit yourself young man suit yourself she said with equally direct resentment and antagonism only mebbee youll let me tell you that jim mcclosky aint no fool and mebbee knows what lawyers think of an arrangement with a sisterinlaw that leaves a real sister out mebbee thats a sisters title you aint thought of mr brant and mebbee youll find out that your chance o gettin mrs peytons consent aint as safe to gamble on as you reckon it is and mebbee whats more to the purpose if you did get it it might not be just the trump card to fetch susy with and to wind up mr brant when you do have to come down to the bedrock and me and jim mcclosky you may find out that him and me have discovered a better match for susy than the son of old ham brant who is trying to play the spanish grandee off his fathers money on a couple of women and we maynt have to go far to do itor to get the real thing mr brant  too heartsick and disgusted to even notice the slur upon himself or the import of her last words clarence only rose and bowed as she jumped up from the table but as she reached the door he said half appealingly  whatever are your other intentions mrs mcclosky as we are both susys guests i beg you will say nothing of this to her while we are here and particularly that you will not allow her to think for a moment that i have discussed my relations to her with anybody  she flung herself out of the door without a reply but on entering the dark lowceilinged drawingroom she was surprised to find that susy was not there she was consequently obliged to return to the veranda where clarence had withdrawn and to somewhat ostentatiously demand of the servants that susy should be sent to her room at once but the young girl was not in her own room and was apparently nowhere to be found clarence who had now fully determined as a last resource to make a direct appeal to susy herself listened to this fruitless search with some concern she could not have gone out in the rain which was again falling she might be hiding somewhere to avoid a recurrence of the scene she had perhaps partly overheard he turned into the corridor that led to mrs peytons boudoir as he knew that it was locked he was surprised to see by the dim light of the hanging lamp that a duplicate key to the one in his desk was in the lock it must be susys and the young girl had probably taken refuge there he knocked gently there was a rustle in the room and the sound of a chair being moved but no reply impelled by a sudden instinct he opened the door and was met by a cool current of air from some open window at the same moment the figure of susy approached him from the semidarkness of the interior  i did not know you were here said clarence much relieved he knew not why but i am glad for i wanted to speak with you alone for a few moments  she did not reply but he drew a match from his pocket and lit the two candles which he knew stood on the table the wick of one was still warm as if it had been recently extinguished as the light slowly radiated he could see that she was regarding him with an air of affected unconcern but a somewhat heightened color it was like her and not inconsistent with his idea that she had come there to avoid an after scene with mrs mcclosky or himself or perhaps both the room was not disarranged in any way the window that was opened was the casement of the deep embrasured one in the rear wall and the light curtain before it still swayed occasionally in the night wind  im afraid i had a row with your aunt susy he began lightly in his old familiar way but i had to tell her i didnt think her conduct to mrs peyton was exactly the square thing towards one who had been as devoted to you as she has been  oh for goodness sake dont go over all that again said susy impatiently ive had enough of it  clarence flashed but recovered himself  then you overheard what i said and know what i think he said calmly  i knew it before said the young girl with a slight supercilious toss of the head and yet a certain abstraction of manner as she went to the window and closed it anybody could see it i know you always wanted me to stay here with mrs peyton and be coddled and monitored and catechised and shut up away from any one until you had been coddled and monitored and catechised by somebody else sufficiently to suit her ideas of your being a fit husband for me i told aunty it was no use our coming here toto  to do what asked clarence  to put some spirit into you said the young girl turning upon him sharply to keep you from being tied to that womans apronstrings to keep her from making a slave of you as she would of me but it is of no use mary rogers was right when she said you had no wish to please anybody but mrs peyton and no eyes for anybody but her and if it hadnt been too ridiculous considering her age and yours shed say you were dead in love with her  for an instant clarence felt the blood rush to his face and then sink away leaving him pale and cold the room which had seemed to whirl around him and then fade away returned with appalling distinctnessthe distinctness of memoryand a vision of the first day that he had seen mrs peyton sitting there as he seemed to see her now for the first time there flashed upon him the conviction that the young girl had spoken the truth and had brusquely brushed the veil from his foolish eyes he was in love with mrs peyton that was what his doubts and hesitation regarding susy meant that alone was the source secret and limit of his vague ambition  but with the conviction came a singular calm in the last few moments he seemed to have grown older to have loosed the bonds of old companionship with susy and the later impression she had given him of her mature knowledge and moved on far beyond her years and experience and it was with an authority that was half paternal and in a voice he himself scarcely recognized that he said  if i did not know you were prejudiced by a foolish and indiscreet woman i should believe that you were trying to insult me as you have your adopted mother and would save you the pain of doing both in her house by leaving it now and forever but because i believe you are controlled against your best instinct by that woman i shall remain here with you to frustrate her as best i can or until i am able to lay everything before mrs peyton except the foolish speech you have just made  the young girl laughed why not that one too while youre about it see what shell say  i shall tell her continued clarence calmly only what you yourself have made it necessary for me to tell her to save you from folly and disgrace and only enough to spare her the mortification of hearing it first from her own servants  hearing what from her own servants what do you mean how dare you demanded the young girl sharply  she was quite real in her anxiety now although her attitude of virtuous indignation struck him as being like all her emotional expression namely acting  i mean that the servants know of your correspondence with mrs mcclosky and that she claims to be your aunt returned clarence they know that you confided to pepita they believe that either mrs mcclosky or you have seen  he had stopped suddenly he was about to say that the servants particularly incarnacion knew that pedro had boasted of having met susy when for the first time the tremendous significance of what he had hitherto considered as merely an idle falsehood flashed upon him  seen whom repeated susy in a higher voice impatiently stamping her foot  clarence looked at her and in her excited questioning face saw a confirmation of his still halfformed suspicions in his own abrupt pause and knitted eyebrows she must have read his thoughts also their eyes met her violet pupils dilated trembled and then quickly shifted as she suddenly stiffened into an attitude of scornful indifference almost grotesque in its unreality his eyes slowly turned to the window the door the candles on the table and the chair before it and then came back to her face again then he drew a deep breath  i give no heed to the idle gossip of servants susy he said slowly i have no belief that you have ever contemplated anything worse than an act of girlish folly or the gratification of a passing caprice neither do i want to appeal to you or frighten you but i must tell you now that i know certain facts that might make such a simple act of folly monstrous inconceivable in you and almost accessory to a crime i can tell you no more but so satisfied am i of such a possibility that i shall not scruple to take any meansthe strongestto prevent even the remotest chance of it your aunt has been looking for you you had better go to her now i will close the room and lock the door meantime i should advise you not to sit so near an open window with a candle at night in this locality even if it might not be dangerous for you it might be fatal to the foolish creatures it might attract  he took the key from the door as he held it open for her to pass out she uttered a shrill little laugh like a nervous mischievous child and slipping out of her previous artificial attitude as if it had been a mantle ran out of the room     chapter x   as susys footsteps died away clarence closed the door walked to the window and examined it closely the bars had been restored since he had wrenched them off to give ingress to the family on the day of recapture he glanced around the room nothing seemed to have been disturbed nevertheless he was uneasy the suspicions of a frank trustful nature when once aroused are apt to be more general and farreaching than the specific distrusts of the disingenuous for they imply the overthrow of a whole principle and not a mere detail clarences conviction that susy had seen pedro recently since his dismissal led him into the wildest surmises of her motives it was possible that without her having reason to suspect pedros greater crime he might have confided to her his intention of reclaiming the property and installing her as the mistress and chatelaine of the rancho the idea was one that might have appealed to susys theatrical imagination he recalled mrs mccloskys sneer at his own pretensions and her vague threats of a rival of more lineal descent the possible infidelity of susy to himself touched him lightly when the first surprise was over indeed it scarcely could be called infidelity if she knew and believed mary rogerss discovery and the conviction that he and she had really never loved each other now enabled him as he believed to look at her conduct dispassionately yet it was her treachery to mrs peyton and not to himself that impressed him most and perhaps made him equally unjust through his affections  he extinguished the candles partly from some vague precautions he could not explain and partly to think over his fears in the abstraction and obscurity of the semidarkness the higher windows suffused a faint light on the ceiling and assisted by the dark lanternlike glow cast on the opposite wall by the tunnel of the embrasured window the familiar outlines of the room and its furniture came back to him somewhat in this fashion also in the obscurity and quiet came back to him the events he had overlooked and forgotten he recalled now some gossip of the servants and hints dropped by susy of a violent quarrel between peyton and pedro which resulted in pedros dismissal but which now seemed clearly attributable to some graver cause than inattention and insolence he recalled mary rogerss playful pleasantries with susy about pedro and susys mysterious air which he had hitherto regarded only as part of her exaggeration he remembered mrs peytons unwarrantable uneasiness about susy which he had either overlooked or referred entirely to himself she must have suspected something to his quickened imagination in this ruin of his faith and trust he believed that hookers defection was either part of the conspiracy or that he had run away to avoid being implicated with susy in its discovery this too was the significance of gilroys parting warning he and mrs peyton alone had been blind and confiding in the midst of this treachery and even he had been blind to his own real affections  the wind had risen again and the faint light on the opposite wall grew tremulous and shifting with the movement of the foliage without but presently the glow became quite obliterated as if by the intervention of some opaque body outside the window he rose hurriedly and went to the casement but at the same moment he fancied he heard the jamming of a door or window in quite another direction and his examination of the casement before him showed him only the silver light of the thinly clouded sky falling uninterruptedly through the bars and foliage on the interior of the whitewashed embrasure then a conception of his mistake flashed across him the line of the casa was long straggling and exposed elsewhere why should the attempt to enter or communicate with any one within be confined only to this single point and why not satisfy himself at once if any trespassers were lounging around the walls and then confront them boldly in the open their discovery and identification was as important as the defeat of their intentions  he relit the candle and placing it on a small table by the wall beyond the visual range of the window rearranged the curtain so that while it permitted the light to pass out it left the room in shadow he then opened the door softly locked it behind him and passed noiselessly into the hall susys and mrs mccloskys rooms were at the further end of the passage but between them and the boudoir was the open patio and the low murmur of the voices of servants who still lingered until he should dismiss them for the night turning back he moved silently down the passage until he reached the narrow arched door to the garden this he unlocked and opened with the same stealthy caution the rain had recommenced not daring to risk a return to his room he took from a peg in the recess an old waterproof cloak and souwester of peytons which still hung there and passed out into the night locking the door behind him to keep the knowledge of his secret patrol from the stablemen he did not attempt to take out his own horse but trusted to find some vacqueros mustang in the corral by good luck an old blue grass hack of peytons nearest the stockade as he entered allowed itself to be quickly caught using its rope headstall for a bridle clarence vaulted on its bare back and paced cautiously out into the road here he kept the curve of the long line of stockade until he reached the outlying field where half hidden in the withered sapless but still standing stalks of grain he slowly began a circuit of the casa  the misty gray dome above him which an invisible moon seemed to have quicksilvered over alternately lightened and darkened with passing gusts of fine rain nevertheless he could see the outline of the broad quadrangle of the house quite distinctly except on the west side where a fringe of writhing willows beat the brown adobe walls with their imploring arms at every gust elsewhere nothing moved the view was uninterrupted to where the shining watery sky met the equally shining watery plain he had already made a half circuit of the house and was still noiselessly picking his way along the furrows muffled with soaked and brokendown blades and the velvety upspringing of the volunteer growth when suddenly not fifty yards before him without sound or warning a figure rode out of the grain upon the open crossroad and deliberately halted with a listless abstracted waiting air clarence instantly recognized one of his own vacqueros an undersized halfbreed but he as instantly divined that he was only an outpost or confederate stationed to give the alarm the same precaution had prevented each hearing the other and the lesser height of the vacquero had rendered him indistinguishable as he preceded clarence among the grain as the young man made no doubt that the real trespasser was nearer the casa along the line of willows he wheeled to intercept him without alarming his sentry unfortunately his horse answered the rope bridle clumsily and splashed in striking out the watcher quickly raised his head and clarence knew that his only chance was now to suppress him determined to do this at any hazard with a threatening gesture he charged boldly down upon him  but he had not crossed half the distance between them when the man uttered an appalling cry so wild and despairing that it seemed to chill even the hot blood in clarences veins and dashed frenziedly down the crossroad into the interminable plain before clarence could determine if that cry was a signal or an involuntary outburst it was followed instantly by the sound of frightened and struggling hoofs clattering against the wall of the casa and a swaying of the shrubbery near the back gate of the patio here was his real quarry without hesitation he dug his heels into the flanks of his horse and rode furiously towards it as he approached a long tremor seemed to pass through the shrubbery with the retreating sound of horse hoofs the unseen trespasser had evidently taken the alarm and was fleeing and clarence dashed in pursuit following the sound for the shrubbery hid the fugitive from view he passed the last wall of the casa but it soon became evident that the unknown had the better horse the hoofbeats grew fainter and fainter and at times appeared even to cease until his own approach started them again eventually to fade away in the distance in vain clarence dug his heels into the flanks of his heavier steed and regretted his own mustang and when at last he reached the edge of the thicket he had lost both sight and sound of the fugitive the descent to the lower terrace lay before him empty and desolate the man had escaped  he turned slowly back with baffled anger and vindictiveness however he had prevented something although he knew not what the principal had got away but he had identified his confederate and for the first time held a clue to his mysterious visitant there was no use to alarm the household which did not seem to have been disturbed the trespassers were far away by this time and the attempt would hardly be repeated that night he made his way quietly back to the corral let loose his horse and regained the casa unobserved he unlocked the arched door in the wall reentered the darkened passage stopped a moment to open the door of the boudoir glance at the closely fastened casement and extinguish the still burning candle and relocking the door securely made his way to his own room  but he could not sleep the whole incident over so quickly had nevertheless impressed him deeply and yet like a dream the strange yell of the vacquero still rang in his ears but with an unearthly and superstitious significance that was even more dreamlike in its meaning he awakened from a fitful slumber to find the light of morning in the room and incarnacion standing by his bedside  the yellow face of the steward was greenish with terror and his lips were dry  get up senor clarencio get up at once my master strange things have happened mother of god protect us  clarence rolled to his feet with the events of the past night struggling back upon his consciousness  what mean you nascio he said grasping the mans arm which was still mechanically making the sign of the cross as he muttered incoherently speak i command you  it is jose the little vacquero who is even now at the padres house raving as a lunatic stricken as a madman with terror he has seen himthe dead alive save us  are you mad yourself nascio said clarence whom has he seen  whom god help us the old padronsenor peyton himself he rushed towards him here in the patio last nightout of the air the sky the ground he knew nothis own self wrapped in his old storm cloak and hat and riding his own horseerect terrible and menacing with an awful hand upholding a ropeso he saw him with these eyes as i see you what he said to him god knows the priest perhaps for he has made confession  in a flash of intelligence clarence comprehended all he rose grimly and began to dress himself  not a word of this to the womento any one nascio dost thou understand he said curtly it may be that jose has been partaking too freely of aguardienteit is possible i will see the priest myself but what possesses thee collect thyself good nascio  but the man was still trembling  it is not allmother of god it is not all master he stammered dropping to his knees and still crossing himself this morning beside the corral they find the horse of pedro valdez splashed and spattered on saddle and bridle and in the stirrupdost thou hear the stirruphanging the tornoff boot of valdez ah god the same as his now do you understand it is his vengeance no jesu forgive me it is the vengeance of god  clarence was staggered  and you have not found valdez you have looked for him he said hurriedly throwing on his clothes  everywhereall over the plain the whole rancho has been out since sunrisehere and there and everywhere and there is nothing of course not what would you he pointed solemnly to the ground  nonsense said clarence buttoning his coat and seizing his hat follow me  he ran down the passage followed by incarnacion through the excited gesticulating crowd of servants in the patio and out of the back gate he turned first along the wall of the casa towards the barred window of the boudoir then a cry came from incarnacion  they ran quickly forward hanging from the grating of the window like a mass of limp and saturated clothes was the body of pedro valdez with one unbooted foot dangling within an inch of the ground his head was passed inside the grating and fixed as at that moment when the first spring of the frightened horse had broken his neck between the bars as in a garrote and the second plunge of the terrified animal had carried off his boot in the caught stirrup when it escaped     chapter xi   the winter rains were over and gone and the whole long line of californian coast was dashed with color there were miles of yellow and red poppies leagues of lupines that painted the gently rounded hills with soft primary hues and long continuous slopes like low mountain systems of daisies and dandelions at sacramento it was already summer the yellow river was flashing and intolerable the tule and marsh grasses were lush and long the bloom of cottonwood and sycamore whitened the outskirts of the city and as cyrus hopkins and his daughter phoebe looked from the veranda of the placer hotel accustomed as they were to the cool trade winds of the coast valleys they felt homesick from the memory of eastern heats  later when they were surveying the long dinner tables at the table dhote with something of the uncomfortable and shamefaced loneliness of the provincial phoebe uttered a slight cry and clutched her fathers arm mr hopkins stayed the play of his squared elbows and glanced inquiringly at his daughters face there was a pretty animation in it as she pointed to a figure that had just entered it was that of a young man attired in the extravagance rather than the taste of the prevailing fashion which did not however in the least conceal a decided rusticity of limb and movement a long mustache which looked unkempt even in its pomatumed stiffness and lank dark hair that had bent but never curled under the barbers iron made him notable even in that heterogeneous assembly  thats he whispered phoebe  who said her father  alas for the inconsistencies of love the blush came with the name and not the vision  mr hooker she stammered  it was indeed jim hooker but the role of his exaggeration was no longer the same the remorseful gloom in which he had been habitually steeped had changed into a fatigued yet haughty fastidiousness more in keeping with his fashionable garments he was more peaceful yet not entirely placable and as he sat down at a side table and pulled down his striped cuffs with his clasped fingers he cast a glance of critical disapproval on the general company nevertheless he seemed to be furtively watchful of his effect upon them and as one or two whispered and looked towards him his consciousness became darkly manifest  all of which might have intimidated the gentle phoebe but did not discompose her father he rose and crossing over to hookers table clapped him heartily on the back  how do hooker i didnt recognize you in them fine clothes but phoebe guessed as how it was you  flushed disconcerted irritated but always in wholesome awe of mr hopkins jim returned his greeting awkwardly and half hysterically how he would have received the more timid phoebe is another question but mr hopkins without apparently noticing these symptoms went on  were only just down phoebe and me and as i guess well want to talk over old times well come alongside o you hold on and ill fetch her  the interval gave the unhappy jim a chance to recover himself to regain his vanished cuffs display his heavy watchchain curl his mustache and otherwise reassume his air of blase fastidiousness but the transfer made phoebe after shaking hands became speechless under these perfections not so her father  if theres anything in looks you seem to be prospering he said grimly unless youre in the tailorin line and youre only showin off stock what mout ye be doing  ye aint bin long in sacramento i reckon suggested jim with patronizing pity  no we only came this morning returned hopkins  and you aint bin to the theatre continued jim  no  nor moved much ininginral fashnable sassiety  not yet interposed phoebe with an air of faint apology  nor seen any of them large posters on the fences of the prairie flower or redhanded dickthreeact play with five tableauxjust the biggest sensation outrunnin for forty nightsmoney turned away every nightstandin room only continued jim with prolonged toleration  no  well i play redhanded dick i thought you might have seen it and recognized me all those people over there darkly indicating the long table know me a fellow cant stand it you know being stared at by such a vulgar lowbred lot its gettin too fresh here ill have to give the landlord notice and cut the whole hotel they dont seem to have ever seen a gentleman and a professional before  then youre a playactor now said the farmer in a tone which did not however exhibit the exact degree of admiration which shone in phoebes eyes  for the present said jim with lofty indifference you see i was inin partnership with mcclosky the manager and i didnt like the style of the chump that was doin redhanded dick so i offered to take his place one night to show him how and by jinks the audience after that night wouldnt let anybody else play itwouldnt stand even the biggest highestpriced stars in it i reckon he added gloomily ill have to run the darned thing in all the big towns in californyif i dont have to go east with it after all just for the business but its an awful grind on a manleaves him no time along of the invitations he gets and what with being run after in the streets and stared at in the hotels he dont get no privacy theres men and women too over at that table that just lie in wait for me here till i come and dont lift their eyes off me i wonder they dont bring their operyglasses with them  concerned sympathizing and indignant poor phoebe turned her brown head and honest eyes in that direction but because they were honest they could not help observing that the other table did not seem to be paying the slightest attention to the distinguished impersonator of redhanded dick perhaps he had been overheard  then that was the reason ye didnt come back to your location i always guessed it was because youd got wind of the smashup down there afore we did said hopkins grimly  what smashup asked jim with slightly resentful quickness  why the smashup of the sisters titledidnt you hear that  there was a slight movement of relief and a return of gloomy hauteur in jims manner  no we dont know much of what goes on in the cow counties up here  ye mout considerin it concerns some o your friends returned hopkins dryly for the sisters title went smash as soon as it was known that pedro valdezthe man as started ithad his neck broken outside the walls o robles rancho and they do say as this yer brant your friend had suthin to do with the breaking of it though it was laid to the ghost of old peyton anyhow there was such a big skeer that one of the greaser gang who thought hed seen the ghost being a papist to save his everlasting soul went to the priest and confessed but the priest wouldnt give him absolution until hed blown the hull thing and made it public and then it turned out that all the dockyments for the title and even the customhouse paper were forged by pedro valdez and put on the market by his confederates and thats just where your friend clarence brant comes in for he had bought up the whole title from them fellers now either as some say he was in the fraud from the beginnin and never paid anything or else he was an allfired fool and had parted with his money like one some allow that the reason was that he was awfully sweet on mrs peytons adopted daughter and ez the parents didnt approve of him he did this so as to get a holt over them by the property but hes a ruined man anyway now for they say hes such a darned fool that hes goin to pay for all the improvements that the folks who bought under him put into the land and thatll take his last cent i thought id tell you that for i suppose youve lost a heap in your improvements and will put in your claim  i reckon i put nearly as much into it as clar brant did said jim gloomily but i aint goin to take a cent from him or go back on him now  the rascal could not resist this last mendacious opportunity although he was perfectly sincere in his renunciation touched in his sympathy and there was even a film of moisture in his shifting eyes  phoebe was thrilled with the generosity of this noble being who could be unselfish even in his superior condition she added softly  and they say that the girl did not care for him at all but was actually going to run off with pedro when he stopped her and sent for mrs peyton  to her surprise jims face flushed violently  its all a dodblasted lie he said in a thick stage whisper its only the hogwash them greasers and pike county galoots ladle out to each other around the stove in a county grocery but recalling himself loftily and with a tolerant wave of his bediamonded hand wot kin you expect from one of them cow counties they aint satisfied till they drive every gentleman out of the darned gopherholes they call their kentry  in her admiration of what she believed to be a loyal outburst for his friend phoebe overlooked the implied sneer at her provincial home but her father went on with a perfunctory exasperating dusty aridity  that mebbee ez mebbee mr hooker but the story down in our precinct goes that she gave mrs peyton the slipchucked up her situation as adopted darter and went off with a queer sort of a cirkiss womanone of her own kin and i reckon one of her own kind  to this mr hooker offered no further reply than a withering rebuke of the waiter a genteel abstraction and a lofty change of subject he pressed upon them two tickets for the performance of which he seemed to have a number neatly clasped in an indiarubber band and advised them to come early they would see him after the performance and sup together he must leave them now as he had to be punctually at the theatre and if he lingered he should be pestered by interviewers he withdrew under a dazzling display of cuff and white handkerchief and with that inward swing of the arm and slight bowiness of the leg generally recognized in his profession as the lounging exit of high comedy  the mingling of awe and an uneasy sense of changed relations which that meeting with jim had brought to phoebe was not lessened when she entered the theatre with her father that evening and even mr hopkins seemed to share her feelings the theatre was large and brilliant in decoration the seats were well filled with the same heterogeneous mingling she had seen in the diningroom at the placer hotel but in the parquet were some fashionable costumes and cultivated faces mr hopkins was not altogether so sure that jim had been only gassing but the gorgeous drop curtain representing an allegory of californian prosperity and abundance presently uprolled upon a scene of western life almost as striking in its glaring unreality from a roseclad english cottage in a subtropical landscape skipped rosalie the prairie flower the briefest of skirts the most unsullied of stockings the tiniest of slippers and the few diamonds that glittered on her fair neck and fingers revealed at once the simple and unpretending daughter of the american backwoodsman a tumult of delighted greeting broke from the audience the bright color came to the pink girlish cheeks gratified vanity danced in her violet eyes and as she piquantly bowed her acknowledgments this great breath of praise seemed to transfigure and possess her a very young actor who represented the giddy world in a straw hat and with an effeminate manner was alternately petted and girded at by her during the opening exposition of the plot until the statement that a dark destiny obliged her to follow her uncle in an emigrant train across the plains closed the act apparently extinguished him and left her the central figure so far she evidently was the favorite a singular aversion to her crept into the heart of phoebe  but the second act brought an indian attack upon the emigrant train and here rosalie displayed the archest heroism and the pinkest and most distracting selfpossession in marked contrast to the giddy worldling who having accompanied her apparently for comic purposes best known to himself cowered abjectly under wagons and was pulled ignominiously out of straw until red dick swept out of the wings with a chosen band and a burst of revolvers and turned the tide of victory attired as a picturesque combination of the neapolitan smuggler riverbar miner and mexican vacquero jim hooker instantly began to justify the plaudits that greeted him and the most sanguinary hopes of the audience a gloomy but fascinating cloud of gunpowder and dark intrigue from that moment hung about the stage  yet in this sombre obscuration rosalie had passed a happy six months coming out with her character and stockings equally unchanged and unblemished to be rewarded with the hand of red dick and the discovery of her father the governor of new mexico as a whitehaired but objectionable vacquero at the fall of the curtain  through this exciting performance phoebe sat with a vague and increasing sense of loneliness and distrust she did not know that hooker had added to his ordinary inventive exaggeration the form of dramatic composition but she had early detected the singular fact that such shadowy outlines of plot as the piece possessed were evidently based on his previous narrative of his own experiences and the saving of susy peytonby himself there was the episode of their being lost on the plains as he had already related it to her with the addition of a few years to susys age and some vivid picturesqueness to himself as red dick she was not of course aware that the part of the giddy worldling was jims own conception of the character of clarence but what even to her provincial taste seemed the extravagance of the piece she felt in some way reflected upon the truthfulness of the story she had heard it seemed to be a parody on himself and in the laughter which some of the most thrilling points produced in certain of the audience she heard an echo of her own doubts but even this she could have borne if jims confidence had not been given to the general public it was no longer hers alone she shared it with them and this strange bold girl who acted with himthe blanche belville of the billshow often he must have told her the story and yet how badly she had learned it it was not her own idea of it nor of him in the last extravagant scene she turned her weary and halfshamed eyes from the stage and looked around the theatre among a group of loungers by the wall a face that seemed familiar was turned towards her own with a look of kindly and sympathetic recognition it was the face of clarence brant when the curtain fell and she and her father rose to go he was at their side he seemed older and more superior looking than she had ever thought him before and there was a gentle yet sad wisdom in his eyes and voice that comforted her even while it made her feel like crying  you are satisfied that no harm has come to our friend he said pleasantly of course you recognized him  oh yes we met him today said phoebe her provincial pride impelled her to keep up a show of security and indifference we are going to supper with him  clarence slightly lifted his brows  you are more fortunate than i am he said smilingly i only arrived here at seven and i must leave at midnight  phoebe hesitated a moment then said with affected carelessness  what do you think of the young girl who plays with him do you know her who is she  he looked at her quickly and then said with some surprise  did he not tell you  she was the adopted daughter of mrs peytonmiss susan silsbee he said gravely  then she did run away from home as they said said phoebe impulsively  not exactly as they said said clarence gently she elected to make her home with her aunt mrs mcclosky who is the wife of the manager of this theatre and she adopted the profession a month ago as it now appears that there was some informality in the old articles of guardianship mrs peyton would have been powerless to prevent her from doing either even if she had wished to  the infelicity of questioning clarence regarding susy suddenly flashed upon the forgetful phoebe and she colored yet although sad he did not look like a rejected lover  of course if she is here with her own relatives that makes all the difference she said gently it is protection  certainly said clarence  and continued phoebe hesitatingly she is playing withwithan old friendmr hooker  that is quite proper too considering their relations said clarence tolerantly  idontunderstand stammered phoebe  the slightly cynical smile on clarences face changed as he looked into phoebes eyes  ive just heard that they are married he returned gently     chapter xii   nowhere had the long season of flowers brought such glory as to the broad plains and slopes of robles rancho by some fortuitous chance of soil or flood or drifting pollen the three terraces had each taken a distinct and separate blossom and tint of color the straggling line of corral the crumbling wall of the old garden the outlying chapel and even the brown walls of the casa itself were half sunken in the tall racemes of crowding lupines until from the distance they seemed to be slowly settling in the profundity of a darkblue sea the second terrace was a leaguelong flow of gray and gold daisies in which the cattle dazedly wandered midleg deep a perpetual sunshine of yellow dandelions lay upon the third the gentle slope to the darkgreen canada was a broad cataract of crimson poppies everywhere where water had stood great patches of color had taken its place it seemed as if the rains had ceased only that the broken heavens might drop flowers  never before had its beautya beauty that seemed built upon a cruel youthful obliterating forgetfulness of the paststruck clarence as keenly as when he had made up his mind that he must leave the place forever for the tale of his mischance and illfortune as told by hopkins was unfortunately true when he discovered that in his desire to save peytons house by the purchase of the sisters title he himself had been the victim of a gigantic fraud he accepted the loss of the greater part of his fortune with resignation and was even satisfied by the thought that he had at least effected the possession of the property for mrs peyton but when he found that those of his tenants who had bought under him had acquired only a dubious possession of their lands and no title he had unhesitatingly reimbursed them for their improvements with the last of his capital only the lawless gilroy had goodhumoredly declined the quiet acceptance of the others did not unfortunately preclude their settled belief that clarence had participated in the fraud and that even now his restitution was making a dangerous precedent subversive of the best interests of the state and discouraging to immigration some doubted his sanity only one struck with the sincerity of his motive hesitated to take his money with a look of commiseration on his face  are you not satisfied asked clarence smiling  yes but  but what  nothin only i was thinkin that a man like you must feel awful lonesome in calforny  lonely he was indeed but his loneliness was not the loss of fortune nor what it might bring perhaps he had never fully realized his wealth it had been an accident rather than a custom of his life and when it had failed in the only test he had made of its power it is to be feared that he only sentimentally regretted it it was too early yet for him to comprehend the veiled blessings of the catastrophe in its merciful disruption of habits and ways of life his loneliness was still the hopeless solitude left by vanished ideals and overthrown idols he was satisfied that he had never cared for susy but he still cared for the belief that he had  after the discovery of pedros body that fatal morning a brief but emphatic interview between himself and mrs mcclosky had followed he had insisted upon her immediately accompanying susy and himself to mrs peyton in san francisco horrorstricken and terrified at the catastrophe and frightened by the strange looks of the excited servants they did not dare to disobey him he had left them with mrs peyton in the briefest preliminary interview during which he spoke only of the catastrophe shielding the woman from the presumption of having provoked it and urging only the importance of settling the question of guardianship at once it was odd that mrs peyton had been less disturbed than he imagined she would be at even his charitable version of susys unfaithfulness to her it even seemed to him that she had already suspected it but as he was about to withdraw to leave her to meet them alone she had stopped him suddenly  what would you advise me to do  it was his first interview with her since the revelation of his own feelings he looked into the pleading troubled eyes of the woman he now knew he had loved and stammered  you alone can judge only you must remember that one cannot force an affection any more than one can prevent it  he felt himself blushing and conscious of the construction of his words he even fancied that she was displeased  then you have no preference she said a little impatiently  none  she made a slight gesture with her handsome shoulders but she only said i should have liked to have pleased you in this and turned coldly away he had left without knowing the result of the interview but a few days later he received a letter from her stating that she had allowed susy to return to her aunt and that she had resigned all claims to her guardianship  it seemed to be a foregone conclusion she wrote and although i cannot think such a change will be for her permanent welfare it is her present wish and who knows indeed if the change will be permanent i have not allowed the legal question to interfere with my judgment although her friends must know that she forfeits any claim upon the estate by her action but at the same time in the event of her suitable marriage i should try to carry out what i believe would have been mr peytons wishes  there were a few lines of postscript it seems to me that the change would leave you more free to consult your own wishes in regard to continuing your friendship with susy and upon such a footing as may please you i judge from mrs mccloskys conversation that she believed you thought you were only doing your duty in reporting to me and that the circumstances had not altered the good terms in which you all three formerly stood  clarence had dropped the letter with a burning indignation that seemed to sting his eyes until a scalding moisture hid the words before him what might not susy have said what exaggeration of his affection was she not capable of suggesting he recalled mrs mcclosky and remembered her easy acceptance of him as susys lover what had they told mrs peyton what must be her opinion of his deceit towards herself it was hard enough to bear this before he knew he loved her it was intolerable now and this is what she meant when she suggested that he should renew his old terms with susy it was for him that this illdisguised scornful generosity in regard to susys pecuniary expectations was intended what should he do he would write to her and indignantly deny any clandestine affection for susy but could he do that in honor in truthfulness would it not be better to write and confess all yeseverything  fortunately for his still boyish impulsiveness it was at this time that the discovery of his own financial ruin came to him the inquest on the body of pedro valdez and the confession of his confidant had revealed the facts of the fraudulent title and forged testamentary documents although it was correctly believed that pedro had met his death in an escapade of gallantry or intrigue the coroners jury had returned a verdict of accidental death and the lesser scandal was lost in the wider farspreading disclosure of fraud when he had resolved to assume all the liabilities of his purchase he was obliged to write to mrs peyton and confess his ruin but he was glad to remind her that it did not alter her status or security he had only given her the possession and she would revert to her original and now uncontested title but as there was now no reason for his continuing the stewardship and as he must adopt some profession and seek his fortune elsewhere he begged her to relieve him of his duty albeit written with a throbbing heart and suffused eyes it was a plain businesslike and practical letter her reply was equally cool and matter of fact she was sorry to hear of his losses although she could not agree with him that they could logically sever his present connection with the rancho or that placed upon another and distinctly business footing the occupation would not be as remunerative to him as any other but of course if he had a preference for some more independent position that was another question although he would forgive her for using the privilege of her years to remind him that his financial and business success had not yet justified his independence she would also advise him not to decide hastily or at least to wait until she had again thoroughly gone over her husbands papers with her lawyer in reference to the old purchase of the sisters title and the conditions under which it was bought she knew that mr brant would not refuse this as a matter of business nor would that friendship which she valued so highly allow him to imperil the possession of the rancho by leaving it at such a moment as soon as she had finished the examination of the papers she would write again her letter seemed to leave him no hope if indeed he had ever indulged in any it was the practical kindliness of a woman of business nothing more as to the examination of her husbands papers that was a natural precaution he alone knew that they would give no record of a transaction which had never occurred he briefly replied that his intention to seek another situation was unchanged but that he would cheerfully await the arrival of his successor two weeks passed then mr sanderson mrs peytons lawyer arrived bringing an apologetic note from mrs peyton she was so sorry her business was still delayed but as she had felt that she had no right to detain him entirely at robles she had sent to mr sanderson to temporarily relieve him that he might be free to look around him or visit san francisco in reference to his own business only extracting a promise from him that he would return to robles to meet her at the end of the week before settling upon anything  the bitter smile with which clarence had read thus far suddenly changed some mysterious touch of unbusinesslike but womanly hesitation that he had never noticed in her previous letters gave him a faint sense of pleasure as if her note had been perfumed he had availed himself of the offer it was on this visit to sacramento that he had accidentally discovered the marriage of susy and hooker  its a great deal better business for her to have a husband in the profesh if shes agoin to stick to it said his informant mrs mcclosky and shes nothing if she aint business and profesh mr brant i never see a girl that was born for the stageyes you might say jess cut out o the boards of the stageas that girl susy is and thats jest whats the matter and you know it and i know it and there you are  it was with these experiences that clarence was today reentering the wooded and rocky gateway of the rancho from the high road of the canada but as he cantered up the first slope through the drift of scarlet poppies that almost obliterated the track and the blue and yellow blooms of the terraces again broke upon his view he thought only of mrs peytons pleasure in this changed aspect of her old home she had told him of it once before and of her delight in it and he had once thought how happy he should be to see it with her  the servant who took his horse told him that the senora had arrived that morning from santa inez bringing with her the two senoritas hernandez from the rancho of los canejos and that other guests were expected and there was the senor sanderson and his reverence padre esteban truly an affair of hospitality the first since the padron died whatever dream clarence might have had of opportunities for confidential interview was rudely dispelled yet mrs peyton had left orders to be informed at once of don clarencios arrival  as he crossed the patio and stepped upon the corridor he fancied he already detected in the internal arrangements the subtle influence of mrs peytons taste and the indefinable domination of the mistress for an instant he thought of anticipating the servant and seeking her in the boudoir but some instinct withheld him and he turned into the study which he had used as an office it was empty a few embers glimmered on the hearth at the same moment there was a light step behind him and mrs peyton entered and closed the door behind her she was very beautiful although paler and thinner there was an odd sort of animation about her so unlike her usual repose that it seemed almost feverish  i thought we could talk together a few moments before the guests arrive the house will be presently so full and my duties as hostess commence  i wasabout to seek youinin the boudoir hesitated clarence  she gave an impatient shiver  good heavens not there i shall never go there again i should fancy every time i looked out of the window that i saw the head of that man between the bars no i am only thankful that i wasnt here at the time and that i can keep my remembrance of the dear old place unchanged she checked herself a little abruptly and then added somewhat irrelevantly but cheerfully well you have been away what have you done  nothing said clarence  then you have kept your promise she said with the same nervous hilarity  i have returned here without making any other engagement he said gravely but i have not altered my determination  she shrugged her shoulders again or as it seemed the skin of her tightly fitting black dress above them with the sensitive shiver of a highly groomed horse and moved to the hearth as if for warmth put her slim slippered foot upon the low fender drawing with a quick hand the whole width of her skirt behind her until it clingingly accented the long graceful curve from her hip to her feet all this was so unlike her usual fastidiousness and repose that he was struck by it with her eyes on the glowing embers of the hearth and tentatively advancing her toe to its warmth and drawing it away she said  of course you must please yourself i am afraid i have no right except that of habit and custom to keep you here and you know she added with an only halfwithheld bitterness that they are not always very effective with young people who prefer to have the ordering of their own lives but i have something still to tell you before you finally decide i have as you know been looking over myover mr peytons papers very carefully well as a result i find mr brant that there is no record whatever of his wonderfully providential purchase of the sisters title from you that he never entered into any written agreement with you and never paid you a cent and that furthermore his papers show me that he never even contemplated it nor indeed even knew of your owning the title when he died yes mr brant it was all to your foresight and prudence and your generosity alone that we owe our present possession of the rancho when you helped us into that awful window it was your house we were entering and if it had been you and not those wretches who had chosen to shut the doors on us after the funeral we could never have entered here again dont deny it mr brant i have suspected it a long time and when you spoke of changing your position i determined to find out if it wasnt i who had to leave the house rather than you one moment please and i did find out and it was i dont speak please yet and now she said with a quick return to her previous nervous hilarity knowing this as you did and knowing too that i would know it when i examined the papersdont speak im not through yetdont you think that it was just a little cruel for you to try to hurry me and make me come here instead of your coming to me in san francisco when i gave you leave for that purpose  but mrs peyton gasped clarence  please dont interrupt me said the lady with a touch of her old imperiousness for in a moment i must join my guests when i found you wouldnt tell me and left it to me to find out i could only go away as i did and really leave you to control what i believed was your own property and i thought too that i understood your motives and to be frank with you that worried me for i believed i knew the disposition and feelings of a certain person better than yourself  one moment broke out clarence you must hear me now foolish and misguided as that purchase may have been i swear to you i had only one motive in making itto save the homestead for you and your husband who had been my first and earliest benefactors what the result of it was you as a business woman know your friends know your lawyer will tell you the same you owe me nothing i have given you nothing but the repossession of this property which any other man could have done and perhaps less stupidly than i did i would not have forced you to come here to hear this if i had dreamed of your suspicions or even if i had simply understood that you would see me in san francisco as i passed through  passed through where were you going she said quickly  to sacramento  the abrupt change in her manner startled him to a recollection of susy and he blushed she bit her lips and moved towards the window  then you saw her she said turning suddenly towards him the inquiry of her beautiful eyes was more imperative than her speech  clarence recognized quickly what he thought was his cruel blunder in touching the halfhealed wound of separation but he had gone too far to be other than perfectly truthful now  yes i saw her on the stage he said with a return of his boyish earnestness and i learned something which i wanted you to first hear from me she is marriedand to mr hooker who is in the same theatrical company with her but i want you to think as i honestly do that it is the best for her she has married in her profession which is a great protection and a help to her success and she has married a man who can look lightly upon certain qualities in her that others might not be so lenient to his worst faults are on the surface and will wear away in contact with the world and he looks up to her as his superior i gathered this from her friend for i did not speak with her myself i did not go there to see her but as i expected to be leaving you soon i thought it only right that as i was the humble means of first bringing her into your life i should bring you this last news which i suppose takes her out of it forever only i want you to believe that you have nothing to regret and that she is neither lost nor unhappy  the expression of suspicious inquiry on her face when he began changed gradually to perplexity as he continued and then relaxed into a faint peculiar smile but there was not the slightest trace of that pain wounded pride indignation or anger that he had expected to see upon it  that means i suppose mr brant that you no longer care for her  the smile had passed yet she spoke now with a halfreal halfaffected archness that was also unlike her  it means said clarence with a white face but a steady voice that i care for her now as much as i ever cared for her no matter to what folly it once might have led me but it means also that there was no time when i was not able to tell it to you as frankly as i do now  one moment please she interrupted and turned quickly towards the door she opened it and looked out i thought they were calling meandiimust go now mr brant and without finishing my business either or saying half i had intended to say but waitshe put her hand to her head in a pretty perplexity its a moonlight night and ill propose after dinner a stroll in the gardens and you can manage to walk a little with me she stopped again returned said it was very kind of you to think of me at sacramento held out her hand allowed it to remain for an instant cool but acquiescent in his warmer grasp and with the same odd youthfulness of movement and gesture slipped out of the door  an hour later she was at the head of her dinner table serene beautiful and calm in her elegant mourning provokingly inaccessible in the sweet deliberation of her widowed years padre esteban was at her side with a local magnate who had known peyton and his wife while donna rosita and a pair of liquidtongued childlike senoritas were near clarence and sanderson to the priest mrs peyton spoke admiringly of the changes in the rancho and the restoration of the mission chapel and together they had commended clarence from the level of their superior passionless reserve and years clarence felt hopelessly young and hopelessly lonely the naive prattle of the young girls beside him appeared infantine in his abstraction he heard mrs peyton allude to the beauty of the night and propose that after coffee and chocolate the ladies should put on their wraps and go with her to the old garden clarence raised his eyes she was not looking at him but there was a slight consciousness in her face that was not there before and the faintest color in her cheek still lingering no doubt from the excitement of conversation  it was a cool tranquil dewless night when they at last straggled out mere black and white patches in the colorless moonlight the brilliancy of the flowerhued landscape was subdued under its passive pale austerity even the gray and gold of the second terrace seemed dulled and confused at any other time clarence might have lingered over this strange effect but his eyes followed only a tall figure in a long striped burnous that moved gracefully beside the soutaned priest as he approached it turned towards him  ah here you are i just told father esteban that you talked of leaving tomorrow and that he would have to excuse me a few moments while you showed me what you had done to the old garden  she moved beside him and with a hesitation that was not unlike a more youthful timidity slipped her hand through his arm it was for the first time and without thinking he pressed it impulsively to his side i have already intimated that clarences reserve was at times qualified by singular directness  a few steps carried them out of hearing a few more and they seemed alone in the world the long adobe wall glanced away emptily beside them and was lost the black shadows of the knotted peartrees were beneath their feet they began to walk with the slight affectation of treading the shadows as if they were patterns on a carpet clarence was voiceless and yet he seemed to be moving beside a spirit that must be first addressed  but it was flesh and blood nevertheless  i interrupted you in something you were saying when i left the office she said quietly  i was speaking of susy returned clarence eagerly and  then you neednt go on interrupted mrs peyton quickly i understand you and believe you i would rather talk of something else we have not yet arranged how i can make restitution to you for the capital you sank in saving this place you will be reasonable mr brant and not leave me with the shame and pain of knowing that you ruined yourself for the sake of your old friends for it is no more a sentimental idea of mine to feel in this way than it is a fair and sensible one for you to imply that a mere quibble of construction absolves me from responsibility mr sanderson himself admits that the repossession you gave us is a fair and legal basis for any arrangement of sharing or division of the property with you that might enable you to remain here and continue the work you have so well begun have you no suggestion or must it come from me mr brant  neither let us not talk of that now  she did not seem to notice the boyish doggedness of his speech except so far as it might have increased her inconsequent and nervously pitched levity  then suppose we speak of the misses hernandez with whom you scarcely exchanged a word at dinner and whom i invited for you and your fluent spanish they are charming girls even if they are a little stupid but what can i do if i am to live here i must have a few young people around me if only to make the place cheerful for others do you know i have taken a great fancy to miss rogers and have asked her to visit me i think she is a good friend of yours although perhaps she is a little shy whats the matter you have nothing against her have you  clarence had stopped short they had reached the end of the peartree shadows a few steps more would bring them to the fallen south wall of the garden and the open moonlight beyond but to the right an olive alley of deeper shadow diverged  no he said with slow deliberation i have to thank mary rogers for having discovered something in me that i have been blindly foolishly and hopelessly struggling with  and pray what was that said mrs peyton sharply  that i love you  mrs peyton was fairly startled the embarrassment of any truth is apt to be in its eternal abruptness which no deviousness of tact or circumlocution of diplomacy has ever yet surmounted whatever had been in her heart or mind she was unprepared for this directness the bolt had dropped from the sky they were alone there was nothing between the stars and the earth but herself and this man and this truth it could not be overlooked surmounted or escaped from a step or two more would take her out of the garden into the moonlight but always into this awful frankness of blunt and outspoken nature she hesitated and turned the corner into the olive shadows it was perhaps more dangerous but less shameless and less like truckling and the appallingly direct clarence instantly followed  i know you will despise me hate me and perhaps worst of all disbelieve me but i swear to you now that i have always loved youyes always when first i came here it was not to see my old playmate but you for i had kept the memory of you as i first saw you when a boy and you have always been my ideal i have thought of dreamed of worshiped and lived for no other woman even when i found susy again grown up here at your side even when i thought that i might with your consent marry her it was that i might be with you always that i might be a part of your home your family and have a place with her in your heart for it was you i loved and you only dont laugh at me mrs peyton it is the truth the whole truth i am telling you god help me  if she only could have laughedharshly ironically or even mercifully and kindly but it would not come and she burst out  i am not laughing good heavens dont you see it is me you are making ridiculous  you ridiculous he said in a momentarily choked halfstupefied voice youa beautiful woman my superior in everything the mistress of these lands where i am only stewardmade ridiculous not by my presumption but by my confession was the saint you just now admired in father estebans chapel ridiculous because of the peon clowns who were kneeling before it  hush this is wicked stop  she felt she was now on firm ground and made the most of it in voice and manner she must draw the line somewhere and she would draw it between passion and impiety  not until i have told you all and i must before i leave you i loved you when i came hereeven when your husband was alive dont be angry mrs peyton he would not and need not have been angry he would have pitied the foolish boy who in the very innocence and ignorance of his passion might have revealed it to him as he did to everybody but one and yet i sometimes think you might have guessed it had you thought of me at all it must have been on my lips that day i sat with you in the boudoir i know that i was filled with it with it and with you with your presence with your beauty your grace of heart and mindyes mrs peyton even with your own unrequited love for susy only then i knew not what it was  but i think i can tell you what it was then and now said mrs peyton recovering her nervous little laugh though it died a moment after on her lips i remember it very well you told me then that i reminded you of your mother well i am not old enough to be your mother mr brant but i am old enough to have been and might have been the mother of your wife that was what you meant then that is what you mean now i was wrong to accuse you of trying to make me ridiculous i ask your pardon let us leave it as it was that day in the boudoir as it is now let me still remind you of your motheri know she must have been a good woman to have had so good a sonand when you have found some sweet young girl to make you happy come to me for a mothers blessing and we will laugh at the recollection and misunderstanding of this evening  her voice did not however exhibit that exquisite maternal tenderness which the beatific vision ought to have called up and the persistent voice of clarence could not be evaded in the shadow  i said you reminded me of my mother he went on at her side because i knew her and lost her only as a child she never was anything to me but a memory and yet an ideal of all that was sweet and lovable in woman perhaps it was a dream of what she might have been when she was as young in years as you if it pleases you still to misunderstand me it may please you also to know that there is a reminder of her even in this i have no remembrance of a word of affection from her nor a caress i have been as hopeless in my love for her who was my mother as of the woman i would make my wife  but you have seen no one you know no one you are young you scarcely know your own self you will forget this you will forget me and ififi shouldlisten to you what would the world say what would you yourself say a few years hence oh be reasonable think of itit would be so wildso mad sosoutterly ridiculous  in proof of its ludicrous quality two tears escaped her eyes in the darkness but clarence caught the white flash of her withdrawn handkerchief in the shadow and captured her returning hand it was trembling but did not struggle and presently hushed itself to rest in his  im not only a fool but a brute he said in a lower voice forgive me i have given you painyou for whom i would have died  they had both stopped he was still holding her sleeping hand his arm had stolen around the burnous so softly that it followed the curves of her figure as lightly as a fold of the garment and was presumably unfelt grief has its privileges and suffering exonerates a questionable situation in another moment her fair head might have dropped upon his shoulder but an approaching voice uprose in the adjoining broad allee it might have been the world speaking through the voice of the lawyer sanderson  yes he is a good fellow and an intelligent fellow too but a perfect child in his experience of mankind  they both started but mrs peytons hand suddenly woke up and grasped his firmly then she said in a higher but perfectly level tone  yes i think with you we had better look at it again in the sunlight tomorrow but here come our friends they have probably been waiting for us to join them and go in        the wholesome freshness of early morning was in the room when clarence awoke cleared and strengthened his resolution had been made he would leave the rancho that morning to enter the world again and seek his fortune elsewhere this was only right to her whose future it should never be said he had imperiled by his folly and inexperience and if in a year or two of struggle he could prove his right to address her again he would return he had not spoken to her since they had parted in the garden with the grim truths of the lawyer ringing in his ears but he had written a few lines of farewell to be given to her after he had left he was calm in his resolution albeit a little pale and holloweyed for it  he crept downstairs in the gray twilight of the scarceawakened house and made his way to the stables saddling his horse and mounting he paced forth into the crisp morning air the sun just risen was everywhere bringing out the fresh color of the flowerstrewn terraces as the last nights shadows which had hidden them were slowly beaten back he cast a last look at the brown adobe quadrangle of the quiet house just touched with the bronzing of the sun and then turned his face towards the highway as he passed the angle of the old garden he hesitated but strong in his resolution he put the recollection of last night behind him and rode by without raising his eyes  clarence  it was her voice he wheeled his horse she was standing behind the grille in the old wall as he had seen her standing on the day he had ridden to his rendezvous with susy a spanish manta was thrown over her head and shoulders as if she had dressed hastily and had run out to intercept him while he was still in the stable her beautiful face was pale in its blackhooded recess and there were faint circles around her lovely eyes  you were going without saying goodby she said softly  she passed her slim white hand between the grating clarence leaped to the ground caught it and pressed it to his lips but he did not let it go  no no she said struggling to withdraw it it is better as it isasas you have decided it to be only i could not let you go thuswithout a word there nowgo clarence go please dont you see i am behind these bars think of them as the years that separate us my poor dear foolish boy think of them as standing between us growing closer heavier and more cruel and hopeless as the years go on  ah well they had been good bars a hundred and fifty years ago when it was thought as necessary to repress the innocence that was behind them as the wickedness that was without they had done duty in the convent at santa inez and the monastery of santa barbara and had been brought hither in governor micheltorrenas time to keep the daughters of robles from the insidious contact of the outer world when they took the air in their cloistered pleasance guitars had tinkled against them in vain and they had withstood the stress and storm of love tokens but like many other things which have had their day and time they had retained their semblance of power even while rattling loosely in their sockets only because no one had ever thought of putting them to the test and in the strong hand of clarence assisted perhaps by the leaning figure of mrs peyton i grieve to say that the whole grille suddenly collapsed became a frame of tinkling iron and then clanked bar by bar into the road mrs peyton uttered a little cry and drew back and clarence leaping the ruins caught her in his arms  for a moment only for she quickly withdrew from them and although the morning sunlight was quite rosy on her cheeks she said gravely pointing to the dismantled opening  i suppose you must stay now for you never could leave me here alone and defenseless  he stayed and with this fulfillment of his youthful dreams the romance of his young manhood seemed to be completed and so closed the second volume of this trilogy but what effect that fulfillment of youth had upon his maturer years or the fortunes of those who were nearly concerned in it may be told in a later and final chronicle
