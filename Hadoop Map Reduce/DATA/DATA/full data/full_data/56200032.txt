56200032	an essay on criticism  by  alexander pope  with introductory and explanatory notes    alexander pope                                       this eminent english poet was born in london may 21 1688 his parents were roman catholics and to this faith the poet adhered thus debarring himself from public office and employment his father a linen merchant having saved a moderate competency withdrew from business and settled on a small estate he had purchased in windsor forest he died at chiswick in 1717 his son shortly afterwards took a long lease of a house and five acres of land at twickenham on the banks of the thames whither he retired with his widowed mother to whom he was tenderly attached and where he resided till death cultivating his little domain with exquisite taste and skill and embellishing it with a grotto temple wilderness and other adjuncts poetical and picturesque in this famous villa pope was visited by the most celebrated wits statesmen and beauties of the day himself being the most popular and successful poet of his age his early years were spent at binfield within the range of the royal forest he received some education at little catholic schools but was his own instructor after his twelfth year he never was a profound or accurate scholar but he read latin poets with ease and delight and acquired some greek french and italian he was a poet almost from infancy he lisped in numbers and when a mere youth surpassed all his contemporaries in metrical harmony and correctness his pastorals and some translations appeared in 1709 but were written three or four years earlier these were followed by the essay on criticism 1711 rape of the lock when completed the most graceful airy and imaginative of his works 17121714 windsor forest 1713 temple of fame 1715 in a collection of his works printed in 1717 he included the epistle of eloisa and elegy on an unfortunate lady two poems inimitable for pathetic beauty and finished melodious versification  from 1715 till 1726 pope was chiefly engaged on his translations of the iliad and odyssey which though wanting in time homeric simplicity naturalness and grandeur are splendid poems in 172829 he published his greatest satirethe dunciad an attack on all poetasters and pretended wits and on all other persons against whom the sensitive poet had conceived any enmity in 1737 he gave to the world a volume of his literary correspondence containing some pleasant gossip and observations with choice passages of description but it appears that the correspondence was manufactured for publication not composed of actual letters addressed to the parties whose names are given and the collection was introduced to the public by means of an elaborate stratagem on the part of the scheming poet between the years 1731 and 1739 he issued a series of poetical essays moral and philosophical with satires and imitations of horace all admirable for sense wit spirit and brilliancy of these delightful productions the most celebrated is the essay on man to which bolingbroke is believed to have contributed the spurious philosophy and false sentiment but its merit consists in detached passages descriptions and pictures a fourth book to the dunciad containing many beautiful and striking lines and a general revision of his works closed the poets literary cares and toils he died on the 30th of may 1744 and was buried in the church at twickenham  pope was of very diminutive stature and deformed from his birth his physical infirmity susceptible temperament and incessant study rendered his life one long disease he was as his friend lord chesterfield said the most irritable of all the genus irritabile vatum offended with trifles and never forgetting or forgiving them his literary stratagems disguises assertions denials and we must add misrepresentations would fill volumes yet when no disturbing jealousy vanity or rivalry intervened was generous and affectionate and he had a manly independent spirit as a poet he was deficient in originality and creative power and thus was inferior to his prototype dryden but as a literary artist and brilliant declaimer satirist and moralizer in verse he is still unrivaled he is the english horace and will as surely descend with honors to the latest posterity       an essay on criticism  written in the year 1709       the title an essay on criticism hardly indicates all     that is included in the poem it would have been impossible to     give a full and exact idea of the art of poetical criticism     without entering into the consideration of the art of poetry     accordingly pope has interwoven the precepts of both throughout     the poem which might more properly have been styled an essay on     the art of criticism and of poetry                                       part i      tis hard to say if greater want of skill   appear in writing or in judging ill   but of the two less dangerous is the offense   to tire our patience than mislead our sense   some few in that but numbers err in this   ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss   a fool might once himself alone expose   now one in verse makes many more in prose      tis with our judgments as our watches none   go just alike yet each believes his own   in poets as true genius is but rare   true taste as seldom is the critic share   both must alike from heaven derive their light   these born to judge as well as those to write   let such teach others who themselves excel   and censure freely who have written well   authors are partial to their wit tis true 17   but are not critics to their judgment too      yet if we look more closely we shall find   most have the seeds of judgment in their mind   nature affords at least a glimmering light   the lines though touched but faintly are drawn right   but as the slightest sketch if justly traced   is by ill coloring but the more disgraced   so by false learning is good sense defaced   some are bewildered in the maze of schools 26   and some made coxcombs nature meant but fools   in search of wit these lose their common sense   and then turn critics in their own defense   each burns alike who can or cannot write   or with a rivals or an eunuchs spite   all fools have still an itching to deride   and fain would be upon the laughing side   if maevius scribble in apollos spite 34   there are who judge still worse than he can write      some have at first for wits then poets passed   turned critics next and proved plain fools at last   some neither can for wits nor critics pass   as heavy mules are neither horse nor ass   those halflearned witlings numerous in our isle   as halfformed insects on the banks of nile   unfinished things one knows not what to call   their generation is so equivocal   to tell them would a hundred tongues require   or one vain wits that might a hundred tire      but you who seek to give and merit fame   and justly bear a critics noble name   be sure yourself and your own reach to know   how far your genius taste and learning go   launch not beyond your depth but be discreet   and mark that point where sense and dullness meet      nature to all things fixed the limits fit   and wisely curbed proud mans pretending wit   as on the land while here the ocean gains   in other parts it leaves wide sandy plains   thus in the soul while memory prevails   the solid power of understanding fails   where beams of warm imagination play   the memorys soft figures melt away   one science only will one genius fit   so vast is art so narrow human wit   not only bounded to peculiar arts   but oft in those confined to single parts   like kings we lose the conquests gained before   by vain ambition still to make them more   each might his several province well command   would all but stoop to what they understand      first follow nature and your judgment frame   by her just standard which is still the same   unerring nature still divinely bright   one clear unchanged and universal light   life force and beauty must to all impart   at once the source and end and test of art   art from that fund each just supply provides   works without show and without pomp presides   in some fair body thus the informing soul   with spirits feeds with vigor fills the whole   each motion guides and every nerve sustains   itself unseen but in the effects remains   some to whom heaven in wit has been profuse 80   want as much more to turn it to its use   for wit and judgment often are at strife   though meant each others aid like man and wife   tis more to guide than spur the muses steed   restrain his fury than provoke his speed   the winged courser like a generous horse 86   shows most true mettle when you check his course      those rules of old discovered not devised   are nature still but nature methodized   nature like liberty is but restrained   by the same laws which first herself ordained      hear how learned greece her useful rules indites   when to repress and when indulge our flights   high on parnassus top her sons she showed 94   and pointed out those arduous paths they trod   held from afar aloft the immortal prize   and urged the rest by equal steps to rise 97   just precepts thus from great examples given   she drew from them what they derived from heaven   the generous critic fanned the poets fire   and taught the world with reason to admire   then criticism the muses handmaid proved   to dress her charms and make her more beloved   but following wits from that intention strayed   who could not win the mistress wooed the maid   against the poets their own arms they turned   sure to hate most the men from whom they learned   so modern pothecaries taught the art   by doctors bills to play the doctors part   bold in the practice of mistaken rules   prescribe apply and call their masters fools   some on the leaves of ancient authors prey   nor time nor moths eer spoil so much as they   some dryly plain without inventions aid   write dull receipts how poems may be made   these leave the sense their learning to display   and those explain the meaning quite away      you then whose judgment the right course would steer   know well each ancients proper character   his fable subject scope in every page   religion country genius of his age   without all these at once before your eyes   cavil you may but never criticise   be homers works your study and delight   read them by day and meditate by night   thence form your judgment thence your maxims bring   and trace the muses upward to their spring   still with itself compared his text peruse   and let your comment be the mantuan muse 129      when first young maro in his boundless mind 130   a work to outlast immortal rome designed   perhaps he seemed above the critics law   and but from natures fountain scorned to draw   but when to examine every part he came   nature and homer were he found the same   convinced amazed he checks the bold design   and rules as strict his labored work confine   as if the stagirite oerlooked each line 138   learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem   to copy nature is to copy them      some beauties yet no precepts can declare   for theres a happiness as well as care   music resembles poetryin each   are nameless graces which no methods teach   and which a master hand alone can reach   if where the rules not far enough extend   since rules were made but to promote their end   some lucky license answer to the full   the intent proposed that license is a rule   thus pegasus a nearer way to take   may boldly deviate from the common track   great wits sometimes may gloriously offend   and rise to faults true critics dare not mend   from vulgar bounds with brave disorder part   and snatch a grace beyond the reach of art   which without passing through the judgment gains   the heart and all its end at once attains   in prospects thus some objects please our eyes   which out of natures common order rise   the shapeless rock or hanging precipice   but though the ancients thus their rules invade   as kings dispense with laws themselves have made   moderns beware or if you must offend   against the precept neer transgress its end   let it be seldom and compelled by need   and have at least their precedent to plead   the critic else proceeds without remorse   seizes your fame and puts his laws in force      i know there are to whose presumptuous thoughts   those freer beauties even in them seem faults   some figures monstrous and misshaped appear   considered singly or beheld too near   which but proportioned to their light or place   due distance reconciles to form and grace   a prudent chief not always must display   his powers in equal ranks and fair array   but with the occasion and the place comply   conceal his force nay seem sometimes to fly   those oft are stratagems which errors seem   nor is it homer nods but we that dream 180      still green with bays each ancient altar stands   above the reach of sacrilegious hands   secure from flames from envys fiercer rage 183   destructive war and allinvolving age   see from each clime the learned their incense bring   hear in all tongues consenting paeans ring   in praise so just let every voice be joined   and fill the general chorus of mankind   hail bards triumphant born in happier days   immortal heirs of universal praise   whose honors with increase of ages grow   as streams roll down enlarging as they flow   nations unborn your mighty names shall sound 193   and worlds applaud that must not yet be found   oh may some spark of your celestial fire   the last the meanest of your sons inspire   that on weak wings from far pursues your flights   glows while he reads but trembles as he writes   to teach vain wits a science little known   to admire superior sense and doubt their own                                       part ii      of all the causes which conspire to blind   mans erring judgment and misguide the mind   what the weak head with strongest bias rules   is pride the neverfailing vice of fools   whatever nature has in worth denied   she gives in large recruits of needful pride   for as in bodies thus in souls we find   what wants in blood and spirits swelled with wind   pride where wit fails steps in to our defense   and fills up all the mighty void of sense   if once right reason drives that cloud away   truth breaks upon us with resistless day   trust not yourself but your defects to know   make use of every friendand every foe      a little learning is a dangerous thing   drink deep or taste not the pierian spring 216   there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain   and drinking largely sobers us again   fired at first sight with what the muse imparts   in fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts   while from the bounded level of our mind   short views we take nor see the lengths behind   but more advanced behold with strange surprise   new distant scenes of endless science rise   so pleased at first the towering alps we try   mount oer the vales and seem to tread the sky   the eternal snows appear already passed   and the first clouds and mountains seem the last   but those attained we tremble to survey   the growing labors of the lengthened way   the increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes   hills peep oer hills and alps on alps arise      a perfect judge will read each work of wit   with the same spirit that its author writ   survey the whole nor seek slight faults to find   where nature moves and rapture warms the mind   nor lose for that malignant dull delight   the generous pleasure to be charmed with wit   but in such lays as neither ebb nor flow   correctly cold and regularly low   that shunning faults one quiet tenor keep   we cannot blame indeedbut we may sleep   in wit as nature what affects our hearts   is not the exactness of peculiar parts   tis not a lip or eye we beauty call   but the joint force and full result of all   thus when we view some well proportioned dome   the worlds just wonder and even thine o rome 248   no single parts unequally surprise   all comes united to the admiring eyes   no monstrous height or breadth or length appear   the whole at once is bold and regular    whoever thinks a faultless piece to see   thinks what neer was nor is nor eer shall be   in every work regard the writers end   since none can compass more than they intend   and if the means be just the conduct true   applause in spite of trivial faults is due   as men of breeding sometimes men of wit   to avoid great errors must the less commit   neglect the rules each verbal critic lays   for not to know some trifles is a praise   most critics fond of some subservient art   still make the whole depend upon a part   they talk of principles but notions prize   and all to one loved folly sacrifice      once on a time la manchas knight they say 267   a certain bard encountering on the way   discoursed in terms as just with looks as sage   as eer could dennis of the grecian stage 270   concluding all were desperate sots and fools   who durst depart from aristotles rules   our author happy in a judge so nice   produced his play and begged the knights advice   made him observe the subject and the plot   the manners passions unities what not   all which exact to rule were brought about   were but a combat in the lists left out   what leave the combat out exclaims the knight   yes or we must renounce the stagirite   not so by heaven he answers in a rage   knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage   so vast a throng the stage can neer contain   then build a new or act it in a plain      thus critics of less judgment than caprice   curious not knowing not exact but nice   form short ideas and offend in arts   as most in manners by a love to parts      some to conceit alone their taste confine   and glittering thoughts struck out at every line   pleased with a work where nothings just or fit   one glaring chaos and wild heap of wit   poets like painters thus unskilled to trace   the naked nature and the living grace   with gold and jewels cover every part   and hide with ornaments their want of art   true wit is nature to advantage dressed   what oft was thought but neer so well expressed   something whose truth convinced at sight we find   that gives us back the image of our mind   as shades more sweetly recommend the light   so modest plainness sets off sprightly wit   for works may have more wit than does them good   as bodies perish through excess of blood      others for language all their care express   and value books as women men for dress   their praise is stillthe style is excellent   the sense they humbly take upon content 308   words are like leaves and where they most abound   much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found   false eloquence like the prismatic glass 311   its gaudy colors spreads on every place   the face of nature we no more survey   all glares alike without distinction gay   but true expression like the unchanging sun   clears and improves whateer it shines upon   it gilds all objects but it alters none   expression is the dress of thought and still   appears more decent as more suitable   a vile conceit in pompous words expressed   is like a clown in regal purple dressed   for different styles with different subjects sort   as several garbs with country town and court   some by old words to fame have made pretense   ancients in phrase mere moderns in their sense   such labored nothings in so strange a style   amaze the unlearned and make the learned smile   unlucky as fungoso in the play 328   these sparks with awkward vanity display   what the fine gentleman wore yesterday   and but so mimic ancient wits at best   as apes our grandsires in their doublets dressed   in words as fashions the same rule will hold   alike fantastic if too new or old   be not the first by whom the new are tried   nor yet the last to lay the old aside    but most by numbers judge a poets song   and smooth or rough with them is right or wrong   in the bright muse though thousand charms conspire   her voice is all these tuneful fools admire   who haunt parnassus but to please their ear   not mend their minds as some to church repair   not for the doctrine but the music there   these equal syllables alone require   though oft the ear the open vowels tire   while expletives their feeble aid do join   and ten low words oft creep in one dull line   while they ring round the same unvaried chimes   with sure returns of still expected rhymes   whereer you find the cooling western breeze   in the next line it whispers through the trees   if crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep   the readers threatened not in vain with sleep   then at the last and only couplet fraught   with some unmeaning thing they call a thought   a needless alexandrine ends the song 356   that like a wounded snake drags its slow length along      leave such to tune their own dull rhymes and know   whats roundly smooth or languishingly slow   and praise the easy vigor of a line   where denhams strength and wallers sweetness join 361   true ease in writing comes from art not chance   as those move easiest who have learned to dance   tis not enough no harshness gives offense   the sound must seem an echo to the sense   soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows 366   and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows   but when loud surges lash the sounding shore   the hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar   when ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw   the line too labors and the words move slow   not so when swift camilla scours the plain   flies oer the unbending corn and skims along the main 373   hear how timotheus varied lays surprise 374   and bid alternate passions fall and rise   while at each change the son of libyan jove 376   now burns with glory and then melts with love   now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow   now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow   persians and greeks like turns of nature found   and the worlds victor stood subdued by sound 381   the power of music all our hearts allow   and what timotheus was is dryden now      avoid extremes and shun the fault of such   who still are pleased too little or too much   at every trifle scorn to take offense   that always shows great pride or little sense   those heads as stomachs are not sure the best   which nauseate all and nothing can digest   yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move   for fools admire but men of sense approve   as things seem large which we through mist descry   dullness is ever apt to magnify 393      some foreign writers some our own despise   the ancients only or the moderns prize   thus wit like faith by each man is applied   to one small sect and all are damned beside   meanly they seek the blessing to confine   and force that sun but on a part to shine   which not alone the southern wit sublimes   but ripens spirits in cold northern climes   which from the first has shone on ages past   enlights the present and shall warm the last   though each may feel increases and decays   and see now clearer and now darker days   regard not then if wit be old or new   but blame the false and value still the true      some neer advance a judgment of their own   but catch the spreading notion of the town   they reason and conclude by precedent   and own stale nonsense which they neer invent   some judge of authors names not works and then   nor praise nor blame the writing but the men   of all this servile herd the worst is he   that in proud dullness joins with quality   a constant critic at the great mans board   to fetch and carry nonsense for my lord   what woful stuff this madrigal would be   in some starved hackney sonnetteer or me   but let a lord once own the happy lines   how the wit brightens how the style refines   before his sacred name flies every fault   and each exalted stanza teems with thought      the vulgar thus through imitation err   as oft the learned by being singular   so much they scorn the crowd that if the throng   by chance go right they purposely go wrong   so schismatics the plain believers quit   and are but damned for having too much wit   some praise at morning what they blame at night   but always think the last opinion right   a muse by these is like a mistress used   this hour shes idolized the next abused   while their weak heads like towns unfortified   twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side   ask them the cause theyre wiser still they say   and still tomorrows wiser than today   we think our fathers fools so wise we grow   our wiser sons no doubt will think us so   once schooldivines this zealous isle oerspread   who knew most sentences was deepest read 441   faith gospel all seemed made to be disputed   and none had sense enough to be confuted   scotists and thomists now in peace remain 444   amidst their kindred cobwebs in duck lane 445   if faith itself has different dresses worn   what wonder modes in wit should take their turn   oft leaving what is natural and fit   the current folly proves the ready wit   and authors think their reputation safe   which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh      some valuing those of their own side or mind   still make themselves the measure of mankind   fondly we think we honor merit then   when we but praise ourselves in other men   parties in wit attend on those of state   and public faction doubles private hate   pride malice folly against dryden rose   in various shapes of parsons critics beaux 459   but sense survived when merry jests were past   for rising merit will buoy up at last   might he return and bless once more our eyes   new blackmores and new millbourns must arise 463   nay should great homer lift his awful head   zoilus again would start up from the dead 465   envy will merit as its shade pursue   but like a shadow proves the substance true   for envied wit like sol eclipsed makes known   the opposing bodys grossness not its own   when first that sun too powerful beams displays   it draws up vapors which obscure its rays   but even those clouds at last adorn its way   reflect new glories and augment the day      be thou the first true merit to befriend   his praise is lost who stays till all commend   short is the date alas of modern rhymes   and tis but just to let them live betimes   no longer now that golden age appears   when patriarch wits survived a thousand years 479   now length of fame our second life is lost   and bare threescore is all even that can boast   our sons their fathers failing language see   and such as chaucer is shall dryden be   so when the faithful pencil has designed   some bright idea of the masters mind   where a new world leaps out at his command   and ready nature waits upon his hand   when the ripe colors soften and unite   and sweetly melt into just shade and light   when mellowing years their full perfection give   and each bold figure just begins to live   the treacherous colors the fair art betray   and all the bright creation fades away      unhappy wit like most mistaken things   atones not for that envy which it brings   in youth alone its empty praise we boast   but soon the short lived vanity is lost   like some fair flower the early spring supplies   that gayly blooms but even in blooming dies   what is this wit which must our cares employ   the owners wife that other men enjoy   then most our trouble still when most admired   and still the more we give the more required   whose fame with pains we guard but lose with ease   sure some to vex but never all to please   tis what the vicious fear the virtuous shun   by fools tis hated and by knaves undone      if wit so much from ignorance undergo   ah let not learning too commence its foe   of old those met rewards who could excel   and such were praised who but endeavored well   though triumphs were to generals only due   crowns were reserved to grace the soldiers too   now they who reach parnassus lofty crown   employ their pains to spurn some others down   and while selflove each jealous writer rules   contending wits become the sport of fools   but still the worst with most regret commend   for each ill author is as bad a friend   to what base ends and by what abject ways   are mortals urged through sacred lust of praise   ah neer so dire a thirst of glory boast   nor in the critic let the man be lost   goodnature and good sense must ever join   to err is human to forgive divine      but if in noble minds some dregs remain   not yet purged off of spleen and sour disdain   discharge that rage on more provoking crimes   nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times   no pardon vile obscenity should find   though wit and art conspire to move your mind   but dullness with obscenity must prove   as shameful sure as impotence in love   in the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease   sprung the rank weed and thrived with large increase   when love was all an easy monarchs care 536   seldom at council never in a war   jilts ruled the state and statesmen farces writ   nay wits had pensions and young lords had wit   the fair sat panting at a courtiers play   and not a mask went unimproved away 541   the modest fan was lifted up no more   and virgins smiled at what they blushed before   the following license of a foreign reign 544   did all the dregs of bold socinus drain 545   then unbelieving priests reformed the nation   and taught more pleasant methods of salvation   where heavens free subjects might their rights dispute   lest god himself should seem too absolute   pulpits their sacred satire learned to spare   and vice admired to find a flatterer there   encouraged thus wits titans braved the skies 552   and the press groaned with licensed blasphemies   these monsters critics with your darts engage   here point your thunder and exhaust your rage   yet shun their fault who scandalously nice   will needs mistake an author into vice   all seems infected that the infected spy   as all looks yellow to the jaundiced eye                                        part iii      learn then what morals critics ought to show   for tis but half a judges task to know   tis not enough taste judgment learning join   in all you speak let truth and candor shine   that not alone what to your sense is due   all may allow but seek your friendship too      be silent always when you doubt your sense   and speak though sure with seeming diffidence   some positive persisting fops we know   who if once wrong will needs be always so   but you with pleasure own your errors past   and make each day a critique on the last      tis not enough your counsel still be true   blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do   men must be taught as if you taught them not   and things unknown proposed as things forgot   without good breeding truth is disapproved   that only makes superior sense beloved      be niggards of advice on no pretense   for the worst avarice is that of sense   with mean complacence neer betray your trust   nor be so civil as to prove unjust   fear not the anger of the wise to raise   those best can bear reproof who merit praise      twere well might critics still this freedom take   but appius reddens at each word you speak 585   and stares tremendous with a threatening eye   like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry   fear most to tax an honorable fool   whose right it is uncensured to be dull   such without wit are poets when they please   as without learning they can take degrees   leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful satires   and flattery to fulsome dedicators   whom when they praise the world believes no more   than when they promise to give scribbling oer      tis best sometimes your censure to restrain   and charitably let the dull be vain   your silence there is better than your spite   for who can rail so long as they can write   still humming on their drowsy course they keep   and lashed so long like tops are lashed asleep   false steps but help them to renew the race   as after stumbling jades will mend their pace   what crowds of these impenitently bold   in sounds and jingling syllables grown old   still run on poets in a raging vein   even to the dregs and squeezing of the brain   strain out the last dull droppings of their sense   and rhyme with all the rage of impotence      such shameless bards we have and yet tis true   there are as mad abandoned critics too   the bookful blockhead ignorantly read   with loads of learned lumber in his head   with his own tongue still edifies his ears   and always listening to himself appears   all books he reads and all he reads assails   from drydens fables down to durfeys tales 617   with him most authors steal their works or buy   garth did not write his own
