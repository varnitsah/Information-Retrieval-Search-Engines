95952052	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     a mixed proposal   major brill late of the fenshire volununteers stood in front of the small piece of glass in the hatstand and with a firm and experienced hand gave his new silk hat a slight tilt over the right eye  then he took his cane and a new pair of gloves and with a military but squeaky tread passed out into the road  it was a glorious day in early autumn and the soft english landscape was looking its best but despite the fact that there was nothing more alarming in sight than a few cows on the hillside a mile away the major paused at his gate and his face took on an appearance of the greatest courage and resolution before proceeding the road was dusty and quiet except for the children playing at cottage doors and so hot that the major heedless of the fact that he could not replace the hat at exactly the same angle stood in the shade of a tree while he removed it and mopped his heated brow  he proceeded on his way more leisurely overtaking despite his lack of speed another man who was walking still more slowly in the shade of the hedge  fine day halibut he said briskly fine day  beautiful said the other making no attempt to keep pace with him  country wants rain though cried the major over his shoulder  halibut assented and walking slowly on wondered vaguely what gaudy color it was that had attracted his eye  it dawned on him at length that it must be the majors tie and he suddenly quickened his pace by no means reassured as the man of war also quickened his  halloa brill  he cried  half a moment  the major stopped and waited for his friend halibut eyed the tie uneasilyit was fearfully and wonderfully madebut said nothing  well  said the major somewhat sharply  ohi was going to ask you brillconfound it  ive forgotten what i was going to say now  i daresay i shall soon think of it  youre not in a hurry  well i am rather said brill  fact is is my hat on straight halibut  the other assuring him that it was the major paused in his career and gripping the brim with both hands deliberately tilted it over the right eye again  you were saying said halibut regarding this manoeuvre with secret disapproval  yes murmured the major i was saying  well i dont mind telling an old friend like you halibut though it is a profound secret  makes me rather particular about my dress just now  women notice these things imshant get much sympathy from a confirmed old bachelor like youbut im on my way to put a very momentous question  the devil you are  said the other blankly  sir said the astonished major  not mrs riddel said halibut  certainly sir said the major stiffly  why not  only that i am going on the same errand said the confirmed bachelor with desperate calmness  the major looked at him and for the first time noticed an unusual neatness and dressiness in his friends attire  his collar was higher than usual his tie of the whitest and finest silk bore a pin he never remembered to have seen before and for the first time since he had known him the major with a strange sinking at the heart saw that he wore spats  this is extraordinary he said briefly  well goodday halibut cant stop  goodday said the other  the major quickened his pace and shot ahead and keeping in the shade of the hedge ground his teeth as the civilian on the other side of the road slowly but surely gained on him  it became exciting  the major was handicapped by his upright bearing and short military stride the other a simple child of the city bent forward swinging his arms and taking immense strides  at a bylane they picked up three small boys who trotting in their rear made it evident by their remarks that they considered themselves the privileged spectators of a footrace  the major could stand it no longer and with a cut of his cane at the foremost boy softly called a halt  well said halibut stopping  the mans manner was suspicious not to say offensive and the other had much ado to speak him fair  this is ridiculous he said trying to smile  we cant walk in and propose in a duet  one of us must go today and the other tomorrow  certainly said halibut thatll be the best plan  so childish said the major with a careless laugh two fellows walking in hot and tired and proposing to her  absurd replied halibut and both men eyed each other carefully  so if im unsuccessful old chap said the major in a voice which he strove to render natural and easy i will come straight back to your place and let you know so as not to keep you in suspense  youre very good said halibut with some emotion but i think ill take today because i have every reason to believe that i have got one of my bilious attacks coming on tomorrow  pooh fancy my dear fellow said the major heartily i never saw you look better in my life  thats one of the chief signs replied halibut shaking his head  im afraid i must go today  i really cannot waive my right on account of your bilious attack said the major haughtily  your right said halibut with spirit  my right repeated the other  i should have been there before you if you had not stopped me in the first place  but i started first said halibut  prove it exclaimed the major warmly  the other shrugged his shoulders  i shall certainly not give way he said calmly  this is a matter in which my whole future is concerned  it seems very odd not to say inconvenient that you should have chosen the same day as myself brill for such an errandvery odd  its quite an accident asseverated the major as a matter of fact halibut i nearly went yesterday  that alone gives me i think some claim to precedence  just so said halibut slowly it constitutes an excellent claim  the major regarded him with moistening eyes  this was generous and noble  his opinion of halibut rose  and now you have been so frank with me said the latter it is only fair that you should know i started out with the same intention three days ago and found her out so far as claims go i think mine leads  pure matter of opinion said the disgusted major it really seems as though we want an arbitrator  well well have to make our call together i suppose but ill take care not to give you any opportunity halibut so dont cherish any delusions on that point  even you wouldnt have the hardihood to propose before a third party i should think but if you do i give you fair warning that i shall begin too  this is most unseemly said halibut  wed better both go home and leave it for another day  when do you propose going then  asked the major  really i havent made up my mind replied the other  the major shrugged his shoulders  it wont do halibut he said grimly it wont do  im too old a soldier to be caught that way  there was a long pause  the major mopped his brow again  ive got it he said at last  halibut looked at him curiously  we must play for first proposal said the major firmly  were pretty evenly matched  chess gasped the other a whole world of protest in his tones  chess repeated the major  it is hardly respectful demurred halibut  what do you think the lady would do if she heard of it  laugh replied the major with conviction  i believe she would said the other brightening  i believe she would  you agree then  with conditions  conditions  repeated the major  one game said halibut speaking very slowly and distinctly and if the winner is refused the loser not to propose until he gives him permission  what the deuce for  inquired the other suspiciously  suppose i win replied halibut with suspicious glibness and was so upset that i had one of my bilious attacks come on where should i be why i might have to break off in the middle and go home  a fellow cant propose when everything in the room is going round and round  i dont think you ought to contemplate marriage halibut remarked the major very seriously and gently  thanks said halibut dryly  very well said the major i agree to the conditions  better come to my place and well decide it now  if we look sharp the winner may be able to know his fate today after all  halibut assenting they walked back together  the feverish joy of the gambler showed in the majors eye as they drew their chairs up to the little antique chess table and began to place their pieces ready for the fray  then a thought struck him and he crossed over to the sideboard  if youre feeling a bit off colour halibut he said kindly youd better have a little brandy to pull yourself together  i dont wish to take a mean advantage  youre very good said the other as he eyed the noble measure of liquid poured out by his generous adversary  and now to business said the major as he drew himself a little soda from a siphon  now to business repeated halibut rising and placing his glass on the mantelpiece  the major struggled fiercely with his feelings but despite himself a guilty blush lent colour to the others unfounded suspicions  remember the conditions said halibut impressively  heres my hand on it said the other reaching over  halibut took it and his thoughts being at the moment far away gave it a tender respectful squeeze  the major stared and coughed  it was suggestive of practice  if the history of the duel is ever written it will be found not unworthy of being reckoned with the most famous combats of ancient times  piece after piece was removed from the board and the major drank glass after glass of soda to cool his heated brain  at the second glass halibut took an empty tumbler and helped himself  suddenly there was a singing in the majors ears and a voice a hateful triumphant voice said  checkmate  then did his gaze wander from knight to bishop and bishop to castle in a vain search for succour  there was his king defied by a bishopa bishop which had been hobnobbing with pawns in one corner of the board and which he could have sworn he had captured and removed full twenty minutes before  he mentioned this impression to halibut  that was the other one said his foe  i thought you had forgotten this  i have been watching and hoping so for the last halfhour  there was no disguising the coarse satisfaction of the man  he had watched and hoped  not beaten him so the major told himself in fair play but by taking a mean and pitiful advantage of a pure oversight  a sheer oversight  he admitted it  halibut rose with a sigh of relief and the major mechanically sweeping up the pieces dropped them one by one into the box  plenty of time said the victor glancing at the clock  i shall go now but i should like a wash first  the major rose and in his capacity of host led the way upstairs to his room and poured fresh water for his foe  halibut washed himself delicately carefully trimming his hair and beard and anxiously consulting the major as to the set of his coat in the back after he had donned it again  his toilet completed he gave a satisfied glance in the glass and then followed the man of war sedately down stairs  at the hall he paused and busied himself with the clothesbrush and hatpad modestly informing his glaring friend that he could not afford to throw any chances away and then took his departure  the major sat up late that night waiting for news but none came and by breakfasttime next morning his thirst for information became almost uncontrollable  he toyed with a chop and allowed his coffee to get cold then he clapped on his hat and set off to halibuts to know the worst  well he inquired as he followed the other into his diningroom  i went said halibut waving him to a chair  am i to congratulate you  well i dont know was the reply perhaps not just yet  what do you mean by that  said the major irascibly  well as a matter of fact said halibut she refused me but so nicely and so gently that i scarcely minded it  in fact at first i hardly realized that she had refused me  the major rose and regarding his poor friend kindly shook and patted him lightly on the shoulder  shes a splendid woman said halibut  ornament to her sex remarked the major  so considerate murmured the bereaved one  good women always are said the major decisively  i dont think id better worry her today halibut do you  no i dont said halibut stiffly  ill try my luck tomorrow said the major  i beg your pardon said halibut  eh  said the major trying to look puzzled  you are forgetting the conditions of the game replied halibut  you have to obtain my permission first  why my dear fellow said the major with a boisterous laugh i wouldnt insult you by questioning your generosity in such a case no no halibut old fellow i know you too well  he spoke with feeling but there was an anxious note in his voice  we must abide by the conditions said halibut slowly and i must inform you brill that i intend to renew the attack myself  then sir said the major fuming you compel me to sayputting all modesty asidethat i believe the reason mrs riddel would have nothing to do with you was because she thought somebody else might make a similar offer  thats what i thought said halibut simply but you see now that you have so unaccountablyso far as mrs riddel is concerneddropped out of the running perhaps if i am gently persistent shell take me  the major rose and glared at him  if you dont take care old chap said halibut tenderly youll burst something  gently persistent repeated the major staring at him gently persistent  remember bruce and his spider smiled the other  you are not going to propose to that poor woman nine times  roared his incensed friend  i hope that it will not be necessary was the reply but if it is i can assure you my dear brill that im not going to be outclassed by a mere spider  but think of her feelings  gasped the major  i have was the reply and im sure shell thank me for it afterward you see brill you and i are the only eligibles in the place and now you are out of it shes sure to take me sooner or later  and pray how long am i to wait  demanded the major controlling himself with difficulty  i cant say said halibut but i dont think its any good your waiting at all because if i see any signs that mrs riddel is waiting for you i may just give her a hint of the hopelessness of it  youre a perfect mephistopheles sir  bawled the indignant major halibut bowed  strategy my dear brill he said smiling strategy  now why waste your time  why not make some other woman happy  why not try her companion miss philpotts  im sure any little assistance  the majors attitude was so alarming that the sentence was never finished and a second later the speaker found himself alone watching his irate friend hurrying frantically down the path knocking the blooms off the geraniums with his cane as he went  he saw no more of him for several weeks the major preferring to cherish his resentment in the privacy of his house  the major also refrained from seeing the widow having a wholesome dread as to what effect the contemplation of her charms might have upon his plighted word  he met her at last by chance  mrs riddel bowed coldly and would have passed on but the major had already stopped and was making wild and unmerited statements about the weather  it is seasonable she said simply  the major agreed with her and with a strongeffort regained his composure  i was just going to turn back he said untruthfully may i walk with you  i am not going far was the reply  with soldierly courage the major took this as permission with feminine precision mrs riddel walked about fifty yards and then stopped  i told you i wasnt going far she said sweetly as she held out her hand goodby  i wanted to ask you something said the major turning with her  i cant think what it was  they walked on very slowly the majors heart beating rapidly as he told himself that the ladys coldness was due to his neglect of the past few weeks and his wrath against halibut rose to still greater heights as he saw the cruel position in which that schemer had placed him  then he made a sudden resolution  there was no condition as to secrecy and first turning the conversation on to indoor amusements he told the astonished mrs riddel the full particulars of the fatal game  mrs riddel said that she would never forgive them it was the most preposterous thing she had ever heard of  and she demanded hotly whether she was to spend the rest of her life in refusing mr halibut  do you play high as a rule she inquired scornfully  sixpence a game replied the major simply  the corners of mrs riddels mouth relaxed and her fine eyes began to water then she turned her head away and laughed  it was very foolish of us i admit said the major ruefully and very wrong  i shouldnt have told you only i couldnt explain my apparent neglect without  apparent neglect  repeated the widow somewhat haughtily  well put it down to a guilty conscience said the major it seems years to me since i have seen you  remember the conditions major brill said mrs riddel with severity  i shall not transgress them replied the major seriously  mrs riddel gave her head a toss and regarded him from the corner of her eyes  i am very angry with you indeed she said severely  the major apologized again  for losing added the lady looking straight before her  major brill caught his breath and his knees trembled beneath him  he made a halfhearted attempt to seize her hand and then remembering his position sighed deeply and looked straight before him  they walked on in silence  i think said his companion at last that if you like you can get back at cribbage what you lost at chess  that is of course if you really want to  he wouldnt play said the major shaking his head  no but i will said mrs riddel with a smile  i think ive got a plan  she blushed charmingly and then in modest alarm at her boldness dropped her voice almost to a whisper  the major gazed at her in speechless admiration and threw back his head in ecstasy  come round tomorrow afternoon said mrs riddel pausing at the end of the lane mr halibut shall be there too and it shall be done under his very eyes  until that time came the major sat at home carefully rehearsing his part and it was with an air of complacent virtue that he met the somewhat astonished gaze of the persistent halibut next day  it was a bright afternoon but they sat indoors and mrs riddel after an animated description of a game at cribbage with miss philpotts the night before got the cards out and challenged halibut to a game  they played two both of which the diplomatic halibut lost then mrs riddel dismissing him as incompetent sat drumming on the table with her fingers and at length challenged the major  she lost the first game easily and began the second badly  finally after hastily glancing at a new hand she flung the cards petulantly on the table face downward  would you like my hand major brill  she demanded with a blush  better than anything in the world cried the major eagerly  halibut started and miss philpotts nearly had an accident with her crochet hook  the only person who kept cool was mrs riddel and it was quite clear to the beholders that she had realized neither the ambiguity of her question nor the meaning of her opponents reply  well you may have it she said brightly  before miss philpotts could lay down her work before mr halibut could interpose the major took possession of mrs riddels small white hand and raised it gallantly to his lips  mrs riddel with a faint scream which was a perfect revelation to the companion snatched her hand away i meant my hand of cards she said breathlessly  really brill really said halibut stepping forward fussily  oh  said the major blankly cards  thats what i meant of course said mrs riddel recovering herself with a laugh  i had no idea  stillif you prefer  the major took her hand again and miss philpotts set mr halibut an examplewhich he did not followby gazing meditatively out of the window  finally she gathered up her work and quitted the room  mrs riddel smiled over at mr halibut and nodded toward the major  illustrations dont you think major brill is somewhat hasty in his conclusions she inquired softly  dont you think major brill is somewhat hasty in his conclusions  she inquired softly  ill tell major brill what i think of him when i get him alone said the injured gentleman sourly
