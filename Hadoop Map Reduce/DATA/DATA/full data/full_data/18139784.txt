of massachusetts on the first day of may in the year 1775  master edward mott and noah phelps forming a committee appointed by the provincial assembly of connecticut had arrived on the previous evening charged with an important commission the making known of which had so aroused the inhabitants of the peaceful settlement that it was as if the reports of the muskets fired at lexington and concord were actually ringing in their ears  these two gentlemen had with them a following of sixteen men equipped as if for battle and the arrival of so large an armed body had aroused the curiosity of the good people until all were painfully eager to learn the reason for what seemed little less than an invasion  when it was whispered around that master mott and phelps had immediately upon their arrival inquired for colonel james easton and master john brown and were even then closeted with those citizens the more knowing ones predicted that this coming had much to do with the warlike preparations that were making in boston and new york designed to put a check upon the unlawful doings of his majesty the king  when morning came that is to say on this first day of may it was generally understood throughout the settlement that the provincial assembly of connecticut had agreed upon a plan to seize the munitions of war at ticonderoga for the use of that body of men known as the american army then gathered at cambridge and roxbury in the province of massachusetts  the gossips of pittsfield stated that one thousand dollars had been advanced from the provincial treasury of connecticut to pay the expenses of the expedition that the sixteen men making up the following of the committee were recruits who had pledged themselves to capture this important fortress which formed the key of communication between new york and the canadas and that they proposed to march through the country to shoreham opposite ticonderoga recruiting as they went with the belief that on arriving there their force would be sufficiently large to capture the fort  the boys as well as the men were highly excited as was but natural by such rumors and a certain isaac rice who prided himself upon being fourteen years old instead of gathering with his companions listening eagerly to every word which dropped from the lips of the older members of the community conceived the idea of applying to what he believed to be the fountainhead of all information regarding military matters  this supposedly wise man was none other than corporal elijah watkins generally known as corporal lige sometimes spoken of as master watkins but always to isaac rice the corporal  he was looked upon as an old man when he served under abercrombie at ticonderoga in 58 and believed of a surety he was as well informed in military affairs as isaac rice his ardent disciple fancied him to be  ever ready to give advice on important matters not backward about criticising the alleged mistakes of his superiors and holding himself as with the idea that during the late troubles with the french he had learned all the art of warfare but yet with such possibly disagreeable qualities corporal lige had shown himself to be a brave soldier willing at any time to do more even than was his duty  the old man was sitting outside the door of a tiny log building which he called home smoking peacefully much as he might have done had the committee from connecticut never passed that way and this apparent indifference surprised the boy  why corporal dont you know whats going on in the town havent you heard that they are talking of taking the fort at ticonderoga and running the king out of the country  first and foremost isaac lad are you so ignorant as to think the king is here in this ere province to be run out an then agin cant you realize that talkins one thing an doins another  yes but corporal havent you heard the news  if you mean so far as concerns the committee from connecticut isaac i have heard it and whats more master noah phelps talked with me before ever he went to see colonel easton he knew where he could get information about ticonderoga for bless your soul lad wasnt i there in 58 an would you find a stick or stone around the place that i cant call to mind  did master phelps come to see you first  well yes lad it mounted to much the same thing i was down the road when he come into town an seein me he acted like as if a great load had been lifted off his shoulders cause he knowed i could tell him a thing or two if i was minded goodevenin to you corporal lige he said sweet as honey in the honeycomb and i passed the time of day with him kind of suspicionin something of this same business was goin on want to take a little trip up through the country he asked friendlylike and do you know lad the whole plan come to me in a minute an i says to him says i master phelps you can count me in if it so be yore goin toward the lakes thats where were bound for corporal lige says he and ill put your name down i said says i its rations an somethin in the way of pay i reckon an he allowed as that part of it would be all fixed especially with me cause you see lad it wouldnt be much good for these people what never knew anything bout war to start out leavin me behind why bless your heart i allow thats why they come through pittsfield jest for the purpose of seein corporal lige  the old man ceased speaking to puff dense volumes of smoke from his pipe and isaac rice gazed at him in wonder and amaze  that the committee from connecticut had visited the town for the sole and only reason of inducing the corporal to join the force there was no question in his mind and now more implicitly than ever before did he believe that throughout all the provinces there could be found no abler soldier than corporal lige  yes lad im goin with the committee more to tell em what they ought to do as you might say than to serve as a private soldier for you see i know ticonderoga root and branch i could tell you the whole story from the meanin of the name down to who is in command of it this very minute if there was time  but there is corporal the committee are talkin to colonel easton and master brown now and dont count on leaving here before tomorrow  what do they want of the colonel  i dont know but they are stopping at his house  i aint sayin but that the colonel is as good a soldier as youll find around here but bless your soul lad though it aint for me to say it he could learn considerable from corporal lige if he was to spend a few hours every now and then listenin  but tell me all you can about ticonderoga corporal  the old man looked around furtively as if halfexpecting the committee from connecticut or colonel easton might be coming to ask his advice on some disputed point and then shaking his forefinger now and again at the lad much as though to prevent contradiction he began  in the first place the folks round here call it ticonderoga when it aint anything of the kind the real name is cheonderoga which is iroquois lingo for sounding water being called so i allow because the falls at lake george make a deal of noise the french built breastworks there in 55 which they christened fort carillon now you see its a mighty strong place owin to the situation and its bein located on a point which so ive heard said rises moren a hundred feet above the level of the water the solid part of itthat is to say the landis only about five hundred acres three sides are surrounded by water an in the rear is a swamp that much for the advantages of the spot so to speak now i was there in july of 58 when montcalm held the fort with four thousand men lord howe was second in command of general abercrombies forces and major putnam down here was with the crowd thats when the major wouldnt let his lordship go into the battle first but banged right along ahead until we come to the first breastworks finding it so strong that the troops were marched back to the landin place and went into bivouac for the night it was the sixth day of july on the eighth we tried it again but the fort couldnt be carried an the blood that was shed there lad all under the british flag would come pretty nigh drownin every man woman an child in this ere settlement on the twentysixth of july in the year 1759 general amherst with eleven thousand men scared the french out they didnt fire a gun but abandoned the fortification and fled to crown point since that time the kings forces have held it  how many are there now isaac asked not so much for the purpose of gaining information as to tempt the old man to continue his story  i cant rightly say lad though its somewhere in the neighborhood of fifty the commandant is or was when i last heard one captain delaplace and it is said that hes a thorough soldier though im allowin he hasnt got any too much of a force with him  do you think the connecticut gentlemen can raise men enough between here and there to take a fort which resisted general abercrombies entire army  that remains to be seen lad if they are willin to act on such advice as can be got from some people hereabouts i allow theres a good chance for it more especially if the green mountain boys take a hand in the matter as master phelps thinks probable in that case colonel ethan allen would most likely be in command  and you are really going corporal asked isaac  yes lad it dont seem as though i ought to hang back back when im needed if all we hear from the other provinces is true youll be old enough to take a hand in the scrimmage before the fightins over so heres a chance to serve an apprenticeship if it so be youre of the mind ill take you under my wing an by the time we get back youll have a pretty decently good idea of a soldiers trade  do you really mean it corporal and isaac sprang to his feet in excitement do you really mean that i may go with you just as if i was of age to carry a gun  ay lad if it so be your mother an father are willin an i cant see why they shouldnt agree seeins how they know the company youll be in it would seem different if you talked of goin with the general run of recruits who are green hands at this kind of work  but will the committee allow a lad of my age to go as a soldier  isaac my boy when corporal lige says to master phelps says he this ere lad is goin under my wing so to speak why bless your heart thats the end of the whole business theyve got to have me an wont stand out about your joinin when its known my heart is set on it  will you come now while i ask my mother  well lad i aint prepared to say as how i will but this much im promisin go to her an find out how shes feelin about the matter if theres any waverin in her mind ill step inyou see ill be the reserves in this casean when i charge shes bound to surrender but if it so happens that shes dead set against it at the start why you had best not vex her by tryin to push the matter  having perfect faith in the corporals wisdom isaac was thoroughly satisfied with this decision and after the old man had promised to await his return at that point the lad set out for home at full speed  perhaps if isaac had been the only son of his mother he would have found it difficult to gain her permission for such an adventure as corporal lige had proposed  there were five other boys in the family and isaac was neither the oldest nor the youngest  the fact that mrs rice had so many did not cause her to be unmindful of any but less timorous perhaps about parting with one  however it may be the lad gained the desired permission providing his father would assent and this last was little more than a formality  master rice was found among the throng of citizens in front of the inn where recruiting was going on briskly  the opportunity served to give the good man a certain semblance of patriotism when he showed himself willing that one of his sons should go for a soldier and he would have had the boy sign the rolls then and there but that isaac demurred  it was not in his mind to enlist save in the company and after being again assured of the corporals protection therefore he insisted on presenting himself as the old mans recruit rather than his fathers offering  corporal lige was well pleased when isaac returned with a detailed account of all that had taken place and said approvingly  you have shown yourself to be a lad of rare discretion isaac rice and i will take it upon myself to see that such forethought brings due reward suppose you had signed the rolls at the inn what would you be then nothin more than a private  but that is all i shall be when i sign them with you corporal  it may appear that way im free to admit lad but still you will be a deal higher than any noncommissioned officer because youll be under my wing and when we have taken ticonderoga though i aint admitting thats the proper name of the fortwhen weve taken that i say youll be fit for any kind of a commission that youre qualified to hold  yes isaac replied doubtfully and then he fell to speculating as to whether even though corporal lige did not take him under his wing he might not be fit to fill any position for which he was qualified  while he was thus musing a messenger came from master phelps saying the recruiting was coming to an end in this town and the party would set out that same afternoon on their way to bennington expecting to enlist volunteers from colonel eastons regiment of militia as they passed through the country  never you fear but that ill be right at my post of duty when the command is given to form ranks corporal lige said to the messenger and after the latter had departed he added as he turned to the boy now isaac lad you can see what they think of corporal lige colonel easton and master brown are hangin round the inn instead of waitin for the committee to visit them an what do i do why i stay quietly here knowin they cant well get along without me an instead of coolin my heels among a lot of raw recruits im sent for when the time is come as if i was a staff officer thats one thing you want to bear in mind if you dont count yourself of any importance other people are mighty apt to pass you by as a neerdowell  but i havent enlisted yet corporal  of course you have when you said to me im ready to go as your apprentice in this ere business it was jest the same as if youd signed the rolls ill arrange all that matter with master phelps my lad now do you hasten home get what you can pick up in the way of an outfit borrow your fathers gun and kind of mention the fact to your mother that the more she gives in the way of provisions the better youll be fed for you an me are likely to mess together  how much are you going to take corporal  that will depend a good deal on what kind of a supply your mother furnishes im willin to admit shes nigh on to as good a cook as can be found in pittsfield an will take my chances on what she puts up for you providin theres enough of it  of course you are to take your musket  i should be a pretty poor kind of a soldier if i didnt ladthe same one i used under abercrombie and he pointed with his thumb toward the interior of the dwelling where as isaac knew a wellworn weapon hung on hooks just over the fireplace its one of the kings arms an i reckon will do as good service against him as it did for him which is saying considerable lad as major putnam can vouch for now set about making ready for we two above all others must not be behindhand when the column moves  a fine thing it was to be a soldier so isaac thought as he went leisurely from corporal liges log hut to his home he was forced to pass through the entire length of the village stopping here and there to acquaint a friend with what he believed to be a most important fact  among all the lads in pittsfield of about his own age he was the only one who proposed to enlist and from all he heard and saw there could be no question but that he was envied by his companions  from the youngest boy to the oldest man the citizens were in such a ferment of excitement as gave recruits the idea that to enlist was simply providing amusement for themselves during a certain number of days and with the exception of those experienced in such matters no person believed for a moment that the brave ones who were rallying at their countrys call would suffer hardships or privations  in fact this going forth to capture the fort at ticonderoga was to be a pleasure excursion rather than anything else and isaac rice believed he was the most fortunate lad in the province of massachusetts  his outfit did not require that his mother should spend very much time upon it  the clothes he wore comprised the only suit he owned and when two shirts and three pairs of stockings had been made into a parcel of the smallest possible size and he had borrowed his fathers gun powder horn and shot pouch the equipment was complete  then came the most important of the preparations to isaacs mind for he knew the corporal would criticize it closelythe store of provisions  had he been allowed his own bent the remainder of the rice family might have been put on short allowance for with a view to pleasing the corporal he urged that this article of food and then that should be put into the bag which served him as a haversack until the larder must have been completely emptied but for his mothers emphatic refusal to follow such suggestions  if mrs rice did not shed bitter tears over isaac when he left her to join the recruits it was because she shared the opinion of many others in pittsfield and felt positive the lad would soon return none the worse for his short time of soldiering  it was but natural she should take a most affectionate farewell of him however even though believing he would be in no especial danger and a glimpse of the tears which his mother could not restrain caused an uncomfortable swelling in the wouldbe soldiers throat  this leaving home even to march away by the side of corporal lige was not as pleasant as he had supposed and for the moment he ceased to so much as think of the provisionbag  now see here mother he said with a brave attempt at indifference im not counting on doing anything more than help take the fort and since the corporal is to be with us that cant be a long task  you will ever be a good boy isaac  of course mother  and you will write me a letter if it so be you find the opportunity  this was not a pleasing prospect to the boy for he had never found it an easy task to make a fair copy of the single line set down at the top of his writingbook but his heart was sore for the moment and he would have promised even more in order to check his mothers tears  therefore it was he agreed to make her acquainted with all his movements so far as should be possible and that done it seemed as if the sting was taken in a great measure from the parting  feeling more like a man than ever before in his life isaac set forth from his home with a heavy musket over his shoulder and the bag of provisions hanging at his back glancing neither to the right nor to the left until he arrived at the corporals dwelling  an exclamation of surprise and delight burst from his lips when he saw the old man armed and equipped as he had been in 58 wearing the uniform of a british soldier even though by thus setting out he was proving his disloyalty to the king  well you do look fine corporal i dare wager there are none who will set forth from this town as much a soldier as you  i reckon colonel easton will come out great with his militia uniform but what does it amount to except for the value of the gold lace thats on it all im wearin has seen service an though it aint for me to say it i shouldnt be surprised if him as is inside this ere red coat could tell the militia colonel much regarding his duty  of course you can corporal every one knows that an im expecting to see you put next in command to colonel allen if it so be he goes  not quite that lad not quite that for theres jealousy in the ranks the same as outside of them though i warrant many of em will be glad to ask corporal liges advice before this ere business is over now lets have a look to your stores and well be off  the examination of the impromptu haversack appeared to be satisfactory to the old man and without doing more in the way of securing his dwelling from intruders than shutting the outer door he marched down the street with such a swagger as he evidently believed befitting a soldier  isaac followed meekly at his heels troubling his head not one whit because he lacked a uniform but believing he shared to a certain degree in corporal liges gorgeousness and martial bearing  the two came to a halt outside the inn standing stiffly at attention and there they remained until master phelps was forced to go out and bid the old man enter that the formality of signing the rolls might be gone through with after which isaac rice was duly entitled to call himself a militiaman     chapter ii  a secluded camp   when these raw recruits departed from the towncorporal lige insisted that they did not marchthey were followed for several miles by nearly all the men and boys in the vicinity  the old man was greatly exercised because colonel easton who now assumed command allowed such an unsoldierly proceeding as that his troops should walk arm in arm with their friends each in his own manner and at his own convenience  had the corporal been invested with the proper authority he would have had these raw recruits marshaled into ranks and forced to step in unison carrying their muskets at the same angle and otherwise conforming themselves to his idea of soldierly bearingall this he would have had them do but whether he could have brought about such a condition of affairs is extremely problematical  i allowed colonel james easton came somewhere near bein a soldier even though he is only a militiaman the corporal said in a tone of intense dissatisfaction to isaac as the two marched solemnly side by side in the midst of their disorderly companions and i did think we could set out from here and capture ticonderoga if all hands were willin to put their shoulders to the wheel but i take back that statement lad and am sorry i ever was so foolish as to enlist i ought to have known better when i saw the crowd that was signin the rolls  why whats the matter corporal and isaac looked around in surprise for until this moment he had believed everything was progressing in proper military fashion  matter corporal lige cried angrily look around and see how these men are comportin themselves an then youll know here are them as should be soldiers seeins theyve signed the rolls mixed up with citizens till you couldnt tell one from the other unless personally acquainted with all hands then how are they marchin why a flock of geese couldnt straggle along in any more ungainly fashion  i shouldnt suppose it would make any difference how they marched so that they got there in time isaac ventured to suggest timidly  shouldnt eh then whats the good of calling themselves soldiers why dont they start out like a crowd of farmers an try their hand at taking the fort  well isaac replied calmly why shouldnt they they are not soldiers you know corporal and so longs the fort is taken why wouldnt it be as well if they didnt try to ape military manners  the old man gazed sternly at the boy while one might have counted ten and then said in a tone of sadness  its a shame isaac rice that after bein with me all these years an hearin more or less regardin military matters you shouldnt have more sense  why what have i said now corporal is it any harm to think that farmers might take a fort  of course it is lad if anything of that kind could happen whats the use of having soldiers  but i suppose it is necessary to have an army if theres going to be war isaac replied innocently and this last was sufficient to completely fill the vials of the old mans wrath  that this pupil of his should fail at the very first opportunity to show a proper spirit was to him most disappointing and during the halfhour which followed he refused to speak even though isaac alternately begged his pardon for having been so ignorant and expressed regret that he had said anything which might give offense  during all this while the citizens of pittsfield were following the recruits in a most friendly manner believing it their duty to thus cheer those who might soon be amid the carnage of battle and perhaps not one realized how seriously he was by such method offending corporal lige  isaacs father was among this wellintentioned following as were two of the lads brothers and when these representatives of the rice family having walked as far as the head of the household deemed necessary were about to turn back they ranged themselves either side of the corporal and his pupil in order to bid the latter farewell  i expect you will give a good account of yourself isaac when it comes to fighting and i feel all the more confident in regard to it because you are under the wing of a man who knows what it is to be a soldier  this compliment was intended for corporal lige as a matter of course but he paid no other attention to it than to say  if the lad had profited by my teachings hed know that he has no right to talk with outsiders while hes in the ranks  thats exactly it mr rice replied wholly oblivious that the corporal was administering what he believed to be a most severe rebuke that is exactly it my son and you will do well to remember that you cannot fail in your duty so long as you take pattern from the corporal  the old soldier gave vent to what can be described only as a snort of contempt and the boys sorrow was as nothing compared with what it had been when bidding goodby to his mother  after the young rices had turned their faces homeward in obedience to the orders of the elder rice isaac gave more heed to copying the movements of the corporal thereby atoning in a certain measure for his previous injudicious remarks  the boy firmly believed that no more able soldier could be found in all the colonies than this same corporal lige and had any person ventured to remark that the expedition might be as well off without him isaac would have set the speaker down as one lacking common sense  take the corporal out of the ranks and young rice would have said there was no possibility either crown point or ticonderoga could be captured  thus it was that an order from colonel allen colonel easton or seth warner was as nothing compared with one from corporal lige in the mind of isaac rice but there were many in the ranks who did not have such an exalted opinion of the old soldier and these were free with their criticisms and unfavorable remarks much against the raw recruits peace of mind as well as the corporals annoyance  it was because of these lightheaded volunteers who saw only in this expedition a novel and agreeable form of junketing out of which it was their duty to extract all the sport possible regardless of the feelings of others that corporal lige withdrew himself so to speak from his comrades and barely acknowledged the salutes of any save his superior officers  at the end of the second days journey he refused to go into camp with them but applied to the captain of his company for permission to advance yet a short distance further at which point he could join the troops when they came forward next morning it was known by all the expedition even including those who were making the old soldier the butt of their mirth that he was held in high esteem by colonel ethan allen and the request although irregular was readily granted after a warning against the perils attendant upon such a course  it is better you stay with the troops corporal the captain said kindly although i have no hesitation in saying you are free to do as you choose  and i do not choose to remain in the encampment for all the young geesewho fancy that by signing the rolls they have become soldiersto sharpen their wits upon therefore i would halt by myself taking only the recruit i claim as my own for company  i will have a care that you are not annoyed again the officer replied in a kindly tone but this was not to corporal liges liking  if a soldier can only keep his selfrespect by running to his superior officers like a schoolboy when matters are not to his fancy it is time he left the ranks after we have smelt burning powder i fancy these youngsters will keep a civil tongue in their heads and until then i had best care for myself  this was such good logic that the captain could oppose no solid argument against it therefore the old soldier received permission for himself and his recruit to form camp wherever it should please him provided however that they remained in the ranks while the command was advancing  not until after the matter had been thus settled did the captain take it upon himself to warn the corporal that it was not wholly safe to thus separate from his companions  it is well known that our movements are being watched by both tories and indians he said in a friendly manner such as would not offend the obstinate old soldier and you can well fancy that they would not hesitate to do some mischief to any of the expedition whom they might come upon alone  i can take care of myself and also the boy corporal lige replied stiffly as he saluted his superior officer with unusual gravity and with this the subject was dropped  then the old man said to his recruit as he motioned him aside that others might not get information concerning his purpose  well draw such rations as may be served out lad and then push ahead to where we can be in the company of sensible people meaning our two selves  isaac would have felt decidedly more safe if he could remain with the main body of troops for he had heard the captains caution but he did not think it wise to give such a desire words and by his silence signified that he was ready to do whatsoever his instructor should deem to be for the best  the rations served these volunteers who proposed to reduce the forts at ticonderoga and crown point ere they yet knew a soldiers duties were not generous and he who from a desire to avoid seeming greedy delayed in applying for them generally found himself without food save he might be so fortunate as to beg some from his more provident companions  corporal lige was exceedingly friendly to his stomach he made it a rule never to allow modesty to deprive him of a full share of whatever might be served out therefore it was he had drawn rations for himself and isaac almost before the troops came to a halt and the hindermost were yet marching into camp weary and travelstained when he said to his small comrade  there is nothing to keep us here longer and the sooner we are at a goodly distance from these silly youngsters who fancy that the taking of a musket in their hands makes them soldiers the better i shall be pleased  isaac gave token of willingness to continue the march by shouldering his weapon once more and the two set off attracting no attention from their companionsinarms each of whom had little thought save to minister to his own comfort for this soldiering was rapidly becoming more of a task and less of a pleasuretour than had been at first supposed  not until he was fully a mile from the foremost of the main body did the corporal give any evidence of an intention to halt and then he showed remarkably good judgment in his selection of a campingplace  at the edge of a small brook about fifty yards from the main road over which they had been traveling he threw down his knapsack and announced in a tone of satisfaction that they would spend the night there  it is not too far away and yet at such a distance that we shall not be forced to listen to the gabbling of those geese he said as he set about building a small campfire in order to prepare the food he had procured make yourself comfortable isaac rice for it is a soldiers solemn duty to gain all the rest he can  do you think we shall be safe here the boy asked almost timidly for it seemed little short of a crime to question any proposition made by the corporal  safe lad whats to prevent if you keep your ears open for stories of danger while you are with the army youll never know peace of mind for there are always those fainthearted ones ready to exaggerate the falling of a leaf into the coming of the enemy i have as much regard for my own safety as for yours and i say that here we can camp in peace and safety  this was sufficient for the corporals recruit and he set about making himself comfortable with the conviction that none knew better than his comrade the general condition of affairs     chapter iii  an unpleasant surprise   surely this camping by themselves was exceedingly pleasant isaac thought as the old soldier took upon himself the duties of cook leaving his recruit with nothing to do save watch him as he worked  on the previous night they had slept in the midst of a noisy throng who chattered and made merry until an exceedingly late hour thus preventing the more weary from sleeping and everywhere in the air hanging like clouds was the dust raised by the feet of so many men  now these two were in the seclusion of the woods with a carpet of grass for a bed the rippling brook to lull them to slumber and nothing more noisy than the insect life everywhere around to disturb their slumbers  corporal lige was in a rare good humor he prepared an appetizing meal although his materials were none of the best and when it had been eaten seated himself by isaacs side with pipe in his mouth ready and willing to spin yarns of his previous experience as a soldier  the boy was an eager listener but after a certain time even the tones of the old soldiers voice were not sufficient to banish the sleep elves and his eyes closed in unconsciousness just when his comrade had arrived at the most exciting portion of his narrative  perhaps i shant be so willin the next time you want to hear what ive seen in this world corporal lige said testily when he observed that his audience was asleep and then knocking the ashes carefully from his pipe he lay down by the side of his small companion  it seemed to isaac that he had hardly more than closed his eyes in unconsciousness when he was aroused by the pressure of some heavy substance upon his hand and looking up quickly he saw in the dim light three men standing over the corporal  the foot of one of these strangers was upon the boys hand as if he did not think isaac of sufficient importance either to warrant his taking him prisoner or to so much as step aside that he might be spared pain  before hearing a single word isaac understood that these latecomers were no friends of the corporals and he endured the pain in silence hoping that by so doing he might escape observation  it was hardly probable the strangers failed to see him for he had been lying within a few feet of his companion but that he was not the object of their regard could be readily understood  the man who had thus pinned the boy to the earth by his heel wore moccasins rather than boots otherwise isaac would have received severe injury and as it was the corporals recruit suffered considerable pain before the foot was finally removed but yet made no sound  so far as he could judge by the conversation these strangers must have been in camp some time before he was awakened for when he first opened his eyes they were in the midst of an unpleasant conversation with the old soldier such as had evidently been carried on for some moments  if he dont choose to tell string him up to a tree one of the party cried impatiently at the moment isaac first became conscious that matters were not running smoothly in this private encampment a dead rebel is of more good than a live one and we have no time to lose  hang me if thats what youre hankerin for corporal lige cried in a voice that sounded thick and choked as if a heavy pressure was upon his throat even though i knew more concernin this ere expedition than i do not a word should i speak  well soon see whether youre so willing to dance on nothing the first speaker cried vindictively and then came noises as if the man was making ready to carry his threat into execution  give him another chance one of the tories suggested let the old fool tell us all he knows of allens plans an well leave him none the worse for our coming  i know nothing the corporal cried in a rage do you reckon the colonel would lay out his campaign before me  it is said he did so before you left pittsfield  whoever says that is a liar but even though he had made the fullest explanations i would not reveal the plans to you you must think im a mighty poor kind of a soldier if i dont know how to die rather than play the traitor  youll soon have a chance of proving what you can do the third man cried angrily and then it was he stepped forward leaving isaac free to do as he thought best  that these three tories were bent on hanging the old soldier or at least so nearly doing so as to frighten him into disclosing all he knew regarding colonel allens plans there could be no question and young rice trembling with fear though he was had no other thought than as to how it might be possible for him to aid his comrade  it did not seem probable the men were ignorant regarding the boys presence and the only explanation which can be made as to why they failed to secure him is that he was so nearly a child as to appear of but little consequence they evidently had no thought that he could in any way thwart their purpose and therefore no heed was given to him  it can readily be imagined that isaac did not waste much time in speculations as to why he was allowed to remain at liberty  now was come the moment when he might repay some portion of the debt he believed he owed corporal lige and the only anxiety in his mind was lest he should not do it in proper military fashion  he could not even so much as guess what a genuine soldier would do under the same circumstances but he had a very good idea as to how a boy might extricate himself from such a difficulty and lost no time in beginning the work  the three men were so busily engaged trying to frighten the corporal into telling them what he might know of colonel allens forces as not to heed the noise isaac made when he rolled himself toward the bushes in that direction where the two muskets had been set up against a tree under the foliage in such manner that they might not be affected by the dew  it was impossible for him to say exactly what these intruders were doing to corporal lige but from the noises he judged they had first made a prisoner of the old man by seizing him around the throat perhaps while he was yet asleep and now there was every indication that they were making ready to carry out the threat of hanging  give him another chance to tell what he knows one of the men cried and immediately afterward the old soldier replied  string me up if you will for theres no need of waiting any longer with the idea that im goin to give you any information even if i have it  then up with him the man who had first spoken shouted and isaac without looking in that direction heard the confused noises which told him the enemy were trying to raise the old man to his feet  by this time the boy had his hand on one of the muskets and his first impulse was to discharge it full at the intruders but before he could act the thought came that there were two shots at his disposal and he ought to so plan as to make both of them count he believed it was necessary to work with the utmost speed lest these three tories should have hung the corporal before he was ready to interfere and yet a certain number of seconds were absolutely necessary before he could carry out that plan which had suddenly come into his mind  with both muskets under his arm he crept cautiously a few paces onward until screened by the foliage and then raising one of the weapons took deliberate aim at the nearest enemy  there was no thought in his mind that he was thus compassing the death of a human being he only knew his comrades life was in danger and that a welldirected shot might save him  the three men had by this time gotten a rope around corporal liges neck and finding that it was difficult to raise the old man to his feet were throwing the halter over the limb of the nearest tree as a method of saving labor  one of the tories he who appeared to be the elder and who was directing the movements of the others stood a few paces from his comrades and taking deliberate aim at him isaac shouted  throw down your weapons and surrender or you are dead men  the words had but just been spoken when he discharged the musket and a scream of pain from the living target told that the bullet had sped true to its mark  the two men who were as yet unarmed dropped the rope they were holding and sprang toward their weapons which had been left on the ground near by but before they could reach them isaac had emptied a second musket and another cry of pain rang out  throw down your weapons and surrender or you are dead men he shouted again and at this the third tory who must have believed there was more than one man in the thicket took to his heels in alarm while corporal lige who had received no worse injury than a severe choking seized upon the three muskets which were lying close beside him  even now when two of the intruders were wounded and the third running for dear life isaac was doubtful as to whether he should show himself  he remained in concealment while the corporal gazed around him in surprise for a dozen seconds or more and gave no token of his whereabouts until the old man shouted  hello friends show yourselves  is it all right isaac asked timidly and in a tone which was little better than a squeak is it all right corporal  come in here isaac rice can it be it was you who fired those shots  the raw recruit came forward almost timidly and corporal lige shifting the three muskets he had taken possession of over on to his left arm seized the boy by the hand  ive done a good bit of soldierin in my day lad seen surprises an ambushes an attacks of a similar kind without number but never did i know of anything that was done with more neatness an dispatch than this same job of yours which has saved my neck from bein stretched im proud of you lad  isaac was overwhelmed by this praise yet not to such an extent but that there was a great fear in his mind lest he had taken a human life and he asked anxiously  do you suppose i hurt either of them seriously corporal lige and he pointed to where the wounded men lay  it is to be hoped you killed em both so that we may be spared any further trouble with the vermin and not until then did the corporal condescend to give any attention to those enemies who had been so sadly worsted by a boy  just at this moment the wounded tories suffered more in mind than in body for they now understood who had made the attack upon them and it can readily be fancied that both were ashamed at having been thus defeated in their purpose by one whom they had considered of so little importance that no effort was made to deprive him of his liberty when they surprised the encampment  it was with the most intense relief that young rice heard the corporals report which was to the effect that he who had acted as leader of the party had a severe but apparently not exceedingly dangerous wound in the shoulder while his comrade was suffering from a bullethole in the leg  theyre disabled lad but not killed an the first bit of soldierin that you have been called on to do is like to give great credit with such as colonel allen and colonel easton tell me how you happened to think of overcoming them in this shape  i didnt think of it the boy replied it seemed to me you were like to be hanged and i only did what was in my power  i came nigher to havin my neck stretched than ever before an as it was the villainous tories pulled mighty hard on that rope before you effected the rescue but lad you must have thought this attack you made in such a soldierly fashion wasnt the result of chance an that ill go bail  it was useless to make any attempt at convincing corporal lige of what was only the truth  the old man was so determined to look upon the rescue as a soldierly act that he would not accept any other explanation and the boy ceased his fruitless efforts by asking  what is to be done with these two tories  i reckon they must be got back to camp although it would be no more than servin em right if we put an end to their miserable lives without further parley  oh you wouldnt kill them in cold blood corporal lige isaac cried in alarm  no i dont reckon i would though thats what ought to be done with em its plain you an i cant lug the two a matter of a mile or more so one must stand guard over em while the other goes back to the camp im leavin it to you to say which service youll perform for after this nights work im willin to admit that my recruit has in him the makins of a better soldier than i can ever hope to be  the boy gave no heed to this praise at the time although later he remembered the words with pleasure  now there was in his mind a fear lest the corporal should desire him to guard the prisoners and the more imminent danger over he was growing exceedingly timorous  ill go back to the encampment if it so please you corporal lige because i can run faster than you  as you will lad as you will explain to colonel ethan allen what has happened here and let him say how these venomous snakes are to be treated  during this conversation neither of the wounded men had spoken but now as the boy was about to set out for the encampment he who had evidently acted as the leader cried sharply  hold on a bit what is the sense of sending us into your camp when we are like to die why not give us a show for our lives  in what way corporal lige asked sternly  by allowing us to go to our homes  that will do the old soldier said angrily after your attempt to kill me im not such a simple as to let you go scot free get you gone lad and make the report to colonel allen as soon as may be  the wounded tory continued to plead with the corporal but isaac did not wait to hear anything more  he set out at full speed down the road in the direction where the troops were encamped running at his best pace and fearing each instant lest that tory who had made his escape should suddenly come upon him     chapter iv  the letter   when isaac was come within hailing distance of the few sentinels who had been posted to guard against a surprise he was astonished at being halted after having announced who he was and the laxness of military discipline can be understood when it is said that after being recognized by the recruit at that particular post the boy was allowed to enter the encampment without further question  colonel allen was not better lodged than his men a leanto formed of a few boughs was the only shelter he had and isaac was forced to search among the sleeping soldiers several moments before discovering the whereabouts of the commander  once this had been done it was but the work of a few seconds to acquaint the officer with what had occurred and at this evidence that the tories were dogging the little army more than one recruit who had boasted the loudest as to what he would do when the time for fighting should come turned suspiciously pale as he approached to hear all isaac was saying  why did corporal watkins camp by himself colonel allen asked when the boy concluded his report  because some of the men poke fun at him allowin that hes too old to be of service an far too crochety to make any fist at bein a soldier isaac replied promptly  i wish from the bottom of my heart that i had one hundred men like him rather than some of the braggarts who do not know there is such a work as the manual of arms the colonel said in a loud voice as if desirous that all should hear tell the corporal that he will camp with this force in the future and i shall make it my especial business to learn who it is that dares make matters uncomfortable for him  then to the captain of the company to which corporal lige was attached an order was given that a squad of men be sent forward to bring in the prisoners and when this had been obeyed the old soldier as a matter of course returned with them  from that night isaac heard nothing more regarding the wounded tories it was said they had been sent back to pittsfield under a strong guard and certain it is they disappeared from the encampment before daybreak but neither the boy nor the corporal could find a single man who had seen them depart  this incident and it was hardly to be spoken of as anything of importance together with colonel allens remark served to render corporal liges life more pleasant for those who had used him as the butt of their mirth began to understand that he was superior to themselves in a soldierly way and more than one sought his advice on various occasions  at sunset on the seventh day of may the raw recruits had arrived at castleton fourteen miles east of skenesborough and isaac himself has given the details of that straggling march through the country in the first letter written to his mother after setting out as a soldier                                                     may the eighth 1775    my dear mother father and children    we have been camping here in this thicket since last night and if   there is anybody in all the company more tired of soldiering than i   am i would like to meet him i wore a hole in the heel of my stocking   on the second day and got such a blister because of it that ive been   obliged to go barefoot ever since    we have had plenty to eat for the folks along the road were most   kind but its sleeping that has been the worst on me though the   corporal says i never can hope to be a soldier till im able to lay   down in three or four inches of water and get as much rest as i would   at home in bed i tell him i dont hope to be one any more for ive   had about enough of it though of course i shall stick by the company   till weve taken the fort and its pretty certain we shall do that   because now there are two hundred and seventy men in the ranks    colonel easton enlisted thirtynine of his militia before we got to   bennington and there we were joined by the green mountain boys under   the command of colonel ethan allen    it surprised me to find that a good many of the people dont believe   we are doing right in trying to take away the fort from the kings   troops and the corporal says that unless this thing is a success we   are all like to be hanged for traitors because his majesty will make   an example of them who are foremost in the workwhich means us    two hours after we halted last night colonel benedict arnold who is   said to have gone from new haven as captain of a company to   cambridge arrived here with a few men and a large amountso it seems   to meof military supplies    although knowing that colonel allen is in charge of this force he   claimed the right to take command and so the corporal says made   display of a commission signed by the massachusetts committee of   safety declaring that it entitled him to take charge of all the   troops now although im not a soldierthe corporal says i never   will beive got sense enough to understand that if i enlisted under   colonel easton and was willing he should give way to colonel allen so   we might have the green mountain boys with us the massachusetts   committee of safety have got nothing to do with saying who shall lead   in the battlethough i hope to goodness we shant see one    the corporal says that no committee is going to scare ethan allen   and its certain so those of the green mountain boys with whom ive   talked say that this stranger wont get himself into command of the   company even though as is said he brings one hundred pounds in   money two hundred pounds weight of gunpowder the same of leaden   balls and one thousand flints to carry all of which and himself he   has ten horses    now the corporal claims that these things including the money are   munitions of war and that if colonel arnold doesnt deliver them over   to colonel allen they will be taken from him and he corporal lige   i mean went early this morning to master phelps offering to see to   it that this property was delivered up to us but for some reason or   otherneither the corporal nor i can understand whathis offer was   not accepted    i have heard it said and the corporal is of the opinion it is true   that when the council of war was held last night before this gentleman   from new haven arrived colonel allen was chosen commander of the   whole expedition colonel easton second in command and seth warner   third it was decided that the greater number of us with the   principal officers would march from here to shorehamwhich you know   is opposite ticonderogaand captain herrick with thirty men would at   the same time go to skenesborough to capture young major skene whose   father the governor is now in england seize all the boats they can   find and join us at shoreham captain douglas is to go to panton with   a small troop and get whatever craft is in the water roundabout the   corporal says he shall be quite well satisfied with this arrangement   providing the remainder of the plan is mapped out as he thinks right    however nobody seems to know whether colonel arnold will manage to   get his commission from the massachusetts committee of safety   recognized as good and sufficient authority for him to lord it over   our people and we ask each other what will become of his munitions of   war in case he doesnt or how may the plans be changed if he does    what i cant understand in this whole business is why the corporal   shouldnt be the third officer in command instead of master warner   who i have no doubt is a very worthy gentleman but of course cannot   claim to be any such soldier as corporal lige he says theres always   a lot of jealousy among officers in the army and thats why he isnt   to be given a chance to show how much he can do    the food i brought from home was used up the second daythe corporal   had what he called a coming appetiteand perhaps it was just as   well for i had all the load any fellow could want to carry i never   believed before leaving home that fathers musket was so heavy i held   it over my shoulder until it seemed as if the flesh was worn right   down to the bone then lugged it in my hand till my arm ached as if it   was going to drop off and i verily believe i would have thrown the   thing away but that corporal lige said a soldier didnt amount to   very much unless he had a weapon of some kind    the corporal says i am to give you his dutiful compliments and to   say that if his life is spared by the blessing of god he will   capture ticonderoga before we come back    as for me i wish i was at home now though it will be a fine thing   if we do what the old man says is our duty in these times without   being hanged    i havent yet found out why people think there is so much honor to be   gained in being a soldier to my mind its much like any other way of   running around the country but the corporal says if he had the   management of affairs things would be different because hed keep the   men right up to their work though i dont see how it could well be   done for my part i shouldnt carry a musket over my shoulder when i   was lame and tired just because any man said so it would be as well   whatever fashion i lugged it providing the labor was lessened but   the corporal says it would make all the difference in the world if we   marched the same as we would at a muster    i love you all very much and shall be precious glad to find myself   at home again    from your obedient and dutiful son                                                             isaac rice   in this letter the young recruit who although having enjoyed the teachings of corporal lige was certainly not a soldier at heart has told the main facts in the case regarding the halt of the militia at castleton but it will be observed that his modesty was too great to permit of his mentioning the brave part he played in the rescue of corporal lige from the tories  he has failed however most probably through ignorance in giving colonel arnolds authority for claiming his right to lead the expedition  that officer had brought to cambridge from new haven a company of which he was the captain and upon arriving there at once reported to the massachusetts committee of safety that it would be possible before the forts had been reinforced to seize the works at ticonderoga and crown point with a comparatively small body of men  he proceeded to organize an expedition for such a purpose and to this end was supplied with the money and munitions of war mentioned by isaac together with a colonels commission which gave him the chief command of troops not exceeding four hundred in number which he might raise to accompany him against the lake fortresses  upon arriving at stockbridge in the province of massachusetts he learned that another expedition had set outthat is to say the same one corporal lige and isaac accompaniedand after engaging officers and men to the number of fourteen he hastened onward overtaking the militia as isaac has said  in this camp where military discipline was conspicuous by its absence the recruits who had learned within the hour what had been decided upon the night previous by the council of war soon ascertained the position which the officer from new haven claimed and knew exactly what he proposed to do by virtue of his commission  even though the men had not learned such facts from their officers those recruits who accompanied colonel arnold would have at once made the matter public  at about the time isaac finished the letter to his mother the encampment was in a state bordering on insubordination  colonel arnolds recruits raised in stockbridge insisted that their leader should command the forces not only because he was authorized to do so but owing to the fact that he had the money and ammunition necessary to carry out the plan while the members of colonel allens regiment known as the green mountain boys were equally determined that such honor as might be gained should be their colonels and in a brief space of time these newfledged patriots were ripe for riot  now was come the hour when corporal lige had shown him some portion of that consideration which he believed due his experience in military affairs  those members of colonel eastons militia regiment which had joined the expedition jealous because their leader had given way to colonel allen now demanded loudly and publicly that he must lead the party or they would turn back  inasmuch however as this portion of the troops amounted to fifty or thereabouts they had a small showing when the green mountain boys who were more than two hundred strong came forth in turn with their threats  colonel allen was to be retained first in command as had been decided upon the previous evening or they should march back to bennington without an hours delay  on the other hand the men from stockbridge insisted that colonel arnold was the lawful commander because he was the only one who held a commission for such purpose and threatened that neither money nor munitions of war should be given up unless his claims were fully recognized  on this morning of the eighth of may the men were divided into three divisions according to their opinions and it seemed much as if the officers were willing they should settle it without interference for those highest in command remained in council among themselves giving no heed to the threats which were uttered here and there until it seemed positive personal encounters must soon take the place of words  the men from round about pittsfield recognizing the need of a leader in what might properly be termed a mutiny selected corporal lige as if by common consent and isaac had but just written his mothers name on the missive which had cost him so much labor when he and the corporal were surrounded by the faction to which belonged their neighbors and friends  one of these a butcher whose home was in pittsfield thus addressed the old man using at the beginning of his remark just that compliment best calculated to please him  you who have had so much experience in military affairs corporal lige should be able to settle this matter without any great loss of time for according to my way of thinking it must be arranged among the men themselves or not at all  i have seen plenty of fightin the corporal began slowly as if undecided what words had best be used but it was in the kings army as you well know and there every one in command held their commission from his majesty which plainly said he was to be the leader now it seems in this ere case that the only officer who has any real authority is the one from new haven  a chorus of derisive howls interrupted the old man and not a few of his neighbors accused him of being a traitor because he was apparently on the point of giving his decision in favor of the stranger  waiting patiently until they had exhausted their anger and were silent once more he continued placidly  as i said before it seems to me the only one with any show of authority is the officer from new haven but and corporal lige emphasized this word but what do you know of this ere massachusetts committee of safety accordin to my way of figurin that body of men are lookin out for matters round about boston and weve got with us recruits all the way from pittsfield up to bennington none of whom are given overmuch to heedin what the boston folks think is right or wrong therefore i say that while the officer from new haven seems to have the only real authority it strikes me that his commission does not extend as far as this ere spot where we are encamped  again he was interrupted but this time by cries expressive of satisfaction and good will  we were the ones who started the idea of taking the fort a recruit from pittsfield cried and that being the case i hold weve got the right to say who shall lead us  but the green mountain boys wont go except their colonel is in command another added and a third cried  the men of stockbridge will hold to colonel arnold and wont go on under another  well ive heard all that before corporal lige said in a tone of fine irony if you have come to me to repeat the same story that has been goin round the encampment since daybreak why then you are wastin your time if you want my opinion so that this thing can be put right in short order hold your tongues an ill give it  let corporal lige finish  he is soldier enough to know what should be done  go on corporal go on  this evidence of popularity was most pleasing to the old man and smiling benignantly upon those nearest he said with the air of one who cannot be in the wrong  this is how it must be done let them as come with colonel easton stick to him the green mountain boys shall hang to the tail of colonel allens coat and the stockbridge men may follow colonel arnold that makes three bands of us now mark you lads there are three sides to that ere fortone apiece let us meet here at whatever hour you will and then start on the minute each troop taking a different course an them who arrive first an capture the fortification gets the credit  but we are needing what colonel arnold brought with him someone cried  ay and you would have heard me fix that if youd waited where did this ere massachusetts committee of safety get these munitions of war an this money why they got it out of the province of course and where did we come from why we come from the province of massachusetts of course then who does this money and these munitions of war belong to why they belong to us of course now as near as i have heard there are only fourteen following colonel arnold how long will it take us to lay our hands on all that stuff then i guarantee that colonel eastonfor if he wants me to do it ill help him in conducting the campaignwill march straight through an take ticonderoga before youve had time to say jack robinson never mind what the greenmountain boys do an as for the stockbridge men they aint enough for the countin  the advice which corporal lige had given met with the unqualified approval of all whom he addressed and instantly shouts were raised in his honor until those recruits who were not in the secret looked about them in alarm and dismay as if fearing an attack  isaac was frightened of that there could be no mistake  it seemed to him as if an immediate and unquestionably dangerous encounter could not be prevented for already were the men hanging about corporal lige in a dense body as bees hang about their queen when swarming all urging that he lead them on to wrest from the stockbridge men the property which he had proven did not belong to them  isaac glanced this way and then as if trying to determine in which direction it would be safest to flee but at this moment his eyes fell upon a lad of about his own age who had come in from the highway and was staring about him in perplexity     chapter v  nathan beman   in his fear and trouble it seemed to isaac as if this stranger might render him some valuable assistance  it was as if he stood alone amid the recruits now that corporal lige had been claimed so to speak as leader of the pittsfield faction and the lad needed some one to whom he could appeal for advice  therefore it was that while the newcomer was staring about him as if distracted by the tumult isaac approached in the most friendly manner as he asked  are you a recruit  what do you mean by that  do you belong to the soldiers here  do you call these soldiers the stranger asked almost contemptuously  well if they aint what do you call them  they look to me like a crowd of folks what was goin to have a fight pretty soon  thats jest what im afraid of say do you live near here  no i came from shoreham we heard there was a crowd comin to take fort ticonderoga an seeins how they didnt get along very fast i thought id come an hunt em up do you count yourself a soldier  i did when i left pittsfield but ive kinder got over that feelin now whats your name  nathan beman  mines isaac rice  what made you come out with a crowd like this  all the folks round our way was enlisting and they said it was the duty of everybody to fight against the king besides that the corporal was going an he agreed to put me through in great shape  whos the corporal  thats him over there with the red coat on  do you allow an old chap like him could put anybody through in very great shape  you mustnt talk like that about corporal lige where anybody will hear you why hes a regular soldier fought under general abercrombie in 58 an i reckon if it hadnt been for him the kings troops would have got it terrible bad  an thats about the way they did get it  well corporal lige is here now an itll be different did you ever see the fort  see it why im over there pretty near very week our folks sell eggs an chickens an such truck to the garrison an i know the place jest like i do my own home  do you spose we can take it  there seems to be a sight of you here but i shouldnt want to make a guess till after id seen whether theres going to be a row among all hands or not father says when thieves fall out honest men get their due  however frightened isaac might be he was not disposed to allow any boy of his own size to call the members of this army thieves even though they were in a state of insubordination and forgetting all his fears he demanded sternly  who are you calling thieves  now you neednt get so huffy cause i didnt mean anything nathan replied quietly and yet with no show of alarm but father is always sayin that an i spose it meanswell i dont know what except that all hands of you are fightin here an it looks like as if captain delaplace would get the best of it  whos he  the commandant of the fort of course  well see here nathan it begins to look as though there was goin to be a row for a fact and i hoped you lived close by so i could go to your house till it was over  but youre a soldier aint you  not much of one  well if youve enlisted a fight is right where you belong and nathan appeared to think this settled the matter beyond any argument  i aint so certain of that but even if i do belong in a fight i shant stay in one it seems like as if corporal lige had turned me off an all hes thinking about is helping our crowd get the best of the stockbridgers  well there aint anything very dangerous here yet awhile suppose we wait an see how things turn i dont care overmuch for fightin myself but thats no reason why i shouldnt want to know whether theres likely to be a row or not  isaac admired the courage of his new acquaintance and immediately adopted him as a protector taking up his position a pace or two in the rear of nathan as he watched the threatening movements  the recruits from pittsfield and vicinity were standing in close order with the corporal at their head evidently ready for whatever turn might come in affairs  some of them retained their weapons but the majority appeared to have more confidence in their fists and with arms bared to the elbow were awaiting the word which would precipitate them upon the small body from stockbridge who guarded the treasure  this last detachment had either learned of the advice given by corporal lige or scented danger because they were so few in numbers as compared with the other two factions and were standing shoulder to shoulder ready to resist an expected attack  a short distance away the greenmountain boys remained strictly by themselves but not giving any sign of taking part in the lawless proceedings so long as ethan allen was considered the head of the expedition they were satisfied to stand aloof from any brawl  as has been said before the leading officers were nowhere to be seen some of the better informed declared they were in the shelter near by which had been used as their quarters during the night and with colonel arnold were discussing the question of superiority in rank  corporal lige hesitated to give the word which should precipitate the riot  he had been elevated to the position of leader and perhaps the responsibility weighed heavily upon him for certain it is that after advising what should be done he evinced a disposition to retire from what might be the scene of a conflict  look here old man were ready to do as you have said now give the word and lead us on to those recruits well soon find out what theyre made of one of the men said as the corporal turned toward the rear much as though intending to join isaac and nathan  yes give the word this is your plan and were ready to carry it out as you have said  fair an easy fair an easy comrades corporal lige said soothingly a good general doesnt depend wholly on his plan until hes made certain of the enemys position you dont allow that we can rush in hilterskilter an hope to work our purpose eh  why not there are only a dozen of them to near fifty of us  but look at colonel allens regiment  well what of them they are not in this quarrel for their commander is leader of the expedition so far  no they are not in it the corporal said but what assurance have we they wont take a hand as soon as we begin operations dont you allow they know what the stockbridge men brought with them  why everybody in camp knows that  then do you suppose theyre goin to stand by idly while we take the money and munitions  the men began to murmur among themselves and corporal lige appeared well satisfied that they should thus consume the time but before many minutes had passed one and another spoke derisively of the old man asking what his plan was good for if he didnt dare carry it out or why he had not made mention of what colonel allens men might do in event of his suggestion being acted upon  at first the corporal was not minded to take heed of these disparaging remarks but as the clamor increased he was forced to defend himself and made answer sharply  the plan was good and the only one likely to succeed when i got that far with it you jumped to the idea that it should be worked out at once now all the while i was keeping my eye fixed on colonel allens men tryin to make up my mind what theyd do when we struck the first blow and i havent decided yet  youre a coward you claimed to be an old soldier and to know more of warfare than any one in this encampment not excepting the commanders but yet you dont dare lead fifty men against a dozen  if i dont dare it isnt because im afraid of bodily injury but i cant afford to stake my reputation as a soldier where the chances are likely to be so heavy against us its one thing to have a good plan an just as important to know when to carry it out if we hang together an are ready to take advantage of the first opportunity that comes then well be showing our strength but not by rushing in hilterskilter like a crowd of boys primed for a roughantumble fight  corporal liges argument was evidently considered a good one for at once the outcries which had been raised against him died away the men yet remaining in position as if ready to act upon any suggestion he might make  i dont reckon theres goin to be much trouble round here after all nathan said in a tone of disappointment and isaac gave vent to a sigh of relief it strikes me that old man crawled out of a pretty small hole  do you mean to say he wouldnt dare do what the men wanted  well he would be a pretty poor stick if he didnt theres four of this crowd to one of that what i allow is hes afraid of the officers and if this is any kind of a military company hes got good cause to be accordin to the way things run up to the fort there you wouldnt hear privates tellin who should command em an who shouldnt else theyd find themselves in trouble  at this moment a great shout went up from the greenmountain boys and as the two factions who had stood facing each other ready for the encounter glanced around quickly they saw colonel ethan allen approaching  then the stockbridge men set up a shout for colonel arnold stepped to allens side as if of equal rank and the pittsfield detachment remained silent because colonel easton was walking in the rear of these two officers  it looks as if our colonel had given in an wasnt countin on standin up for his own rights corporal lige said mournfully let one of you run over there an tell him what were ready to do say well begin the scrimmage as soon as he gives the word  this order was obeyed and the little troop watched the messenger as he approached the colonel and without so much as touching his cap by way of salute spoke earnestly during a few seconds  then colonel easton was seen to shake his head decidedly and the man returned to his fellows looking thoroughly ashamed  whats the matter corporal lige asked sharply  he says if we had any idea of our duties as soldiers we should be less ready to advise and more eager to obey  theres a good deal of sense in that the corporal said thoughtfully but at the same time i claim matters are in such shape that were justified in making the proposition when a body of men have got a commander what wont stand up for himself its time the rank and file took the matter in hand  is that what you call good soldiering nathan beman asked shrilly and isaac clutched his new friend by the arm frantically for it alarmed him that any one should dare ask such a bold question of the corporal  the old man turned around angrily opened his mouth as if to speak and then repenting of his purpose faced the oncoming officers once more much as if to say that such a question from such a questioner was not worthy of regard  the group of officers advanced until they were standing at equal distances from each of the three factions and colonel allen said speaking slowly and distinctly looking at the forces from stockbridge and pittsfield  it is no secret that you men are disgruntled because i have been chosen commander of the expedition you are enlisted as militia from the province of massachusetts and as enroled men have no voice in choosing a commander therefore i propose to make no explanation of the matter but have taken this opportunity to address you in order to say that by the advice and with the consent of the others in command those of you who cannot obey such orders as may be given regardless of who is the leader had best return home from this point it shall not be counted against you as deserters for the names of those who are unwilling to serve cheerfully will be stricken quietly from the rolls without any mention whatever dishonorable or otherwise colonel arnold presents himself with due authority from the province of massachusetts to take command of any troops not exceeding four hundred which may be raised for the purpose of attacking fort ticonderoga under all the circumstances he has decided to wave his claim of rank and act as volunteer until the purpose for which we have advanced be accomplished now then those of you who cannot obey my orders step to the right  the greenmountain boys began to raise shouts of approval but their colonel checked them by saying sternly  silence in the ranks let no man dare give voice to his approval or disapproval of what may occur in this encampment  it was as if colonel easton believed some of his men might take advantage of the opportunity and stepping quickly to the side of allen he said  lads when the question came up last night as to who should lead this expedition i cast the first vote for colonel allen he is a soldier of much experience and great ability it is my earnest desire that he take upon himself the responsibility of directing our movements and whatsoever he orders shall be performed by me faithfully and promptly  colonel arnold made no attempt to address his men and the three officers stood in silence several moments after which allen said  because none of you have signified your desire to be relieved from the enlistment we will suppose all are willing to go forward and from now out there can be no excuse for insubordination or hesitation  this said the officers withdrew once more and now that their colonel was no longer there to check them the green mountain boys set up a shout of triumph which was answered by derisive yells from corporal liges troop and apparent indifference by the men from stockbridge  i reckon i may as well go home now nathan said in a low tone to isaac there dont seem to be any chance of a row because the men are going to give in easy enough but id like to see em find their way into the fort it aint so easy as theyre countin on  who is this boy isaac corporal lige asked as he stepped toward the lads apparently glad of an opportunity to disengage himself from those who had shown they were ready to obey his commands  isaac gave such explanation as was within his power and the old man asked addressing nathan  what do you know about fort ticonderoga  the boy made reply much as he had to isaac and the corporal questioned him sharply  have you been allowed to roam over the fortification at will  there was no reason why i shouldnt i know all the boys who live in the fort an after i finished what i went for whod stop us from goin round  how many soldiers are there in the place  somewhere about fifty i should think  women and children  yes most twice as many i reckon though i never counted em  and you say you know all the ins and outs of the fort  look here how many times do you want me to tell you of course i do but whats that got to do with you  nathan spoke in such a disrespectful tone that isaac literally trembled lest the corporal should fall upon him in his wrath  wait you here till i come back an see to it that you dont move from this spot  the corporal gave this command in his sternest tones and without waiting for a reply hastened off in the direction where the officers had disappeared while nathan stood looking at his new acquaintance in mingled surprise and bewilderment  now what does that old man mean when he tells me to wait here what rights he got to order me round  dont get disgruntled isaac said imploringly i tell you hes a great soldier and youll see that his order means something cause the corporal dont make foolish talk  then what was it i heard when i come up here an he was tellin the men what to do but backed down after findin they were ready to follow him  that part of it was all right the time hadnt come for him to carry out his plans and he explained it couldnt you hear him  i heard what he said but that didnt deceive me  then isaac explained with many a detail why the old man was the ablest soldier in the encampment and while he was trying to convince the skeptical nathan corporal lige returned looking very important and mysterious  youre to come with me he said tapping nathan on the shoulder  where the boy asked sharply  i said you were to come with me  well you may say it again before i go i want to know what youre thinkin of doin i aint one of these makebelieve soldiers that can be ordered round by such as you  during an instant the corporal glowered at the boy as if of a mind to chastise him for his too familiar words and then isaac interposed to save his newfound friend from what he feared would be most severe punishment  hell go with you corporal lige dont be angry with him you see hes a stranger here an doesnt understand what  i understand enough not to go till i know what hes about nathan cried angrily wrenching himself free from isaacs detaining grasp and leaping back a few paces  the corporal clapped his hand to his side as if to raise a sword and then realizing that he had no such weapon said in a remarkably conciliatory tone  i told colonel allen that you were well acquainted with the interior of the fort and he would speak with you a few moments  well if youd said that in the first place i would have been willing but when you jumped down on me as if i was one of these recruits i wasnt goin to stand it  if you are willin to come follow me  am i to go with you isaac asked pleadingly and the corporal hesitated an instant before replying  yes lad i dont reckon itll do any harm and it may give you an insight into the way we manage military affairs     chapter vi  a squad of four   isaac was in high glee at thus being permitted to visit headquarters for even though he went there only by permission of corporal lige and not because his presence was desired it seemed to him that it was in a certain degree a recognition of the possible fact that he was really a soldier  nathan beman however did not appear to think there was any compliment in the invitation naturally of a suspicious nature he fancied in some way this visit might work to his harm and in addition he was displeased by the air of superiority which was observable in the corporal when he addressed any remark to the lad  the old soldier walked several paces in advance of the boys and did not appear to think it necessary he should look around to see if they were following for in his mind a request to visit headquarters was the same as an imperative command and one which no sane person would venture to disobey  i suppose he thinks he can tow me round wherever he likes and ive got a mind to show him he cant nathan said to isaac motioning with his thumb toward the corporal  its colonel allen who wants to see you isaac ventured to suggest timidly  how do you know  why corporal lige said so  i aint certain that makes it true cause hes said a good many things that dont amount to much since ive been around this place  but the corporal wouldnt lie isaac said solemnly and nathan added with a peculiar smile  oh no he wouldnt lie  see here what have you got against the corporal  me why should i have anything against him  thats what puzzles me but it seems as though you didnt think very much of him  neither do i ive seen soldiers up round ticonderoga not makebelieves like the old man who is all talk an no substance  isaacs face flushed he was not disposed to let this stranger make sport of corporal lige whom he knew was thoroughly versed in the art of warfare and a brave man withal but before he had decided in his own mind how the most telling reproof could be administered they arrived at headquarters which was neither more nor less than a shelter built of pine boughs situate so far from the main encampment as to afford some degree of seclusion  isaac judged from the eager look on the faces of the officers that this visit was considered by them of more importance than it was by nathan and instantly corporal lige saluted colonel allen asked  are both the lads acquainted with the fort  no colonel here is the one who lives up shoreham way and he touched nathan on the shoulder this he added motioning toward isaac is a recruit i have taken under my protection  it was evident that colonel allen came nearer nathans standard of a soldier than corporal lige for he stood in a respectful attitude before the officer as if recognizing the latters right to question him  is your father alive the colonel asked  yes sir he owns a farm up on the lake  how often have you visited the fort within the past year  mostly twice a week sir never less than once  then you are sufficiently well acquainted with the troops to be able to gain admission at any time  yes sir father sells a lot of truck there an i mostly carry it over  are you known to captain delaplace  yes sir and his wife as well  what brought you here lad  we heard it said there was a lot of soldiers marchin up this way and i didnt have much of anything to do so come down to have a look at em  is it generally known near about where you live that troops are marching toward the fort  i dont think so sir simon york a trapper told father and it was agreed between them that nothing should be spoken about it lest the news get out  do you know how many soldiers there are in the fort now  near about fifty sir  hark you lad are you minded to do a service for those who would strike a blow against the king  i suppose that would depend on what it was an how much id make out of it nathan replied cautiously  then you are not of the mind to do anything toward establishing the independence of the coloniesit is simply a question of shillings and pence  well sir perhaps it is something like that nathan replied growing confused father thinks since the news came from concord and lexington that all the provincials ought to turn to and show their mettle but mother says so long as the kings troops buy truck and pay good prices for it it is our business to see that we dont take the bread and butter out of our own mouths  i understand yours is what might be called a divided household and colonel allen looked around with a smile at his companions  i guess i dont know what you mean by that sir but things our way are about as i have told you  corporal lige glowered at the boy who thus unblushingly announced that he measured his patriotism by its value in money and isaac wondered that a lad so young could talk thus pertly to one as high in authority as was colonel ethan allen  if you should be paid six shillings would you be willing to guide one of these gentlemen into the fort and come back with him to where our troops might then be stationed  which one wants to go nathan asked not intending to commit himself until the full details were given  this gentleman and colonel allen pointed toward master phelps one of the committee from the connecticut assembly  nathan looked at him critically a moment and then asked as if suspicious some portion of the plan was being kept secret from him  does he want to see captain delaplace  he simply wishes to view the fort and it would be necessary you should pretend he was a neighbor who had come with no other motive than that of curiosity  you couldnt pass him off for any neighbor of ourn  why not  cause hes dressed too fine an his face is so pale that anybodyd know he didnt live round here  all that may be readily changed master phelps interrupted ill promise to look so nearly like one of your neighbors that there shall be no question raised  when do i get the six shillings nathan asked  after you have performed the work faithfully to the extent of bringing master phelps back to me colonel allen replied now speaking quite sharply it would be a serious matter indeed if you were to betray him to the commandant of the fort or indicate that this body of men are near at hand  if i take the six shillings ill earn em its none of my business where you folks are nor whats goin on round the fort all im looking after is the cash i can make  will you undertake the task  yes nathan replied and then as if a sudden thought had come to him added  i will if this boy goes along too  is he a friend of yours  i dont spose so cause i never saw him before but its goin to be mighty pokey all alone with a man like him and nathan pointed to master phelps  at this point corporal lige stepped forward and saluted thus attracting the colonels attention after which he motioned toward the outside as if to ask for a private interview  the colonel immediately left the hut followed by the corporal and nathan looked after them suspiciously whispering to isaac  now what do you spose that old imitation soldier is up to he mustnt try to get the best of me  you neednt be afraid corporal lige will do anything thats wrong cause hes an honest man an no imitation of a soldier but a true one  i aint so certain about all that but you seem to have a pretty good idea of him so perhaps he is halfway decent after all  at his point the old soldier and the colonel returned the latter saying when he was inside the hut once more  in order that you may have no lack of company i propose that master phelps corporal watkins and the lad all go with you  whos watkins nathan whispered to isaac  why thats corporal lige of course  i knew he was stickin his nose into it some way  youll be glad to have him cause hes jest as good as he can be after you get acquainted  nathan remained silent a few seconds and then asked abruptly  when does the crowd want to go  at once it should be possible to visit the fort before sunset  well thats accordin to how fast they can walk but if they start an dont get there in time fatherll keep them overnight without chargin moren whats right for the lodgings  very well you may make ready to set out immediately and when you have returned the money shall be paid you  im ready now  master phelps will need a few moments in which to prepare himself for the journey and i doubt not but that the corporal and his comrade have some belongings which they will want to take with them remain you here lad until the others have made all necessary preparations and are in condition for the journey  this was a command which nathan could not well disobey but he looked toward isaac while the latter was hurried away by corporal lige as if there were yet other questions concerning this project which he would like to ask  dont turn back lad the old soldier said when his protégé made a move as if to return theres to be no time lost and youll have good opportunity for talking once were on the road  how did it happen the colonel sent you and me isaac asked when the two were so far from headquarters that his words could not be overheard  thats owing to the hint i gave colonel allen when that young skinflint made his talk a lad who wont take sides in this matter twixt the colonies and the king but holds out for whatever money he can get is not to be trusted accordin to my way of thinkin while he was settin himself down for a coldblooded closefisted specimen of humanity such as you wouldnt look for in one so young i made up my mind that there had best be a sharp watch kept of him else a word or two might be dropped at the fort which would upset all our plans  do you believe he would take colonel allens money and then betray him  i am certain a lad who would haggle for six shillings under such circumstances as this would sell out to the next man who offered half as much more and the colonel was of the same mind after id mentioned the matter  i dont see why i should go  dont you want to the corporal asked in surprise  of course it would be more pleasant than marching with the troops but still i cant understand what good it is possible for me to do  i dont reckon you will be of any service but the boy had taken a notion to have you with him so it seemed like a good chance for me to put my oar in and between the two of us i reckon he wont have much show of playing double  in a very few seconds the corporal and isaac had made their preparations for the journey which simply consisted in gathering up all their belongings much to the surprise of the lad who questioned whether if they were to go to the fort apparently from motives of curiosity it was well they carried muskets  if it seems necessary we can leave them where this boy lives but it is certain we cannot depend on any one else bringing our luggage along for us so take what we own lad an then be at home wherever we stop  when the two returned to headquarters they found master phelps awaiting their coming and nathan kept close and suspicious watch upon each person and everything within his range of vision  the messenger from the general assembly had made a very decided change in his personal appearance and isaac was forced to look twice before feeling positive this was the same master phelps whom he had seen a few moments before  now he was clad after the fashion of a farmer in garments which he had probably borrowed from some member of the troop his face was browned and soiled while his hands were exceedingly dirty and even nathan must have been satisfied that the commandant of the fort would not see in this visitor other than he professed to be  if that lad had a trifle more sense hed understand there wasnt anything to be gained by deceiving him the corporal said in a low tone to isaac but hes so selfopinionated he thinks everybody is plotting mischief against him  you dont seem to like him very well isaac ventured to say and corporal lige replied emphatically  neither do i  then unless he an i go off by ourselves i dont reckon this will be a very pleasant journey isaac said to himself as he thought of the corporal and nathan each distrusting and making complaint against the other  colonel allen was determined there should be no delay in the setting out of this spying expedition and immediately the corporal and isaac showed themselves he insisted that the little party start without further loss of time  young beman at once showed his preference as to a traveling companion for he ranged himself by isaacs side and when the corporal would have joined them said curtly  youd better keep back with the other man i spose ill have to lead the way and when we strike off the main road the path aint wide enough for more than two  dont the highway lead to shoreham the corporal asked suspiciously  yes but we can save moren four miles by cuttin through the woods and nathan hurried isaac on as a means both of putting an end to the corporals inquiries and forcing him to join master phelps  once the journey was well begun young beman presented himself in a more favorable light  he ceased to refer to the corporal as an imitation soldier and gave no further evidence of being suspicious but questioned isaac as to what the town of pittsfield was like and concerning boston where young rice had visited two years previous in company with his father  master phelps was not accustomed to this method of traveling and when the guide struck into the woods where the trail lead alternately over a hilly and swampy country he was soon forced to declare that he could not proceed at such a rapid pace  you will have to slacken up a bit corporal lige shouted for the gentleman aint used to this kind of footin  we cant go very slow else we shant get to the fort before sunset nathan replied indifferently and master phelps said in a tone which admitted of no argument  it isnt possible for me to keep pace with you if it so be we fail to finish the journey before dark we can take lodgings with your father and accomplish our purpose early tomorrow morning  the prospect of introducing to his father guests who would pay for all they received was so satisfactory to young beman that he made no protest at being thus forced to slacken pace it may be he was unnecessarily slow from this time out for it was already dark when they arrived at the guides home and nathan said to master phelps before entering the building  ill tell father you folks want to stay all night and thats as much as i need say if you count on explaining why you have come its none of my business the officer what hired me said i was to keep quiet about everything id seen down to the camp so i might as well begin by holding my tongue  then nathan ushered the guests into the kitchen where was found mr beman sitting by the fireplace for the night had grown cold and chill while his wife was preparing the supper  here are some travelers who want to stay all night nathan announced and added in a lower tone to isaac come out to the barn with me while i do my chores theres no fun in sittin here  five minutes later the three men followed the boys and isaac fancied it was master phelps intention to explain to the farmer the purpose of their coming but that he feared to do so in the presence of the mistress of the household who if her son had quoted her words correctly favored the kings representatives rather than the colonists in the doings which had lately arisen  nathan took good care that his new friend should perform a full share of the evenings work and isaac assisted in milking the cows carrying water and chopping wood until he had of a surety earned as bountiful a spread as could be set before him  the farmer and his guests did not appear until they had been summoned twice after the appetizing meal was placed upon the table and while she was impatiently awaiting them mrs beman questioned her son sharply as to what business his father could have with the strangers  for a time nathan avoided making any direct answer but when his mother pressed him closely he answered her quite as pertly as he had colonel allen by saying  im to be paid for holdin my tongue about whatever is goin onill have six shillings by this time tomorrow night an i cant afford to talk to anybody  six shillings just for holding your tongue nathan  well its for that an a little more but i aint goin to make any talk so if you want me to earn the money youd better stop askin questions  is your father going to get as much  i dont know anything about his trades its all i can do to take care of my own an work em through accordin to the agreement when theres so much questionin goin on nathan replied quite sharply and his mother who was evidently as prudent as himself in financial matters desisted from pressing him further  after this brief conversation isaac felt positive corporal lige need have no fear regarding possible treachery on nathans part for if the boy refused to tell his mother he surely would be closemouthed in the presence of others  when the party finally made their appearance and were seated at the supper table the three men evidently on the best of terms with each other mrs bemans curiosity was still further aroused as was but natural yet no word was dropped during the progress of the meal nor so long as the guests remained downstairs which could have given her the slightest clew  it was nathans purpose to have isaac for a bedfellow but to this his mother made emphatic protest and when the time for retiring came the three guests were conducted to a room adjoining the kitchen while the farmers family retired to the loft above  then it was in cautious whispers that isaac told the corporal why he felt confident there was no danger nathan would betray them and the old soldier said grimly  he didnt have a fair test when he was talking with his mother cause there was no chance she would pay him for the information what im afeared of is that some one may offer him more than colonel allen did an then ill go bail everything he knows will come out in short order  i dont believe he would do other than he has agreed  well lad you hold to that opinion an ill have my own an twixt the two of us i reckon he wont be able to do any mischief his father is a proper kind of man holds to it that the colonists are right in making war against the king and stands ready to do all he can in furtherance of the cause therefore if this young jackanapes holds himself too high an mighty in the mornin we shant be wholly in his power  when day dawned however corporal lige had no reason to complain of nathan  the lad showed himself of the mind to earn the six shillings and now that he was at home appeared less suspicious of his companions intentions  perhaps this was due in part to the fact that his father well knowing what the visitors would have took it upon himself to give the guide positive instructions and at an early hour nathan set out accompanied by master phelps  it was his intention that isaac should be one of the party but to this the farmer made decided objections insisting that more than one stranger might cause suspicion and therefore it was that corporal lige and his pupil remained quietly at the farm until noon of that day when the delegate from the connecticut assembly returned well pleased with what he had seen  in a private conversation held with the corporal he reported that strong though the fortification was the walls were in a state of great dilapidation few if any precautions taken against surprise military discipline was hardly known and the sentinels in particular were remiss in their duty  master phelps had no difficulty in making such investigations as he chose and declared that in his opinion providing the garrison could be taken by surprise there was nothing to prevent a capture of the fort  however in order that all this might be effected boats were necessary and there was not a sufficient number on the shores near about to convey onetenth of the men in colonel allens command  it is well you have come with me master phelps said to the corporal for while i am returning you and the lad accompanied by the farmer shall set about seizing all the boats which may be found in this vicinity having due heed to your movements however lest you proceed so far in the direction of crown point as to arouse suspicions in that quarter work as expeditiously as is in your power for the troops will arrive here not later than midnight and it is absolutely necessary there be ready proper craft to convey them across the lake  then master phelps still holding to nathan as a guide set off to meet the force which was believed to be rapidly approaching and the farmer said impatiently to the corporal  if it so be sir you count on carrying out the orders given twixt now and dark it is time for us to be moving for boats are not plentiful hereabout and we shall have a long tramp before gathering as many as will carry your force across     chapter vii  ticonderoga   it was not necessary farmer beman should urge corporal lige to make haste in this matter which had been intrusted to him for the old soldier understood full well how necessary it was that means of transportation for the troops should be at hand when the men arrived and had good reason to believe that such task as was assigned him could not be readily performed  he even showed himself more eager in the work than the farmer for when the latter would have delayed in order to eat the noonday meal the old man positively refused as he said  we can have dinner after ticonderoga has been taken but until then there must be no thought of rest although as i understand detachments are to be sent to skenesborough and panton it is not positive they can get boats from there to this point in time and we must act as if believing the matter of transportation depended wholly upon ourselves  had nathan been there to witness the old mans activity after some special work had been set for him he might have changed his opinion about the corporals being an imitation soldier  he walked here and there tiring his companions almost to the verge of exhaustion and yet apparently as fresh as when he began but when the sun set he had only seventeen boats drawn up on the shore at that point where it was supposed the troops would halt and isaac believed there were absolutely no more within the radius of a dozen miles  i allow youve done your best corporal farmer beman said as the three stood looking ruefully at the small number of boats many of which would be loaded to the waters edge with half a dozen men and it now stands us in hand to get supper considerin we missed our dinner so completely  there must be no time wasted let isaac run up to the house for such provisions as your wife can spare and well set out in some other direction for every craft that we add to this ere lot is jest so much gained  you may set out in as many directions as you choose but you will not find another boat this night farmer beman said decidedly and with what was very like a show of illtemper ive guided you to every place i know of and if you are so headstrong as to keep on when theres little show of accomplishing anything you must go alone  and thats exactly what i shall do the corporal said emphatically even though i knew nothing would be accomplished i should keep on workin until the force arrived cause it isnt for me to set down and say my task is finished  if thats your idea of soldierin then im mighty glad i havent enlisted and the farmer went deliberately to his home convinced as was his son that the old corporal was not as well skilled in warfare as he would have it appear  even isaac was disposed to protest against his teachers decision and urged that it was little less than folly to think of adding to the fleet for farmer beman had declared positively there were no more boats in the vicinity  to this the corporal replied with some warmth and there might have been a serious undermining of friendship had not nathan arrived just at that moment  well is that all youve done this afternoon he asked sharply and the corporal turned on him fiercely  do you know of other boats  seems to me theres moren a hundred round here  where are they  nathan began a list mentioning this neighbor or that and as often seeing among the collection the craft to which he referred until finally he was forced to admit that to the best of his knowledge there were no more  i thought you knew of more than a hundred corporal lige cried fiercely  thats what i reckoned myself but when i come to figger em up they wasnt there  you come with us an it may be well find another  what after ive walked down to castleton an back today i go with you out rowin itll take moren six shillings to hire me to do anything like that this night besides you havent got time before the troops get here  how near are they corporal lige asked in alarm  well they oughter be showin up by this time for i wasnt five minutes ahead of em andthere they are now  nathan pointed to a group of men who had just come into the clearing from amid the thicket and as the old man looked up one of the party motioned for him to approach  although nathan had announced that he was nearly exhausted from his ardent labors his weariness was not so great as his curiosity and he followed the corporal and isaac  it was colonel arnold colonel easton and the two representatives of the connecticut assembly who had thus come into view and the former after explaining to corporal lige that the troops had been halted in the thicket lest they might be seen from the fort even in the gloom asked concerning the means of transportation  chagrined though he was at his inability to do more the corporal was forced to admit that he had hardly a sufficient number of boats to take over seventyfive or eighty of the men but this the colonel did not at the time believe to be of great importance for it seemed positive captain herrick from skenesborough and captain douglas from panton must before midnight send craft enough to transfer the entire force  therefore it was that the leaders of the party appeared well satisfied and the corporal must have come to the conclusion that he had fretted himself without reasonable cause  you will remain in charge of the fleet colonel allen said to the old soldier with the boy to act as your lieutenant and you may detail two men as oarsmen in each boat we will set out as soon as the remainder of the craft arrives  then it was that nathan believed he saw an opportunity to add to his earnings of the day and made the proposition that if the further sum of four shillings be paid him he would aid in ferrying the troops across providing the work could be finished before midnight but if it should be delayed until morning he desired to be paid twice that amount  no one seemed disposed to take advantage of this very generous offer now that his particular portion of the work had been done it was very much as if every one save isaac ignored him  thats jest the way with these people from down round bennington they get all they can for the least money an then throw you off i ought to have held out for moren six shillings when i took that master phelps as you call him over to the fort  but you got paid very well isaac suggested  yes so far as it went but if id thought of all thats going on i would have put up my price or held out halfhired till the business was over  now for the first time since their meeting did corporal liges pupil speak sharply to this friend  you should be ashamed to demand money for such work as you have done this day he said stoutly whatever resistance be made to the king is for the benefit of all the colonies and if each one insisted on being paid as youve done his majesty might work his will for there would be none to say him nay  young beman was both surprised and injured by this outburst  thats what i call pretty tough after all ive done for you he cried sharply if it hadnt been for me you wouldnt have got over here and had a chance of staying all night in our house  i didnt have a chance without paying for it as i understand master phelps is to settle with your father for our accommodations  yes an just before i come away mother told me she thought as likely as not fatherd be such a fool as to refuse to take a cent but i aint goin to quarrel with you even if i have been defrauded of what is my right come up to the house an get some supper wont you  you mean that i shall partake of the food after i have helped you do the chores  well yes something like that of course you dont expect to get your supper for nothing  no id rather go without than do more work now after tramping around all the afternoon therell be something in the way of rations found in camp an ill take my chances there  young beman turned away quickly as if angry with this new friend and observing the movement corporal lige asked isaac  whats the trouble with yon skinflint havent been quarrelin eh  i think i have seen enough of a lad who must be paid for all he does at such a time and having said this isaac went in search of his supper not minded to make further explanations  weary though he was the lad was soon forced to aid the corporal in getting the boats crews together and after it was fully dark those selected to act as oarsmen were marched to the waters edge that they might be in readiness when their services were required  after this there was nothing to be done save await the coming of the expected craft  the men were not allowed to build fires lest the lights should be seen by those in the fort and so cautious was the leader that even loud talking was forbidden therefore the men could do little else than spend the time in sleeping a fact by no means disagreeable to the majority after their march of the day  on the shore of the lake the oarsmen followed the example of their comrades in the woods until all save the corporal and isaac were wrapped in the unconsciousness of slumber  the old soldier considering himself responsible for the safety of the fleet would neither lie down nor allow his young lieutenant to do so and they paced to and fro on the sand keeping sharp lookout for the expected boats but without avail  midnight came and yet no word from either of the two detachments which had been sent in search of means of transportation  colonel allen and colonel arnold growing impatient because of the long delay came to the shore and corporal lige stood stiff as the barrel of his own musket when he saluted  how many can be taken in the boats you have here colonel arnold asked  somewhere about eighty sir and if it so be you give the word we can ferry the whole party across in three trips  that would never do colonel arnold replied decidedly we must go in a body or give up all hope of surprising the garrison  in this colonel allen was agreed and the two officers remained near at hand now pacing to and fro and again listening intently for those sounds which would tell of the hopedfor arrival until it lacked no more than two hours of daybreak when they were joined by master phelps and colonel easton the latter saying sufficiently loud for isaac to distinguish the words  unless such a move is made as may be possible with the means at our disposal the plan of capturing the fort has come to naught for it isnt reasonable to suppose our party can remain in this vicinity throughout tomorrow without some intimation being given the commandant by those who live in the vicinity  what was evidently a conversation between the officers followed but it was conducted in so low a tone that isaac could not hear the words and he remained near at hand expecting to receive the order to launch the boats until colonel easton called him by name  you know where is situated the home of the lad who guided master phelps into the fort  oh yes sir it is but a short distance from here  go you there and bring the boy  i question if he will come sir unless i make explanation of why he is wanted or promise that he shall be paid for thus disturbing himself he seems to have no thought save of money  yet his father is with us in this matter i am told so far as opinion goes  yes sir  then go and rouse the lad if he refuses to come say to the father that colonel allen requires the services of the boy and if he answers not what we make as a request i will send a detachment to enforce a demand  isaac obeyed promptly not finding it a simple matter to make his way across the field in the darkness but finally succeeding after one or two tumbles each of which left their marks in the shape of a scratch or contusion and with the first knock at the door he heard farmer bemans voice asking as to who was there  it is isaac rice sir and colonel easton has sent me to say that colonel allen desires the attendance of nathan at once  what does he want him for the shrill voice of mrs beman cried and isaac replied truthfully that he did not know since no explanation had been made him  then could be heard the farmer his wife and son in what was evidently an altercation until no less than five minutes had passed at the end of which time young nathan appeared in the doorway fully clad as he asked impatiently  how much are they willing to give me for coming out in the night like this  i think it would be well if you depended upon their generosity otherwise it is in colonel allens power to force you to do as he asks isaac replied curtly and from the inside farmer beman shouted  get you gone boy and do their bidding if i again hear you demanding money for such services your jacket shall be tanned with the stoutest hickory switch i can get hereabouts  one would have said young beman was the most abused lad in the province of new york as he followed isaac down to the shore alternately bewailing his illfortune because he had not given captain delaplace information of the coming of such a body of men trusting to that officers generosity for a greater sum of money than was given him by colonel allen and vehemently protesting he would not stir one step from the encampment without being well paid for his services colonel easton overhearing this threat stepped directly in front of the grumbling lad and called for corporal lige much to the surprise of both the boys saying when the old soldier arrived  corporal it is colonel allens wish that this lad remain near him after we have landed on the other side to show the way into the fort he is not disposed to do so willingly it seems and it shall be your duty to see that the order be obeyed if he attempts to escape shoot him down but give him gentle treatment so long as he complies with your requests  ill take care of him sir that you may depend on the corporal said grimly and from that instant nathan beman remained silent regarding his desire to be paid for acting the part of guide  because of having received this order the corporal was forced to relinquish his position as commodore of the fleet and thus it was that he and his pupil were among the few who entered ticonderoga early that morning  within five minutes after nathan had apparently been subdued word was passed for as many of the green mountain boys as could be conveyed in the boats to embark at once and almost at the same moment colonel easton turning to the old man said  it is your duty corporal lige to take passage in the same craft that carries our leader for the lad of whom you have charge must be kept where colonel allen can speak to him at an instants notice  had the men been allowed to follow their inclinations the frail boats which formed the fleet would have been swamped even before they pushed off from the shore for every member of the troop was eager to be with the first division and it was only after considerable difficulty in the way of restraining the men that the different craft were properly and safely loaded  when the corporal and the lad who was thus virtually held prisoner entered the boat where was colonel allen isaac followed as if it was his right so to do  he could not fancy any position of affairs where he would be debarred from remaining with the man who had taken him under his wing and it so chanced that in the excitement of embarking he passed aboard unheeded by who might have checked him  the darkness of night was just giving way to the gray light of dawn when the little fleet put off from the shore and without being really aware he did so isaac counted the number of those who were thus afloat  beside the officers there were eightythree including himself and nathan and it was no longer reasonable to expect that those who had been sent to skenesborough and panton would arrive in time to be of assistance  will they try to take the fort with so few he asked in a whisper of corporal lige and the latter added emphatically  if all that is told of colonel allen be true he wouldnt hesitate to make an attempt singlehanded  but surely we cannot hope to do much for fifty men behind a fort should be a much larger force than ours  savin and exceptin these men be surprised as our leader counts them in fort ticonderoga will be the corporal replied and then placed his finger on his lips that the lad should cease talking for the order had been passed from boat to boat just before the fleet left the shore that no conversation be indulged in  nathan sulky because of having been put in charge of the man whom he disliked gave no apparent attention to anything  in almost perfect silence the journey by water was made and brought to an end just as the day was breaking when in obedience to signals rather than words the men disembarked and were formed in three ranks close to the waters edge  then it was that colonel allen advanced to where the men might hear when he spoke in the tone of ordinary conversation and said with a calmness which in itself was impressive  there are but few of us here to undertake the work which was cut out but yet each of you should be a match for any two whom we may meet should we delay until all the force can be ferried across there will be no longer opportunity to surprise the garrison therefore we must act for our comrades as well as ourselves remembering that should we falter we cast shame on them also now lads it is my purpose to march into the fort and i only ask that you follow where i lead  the officers stepped forward quickly to make certain there should be no cheering and wheeling about with true military precision colonel allen started forward colonel arnold by his side and corporal lige with nathan and isaac directly in the rear  behind them came eighty of the green mountain boys  there was no command given  each of the men copied the movements of the leader and noiselessly but rapidly they made their way up the heights toward the sallyport isaacs face paling as he went for he believed of a surety now was come the time when he should hear the clash of arms and find himself in the midst of combatants each striving to take the others life  on passing an angle at the rear of the fortification the entrance of a trench or covertway was come upon and here they surprised a sentinel half asleep leaning against the earthwork  awakened thus suddenly and seeing what he might naturally suppose to be the advance guard of a large force directly upon him he took hasty aim at colonel allen and pulled the trigger  involuntarily isaac closed his eyes believing their leader must be killed at such short range but the weapon hung fire and the sentinel took to his heels through this trench the attacking party following at full speed  the fugitive led the way to the paradeground within the barracks where was found another sentinel and he made a thrust with his bayonet at colonel easton who was side by side with the leaders but had hardly raised his weapon before a blow from the flat of colonel allens sword sent him headlong to the ground  at this the men unable longer to control themselves gave vent to a tremendous shout and without orders separated into two divisions each bent on gaining possession of the barrack ranges  as bees swarm out of their hives so did the startled redcoats rush from the buildings and it seemed to isaac as if instantly each man appeared he was disarmed by one of the green mountain boys who as fast as he secured a captive marched him to the center of the paradeground in order that he might not block up the entrance of the barracks  now was come the moment when nathans services were required  it was no longer possible to keep silence for the shouts of the men must have aroused every one within the inclosure and turning quickly colonel allen cried in a loud voice  get you before me with that lad corporal and let him lead the way to the commandants quarters  nathan did not require urging  he understood that this man had come with serious purpose and knew full well it might be dangerous for him to hang back  darting ahead as swiftly as the corporal would allow he conducted colonel allen to the door of captain delaplaces dwelling and the leader gave three resounding knocks with the hilt of his sword as he shouted  surrender this fort commandant surrender at once in order to save the lives of your men  the door was quickly opened in response to this demand and a halfclad man over whose shoulder could be seen the frightened face of a woman appeared in the doorway  before he could speak colonel allen cried  i order you instantly to surrender sir  by whose authority do you make such demand the captain cried with dignity  in the name of the great jehovah and the continental congress  these words sounded in isaacs ears like the thunder of cannon and even while he questioned to himself if it were possible this handful of men had really captured the fortress ticonderoga was surrendered     chapter viii  an interruption   nathan who had looked upon the men under colonel allen much as he had corporal lige was literally amazed by this ready submission of the kings troops standing silent and motionless by the side of isaac as the garrison was paraded without arms and the surrender made in due form  some days afterward isaac learned that the spoils of war at this place were one hundred and twenty iron cannon fifty swivels two teninch mortars one howitzer one cohorn ten tons musketballs three cartloads flints thirty guncarriages a quantity of shells a large amount of material for boat building one hundred stand of small arms ten casks of powder two brass cannon thirty barrels of flour and eighteen barrels of pork  fortyeight soldiers were surrendered and preparations were at once begun to send these together with the women and children to hartford  hardly was the surrender made complete when such of the troops as had been left on the opposite shore under seth warner arrived in a schooner much to the surprise of all until it was learned that captain herrick who had been sent to skenesborough to seize the son of the governor had succeeded in his mission without bloodshed  he took not only the young major but twelve negroes and attendants seized the schooner owned by the elder skene and had come down the lake in the early morning with the hope of aiding in the capture of ticonderoga  isaac had supposed this victory would end the adventure and was saying to himself that his experience had been rather pleasing than otherwise so much so in fact that he almost regretted the time was near at hand for him to return home when he saw much to his surprise a portion of the troops being formed in line as if to leave ticonderoga  corporal lige had been assigned to the task of overhauling the goods in the warehouse for the purpose of making out a list of the same and it was to him that isaac followed by nathan went for information  forming in line eh the old man asked as wiping the perspiration from his face he went outside to have a look around and instantly he noted the preparations which were making turned back to his work as if it was of but little concern  what is the meaning of that corporal isaac suggested are we going back without having stayed here a single day  there will be no turnin back lad until the work is finished and the fort at crown point yet remains to be taken i allow seth warner is goin to tackle that job which wont be a difficult one since it is said there are not above a dozen men in the garrison  suppose you an i go with em nathan suggested now no longer eager to demand money for his services but fired by what he had seen and burning to participate in new conquests  what do you say corporal isaac asked feeling that it was necessary to gain the old mans permission before he could join in the adventure  again corporal lige went to the door of the warehouse looking about him with the air of a weatherprophet after which he replied in a careless tone  i dont reckon it makes any difference whether you lads are here or sailin round the lake therefore if seth warner gives his permission you may go so far as i am concerned but itll be only a question of whifflin from one point to another for while the wind holds in this direction im allowin none of the force will reach crown point  the wind is likely to haul round after sunset so let us take our chances nathan whispered and isaac was not loth to embark  therefore the two started across the paradeground for the purpose of speaking with the old hunterseth warnerwhen captain herrick who had just made his report of the nights work at skenesborough halted the boys by saying  i reckon you two lads are the ones colonel allen would speak with at once you will find him in the commandants quarters  he is most likely thinkin of payin me for comin over last night nathan said as the two turned to obey the command and i have made up my mind not to take money for the service  isaac looked at his companion in surprise and the latter added almost shamefacedly  i reckon father was right when he said every one in the colonies should do all he could in this cause and besides it looks to me as if the kings troops would speedily get the worst of it  young beman was not unlike many in the neighborhood who in afterdays were royalists or patriots as the cause of freedom grew weak or strong  however nathan had no opportunity to refuse a payment of money for his services for when the lads stood before colonel allen the latter said in a tone of command and yet with the air of one asking a favor  i want to send a messenger to sudbury do you think you can find the place isaac rice  i will show him the way sir nathan said promptly and the colonel favored him with a glance of surprise but took no further heed of his sudden complaisance  at that settlement you will find one captain remember baker tell him what has been done at this point and say it is my wish he join me here without delay select the lightest boat you can find for crossing the lake and make all haste  then the colonel turned away intent upon the work of preparing a list of the garrison which had surrendered and some of his officers entering for further instructions prevented the boys from making any inquiries concerning the mission  on leaving the quarters nathan eager to serve this new commander of the fort with all possible celerity would have hastened at once to the shore in order to set out but that isaac insisted upon giving corporal lige due information as to their proposed movements much to the displeasure of young beman who claimed that the old soldier was of no account when the colonel had given orders  well this one is isaac said stoutly hes a good friend of mine and i wouldnt think of leavin without first tellin him no matter whose orders i was obeying  well i spose you must have your own way but the time will come when you wont think so much of that pigheaded old man as you do now  to this illnatured remark the lad did not reply but on presenting himself to corporal lige and explaining what he was about to do the latter still busy with his work of taking account of the stores made very much the same remark as had nathan  dont consider lad that you are to report to me when ordered on duty be careful of yourself do not run into danger needlessly and get you gone without delay for colonel allen is a man who doesnt take kindly to loiterers  nathan showed himself to be one who could perform a task promptly and in good order when it suited his pleasure so to do  he it was who selected the boat in which they were to cross the lake borrowed a musket from one of the men that he might not be forced to make the journey weaponless and succeeding in begging such an amount of provisions as would serve them for dinner  while these few preparations were being made warner with a detachment of twenty five men from colonel allens regiment put off on his journey to crown point and after watching them a moment nathan beman said in a tone of one who is satisfied with himself  its jest as well we didnt have a chance to go with that crowd for they wont get anywhere near there until the wind changes and it seems as though whoever is in charge of the job ought to know it  i suppose the plan is to take the fort by surprise as was this one and unless our people get there soon it will be a failure because the news of what has been done here must fly over the country quickly  while the wind blows this way and so strong no one will get up the lake therefore the garrison wont learn of the surrender of ticonderoga unless some one goes across the country however we neednt bother seeins our work is all cut an dried and we had better not waste too much time here  isaac was beginning to entertain a very friendly feeling toward this lad now that he had changed his views so entirely regarding the value of his services and as a matter of course nathan could be a most pleasing traveling companion when it suited his purpose as it did at present  the journey to sudbury proved to be a longer one than was anticipated  a strong wind which blew directly down the lake carried the boys fully two miles below the point at which they should have landed and nathan was much averse to following back along the shore in order to gain the trail which led to sudbury  it will be just that much useless labor he said emphatically and i am not given to walking more than may be necessary  but theres a chance of going astray if we strike across from here isaac suggested for as has already been shown he knew little of woodcraft and this traveling blindly around a section of the country where there was every reason to believe enemies might be found was not to his liking  id be a mighty poor sort of a guide if i couldnt go across from here without straying from the course so much as a dozen yards master beman said decidedly to walk up the shore two miles or more only for the purpose of striking the trail is foolishness  but the thicket is so dense here isaac suggested timidly almost fearing to venture an opinion lest he should provoke the mirth of his companion it will be harder to make our way through than to go around  nathan made no reply  he bestowed upon corporal liges recruit a glance as of pity and then without further words plunged into the underbrush  master rice could do no less than follow  before the boys had traveled half an hour on the direct course to sudbury it is more than probable young beman repented of having attempted to make a short cut for the advance was indeed difficult  at times it was really painful to force ones way through the tangled foliage while now and again the boys found themselves floundering over swampy land but nathan made no complaint because he was responsible for having taken such a course and isaac hardly dared protest lest his companion should be angered  i still maintain that it was better to come this way than travel two miles in vain nathan said as he threw himself upon the ground and corporal liges recruit ventured to suggest mildly  id rather walk three miles on the shore than one here where a fellow is obliged to fight his way through  perhaps you know this country better than i do and would take the lead  not so you left ticonderoga as guide and it would not be seemly in me who am a stranger here as well as a lad unaccustomed to this sort of warfare which is now being conducted to do other than follow your lead but  the remark which was intended to soothe the irritation in the guides breast was not concluded for isaac was interrupted by the sudden and unexpected appearance of three men who came upon the boys as if from an ambush  hullo master beman cried carelessly as if something in the way of a salutation was expected from him  instead of replying to this hail the two lads were seized roughly and without a word the strangers taking possession of the musket began searching the messengers clothing as if expecting something of value or importance would be found  look here what are you about nathan cried angrily while isaac submitted in silence for he understood that these three might be enemies to the cause what do you mean by handling me in this shape  better keep your tongue between your teeth young beman one of the men said in a surly tone when we ask for information therell be time enough for you to wag it so freely  surprised at having been thus recognized and heedless of the warning nathan continued  who are you i never saw you before what right have you to handle me in this fashion  the right of any of his majestys subjects for in these times it is well to overhaul every rebel one runs across  im no rebel nathan cried now exhibiting signs of alarm  your father is which amounts to the same thing the man replied as after having satisfied himself the lad had nothing concealed about his person he rose to his feet why are you abroad today  how long since is it that a lad may not move about as he wishes  since rebellion first showed its head in these colonies now answer my question or it will be the worse for you  isaac thoroughly alarmed had made no resistance either by word or movement when the stranger searched him and although ignorant as he had often said of warfare he understood now full well that they were fallen into the hands of enemies who would not hesitate at the taking of human life in order to compass their ends  therefore he remained stretched upon the ground as when the men first came upon them so terrified that it was almost impossible either to move or speak  young beman was frightened but not to such an extent as to prevent him from displaying anger and instead of replying to the question he attempted to rise to his feet  a blow delivered with unnecessary force sent him headlong to the ground again and his captor said warningly  have a care what you are about nathan beman for we are not disposed either to bandy words or waste much time on such as you who having professed friendship for those in the fort was ready to betray them  now nathans fears were as great as isaacs but he made one more effort at asserting himself and began by telling a lie  what have i done at the fort i am but just come from my fathers house  take that for the falsehood and this for believing us to be fools who can be deceived by such as you the man replied as he viciously kicked the boy twice you have but just come from ticonderoga and must have been sent by the rebels who captured the fort  what reason have you for saying that nathan asked in a more subdued tone  first the fact of your being here and secondly because your comrade spoke while we were within hearing of your having been sent from ticonderoga  nathan shot an angry glance toward isaac as if corporal liges recruit alone was to blame for this unpleasant interruption to the journey but he ventured no reply lest further chastisement might follow  tell me to whom you are sent and have a care in the replying for we are not minded to waste much time upon such as you  nathan was beginning to understand that he was wholly in the power of an enemy whom he could not readily deceive and also believed that it might be painful for him if the answer was delayed  he was not so devoted to the cause as to be willing to suffer in its behalf and therefore said surlily  we were going to captain remember baker at sudbury  who sent you  colonel allen  where is the message you are carrying  he gave us none save by word of mouth  repeat it and be careful lest you make the mistake of telling another lie  there is nothing in it of importance or interest to you it was simply that captain baker should come at once to ticonderoga  then the fort was taken last night  i thought you knew that nathan cried in surprise now understanding that he had divulged what it was most important should have been kept a profound secret until crown point had been captured  we heard that the rebels were marching toward the fort but could not get there in time to warn the commandant  why was it you made prisoners of two boys if you were not knowing to all that has taken place nathan asked his curiosity getting the better of his fears  we took the chance that you could give us the desired information because it was not reasonable old bemans son should be in this section unless on business of his fathers and in these times one can well guess what that business might be therefore having heard you floundering through the thicket we drew near to listen to such conversation as you might indulge in  are you going to waste time explaining our purpose to that young cub jason wentworth one of the men asked impatiently and he who had been addressed replied with a laugh  we are not in as much haste now as we were half an hour ago ezra jones captain baker will not get the message and while the wind holds in this quarter im allowing the rebels wont reach crown point before we do  they will if we loiter here all day truss up the lads so they can do no mischief and let us be off  would you leave them here in the thicket ezra jones  why not  they might starve to death and while im willing to serve the king in all things it is not my intent to be thus barbarous  they can make themselves heard if any one passes by on the trail the third man replied very carelessly and ezra added quickly  ay i had not thought of that they must be gagged or what may be better for us shot offhand  are you willing to kill two boys in cold blood ezra jones  there was no reply to this question and jason wentworth turned round to the other man  matthew white will you take it upon yourself to do what is little less than murder  no carry them further into the thicket where they cannot be heard from the trail and there tie them up  it were better we shot them at once than leave them to starve jason wentworth said much as if speaking to himself and during this conversation the feelings of the two lads can be faintly imagined  the question of their death by bullet or starvation was being discussed in such a businesslike manner as if there was no alternative that the boys were literally paralyzed with fear  it seemed to isaac rice as if the three men remained silent fully five minutes before jason wentworth spoke again and then it was with the air of one who has decided some vexed question  im not willing to play the part of a savage he said speaking slowly in order to give his words due weight neither do i propose that they shall carry the message well take them with us  and thus we shall be caused much delay ezra jones muttered  if they are wise we will travel as rapidly as when alone and in case of a refusal to obey orders they can be shot or left to starve as easily half an hour hence as now besides there will be much work at the oars twixt here and crown point and they can do a little more than their share of it  perhaps it was this last suggestion which caused the other two men to agree to the proposition  at all events no further objection was made and master wentworth took it upon himself to direct the march of the prisoners  you are to keep half a dozen paces in advance and take good care there is no loitering or any attempt at giving us the slip he said to the boys who yet lay upon the ground i do not propose that you shall be starved to death but at the same time i would put a musketball into one or both of you without compunction rather than suffer delay or escape now get on your feet and move lively for only by obedience can you save your lives  there was no disposition on the part of colonel allens messengers to run counter to the command which had been given  each knew full well that two of their three captors were in favor of leaving them to a most cruel death which could be escaped only by prompt acquiescence to all the orders given  therefore it was they leaped to their feet quickly and set forward at a sharp pace when jason wentworth pointed out the direction to be pursued  at this moment it was isaac who suffered most in mind for he knew full well that corporal lige would condemn him for not having the courage to face death rather than give information to the enemy  even though it was nathan who had divulged what should have been kept a secret the raw recruit knew in his own heart he had agreed that the information should be given because of having made no protest  if seth warner failed in his purpose it would be owing in a certain degree to what had been told these men and isaac who had hoped to win renown if not glory by enlisting could charge himself with what was worse than a blunder  on the other hand nathan was not sore in mind because of the possibility that crown point might still be held by the kings troops but he had sufficient sense to understand that if he had retraced his steps along the shore to the trail as isaac proposed this capture might not have been made  therefore but in a different fashion was his mental trouble as great as that of his comrade  to the chagrin of both the boys they came upon the trail leading from the lake to sudbury after not more than two or three minutes traveling and thus knew that if their halt had been delayed a very short time it might have been possible to have given these enemies the slip  once on the trail word was given to halt and the three men held a brief consultation as to the course they should pursue  one was in favor of going directly to the shore where it appeared they believed a boat could be found but the others insisted on keeping within the thicket until they were arrived a mile or more above the fort lest being seen pursuit should be made by those who had captured ticonderoga  this last proposition prevailed although there were many chances they might not find a boat further up the lake but jason wentworth persisted it would be better if they make the journey entirely on foot than take the risk of being captured before word could be carried to crown point  on being commanded to push forward once more the boys obeyed readily if not willingly and during the hour which elapsed before they gained the desired point nathan and isaac had ample opportunity for conversation since their captors did not seem to be averse to their talking one with the other  of course we shall be held prisoners by the kings troops once we are arrived at crown point isaac ventured to say after they had traveled steadily although slowly onward for nearly half an hour and young beman replied in a petulant tone  that goes without saying and it shows what a fool ive been in running around with those who would oppose the kings will if father is eager to ruin himself thats no reason i should be a fool and id better have listened to mother  why speak of what has been done corporal liges recruit asked in what he intended should be a soothing tone i am not acquainted with the country as you are neither am i so brave but yet it seems as if we should be on the alert for a chance to escape  now you talk like a fool how may we escape with these three men on watch all of whom are willing to shoot us at the first chance we give them im not minded to have a bullet put through my body but would rather trust to the kings troops in the hope that after a time we may be set free  yet if we could give these men the slip  you may be certain we shant have a chance  yet suppose we did  why will you be so weakheaded isaac rice if this is really war between the king and the colonies the lives of boys like us count for but little especially since two of these men are eager to be rid of us  isaac understood that it was useless just at this time to make any attempt at arousing his companion from the petulant despondency into which he had fallen wherefore wisely kept silent but at the same time was firmly resolved to be on the lookout for any opportunity of gaining his freedom  his timorousness had fled before the thought that there might yet be a chance he knew not how of preventing the information of the fall of ticonderoga from being carried to crown point  the boy had in his heart just then what is commonly called courage and his will was good at whatever cost to himself to repair the mischief which had been done  he had hoped to animate his companion to the same pitch but the failure to do this did not discourage him and while obeying strictly the orders given he was keenly aware of everything which might be of benefit  he heard the men discussing what they would do in case of a failure to find a boat near by where they gained the shore and learned that in such an event one of them would return to the landingplace to get the craft of which they knew with the idea that a single oarsman would not be molested while pulling leisurely up stream as if bent on business of his own  he also understood that it was the purpose of his captors after warning the garrison at crown point to muster a force of loyalists from the immediate vicinity and march into sudbury with the idea of taking captain baker and his men prisoners before a second messenger should be sent from ticonderoga  there seemed little hope that such information could avail him and yet he was in a certain degree elated because of having gained it  on arriving at the shore of the lake where the men had thought it possible a boat might be found no craft of any kind was to be seen  the wind still held strongly from the north and jason wentworth announced in a tone of satisfaction  the rebels wont get very far on their journey toward crown point this day and i am mistaken if the wind doesnt freshen after sunset  it will be precious hard work for us to make our way against such a breeze ezra jones grumbled  ay but we can do it with four oars out and even though we pull at them twentyfour hours the labor should count as nothing so that we arrive in good time  but the garrison there is weak  they should be able to hold out until assistance can arrive we can muster fifty men for them within two hours but standing here talking isnt doing the work and its important we set off without unnecessary delay ezra you go down the shore and matthew up each searching for a boat and when one has been found pull to this point where i will stay with the prisoners  is it to your mind that i shall take the craft from opposite the fort running the risk of being overhauled  better that than remain here wasting time in talk  matthew white was of the opinion that it would be wisest to make the journey afoot rather than take the risk of being overhauled by the rebels but to this master wentworth would not listen and he evidently being the leader of the party carried his point  the two men set out and immediately after their departure jason wentworth ordered his prisoners back into the underbrush a short distance from the shore where he stood guard over them and at the same time could keep close watch for the return of his companions     chapter ix  a bold stroke   isaacs heart beat hard and fast when he and nathan were thus left with but a single man to guard them for he believed the time had come when they might succeed in turning the tables because surely it would be easier to overpower one than three  in this however he soon came to understand that he was mistaken  had either of the others been left on guard it is possible something might have been done but jason wentworth was not a man to be caught napping and while he seemingly directed his gaze out over the waters at the slightest movement of either of the prisoners he was on the alert against an attempt at escape  twice had isaac changed his position in order to make certain the man was keeping close watch upon them when his attention was apparently directed elsewhere and each time he saw master wentworths musket raised that it might be ready in case a bullet was needed to check the flight of his captives  you had better not try that again the man said warningly when isaac shifted his position the third time for no other reason than to make himself more comfortable in a case like this your lives count as nothing and while i am unwilling to leave you to starve in the woods i shall not hesitate to kill either or both therefore do not make any feint at giving me the slip lest my patience should become exhausted  after that isaac was exceedingly careful as was young beman to remain silent and motionless  while corporal liges recruit was ready to encounter serious danger in order to accomplish his ends there was no idea in his mind of risking life needlessly when there was nothing to be gained  young beman lay face downward as he had thrown himself when the halt was called giving no heed to the conversation between his comrade and master wentworth and isaac believed young beman intended for him to understand that he would take no part in an effort to effect their release  an hour passed and nothing had been heard from the two who had gone in search of a boat  it surely seemed as if they must have met with some mishap and a great hope sprang up in isaacs breast  when thirty minutes more had passed master wentworths face gave evidence of the anxiety which had come upon him and he looked toward his prisoners with such an odd expression that isaac rice trembled fearing the man was beginning to believe it would be better to do with them as his friends had suggested  then when it seemed impossible for jason wentworth longer to control his impatience master white returned as when he departed and having the appearance of one who had walked far and rapidly  you found no boat master wentworth said interrogatively and the man replied as he seated himself wearily near by the prisoners  i do not believe there is one this side of crown point most likely the rebels took good care to gather in every craft that was to be found within half a dozen miles of here  for the first time since the little party came to a halt did nathan evince any interest in what was going on around him and now he partially turned as if to speak  isaac believing he was on the point of telling what he knew regarding the seizure of boats covered the boys mouth with his hand for he was not minded to give the enemy any information  master wentworth observed the movement and evidently would have demanded an explanation but for the fact that at this moment ezra jones came up through the thicket instead of along the shore  his report was much like master whites  the boat he had expected to find near the trail leading to sudbury was missing and he had continued on nearly two miles further but without avail  again did hope come into isaacs desponding breast  the boy had believed master jones would surely find the craft in which he and nathan had crossed the lake but fortune favored the rebel cause in that respect at least for the man must have turned about when by continuing on a very short distance further he would have come upon that for which he was searching  we must go on foot master wentworth said after a short pause and the sooner we set out the better  its all very well for you who have been resting here to say that jones replied petulantly ive been making a road through the thicket for a matter of five miles or more and dont propose to move again until after ive had a breathing spell  why didnt you come back by the shore as you went  because there are a hundred pair of eyes watching this side of the lake i could see the rebels on the opposite shore before i gained the trail and then it was necessary to keep well hidden in the bushes even though i had found a boat it is doubtful if i should have been allowed to pull up this way for seth warner and ethan allen are much too keen to let any one pass who is headed in the direction of crown point  they are waiting for the wind to die away before setting out to take the fort and if we would save it to the king it is time to be about the work master wentworth said half to himself but his comrades gave no heed to the words  then ensued a long time of silence and isaac was well content for each moment of delay lessened the danger as he believed  thanks to the indolence of masters white and jones it was nearly nightfall before they were ready to begin the journey and then the latter intimated that he had recovered from his fatigue  if we fail to give the warning in time you and white can take the fault to yourselves master wentworth said angrily after which he ordered the prisoners on in advance once more  they have begun to quarrel among themselves and perhaps our time will come before morning isaac whispered to nathan as they pushed on in advance and young beman appeared more willing to listen than when the subject was first broached but yet he made no reply  an hour later night had fully come and the flying clouds so completely obscured the sky that it was difficult for the travelers to make their way even along the shore where was nothing save here and there a point of rocks to impede the progress  more than once did the boys walk directly into the water and twice master white fell headlong over a fallen tree despite all efforts to the contrary and then it was jason wentworth who proposed a halt  we are not making two miles an hour at this rate he said in the tone of one who is offended with his companions we may as well stop where we are until it is light enough for us to see the way  nathan and isaac came to a halt immediately and ordering them to keep close by his side the leader of the party sought for a campingplace amid the shrubbery  it was not possible to make any choice selection while it was so dark that one could not distinguish objects a dozen paces in advance and at the first cleared space sufficiently large to admit of the men stretching out at full length master wentworth made his preparations for the night  he ordered the boys to lie down covered them with four or five saplings and on the ends of these he and master white laid themselves in such manner that the first movement made by the prisoners must awaken the captors  it was the indian method of guarding captives but owing to the absence of robes or blankets with which to cover the ends of the saplings those who lay on the outside had a most uncomfortable bed  isaac still on the alert for any advantage observed rather by sense of hearing than of sight that master wentworth kept his musket close beside him while the other two leaned their weapons against the bushes  it seemed to corporal liges recruit as if nathan beman had finally come to understand that escape might yet be possible for the latter prodded his comrade with his elbow from time to time as if to prevent him from falling asleep and isaac returned the pressure with vigor  then when it appeared as if fully an hour had passed the heavy breathing of the men told that they were fast asleep and nathan whispered cautiously  these fellows aint so smart as id counted on ive heard father tell how he outwitted the savages when they had him in the same kind of a trap an i can work this if youre ready  begin at once there is no time to lose  then it was that young beman breathed loudly as if wrapped in profound slumber and tossed about restlessly all the while pressing against master white  isaac did not understand the purpose of such maneuver but he was content with knowing that his comrade had at last consented to make an effort toward escape  more than once master white partially awakened and grumbled because of nathans restlessness but at the same moment he unconsciously moved aside slightly and each time he did this the prisoners were so much nearer liberty  then came the time when nathan whispered  he has at last rolled off the saplings and i can crawl away without disturbing him are you ready to follow  yes cant you get the muskets two are near our feet and the other is by the side of wentworth  it is enough if we give them the slip  if we get possession of the muskets they cannot send a bullet after us in case one awakens before we are well off  ill try it nathan replied as he began wriggling his body out from under the saplings not daring to move in the direction of where master white lay  isaac literally trembling with excitement followed his example and it seemed to him as if half an hour had been consumed in the task when really no more than five minutes were thus spent before the boys were on their feet and the men apparently still wrapped in slumber  even now nathan would have made good his escape without an effort to secure the weapons and pressed his comrades arm to intimate that there was no time to be lost but isaac dropping to his hands and knees crept toward master wentworth  when the plan had so far succeeded that they were on their feet a bold scheme came into isaacs head and he believed now was come the time for him to gain the good opinion of corporal lige if he should be so fortunate as to see the old soldier again  moving with infinite care and giving no heed to what nathan might be doing the boy crept to master wentworths side and it was with difficulty he repressed a cry of exultation as his fingers closed over the musket  cautiously rising to his feet and at the same instant assuring himself the flint was in place but forgetting that he had no powder with which to prime the weapon isaac stepped back to where he had left his comrade  nathan was no longer there but from a short distance away came a slight rustling of the foliage and isaac waited his heart beating so violently that it seemed positive the thumping must awaken their enemies  before corporal liges recruit could have counted twenty nathan stood by his side and it needed but one touch of the hand to tell the former that all the weapons had been secured  young beman had done his work well for he not only held the two muskets but a powderhorn well filled and a shot pouch heavy with bullets  now it was that having all the advantage nathan began to be sensible of a glow of patriotism and he whispered to his comrade as he carefully primed one of the muskets  it wouldnt be a hard task to take these fellows into sudbury if we had something with which to fetter their hands  my mother made the cloth of this coat i am wearing and i promise that its as strong as a rope  without waiting for a reply isaac began stripping the garment into narrow bands by aid of his teeth and the noise caused master wentworth to half rise as he cried  hey white jones  stay where you are nathan shouted weve got all the muskets and are in the mood to shoot if you make any trouble it wont go much against the grain to put a couple of bullets into the two who wanted to leave us trussed up in the thicket where we would starve to death  master wentworth sank back upon the ground very quickly and at the same instant must have discovered that his ammunition had not been seized for he cried to his companions  they cant prime the muskets and it is the same  youll know whether we can or not if you make any move dont think we were such fools as to forget that part of the business ive got all the powder and balls thatll be needed to give you three a solid dose tie master wentworths hands behind his back isaac and if he so much as winks while you are doing it ill quiet him lie down he added fiercely as in the dim light he saw one of the others attempting to rise if you make any fuss well shoot first an talk afterward  it was more than probable one of the men might because of the darkness have gotten off without injury but each knew that should such an attempt be made nathan could shoot down perhaps two of the party and each probably feared it might be himself who would receive the bullet  therefore it was that they obeyed young bemans orders strictly and as soon as might be master wentworth was lying on his face with both hands tied securely behind his back  to fetter the others in the same fashion was neither a long nor a difficult task because like the bullies they were both showed the white feather when danger threatened their precious selves and no more than fifteen minutes had elapsed from the time nathan first set about making the attempt at escape before the prisoners were powerless for harm  with their hands thus securely lashed behind them it was impossible for the men to rise without assistance and while nathan stood with the musket raised that he might shoot at the first show of resistance isaac helped the prisoners to their feet  now it is you three who will obey our orders instead of knocking us about young beman said gleefully and ill make the same threat master wentworth did at the first show of trying to escape ill shoot an even though it is dark theres little chance of missing aim for we shall keep close in the rear take one musket isaac and the other well leave here rather than hamper ourselves by too much of a burden  do you count on trying to make your way through the thicket while it is so dark ezra jones asked in a surly tone  thats what we shall do  then you may as well shoot us offhand for if it was hard work when we were free what chance have we with our hands tied  if you think that is the best plan ill follow your advice and never so much as wince in the doing of it for you was one who would have left us to starve nathan said so promptly that the man involuntarily ducked his head as if fearing a bullet might follow the words  where are you bent on taking us jason wentworth asked after he had somewhat recovered his composure  our orders were to go to sudbury and i think wed better keep on in that direction rather than lose time by carrying you to ticonderoga we could do that last if we pleased for our boat is hidden among the bushes nearabout where master jones turned back what say you isaac rice is it to be sudbury or the fort  it is best we see captain baker as soon as may be and if you think we can find our way through the woods ill say nothing against a short cut for time presses  the prisoners were driven like sheep both boys marching directly behind them with leveled muskets and as may be expected the advance was exceedingly slow  the men stumbled over fallen trees and each of them fell headlong half a dozen times before the seemingly long night came to an end but still they were urged on at the best possible pace until sunrise when a brief halt was made  two hours after the journey had been resumed the trail was found and from that time on until the outskirts of the settlement was gained the party marched at a reasonably rapid rate of speed  once a glimpse of sudbury was had isaac became exceedingly prudent and insisted upon calling a halt while nathan declared they should press forward until the prisoners could be delivered to captain baker  i shant feel comfortable in mind until all three are off our hands for theres no knowing how many friends they may have in the settlement  that is exactly why i would halt here isaac replied and corporal lige would have rejoiced had he known how rapidly his recruit was learning his duties as a soldier we do not know in which house captain baker lives and while making inquiries still having the prisoners with us we might come upon those who would turn the tables once more before we had so much as gained speech with the officer  then what would you do  we are within less than half a mile of the settlement let us march the prisoners into the thicket where they will be hidden from view of any who may come this way and while one stands guard over them the other can seek out the captain after that has been done he can take charge of the affair and our work will be well and thoroughly done  who is to remain here nathan asked  it shall be as you say  young beman remained silent a moment and then with the air of one who has decided an important question said  you shall go into the settlement and if either of these tories so much as opens his mouth while you are gone ill put a bullet through him  and you must not hesitate to carry out that threat isaac added firmly now is come the time when we may prevent any news from being carried to crown point and at the same moment deliver colonel allens message therefore blood must be spilled if necessary  jones and white looked thoroughly alarmed while jason wentworth said approvingly  you lads are in the right from your own standpoint which is a wrong one however but since we have been so dull as to let you get the best of us it is but proper we should pay the penalty for disobeying orders  will you give us your word not to make an outcry if any person should pass by on the trail isaac quietly having no little respect for this enemy who could look upon the situation so fairly  if by giving up my life i can prevent the capture of crown point you may be certain i shall not hesitate  isaac looked significantly at nathan as if to say that this man should be guarded more closely than the others and after the prisoners had been marched into the thicket where they were completely hidden from view corporal liges recruit set out nathan calling after him  do not loiter by the way either in going or coming for i am not quite at my ease while alone  have no fear i shall delay it should not be a long task to find captain baker and most likely youll see me again in less than an hour keep your wits about you and remember how much mischief may be done if you hesitate to shoot when it becomes necessary to do so     chapter x  crown point   never since the moment when corporal lige had promised to make a soldier of him had isaac rice been as happy as now  he had atoned for the mistake made when they first set out on the journey although it was really none of his and in addition to having prevented the news of what had been done at ticonderoga from being carried to crown point had as prisoners three who could have made no slight amount of trouble for the colonists  surely the old corporal would praise nathan and himself and he glowed with pride as he thought of the report he could make on his return to the fort  of course nathan beman has as big a share in this work as i and it is his right but i know it was not me who grew fainthearted when we were in the power of the enemy an theres a deal of satisfaction in that thought  on arriving at sudbury half an hour after having left his comrade isaac made inquiries for captain bakers dwelling and learned that had nathans proposition been carried out they would have been forced to parade the prisoners through the entire settlement before coming upon the house  the captain was within sound of his wifes voice when isaac finally stood before the good woman asking to see her husband and came up quickly but with a look of disappointment on his face when he saw his visitor was only a boy  is this captain remember baker corporal liges recruit asked for he was not minded any mistake should be made now that his work was so nearly accomplished  yes what do you want  i am come from colonel allen  where is he the captain asked eagerly  that i may not tell you until we are alone  come into the house come in and refresh yourself and you shall tell me that with which you are charged while partaking of such food as my wife can prepare quickly  it is not well for me to spend time in eating until after nathan beman is relieved from his charge  what have you to do with that young tory if it is true that you come from ethan allen and now the captain began to show signs of being suspicious  i will tell the whole story beginning with the capture of ticonderoga  so the fort has been taken by our people captain baker cried joyously as he clasped the messenger by the hand with such force as to make the boy wince tell me quickly when was the work done  more than once before he had come to the story of his and nathans adventures was isaac interrupted by the eager soldier but after a certain time he succeeded in imparting all the information and was rewarded by hearing the captain say  you showed rare good sense in leaving the prisoners outside the settlement for while we in sudbury are with the colonists in their task of teaching the king a muchneeded lesson there are some who might have tried to work mischief had you applied to them asking the location of my dwelling wait here until i can summon a few of the green mountain boys who have been awaiting word from ethan allen and well soon relieve you of the tories  captain baker ran out not stopping for a reply and while he was absent his wife insisted on isaacs eating such food as she had already prepared until it seemed to the boy that he would not need anything more for twentyfour hours  then six men each armed with a musket arrived and were ushered into the house and isaac was called upon to tell once more of how ticonderoga had been captured after which the party set out to find the prisoners  corporal liges recruit acted the part of guide and in less than an hour the three tories having been given a liberal supply of cornbread were being marched back on the trail toward the captured fort  both isaac and nathan believed it was their duty to accompany the prisoners but captain baker insisted that they remain at his home in order to gain the repose which was needed promising that they should arrive at ticonderoga nearly as soon as if they had gone with the company escorting the tories  therefore it was the boys remained well content with the work they had performed and not until the morning of the twelfth of may was the return journey begun  then the wind was blowing gently from the southward and nathan said mournfully  we have of a surety lost the chance of going to crown point for the hunter will be up and doing this morning and is likely well on his way by this time  overhearing his words the captain added  ay lad if he didnt get there yesterday which i misdoubt you may count that he started before daybreak this morning but you can have the satisfaction of knowing that save for your work his task might not be so easy  think you he can surprise the garrison isaac asked  i see no reason why it should not be done especially after your capture of the tories for thus far colonel allen has succeeded in keeping his movements a secret at least from the people in this section of the country and why may you not say the same of crown point  to the surprise of the boys no less than twenty men were assembled in front of captain bakers house by the time breakfast had been eaten and on making inquiry isaac learned that these were all of the green mountain boys who had been ordered by their leader to rendezvous at sudbury until summoned elsewhere  the company under command of captain baker took up the line of march over an old trail through the woods marching to a point on the shore of the lake nearly two miles further down from where the boys had landed when they came from the fort  there snugly hidden in the thicket ready for just such an emergency as had already come were found four stout boats each capable of carrying not less than a dozen men and after all were embarked and the little fleet pushed off from the shore it appeared quite formidable  each craft boasted of a sail and with the wind from the southward there was no need of labor at the oars therefore this portion of the journey promised to be most pleasant  this is different from what we expected when master wentworth marched us in front of his musket isaac said in a tone of content and his comrade replied  we got out of a small hole in fine style  it was when they were midway from the point of embarkation to fort ticonderoga that young beman cried excitedly pointing toward that shore which they had just quitted where could be seen two small boats laden with men who were pulling into a cove as if seeking shelter  it looks to me as if those fellows are wearing red coats  it was the first intimation captain baker had that there were others in the immediate vicinity and instantly he gave word for the boats to be hauled around for the purpose of learning who these strangers were  hardly had this maneuver been executed when one of the men announced positively that young beman was right in his conjecture  they are most likely britishers who escaped from ticonderoga or have come from crown point on their way to st john in search of reinforcements captain baker cried excitedly and orders were given for the men to take to the oars  then ensued a chase which was quickly ended owing to the precaution taken by the britishers themselves  they had put into the cove hoping to escape detection and it proved to be a trap for them  no sooner were the boats arrived off this place of refuge than captain baker gave orders for them to be strung out in line thus cutting off all hope of escape by water and in his own craft pulled near to where the two boats manned by seven soldiers were drawn up as if prepared to do battle  it was soon evident they understood well the truth of the old adage that discretion is the better part of valor for immediately captain baker called upon them to surrender they threw their arms into the bottom of the boat in token of submission  nathan was most grievously disappointed he had fancied there might be a skirmish or at least an exchange of shots for until the morning when ticonderoga was taken so readily he had believed the kings soldiers to be invincible and even now he was not prepared to see them surrender to a force little more than four times their number  the prisoners readily answered the questions put by the captain  they were from crown point and having learned of the surrender of ticonderoga had been dispatched by the sergeant in command of the garrison for reinforcements  they stated in addition that it was not believed those who had taken ticonderoga would push on to crown point immediately consequently plenty of time remained in which that post might be reinforced therefore it was the sergeant in command had not hesitated to weaken his small garrison by thus sending seven men on a mission which might more readily have been accomplished by one  there is yet time for us to do seth warner a good turn captain baker cried sufficiently loud for all his men to hear it is more than likely the garrison at crown point will hold out when the green mountain boys demand its surrender believing reinforcements are or speedily will be on the way now instead of stopping at ticonderoga our plan is to push directly on to the fort and when it is known that we have captured the messengers i reckon the fortification will be surrendered with but little parley  although the captain had thus spoken as if making a suggestion his men understood that his words were little short of a command and after transferring the prisoners the fleet was gotten under way  thanks to the freshening wind the boats were soon making good time in the race to overtake the force led by seth warner  and it is to be crown point for us after all nathan cried exultantly whereat hearing the words captain baker asked  what is your name lad  nathan beman from shoreham  so i knew your father was on the right side but understood that you and your mother were hardly to be trusted  i cannot say anything for mother but since i have seen the kings soldiers surrender so readily i am with the green mountain boys and those who share their opinions  when you are so nearly with them as to enlist come to me lad and i will give you a musket in the best company that can be found this side of cambridge  isaac looked at his new friend reproachfully and the latter said with a laugh  i know all you are thinking but when i enlist and it aint certain but that i shall do so soon if the people continue to hold out against the king i propose to set my name down for that company to which you belong  do so when we go back to the fort isaac cried gleefully and side by side you and i will see many a brave adventure  but the trouble is we may see more than will be pleasing though i truly believe i shall enlist  and corporal lige shall teach us both a soldiers duty  this proposition apparently did not meet with favor for nathan at once changed the subject of the conversation by inquiring regarding the probable condition of affairs at crown point after which the boys listened to the conversation of their companions as they spoke of lexington and concord and of what should be done to avenge the murders committed there  and now it came to pass that these two lads were most grievously disappointed in their anticipations concerning the capture of the fort  probably each had in his mind the thought that he was to see somewhat of war more at least than had been witnessed at ticonderoga but it was not to be  as the little fleet approached the point warner and his men were just disembarking  although captain bakers party was but a mile away at that time when they gained the shore the garrison had been surrendered without the firing of a gun and the booming of the cannon told that again were the imitation soldiers successful in their efforts to teach his majesty a lesson  one hundred and fourteen cannon of which sixtyone were fit for service were among the spoils on this morning and after having made up a list of such goods as were found in the fort seth warner did the two lads the great favor of sending them to colonel allen with the news of the bloodless victory  go you on ahead lads captain baker said when the boys had been intrusted with the message i wont spoil a good fortune by seeming to accompany you but will linger here until you are well on the way and after having given ethan allen the best news he could possibly receive at such a critical time i very much question whether you may not ask whatsoever you will from him  hurriedly the messengers departed in order that they might arrive well in advance of captain bakers company and when they were pulling down the lake isaac said thoughtfully  you heard what captain baker said that colonel allen might grant anything we asked  yes and i know what is in your mind this minute  name it then  you think i am counting on asking him for money  isaacs face flushed and he made no reply  i might have done so a few days ago but now i am coming around on the same track with father and say that the colonists do right in resisting the king if it so be he permits i will enlist this day  and nathan beman kept his promise even going so far as to desire corporal lige should stand sponsor for him when the message having been delivered colonel allen thanked them again and again for the cheering intelligence and asked what they would choose as their reward  only the permission to enlist nathan said and the colonel stared at him in openmouthed astonishment for several seconds after which he asked with a laugh  are you not the same lad who so thirsted for money that he refused to show the way into the fort unless first paid for his services  ay sir but i have come to think differently since then and now im going for a soldier because it looks to me as if the colonists would speedily worst the king  whereas a few days ago it appeared to you that the boot was on the other foot  i did not think farmers could be turned into soldiers sir  you may readily believe it now lad more especially since you have seen how easy it is for one who was almost a royalist to become a good american and now i am speaking of yourself enlist wherever you will and i will take it upon myself to see that both you lads rise in the service as rapidly as you shall deserve   the end     a l burts publications  for young people    by popular writers   9799101 reade street new york   bonnie prince charlie a tale of fontenoy and
