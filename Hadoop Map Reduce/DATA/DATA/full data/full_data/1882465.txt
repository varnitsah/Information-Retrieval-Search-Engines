concerning the american language  rogers      the loves of alonzo fitz clarence and rosannah ethelton  it was well along in the forenoon of a bitter winters day the town of eastport in the state of maine lay buried under a deep snow that was newly fallen the customary bustle in the streets was wanting one could look long distances down them and see nothing but a deadwhite emptiness with silence to match of course i do not mean that you could see the silenceno you could only hear it the sidewalks were merely long deep ditches with steep snow walls on either side here and there you might hear the faint far scrape of a wooden shovel and if you were quick enough you might catch a glimpse of a distant black figure stooping and disappearing in one of those ditches and reappearing the next moment with a motion which you would know meant the heaving out of a shovelful of snow but you needed to be quick for that black figure would not linger but would soon drop that shovel and scud for the house thrashing itself with its arms to warm them yes it was too venomously cold for snowshovelers or anybody else to stay out long  presently the sky darkened then the wind rose and began to blow in fitful vigorous gusts which sent clouds of powdery snow aloft and straight ahead and everywhere under the impulse of one of these gusts great white drifts banked themselves like graves across the streets a moment later another gust shifted them around the other way driving a fine spray of snow from their sharp crests as the gale drives the spume flakes from wavecrests at sea a third gust swept that place as clean as your hand if it saw fit this was fooling this was play but each and all of the gusts dumped some snow into the sidewalk ditches for that was business  alonzo fitz clarence was sitting in his snug and elegant little parlor in a lovely blue silk dressinggown with cuffs and facings of crimson satin elaborately quilted the remains of his breakfast were before him and the dainty and costly little table service added a harmonious charm to the grace beauty and richness of the fixed appointments of the room a cheery fire was blazing on the hearth  a furious gust of wind shook the windows and a great wave of snow washed against them with a drenching sound so to speak the handsome young bachelor murmured  that means no going out today well i am content but what to do for company mother is well enough aunt susan is well enough but these like the poor i have with me always on so grim a day as this one needs a new interest a fresh element to whet the dull edge of captivity that was very neatly said but it doesnt mean anything one doesnt want the edge of captivity sharpened up you know but just the reverse  he glanced at his pretty french mantelclock  that clocks wrong again that clock hardly ever knows what time it is and when it does know it lies about itwhich amounts to the same thing alfred  there was no answer  alfred good servant but as uncertain as the clock  alonzo touched an electric bell button in the wall he waited a moment then touched it again waited a few moments more and said  battery out of order no doubt but now that i have started i will find out what time it is he stepped to a speakingtube in the wall blew its whistle and called mother and repeated it twice  well thats no use mothers battery is out of order too cant raise anybody downstairsthat is plain  he sat down at a rosewood desk leaned his chin on the lefthand edge of it and spoke as if to the floor aunt susan  a low pleasant voice answered is that you alonzo  yes im too lazy and comfortable to go downstairs i am in extremity and i cant seem to scare up any help  dear me what is the matter  matter enough i can tell you  oh dont keep me in suspense dear what is it  i want to know what time it is  you abominable boy what a turn you did give me is that all  allon my honor calm yourself tell me the time and receive my blessing  just five minutes after nine no chargekeep your blessing  thanks it wouldnt have impoverished me aunty nor so enriched you that you could live without other means  he got up murmuring just five minutes after nine and faced his clock ah said he you are doing better than usual you are only thirtyfour minutes wrong let me see let me see thirtythree and twentyone are fiftyfour four times fiftyfour are two hundred and thirtysix one off leaves two hundred and thirtyfive thats right  he turned the hands of his clock forward till they marked twentyfive minutes to one and said now see if you cant keep right for a whileelse ill raffle you  he sat down at the desk again and said aunt susan  yes dear  had breakfast  yes indeed an hour ago  busy  noexcept sewing why  got any company  no but i expect some at half past nine  i wish i did im lonesome i want to talk to somebody  very well talk to me  but this is very private  dont be afraidtalk right along theres nobody here but me  i hardly know whether to venture or not but  but what oh dont stop there you know you can trust me alonzoyou know you can  i feel it aunt but this is very serious it affects me deeplyme and all the familyeven the whole community  oh alonzo tell me i will never breathe a word of it what is it  aunt if i might dare  oh please go on i love you and feel for you tell me all confide in me what is it  the weather  plague take the weather i dont see how you can have the heart to serve me so lon  there there aunty dear im sorry i am on my honor i wont do it again do you forgive me  yes since you seem so sincere about it though i know i oughtnt to you will fool me again as soon as i have forgotten this time  no i wont honor bright but such weather oh such weather youve got to keep your spirits up artificially it is snowy and blowy and gusty and bitter cold how is the weather with you  warm and rainy and melancholy the mourners go about the streets with their umbrellas running streams from the end of every whalebone theres an elevated double pavement of umbrellas stretching down the sides of the streets as far as i can see ive got a fire for cheerfulness and the windows open to keep cool but it is vain it is useless nothing comes in but the balmy breath of december with its burden of mocking odors from the flowers that possess the realm outside and rejoice in their lawless profusion whilst the spirit of man is low and flaunt their gaudy splendors in his face while his soul is clothed in sackcloth and ashes and his heart breaketh  alonzo opened his lips to say you ought to print that and get it framed but checked himself for he heard his aunt speaking to some one else he went and stood at the window and looked out upon the wintry prospect the storm was driving the snow before it more furiously than ever windowshutters were slamming and banging a forlorn dog with bowed head and tail withdrawn from service was pressing his quaking body against a windward wall for shelter and protection a young girl was plowing kneedeep through the drifts with her face turned from the blast and the cape of her waterproof blowing straight rearward over her head alonzo shuddered and said with a sigh better the slop and the sultry rain and even the insolent flowers than this  he turned from the window moved a step and stopped in a listening attitude the faint sweet notes of a familiar song caught his ear he remained there with his head unconsciously bent forward drinking in the melody stirring neither hand nor foot hardly breathing there was a blemish in the execution of the song but to alonzo it seemed an added charm instead of a defect this blemish consisted of a marked flatting of the third fourth fifth sixth and seventh notes of the refrain or chorus of the piece when the music ended alonzo drew a deep breath and said ah i never have heard in the sweet byandby sung like that before  he stepped quickly to the desk listened a moment and said in a guarded confidential voice aunty who is this divine singer  she is the company i was expecting stays with me a month or two i will introduce you miss  for goodness sake wait a moment aunt susan you never stop to think what you are about  he flew to his bedchamber and returned in a moment perceptibly changed in his outward appearance and remarking snappishly  hang it she would have introduced me to this angel in that skyblue dressinggown with redhot lapels women never think when they get agoing  he hastened and stood by the desk and said eagerly now aunty i am ready and fell to smiling and bowing with all the persuasiveness and elegance that were in him  very well miss rosannah ethelton let me introduce to you my favorite nephew mr alonzo fitz clarence there you are both good people and i like you so i am going to trust you together while i attend to a few household affairs sit down rosannah sit down alonzo goodby i shant be gone long  alonzo had been bowing and smiling all the while and motioning imaginary young ladies to sit down in imaginary chairs but now he took a seat himself mentally saying oh this is luck let the winds blow now and the snow drive and the heavens frown little i care  while these young people chat themselves into an acquaintanceship let us take the liberty of inspecting the sweeter and fairer of the two she sat alone at her graceful ease in a richly furnished apartment which was manifestly the private parlor of a refined and sensible lady if signs and symbols may go for anything for instance by a low comfortable chair stood a dainty topheavy workstand whose summit was a fancifully embroidered shallow basket with varicolored crewels and other strings and odds and ends protruding from under the gaping lid and hanging down in negligent profusion on the floor lay bright shreds of turkey red prussian blue and kindred fabrics bits of ribbon a spool or two a pair of scissors and a roll or so of tinted silken stuffs on a luxurious sofa upholstered with some sort of soft indian goods wrought in black and gold threads interwebbed with other threads not so pronounced in color lay a great square of coarse white stuff upon whose surface a rich bouquet of flowers was growing under the deft cultivation of the crochetneedle the household cat was asleep on this work of art in a baywindow stood an easel with an unfinished picture on it and a palette and brushes on a chair beside it there were books everywhere robertsons sermons tennyson moody and sankey hawthorne rab and his friends cookbooks prayerbooks patternbooksand books about all kinds of odious and exasperating pottery of course there was a piano with a deckload of music and more in a tender there was a great plenty of pictures on the walls on the shelves of the mantelpiece and around generally where coigns of vantage offered were statuettes and quaint and pretty gimcracks and rare and costly specimens of peculiarly devilish china the baywindow gave upon a garden that was ablaze with foreign and domestic flowers and flowering shrubs  but the sweet young girl was the daintiest thing these premises within or without could offer for contemplation delicately chiseled features of grecian cast her complexion the pure snow of a japonica that is receiving a faint reflected enrichment from some scarlet neighbor of the garden great soft blue eyes fringed with long curving lashes an expression made up of the trustfulness of a child and the gentleness of a fawn a beautiful head crowned with its own prodigal gold a lithe and rounded figure whose every attitude and movement was instinct with native grace  her dress and adornment were marked by that exquisite harmony that can come only of a fine natural taste perfected by culture her gown was of a simple magenta tulle cut bias traversed by three rows of lightblue flounces with the selvage edges turned up with ashesofroses chenille overdress of dark bay tarlatan with scarlet satin lambrequins corncolored polonaise en panier looped with motherofpearl buttons and silver cord and hauled aft and made fast by buff velvet lashings basque of lavender reps picked out with valenciennes low neck short sleeves maroon velvet necktie edged with delicate pink silk inside handkerchief of some simple threeply ingrain fabric of a soft saffron tint coral bracelets and locketchain coiffure of forgetmenots and liliesofthevalley massed around a noble calla  this was all yet even in this subdued attire she was divinely beautiful then what must she have been when adorned for the festival or the ball  all this time she had been busily chatting with alonzo unconscious of our inspection the minutes still sped and still she talked but by and by she happened to look up and saw the clock a crimson blush sent its rich flood through her cheeks and she exclaimed  there goodby mr fitz clarence i must go now  she sprang from her chair with such haste that she hardly heard the young mans answering goodby she stood radiant graceful beautiful and gazed wondering upon the accusing clock presently her pouting lips parted and she said  five minutes after eleven nearly two hours and it did not seem twenty minutes oh dear what will he think of me  at the selfsame moment alonzo was staring at his clock and presently he said  twentyfive minutes to three nearly two hours and i didnt believe it was two minutes is it possible that this clock is humbugging again miss ethelton just one moment please are you there yet  yes but be quick im going right away  would you be so kind as to tell me what time it is  the girl blushed again murmured to herself its right down cruel of him to ask me and then spoke up and answered with admirably counterfeited unconcern five minutes after eleven  oh thank you you have to go now have you  im sorry  no reply  miss ethelton  well  youyoure there yet aint you  yes but please hurry what did you want to say  well iwell nothing in particular its very lonesome here its asking a great deal i know but would you mind talking with me again by and bythat is if it will not trouble you too much  i dont know but ill think about it ill try  oh thanks miss ethelton ah me shes gone and here are the black clouds and the whirling snow and the raging winds come again but she said goodby she didnt say good morning she said goodby  the clock was right after all what a lightningwinged two hours it was  he sat down and gazed dreamily into his fire for a while then heaved a sigh and said  how wonderful it is two little hours ago i was a free man and now my hearts in san francisco  about that time rosannah ethelton propped in the windowseat of her bedchamber book in hand was gazing vacantly out over the rainy seas that washed the golden gate and whispering to herself how different he is from poor burley with his empty head and his single little antic talent of mimicry  ii  four weeks later mr sidney algernon burley was entertaining a gay luncheon company in a sumptuous drawingroom on telegraph hill with some capital imitations of the voices and gestures of certain popular actors and san franciscan literary people and bonanza grandees he was elegantly upholstered and was a handsome fellow barring a trifling cast in his eye he seemed very jovial but nevertheless he kept his eye on the door with an expectant and uneasy watchfulness by and by a nobby lackey appeared and delivered a message to the mistress who nodded her head understandingly that seemed to settle the thing for mr burley his vivacity decreased little by little and a dejected look began to creep into one of his eyes and a sinister one into the other  the rest of the company departed in due time leaving him with the mistress to whom he said  there is no longer any question about it she avoids me she continually excuses herself if i could see her if i could speak to her only a momentbut this suspense  perhaps her seeming avoidance is mere accident mr burley go to the small drawingroom upstairs and amuse yourself a moment i will despatch a household order that is on my mind and then i will go to her room without doubt she will be persuaded to see you  mr burley went upstairs intending to go to the small drawingroom but as he was passing aunt susans private parlor the door of which stood slightly ajar he heard a joyous laugh which he recognized so without knock or announcement he stepped confidently in but before he could make his presence known he heard words that harrowed up his soul and chilled his young blood he heard a voice say  darling it has come  then he heard rosannah ethelton whose back was toward him say  so has yours dearest  he saw her bowed form bend lower he heard her kiss somethingnot merely once but again and again his soul raged within him the heartbreaking conversation went on  rosannah i knew you must be beautiful but this is dazzling this is blinding this is intoxicating  alonzo it is such happiness to hear you say it i know it is not true but i am so grateful to have you think it is nevertheless i knew you must have a noble face but the grace and majesty of the reality beggar the poor creation of my fancy  burley heard that rattling shower of kisses again  thank you my rosannah the photograph flatters me but you must not allow yourself to think of that sweetheart  yes alonzo  i am so happy rosannah  oh alonzo none that have gone before me knew what love was none that come after me will ever know what happiness is i float in a gorgeous cloud land a boundless firmament of enchanted and bewildering ecstasy  oh my rosannahfor you are mine are you not  wholly oh wholly yours alonzo now and forever all the day long and all through my nightly dreams one song sings itself and its sweet burden is alonzo fitz clarence alonzo fitz clarence eastport state of maine  curse him ive got his address anyway roared burley inwardly and rushed from the place  just behind the unconscious alonzo stood his mother a picture of astonishment she was so muffled from head to heel in furs that nothing of herself was visible but her eyes and nose she was a good allegory of winter for she was powdered all over with snow  behind the unconscious rosannah stood aunt susan another picture of astonishment she was a good allegory of summer for she was lightly clad and was vigorously cooling the perspiration on her face with a fan  both of these women had tears of joy in their eyes  soho exclaimed mrs fitz clarence this explains why nobody has been able to drag you out of your room for six weeks alonzo  so ho exclaimed aunt susan this explains why you have been a hermit for the past six weeks rosannah  the young couple were on their feet in an instant abashed and standing like detected dealers in stolen goods awaiting judge lynchs doom  bless you my son i am happy in your happiness come to your mothers arms alonzo  bless you rosannah for my dear nephews sake come to my arms  then was there a mingling of hearts and of tears of rejoicing on telegraph hill and in eastport square  servants were called by the elders in both places unto one was given the order pile this fire high with hickory wood and bring me a roastinghot lemonade  unto the other was given the order put out this fire and bring me two palmleaf fans and a pitcher of icewater  then the young people were dismissed and the elders sat down to talk the sweet surprise over and make the wedding plans  some minutes before this mr burley rushed from the mansion on telegraph hill without meeting or taking formal leave of anybody he hissed through his teeth in unconscious imitation of a popular favorite in melodrama him shall she never wed i have sworn it ere great nature shall have doffed her winters ermine to don the emerald gauds of spring she shall be mine  iii  two weeks later every few hours during same three or four days a very prim and devoutlooking episcopal clergyman with a cast in his eye had visited alonzo according to his card he was the rev melton hargrave of cincinnati he said he had retired from the ministry on account of his health if he had said on account of illhealth he would probably have erred to judge by his wholesome looks and firm build he was the inventor of an improvement in telephones and hoped to make his bread by selling the privilege of using it at present he continued a man may go and tap a telegraph wire which is conveying a song or a concert from one state to another and he can attach his private telephone and steal a hearing of that music as it passes along my invention will stop all that  well answered alonzo if the owner of the music could not miss what was stolen why should he care  he shouldnt care said the reverend  well said alonzo inquiringly  suppose replied the reverend suppose that instead of music that was passing along and being stolen the burden of the wire was loving endearments of the most private and sacred nature  alonzo shuddered from head to heel sir it is a priceless invention said he i must have it at any cost  but the invention was delayed somewhere on the road from cincinnati most unaccountably the impatient alonzo could hardly wait the thought of rosannahs sweet words being shared with him by some ribald thief was galling to him the reverend came frequently and lamented the delay and told of measures he had taken to hurry things up this was some little comfort to alonzo  one forenoon the reverend ascended the stairs and knocked at alonzos door there was no response he entered glanced eagerly around closed the door softly then ran to the telephone the exquisitely soft and remote strains of the sweet byandby came floating through the instrument the singer was flatting as usual the five notes that follow the first two in the chorus when the reverend interrupted her with this word in a voice which was an exact imitation of alonzos with just the faintest flavor of impatience added  sweetheart  yes alonzo  please dont sing that any more this weektry something modern  the agile step that goes with a happy heart was heard on the stairs and the reverend smiling diabolically sought sudden refuge behind the heavy folds of the velvet windowcurtains alonzo entered and flew to the telephone said he  rosannah dear shall we sing something together  something modern asked she with sarcastic bitterness  yes if you prefer  sing it yourself if you like  this snappishness amazed and wounded the young man he said  rosannah that was not like you  i suppose it becomes me as much as your very polite speech became you mr fitz clarence  mister fitz clarence rosannah there was nothing impolite about my speech  oh indeed of course then i misunderstood you and i most humbly beg your pardon hahaha no doubt you said dont sing it any more today  sing what any more today  the song you mentioned of course how very obtuse we are all of a sudden  i never mentioned any song  oh you didnt  no i didnt  i am compelled to remark that you did  and i am obliged to reiterate that i didnt  a second rudeness that is sufficient sir i will never forgive you all is over between us  then came a muffled sound of crying alonzo hastened to say  oh rosannah unsay those words there is some dreadful mystery here some hideous mistake i am utterly earnest and sincere when i say i never said anything about any song i would not hurt you for the whole world rosannah dear speak to me wont you  there was a pause then alonzo heard the girls sobbings retreating and knew she had gone from the telephone he rose with a heavy sigh and hastened from the room saying to himself i will ransack the charity missions and the haunts of the poor for my mother she will persuade her that i never meant to wound her  a minute later the reverend was crouching over the telephone like a cat that knoweth the ways of the prey he had not very many minutes to wait a soft repentant voice tremulous with tears said  alonzo dear i have been wrong you could not have said so cruel a thing it must have been some one who imitated your voice in malice or in jest  the reverend coldly answered in alonzos tones  you have said all was over between us so let it be i spurn your proffered repentance and despise it  then he departed radiant with fiendish triumph to return no more with his imaginary telephonic invention forever  four hours afterward alonzo arrived with his mother from her favorite haunts of poverty and vice they summoned the san francisco household but there was no reply they waited and continued to wait upon the voiceless telephone  at length when it was sunset in san francisco and three hours and a half after dark in eastport an answer to the oftrepeated cry of rosannah  but alas it was aunt susans voice that spake she said  i have been out all day just got in i will go and find her  the watchers waited two minutesfive minutesten minutes then came these fatal words in a frightened tone  she is gone and her baggage with her to visit another friend she told the servants but i found this note on the table in her room listen i am gone seek not to trace me out my heart is broken you will never see me more tell him i shall always think of him when i sing my poor sweet byandby but never of the unkind words he said about it that is her note alonzo alonzo what does it mean what has happened  but alonzo sat white and cold as the dead his mother threw back the velvet curtains and opened a window the cold air refreshed the sufferer and he told his aunt his dismal story meantime his mother was inspecting a card which had disclosed itself upon the floor when she cast the curtains back it read mr sidney algernon burley san francisco  the miscreant shouted alonzo and rushed forth to seek the false reverend and destroy him for the card explained everything since in the course of the lovers mutual confessions they had told each other all about all the sweethearts they had ever had and thrown no end of mud at their failings and foibles for lovers always do that it has a fascination that ranks next after billing and cooing  iv  during the next two months many things happened it had early transpired that rosannah poor suffering orphan had neither returned to her grandmother in portland oregon nor sent any word to her save a duplicate of the woeful note she had left in the mansion on telegraph hill whosoever was sheltering herif she was still alivehad been persuaded not to betray her whereabouts without doubt for all efforts to find trace of her had failed  did alonzo give her up not he he said to himself she will sing that sweet song when she is sad i shall find her so he took his carpetsack and a portable telephone and shook the snow of his native city from his arctics and went forth into the world he wandered far and wide and in many states time and again strangers were astounded to see a wasted pale and woeworn man laboriously climb a telegraphpole in wintry and lonely places perch sadly there an hour with his ear at a little box then come sighing down and wander wearily away sometimes they shot at him as peasants do at aeronauts thinking him mad and dangerous thus his clothes were much shredded by bullets and his person grievously lacerated but he bore it all patiently  in the beginning of his pilgrimage he used often to say ah if i could but hear the sweet byandby but toward the end of it he used to shed tears of anguish and say ah if i could but hear something else  thus a month and three weeks drifted by and at last some humane people seized him and confined him in a private madhouse in new york he made no moan for his strength was all gone and with it all heart and all hope the superintendent in pity gave up his own comfortable parlor and bedchamber to him and nursed him with affectionate devotion  at the end of a week the patient was able to leave his bed for the first time he was lying comfortably pillowed on a sofa listening to the plaintive miserere of the bleak march winds and the muffled sound of tramping feet in the street below for it was about six in the evening and new york was going home from work he had a bright fire and the added cheer of a couple of studentlamps so it was warm and snug within though bleak and raw without it was light and bright within though outside it was as dark and dreary as if the world had been lit with hartford gas alonzo smiled feebly to think how his loving vagaries had made him a maniac in the eyes of the world and was proceeding to pursue his line of thought further when a faint sweet strain the very ghost of sound so remote and attenuated it seemed struck upon his ear his pulses stood still he listened with parted lips and bated breath the song flowed onhe waiting listening rising slowly and unconsciously from his recumbent position at last he exclaimed  it is it is she oh the divine hated notes  he dragged himself eagerly to the corner whence the sounds proceeded tore aside a curtain and discovered a telephone he bent over and as the last note died away he burst forthwith the exclamation  oh thank heaven found at last speak to me rosannah dearest the cruel mystery has been unraveled it was the villain burley who mimicked my voice and wounded you with insolent speech  there was a breathless pause a waiting age to alonzo then a faint sound came framing itself into language  oh say those precious words again alonzo  they are the truth the veritable truth my rosannah and you shall have the proof ample and abundant proof  oh alonzo stay by me leave me not for a moment let me feel that you are near me tell me we shall never be parted more oh this happy hour this blessed hour this memorable hour  we will make record of it my rosannah every year as this dear hour chimes from the clock we will celebrate it with thanksgivings all the years of our life  we will we will alonzo  four minutes after six in the evening my rosannah shall henceforth  twentythree minutes after twelve afternoon shall  why rosannah darling where are you  in honolulu sandwich islands and where are you stay by me do not leave me for a moment i cannot bear it are you at home  no dear i am in new yorka patient in the doctors hands  an agonizing shriek came buzzing to alonzos ear like the sharp buzzing of a hurt gnat it lost power in traveling five thousand miles alonzo hastened to say  calm yourself my child it is nothing already i am getting well under the sweet healing of your presence rosannah  yes alonzo oh how you terrified me say on  name the happy day rosannah  there was a little pause then a diffident small voice replied i blushbut it is with pleasure it is with happiness wouldwould you like to have it soon  this very night rosannah oh let us risk no more delays let it be nowthis very night this very moment  oh you impatient creature i have nobody here but my good old uncle a missionary for a generation and now retired from servicenobody but him and his wife i would so dearly like it if your mother and your aunt susan  our mother and our aunt susan my rosannah  yes our mother and our aunt susani am content to word it so if it pleases you i would so like to have them present  so would i suppose you telegraph aunt susan how long would it take her to come  the steamer leaves san francisco day after tomorrow the passage is eight days she would be here the 31st of march  then name the 1st of april do rosannah dear  mercy it would make us april

with all my heart  oh happiness name the hour too rosannah  i like the morning it is so blithe will eight in the morning do alonzo  the loveliest hour in the daysince it will make you mine  there was a feeble but frantic sound for some little time as if woollipped disembodied spirits were exchanging kisses then rosannah said excuse me just a moment dear i have an appointment and am called to meet it  the young girl sought a large parlor and took her place at a window which looked out upon a beautiful scene to the left one could view the charming nuuana valley fringed with its ruddy flush of tropical flowers and its plumed and graceful cocoa palms its rising foothills clothed in the shining green of lemon citron and orange groves its storied precipice beyond where the first kamehameha drove his defeated foes over to their destruction a spot that had forgotten its grim history no doubt for now it was smiling as almost always at noonday under the glowing arches of a succession of rainbows in front of the window one could see the quaint town and here and there a picturesque group of dusky natives enjoying the blistering weather and far to the right lay the restless ocean tossing its white mane in the sunshine  rosannah stood there in her filmy white raiment fanning her flushed and heated face waiting a kanaka boy clothed in a damaged blue necktie and part of a silk hat thrust his head in at the door and announced frisco haole  show him in said the girl straightening herself up and assuming a meaning dignity mr sidney algernon burley entered clad from head to heel in dazzling snowthat is to say in the lightest and whitest of irish linen he moved eagerly forward but the girl made a gesture and gave him a look which checked him suddenly she said coldly i am here as i promised i believed your assertions i yielded to your importune lies and said i would name the day i name the 1st of aprileight in the morning now go  oh my dearest if the gratitude of a lifetime  not a word spare me all sight of you all communication with you until that hour nono supplications i will have it so  when he was gone she sank exhausted in a chair for the long siege of troubles she had undergone had wasted her strength presently she said what a narrow escape if the hour appointed had been an hour earlieroh horror what an escape i have made and to think i had come to imagine i was loving this beguiling this truthless this treacherous monster oh he shall repent his villainy  let us now draw this history to a close for little more needs to be told on the 2d of the ensuing april the honolulu advertiser contained this notice       marriedin this city by telephone yesterday morningat eight      oclock by rev nathan hays assisted by rev nathaniel davis of      new

 captain hawthornes beautiful yacht tastefully decorated      was in waiting and the happy bride and her friends immediately      departed on a bridal trip to lahaina and haleakala  the new york

memorable day mr and mrs alonzo fitz clarence were buried in sweet converse concerning the pleasures of their several bridal tours when suddenly the young wife exclaimed oh lonny i forgot i did what i said i would  did you dear  indeed i did i made him the april fool and i told him so too ah it was a charming surprise there he stood sweltering in a black dresssuit with the mercury leaking out of the top of the thermometer waiting to be married you should have seen the look he gave when i whispered it in his ear ah his wickedness cost me many a heartache and many a tear but the score was all

had never seen each other until that moment  a word about the wretched burley whose wicked machinations came so near wrecking the hearts and lives of our poor young friends will be sufficient in a murderous attempt to seize a crippled and helpless artisan who he fancied had done him some small offense he fell into a caldron of boiling oil and expired before he could be extinguished     on the decay of the art of lying  essay for discussion read at a meeting of the historical and antiquarian club of hartford and offered for the thirtydollar prize now first publisheddid not take the prize  observe i do not mean to suggest that the custom of lying has suffered any decay or interruptionno for the lie as a virtue a principle is eternal the lie as a recreation a solace a refuge in time of need the fourth grace the tenth muse mans best and surest friend is immortal and cannot perish from the earth while this club remains my complaint simply concerns the decay of the art of lying no highminded man no man of right feeling can contemplate the lumbering and slovenly lying of the present day without grieving to see a noble art so prostituted in this veteran presence i naturally enter upon this scheme with diffidence it is like an old maid trying to teach nursery matters to the mothers in israel it would not become me to criticize you gentlemen who are nearly all my eldersand my superiors in this thingand so if i should here and there seem to do it i trust it will in most cases be more in a spirit of admiration than of faultfinding indeed if this finest of the fine arts had everywhere received the attention encouragement and conscientious practice and development which this club has devoted to it i should not need to utter this lament or shed a single tear i do not say this to flatter i say it in a spirit of just and appreciative recognition  it had been my intention at this point to mention names and give illustrative specimens but indications observable about me admonished me to beware of particulars and confine myself to generalities  no fact is more firmly established than that lying is a necessity of our circumstancesthe deduction that it is then a virtue goes without saying no virtue can reach its highest usefulness without careful and diligent cultivationtherefore it goes without saying that this one ought to be taught in the public schoolsat the firesideeven in the newspapers what chance has the ignorant uncultivated liar against the educated expert what chance have i against mr per against a lawyer judicious lying is what the world needs i sometimes think it were even better and safer not to lie at all than to lie injudiciously an awkward unscientific lie is often as ineffectual as the truth  now let us see what the philosophers say note that venerable proverb children and fools always speak the truth the deduction is plainadults and wise persons never speak it parkman the historian says the principle of truth may itself be carried into an absurdity in another place in the same chapter he says the saying is old that truth should not be spoken at all times and those whom a sick conscience worries into habitual violation of the maxim are imbeciles and nuisances it is strong language but true none of us could live with an habitual truthteller but thank goodness none of us has to an habitual truthteller is simply an impossible creature he does not exist he never has existed of course there are people who think they never lie but it is not soand this ignorance is one of the very things that shame our socalled civilization everybody liesevery day every hour awake asleep in his dreams in his joy in his mourning if he keeps his tongue still his hands his feet his eyes his attitude will convey deceptionand purposely even in sermonsbut that is a platitude  in a far country where i once lived the ladies used to go around paying calls under the humane and kindly pretense of wanting to see each other and when they returned home they would cry out with a glad voice saying we made sixteen calls and found fourteen of them outnot meaning that they found out anything against the fourteenno that was only a colloquial phrase to signify that they were not at homeand their manner of saying itexpressed their lively satisfaction in that fact now their pretense of wanting to see the fourteenand the other two whom they had been less lucky withwas that commonest and mildest form of lying which is sufficiently described as a deflection from the truth is it justifiable most certainly it is beautiful it is noble for its object is not to reap profit but to convey a pleasure to the sixteen the ironsouled truthmonger would plainly manifest or even utter the fact that he didnt want to see those peopleand he would be an ass and inflict a totally unnecessary pain and next those ladies in that far countrybut never mind they had a thousand pleasant ways of lying that grew out of gentle impulses and were a credit to their intelligence and an honor to their hearts let the particulars go  the men in that far country were liars every one their mere howdydo was a lie because they didnt care how you did except they were undertakers to the ordinary inquirer you lied in return for you made no conscientious diagnosis of your case but answered at random and usually missed it considerably you lied to the undertaker and said your health was failinga wholly commendable lie since it cost you nothing and pleased the other man if a stranger called and interrupted you you said with your hearty tongue im glad to see you and said with your heartier soul i wish you were with the cannibals and it was dinnertime when he went you said regretfully must you go and followed it with a call again but you did no harm for you did not deceive anybody nor inflict any hurt whereas the truth would have made you both unhappy  i think that all this courteous lying is a sweet and loving art and should be cultivated the highest perfection of politeness is only a beautiful edifice built from the base to the dome of graceful and gilded forms of charitable and unselfish lying  what i bemoan is the growing prevalence of the brutal truth let us do what we can to eradicate it an injurious truth has no merit over an injurious lie neither should ever be uttered the man who speaks an injurious truth lest his soul be not saved if he do otherwise should reflect that that sort of a soul is not strictly worth saving the man who tells a lie to help a poor devil out of trouble is one of whom the angels doubtless say lo here is an heroic soul who casts his own welfare into jeopardy to succor his neighbors let us exalt this magnanimous liar  an injurious lie is an uncommendable thing and so also and in the same degree is an injurious trutha fact which is recognized by the law of libel  among other common lies we have the silent liethe deception which one conveys by simply keeping still and concealing the truth many obstinate truthmongers indulge in this dissipation imagining that if they speak no lie they lie not at all in that far country where i once lived there was a lovely spirit a lady whose impulses were always high and pure and whose character answered to them one day i was there at dinner and remarked in a general way that we are all liars she was amazed and said not all it was before pinafores time so i did not make the response which would naturally follow in our day but frankly said yes allwe are all liars there are no exceptions she looked almost offended and said why do you include me certainly i said i think you even rank as an expert she said shsh the children  so the subject was changed in deference to the childrens presence and we went on talking about other things but as soon as the young people were out of the way the lady came warmly back to the matter and said i have made it the rule of my life to never tell a lie and i have never departed from it in a single instance i said i dont mean the least harm or disrespect but really you have been lying like smoke ever since ive been sitting here it has caused me a good deal of pain because i am not used to it she required of me an instancejust a single instance so i said  well here is the unfilled duplicate of the blank which the oakland hospital people sent to you by the hand of the sicknurse when she came here to nurse your little nephew through his dangerous illness this blank asks all manner of questions as to the conduct of that sicknurse did she ever sleep on her watch did she ever forget to give the medicine and so forth and so on you are warned to be very careful and explicit in your answers for the welfare of the service requires that the nurses be promptly fined or otherwise punished for derelictions you told me you were perfectly delighted with that nursethat she had a thousand perfections and only one fault you found you never could depend on her wrapping johnny up half sufficiently while he waited in a chilly chair for her to rearrange the warm bed you filled up the duplicate of this paper and sent it back to the hospital by the hand of the nurse how did you answer this questionwas the nurse at any time guilty of a negligence which was likely to result in the patients taking cold comeeverything is decided by a bet here in california ten dollars to ten cents you lied when you answered that question she said i didnt i left it blank just soyou have told a silent lie you have left it to be inferred that you had no fault to find in that matter she said oh was that a lie and how could i mention her one single fault and she so goodit would have been cruel i said one ought always to lie when one can do good by it your impulse was right but your judgment was crude this comes of unintelligent practice now observe the result of this inexpert deflection of yours you know mr joness willie is lying very low with scarlet fever well your recommendation was so enthusiastic that that girl is there nursing him and the wornout family have all been trustingly sound asleep for the last fourteen hours leaving their darling with full confidence in those fatal hands because you like young george washington have a reputahowever if you are not going to have anything to do i will come around tomorrow and well attend the funeral together for of course youll naturally feel a peculiar interest in willies caseas personal a one in fact as the undertaker  but that was all lost before i was halfway through she was in a carriage and making thirty miles an hour toward the jones mansion to save what was left of willie and tell all she knew about the deadly nurse all of which was unnecessary as willie wasnt sick i had been lying myself but that same day all the same she sent a line to the hospital which filled up the neglected blank and stated the facts too in the squarest possible manner  now you see this ladys fault was not in lying but only in lying injudiciously she should have told the truth there and made it up to the nurse with a fraudulent compliment further along in the paper she could have said in one respect the sicknurse is perfectionwhen she is on watch she never snores almost any little pleasant lie would have taken the sting out of that troublesome but necessary expression of the truth  lying is universalwe all do it we all must do it therefore the wise thing is for us diligently to train ourselves to lie thoughtfully judiciously to lie with a good object and not an evil one to lie for others advantage and not our own to lie healingly charitably humanely not cruelly hurtfully maliciously to lie gracefully and graciously not awkwardly and clumsily to lie firmly frankly squarely with head erect not haltingly tortuously with pusillanimous mien as being ashamed of our high calling then shall we be rid of the rank and pestilent truth that is rotting the land then shall we be great and good and beautiful and worthy dwellers in a world where even benign nature habitually lies except when she promises execrable weather thenbut i am but a new and feeble student in this gracious art i can not instruct this club  joking aside i think there is much need of wise examination into what sorts of lies are best and wholesomest to be indulged seeing we must all lie and do all lie and what sorts it may be best to avoidand this is a thing which i feel i can confidently put into the hands of this experienced cluba ripe body who may be termed in this regard and without undue flattery old masters     about magnanimousincident literature  all my life from boyhood up i have had the habit of reading a certain set of anecdotes written in the quaint vein of the worlds ingenious fabulist for the lesson they taught me and the pleasure they gave me they lay always convenient to my hand and whenever i thought meanly of my kind i turned to them and they banished that sentiment whenever i felt myself to be selfish sordid and ignoble i turned to them and they told me what to do to win back my selfrespect many times i wished that the charming anecdotes had not stopped with their happy climaxes but had continued the pleasing history of the several benefactors and beneficiaries this wish rose in my breast so persistently that at last i determined to satisfy it by seeking out the sequels of those anecdotes myself so i set about it and after great labor and tedious research accomplished my task i will lay the result before you giving you each anecdote in its turn and following it with its sequel as i gathered it through my investigations                             the grateful poodle  one day a benevolent physician who had read the books having found a stray poodle suffering from a broken leg conveyed the poor creature to his home and after setting and bandaging the injured limb gave the little outcast its liberty again and thought no more about the matter but how great was his surprise upon opening his door one morning some days later to find the grateful poodle patiently waiting there and in its company another stray dog one of whose legs by some accident had been broken the kind physician at once relieved the distressed animal nor did he forget to admire the inscrutable goodness and mercy of god who had been willing to use so humble an instrument as the poor outcast poodle for the inculcating of etc etc etc                                    sequel  the next morning the benevolent physician found the two dogs beaming with gratitude waiting at his door and with them two other dogscripples the cripples were speedily healed and the four went their way leaving the benevolent physician more overcome by pious wonder than ever the day passed the morning came there at the door sat now the four reconstructed dogs and with them four others requiring reconstruction this day also passed and another morning came and now sixteen dogs eight of them newly crippled occupied the sidewalk and the people were going around by noon the broken legs were all set but the pious wonder in the good physicians breast was beginning to get mixed with involuntary profanity the sun rose once more and exhibited thirtytwo dogs sixteen of them with broken legs occupying the sidewalk and half of the street the human spectators took up the rest of the room the cries of the wounded the songs of the healed brutes and the comments of the onlooking citizens made great and inspiring cheer but traffic was interrupted in that street the good physician hired a couple of assistant surgeons and got through his benevolent work before dark first taking the precaution to cancel his church membership so that he might express himself with the latitude which the case required  but some things have their limits when once more the morning dawned and the good physician looked out upon a massed and farreaching multitude of clamorous and beseeching dogs he said i might as well acknowledge it i have been fooled by the books they only tell the pretty part of the story and then stop fetch me the shotgun this thing has gone along far enough  he issued forth with his weapon and chanced to step upon the tail of the original poodle who promptly bit him in the leg now the great and good work which this poodle had been engaged in had engendered in him such a mighty and augmenting enthusiasm as to turn his weak head at last and drive him mad a month later when the benevolent physician lay in the deaththroes of hydrophobia he called his weeping friends about him and said  beware of the books they tell but half of the story whenever a poor wretch asks you for help and you feel a doubt as to what result may flow from your benevolence give yourself the benefit of the doubt and kill the applicant  and so saying he turned his face to the wall and gave up the ghost                            the benevolent author  a poor and young literary beginner had tried in vain to get his manuscripts accepted at last when the horrors of starvation were staring him in the face he laid his sad case before a celebrated author beseeching his counsel and assistance this generous man immediately put aside his own matters and proceeded to peruse one of the despised manuscripts having completed his kindly task he shook the poor young man cordially by the hand saying i perceive merit in this come again to me on monday at the time specified the celebrated author with a sweet smile but saying nothing spread open a magazine which was damp from the press what was the poor young mans astonishment to discover upon the printed page his own article how can i ever said he falling upon his knees and bursting into tears testify my gratitude for this noble conduct  the celebrated author was the renowned snodgrass the poor young beginner thus rescued from obscurity and starvation was the afterward equally renowned snagsby let this pleasing incident admonish us to turn a charitable ear to all beginners that need help                                    sequel  the next week snagsby was back with five rejected manuscripts the celebrated author was a little surprised because in the books the young struggler had needed but one lift apparently however he plowed through these papers removing unnecessary flowers and digging up some acres of adjectivestumps and then succeeded in getting two of the articles accepted  a week or so drifted by and the grateful snagsby arrived with another cargo the celebrated author had felt a mighty glow of satisfaction within himself the first time he had successfully befriended the poor young struggler and had compared himself with the generous people in the books with high gratification but he was beginning to suspect now that he had struck upon something fresh in the nobleepisode line his enthusiasm took a chill still he could not bear to repulse this struggling young author who clung to him with such pretty simplicity and trustfulness  well the upshot of it all was that the celebrated author presently found himself permanently freighted with the poor young beginner all his mild efforts to unload this cargo went for nothing he had to give daily counsel daily encouragement he had to keep on procuring magazine acceptances and then revamping the manuscripts to make them presentable when the young aspirant got a start at last he rode into sudden fame by describing the celebrated authors private life with such a caustic humor and such minuteness of blistering detail that the book sold a prodigious edition and broke the celebrated authors heart with mortification with his latest gasp he said alas the books deceived me they do not tell the whole story beware of the struggling young author my friends whom god sees fit to starve let not man presumptuously rescue to his own undoing                             the grateful husband  one day a lady was driving through the principal street of a great city with her little boy when the horses took fright and dashed madly away hurling the coachman from his box and leaving the occupants of the carnage paralyzed with terror but a brave youth who was driving a grocerywagon threw himself before the plunging animals and succeeded in arresting their flight at the peril of his ownthis is probably a misprintm tthe grateful lady took his number and upon arriving at her home she related the heroic act to her husband who had read the books who listened with streaming eyes to the moving recital and who after returning thanks in conjunction with his restored loved ones to him who suffereth not even a sparrow to fall to the ground unnoticed sent for the brave young person and placing a check for five hundred dollars in his hand said take this as a reward for your noble act william ferguson and if ever you shall need a friend remember that thompson mcspadden has a grateful heart let us learn from this that a good deed cannot fail to benefit the doer however humble he may be                                    sequel  william ferguson called the next week and asked mr mcspadden to use his influence to get him a higher employment he feeling capable of better things than driving a grocers wagon mr mcspadden got him an underclerkship at a good salary  presently william fergusons mother fell sick and williamwell to cut the story short mr mcspadden consented to take her into his house before long she yearned for the society of her younger children so mary and julia were admitted also and little jimmy their brother jimmy had a pocket knife and he wandered into the drawingroom with it one day alone and reduced ten thousand dollars worth of furniture to an indeterminable value in rather less than threequarters of an hour a day or two later he fell downstairs and broke his neck and seventeen of his familys relatives came to the house to attend the funeral this made them acquainted and they kept the kitchen occupied after that and likewise kept the mcspaddens busy hunting up situations of various sorts for them and hunting up more when they wore these out the old woman drank a good deal and swore a good deal but the grateful mcspaddens knew it was their duty to reform her considering what her son had done for them so they clave nobly to their generous task william came often and got decreasing sums of money and asked for higher and more lucrative employmentswhich the grateful mcspadden more or less promptly procured for him mcspadden consented also after some demur to fit william for college but when the first vacation came and the hero requested to be sent to europe for his health the persecuted mcspadden rose against the tyrant and revolted he plainly and squarely refused william fergusons mother was so astounded that she let her ginbottle drop and her profane lips refused to do their office when she recovered she said in a halfgasp is this your gratitude where would your wife and boy be now but for my son  william said is this your gratitude did i save your wifes life or not tell me that  seven relations swarmed in from the kitchen and each said and this is his gratitude  williams sisters stared bewildered and said and this is his grat but were interrupted by their mother who burst into tears and exclaimed  to think that my sainted little jimmy threw away his life in the service of such a reptile  then the pluck of the revolutionary mcspadden rose to the occasion and he replied with fervor out of my house the whole beggarly tribe of you i was beguiled by the books but shall never be beguiled againonce is sufficient for me and turning to william he shouted yes you did save my wifes life and the next man that does it shall die in his tracks  not being a clergyman i place my text at the end of my sermon instead of at the beginning here it is from mr noah brookss recollections of president lincoln in scribners monthly       j  h  hackett in his part of falstaff was an actor who gave mr      lincoln great delight  with his usual desire to signify to others      his sense of obligation mr lincoln wrote a genial little note to      the actor expressing his pleasure at witnessing his performance      mr hackett in reply sent a book of some sort perhaps it was one      of his own authorship  he also wrote several notes to the      president  one night quite late when the episode had passed out      of my mind i went to the white house in answer to a message      passing into the presidents office i noticed to my surprise      hackett sitting in the anteroom as if waiting for an audience  the      president asked me if any one was outside  on being told he said      half sadly oh i cant see him i cant see him i was in hopes he      had gone away  then he added now this just illustrates the      difficulty of having pleasant friends and acquaintances in this      place  you know how i liked hackett as an actor and how i wrote to      tell him so  he sent me that book and there i thought the matter      would end  he is a master of his place in the profession i      suppose and well fixed in it but just because we had a little      friendly correspondence such as any two men might have he wants      something  what do you suppose he wants  i could not guess and      mr lincoln added well he wants to be consul to london  oh      dear  i will observe in conclusion that the william ferguson incident occurred and within my personal knowledgethough i have changed the nature of the details to keep william from recognizing himself in it  all the readers of this article have in some sweet and gushing hour of their lives played the role of magnanimousincident hero i wish i knew how many there are among them who are willing to talk about that episode and like to be reminded of the consequences that flowed from it     punch brothers punch  will the reader please to cast his eye over the following lines and see if he can discover anything harmful in them                 conductor when you receive a fare                punch in the presence of the passenjare                a blue trip slip for an eightcent fare

punch brothers punch with care                punch in the presence of the passenjare  i came across these jingling rhymes in a newspaper a little while ago and read them a couple of times they took instant and entire possession of me all through breakfast they went waltzing through my brain and when at last i rolled up my napkin i could not tell whether i had eaten anything or not i had carefully laid out my days work the day beforethrilling tragedy in the novel which i am writing i went to my den to begin my deed of blood i took up my pen but all i could get it to say was punch in the presence of the passenjare i fought hard for an hour but it was useless my head kept humming a blue trip slip for an eightcent fare a buff trip slip for a sixcent fare and so on and so on without peace or respite the days work was ruinedi could see that plainly enough i gave up and drifted downtown and presently discovered that my feet were keeping time to that relentless jingle when i could stand it no longer i altered my step but it did no good those rhymes accommodated themselves to the new step and went on harassing me just as before i returned home and suffered all the afternoon suffered all through an unconscious and unrefreshing dinner suffered and cried and jingled all through the evening went to bed and rolled tossed and jingled right along the same as ever got up at midnight frantic and tried to read but there was nothing visible upon the whirling page except punch punch in the presence of the passenjare by sunrise i was out of my mind and everybody marveled and was distressed at the idiotic burden of my ravingspunch oh punch punch in the presence of the passenjare  two days later on saturday morning i arose a tottering wreck and went forth to fulfil an engagement with a valued friend the rev mr to walk to the talcott tower ten miles distant he stared at me but asked no questions we started mr talked talked talked as is his wont i said nothing i heard nothing at the end of a mile mr said mark are you sick i never saw a man look so haggard and worn and absentminded say something do  drearily without enthusiasm i said punch brothers punch with care punch in the presence of the passenjare  my friend eyed me blankly looked perplexed then said  i do not think i get your drift mark there does not seem to be any relevancy in what you have said certainly nothing sad and yetmaybe it was the way you said the wordsi never heard anything that sounded so pathetic what is  but i heard no more i was already far away with my pitiless heartbreaking blue trip slip for an eightcent fare buff trip slip for a sixcent fare pink trip slip for a threecent fare punch in the presence of the passenjare i do not know what occurred during the other nine miles however all of a sudden mr laid his hand on my shoulder and shouted  oh wake up wake up wake up dont sleep all day here we are at the tower man i have talked myself deaf and dumb and blind and never got a response just look at this magnificent autumn landscape look at it look at it feast your eye on it you have traveled you have seen boasted landscapes elsewhere come now deliver an honest opinion what do you say to this  i sighed wearily and murmured  a buff trip slip for a sixcent fare a pink trip slip for a threecent fare punch in the presence of the passenjare  rev mr  stood there very grave full of concern apparently and looked long at me then he said  mark there is something about this that i cannot understand those are about the same words you said before there does not seem to be anything in them and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them punch in thehow is it they go  i began at the beginning and repeated all the lines  my friends face lighted with interest he said  why what a captivating jingle it is it is almost music it flows along so nicely i have nearly caught the rhymes myself say them over just once more and then ill have them sure  i said them over then mr  said them he made one little mistake which i corrected the next time and the next he got them right now a great burden seemed to tumble from my shoulders that torturing jingle departed out of my brain and a grateful sense of rest and peace descended upon me i was lighthearted enough to sing and i did sing for half an hour straight along as we went jogging homeward then my freed tongue found blessed speech again and the pent talk of many a weary hour began to gush and flow it flowed on and on joyously jubilantly until the fountain was empty and dry as i wrung my friends hand at parting i said  havent we had a royal good time but now i remember you havent said a word for two hours come come out with something  the rev mr turned a lacklustre eye upon me drew a deep sigh and said without animation without apparent consciousness  punch brothers punch with care punch in the presence of the passenjare  a pang shot through me as i said to myself poor fellow poor fellow he has got it now  i did not see mr for two or three days after that then on tuesday evening he staggered into my presence and sank dejectedly into a seat he was pale worn he was a wreck he lifted his faded eyes to my face and said  ah mark it was a ruinous investment that i made in those heartless rhymes they have ridden me like a nightmare day and night hour after hour to this very moment since i saw you i have suffered the torments of the lost saturday evening i had a sudden call by telegraph and took the night train for boston the occasion was the death of a valued old friend who had requested that i should preach his funeral sermon i took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing the discourse but i never got beyond the opening paragraph for then the train started and the carwheels began their clack clackclackclackclack clackclackclackclackclack and right away those odious rhymes fitted themselves to that accompaniment for an hour i sat there and set a syllable of those rhymes to every separate and distinct clack the carwheels made why i was as fagged out then as if i had been chopping wood all day my skull was splitting with headache it seemed to me that i must go mad if i sat there any longer so i undressed and went to bed i stretched myself out in my berth andwell you know what the result was the thing went right along just the same clackclack clack a blue trip slip clackclackclack for an eightcent fare clackclackclack a buff trip slip clack clackclack for a sixcent fare and so on and so on and so on punch in the presence of the passenjare sleep not a single wink i was almost a lunatic when i got to boston dont ask me about the funeral i did the best i could but every solemn individual sentence was meshed and tangled and woven in and out with punch brothers punch with care punch in the presence of the passenjare and the most distressing thing was that my delivery dropped into the undulating rhythm of those pulsing rhymes and i could actually catch absentminded people nodding time to the swing of it with their stupid heads and mark you may believe it or not but before i got through the entire assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in solemn unison mourners undertaker and all the moment i had finished i fled to the anteroom in a state bordering on frenzy of course it would be my luck to find a sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the deceased there who had arrived from springfield too late to get into the church she began to sob and said  oh oh he is gone he is gone and i didnt see him before he died  yes i said he is gone he is gone he is goneoh will this suffering never cease  you loved him then oh you too loved him  loved him loved who  why my poor george my poor nephew  ohhim yesoh yes yes certainlycertainly punchpunchoh

upon mine a pregnant minute and then he said impressively  mark you do not say anything you do not offer me any hope but ah me it is just as wellit is just as well you could not do me any good the time has long gone by when words could comfort me something tells me that my tongue is doomed to wag forever to the jigger of that remorseless jingle therethere it is coming on me again a blue trip slip for an eightcent fare a buff trip slip for a  thus murmuring faint and fainter my friend sank into a peaceful trance and forgot his sufferings in a blessed respite  how did i finally save him from an asylum i took him to a neighboring university and made him discharge the burden of his persecuting rhymes into the eager ears of the poor unthinking students how is it with them now the result is too sad to tell why did i write this article it was for a worthy even a noble purpose it was to warn you reader if you should came across those merciless rhymes to avoid themavoid them as you would a pestilence     the great revolution in pitcairn  let me refresh the readers memory a little nearly a hundred years ago the crew of the british ship bounty mutinied set the captain and his officers adrift upon the open sea took possession of the ship and sailed southward they procured wives for themselves among the natives of tahiti then proceeded to a lonely little rock in midpacific called pitcairns island wrecked the vessel stripped her of everything that might be useful to a new colony and established themselves on shore pitcairns is so far removed from the track of commerce that it was many years before another vessel touched there it had always been considered an uninhabited island so when a ship did at last drop its anchor there in 1808 the captain was greatly surprised to find the place peopled although the mutineers had fought among themselves and gradually killed each other off until only two or three of the original stock remained these tragedies had not occurred before a number of children had been born so in 1808 the island had a population of twentyseven persons john adams the chief mutineer still survived and was to live many years yet as governor and patriarch of the flock from being mutineer and homicide he had turned christian and teacher and his nation of twentyseven persons was now the purest and devoutest in christendom adams had long ago hoisted the british flag and constituted his island an appanage of the british crown  today the population numbers ninety personssixteen men nineteen women twentyfive boys and thirty girlsall descendants of the mutineers all bearing the family names of those mutineers and all speaking english and english only the island stands high up out of the sea and has precipitous walls it is about threequarters of a mile long and in places is as much as half a mile wide such arable land as it affords is held by the several families according to a division made many years ago there is some live stockgoats pigs chickens and cats but no dogs and no large animals there is one church building used also as a capitol a schoolhouse and a public library the title of the governor has been for a generation or two magistrate and chief ruler in subordination to her majesty the queen of great britain it was his province to make the laws as well as execute them his office was elective everybody over seventeen years old had a voteno matter about the sex  the sole occupations of the people were farming and fishing their sole recreation religious services there has never been a shop in the island nor any money the habits and dress of the people have always been primitive and their laws simple to puerility they have lived in a deep sabbath tranquillity far from the world and its ambitions and vexations and neither knowing nor caring what was going on in the mighty empires that lie beyond their limitless ocean solitudes once in three or four years a ship touched there moved them with aged news of bloody battles devastating epidemics fallen thrones and ruined dynasties then traded them some soap and flannel for some yams and breadfruit and sailed away leaving them to retire into their peaceful dreams and pious dissipations once more  on the 8th of last september admiral de horsey commanderinchief of the british fleet in the pacific visited pitcairns island and speaks as follows in his official report to the admiralty       they have beans carrots turnips cabbages and a little maize      pineapples figtrees custardapples and oranges lemons and      cocoanuts  clothing is obtained alone from passing ships in barter      for refreshments  there are no springs on the island but as it      rains generally once a month they have plenty of water although at      times in former years they have suffered from drought  no alcoholic      liquors except for medicinal purposes are used and a drunkard is      unknown       the necessary articles required by the islanders are best shown by      those we furnished in barter for refreshments namely flannel      serge drill halfboots combs tobacco and soap  they also stand      much in need of maps and slates for their school and tools of any      kind are most acceptable  i caused them to be supplied from the      public stores with a union jack for display on the arrival of      ships and a pitsaw of which they were greatly in need  this i      trust will meet the approval of their lordships  if the munificent      people of england were only aware of the wants of this most      deserving little colony they would not long go unsupplied       divine service is held every sunday at 1030 am  and at 3 pm      in the house built and used by john adams for that purpose until he      died in 1829  it is conducted strictly in accordance with the      liturgy of the church of england by mr simon young their selected      pastor who is much respected  a bible class is held every      wednesday when all who conveniently can attend  there is also a      general meeting for prayer on the first friday in every month      family prayers are said in every house the first thing in the      morning and the last thing in the evening and no food is partaken      of without asking gods blessing before and afterward  of these      islanders religious attributes no one can speak without deep      respect  a people whose greatest pleasure and privilege is to      commune in prayer with their god and to join in hymns of praise      and who are moreover cheerful diligent and probably freer from      vice than any other community need no priest among them  now i come to a sentence in the admirals report which he dropped carelessly from his pen no doubt and never gave the matter a second thought he little imagined what a freight of tragic prophecy it bore this is the sentence       one stranger an american has settled on the islanda doubtful      acquisition  a doubtful acquisition indeed captain ormsby in the american ship hornet touched at pitcairns nearly four months after the admirals visit and from the facts which he gathered there we now know all about that american let us put these facts together in historical form the americans name was butterworth stavely as soon as he had become well acquainted with all the peopleand this took but a few days of coursehe began to ingratiate himself with them by all the arts he could command he became exceedingly popular and much looked up to for one of the first things he did was to forsake his worldly way of life and throw all his energies into religion he was always reading his bible or praying or singing hymns or asking blessings in prayer no one had such liberty as he no one could pray so long or so well  at last when he considered the time to be ripe he began secretly to sow the seeds of discontent among the people it was his deliberate purpose from the beginning to subvert the government but of course he kept that to himself for a time he used different arts with different individuals he awakened dissatisfaction in one quarter by calling attention to the shortness of the sunday services he argued that there should be three threehour services on sunday instead of only two many had secretly held this opinion before they now privately banded themselves into a party to work for it he showed certain of the women that they were not allowed sufficient voice in the prayermeetings thus another party was formed no weapon was beneath his notice he even descended to the children and awoke discontent in their breasts becauseas he discovered for themthey had not enough sundayschool this created a third party  now as the chief of these parties he found himself the strongest power in the community so he proceeded to his next movea no less important one than the impeachment of the chief magistrate james russell nickoy a man of character and ability and possessed of great wealth he being the owner of a house with a parlor to it three acres and a half of yam land and the only boat in pitcairns a whaleboat and most unfortunately a pretext for this impeachment offered itself at just the right time  one of the earliest and most precious laws of the island was the law against trespass it was held in great reverence and was regarded as the palladium of the peoples liberties about thirty years ago an important case came before the courts under this law in this wise a chicken belonging to elizabeth young aged at that time fiftyeight a daughter of john mills one of the mutineers of the bounty trespassed upon the grounds of thursday october christian aged twentynine a grandson of fletcher christian one of the mutineers christian killed the chicken according to the law christian could keep the chicken or if he preferred he could restore its remains to the owner and receive damages in produce to an amount equivalent to the waste and injury wrought by the trespasser the court records set forth that the said christian aforesaid did deliver the aforesaid remains to the said elizabeth young and did demand one bushel of yams in satisfaction of the damage done but elizabeth young considered the demand exorbitant the parties could not agree therefore christian brought suit in the courts he lost his case in the justices court at least he was awarded only a halfpeck of yams which he considered insufficient and in the nature of a defeat he appealed the case lingered several years in an ascending grade of courts and always resulted in decrees sustaining the original verdict and finally the thing got into the supreme court and there it stuck for twenty years but last summer even the supreme court managed to arrive at a decision at last once more the original verdict was sustained christian then said he was satisfied but stavely was present and whispered to him and to his lawyer suggesting as a mere form that the original law be exhibited in order to make sure that it still existed it seemed an odd idea but an ingenious one so the demand was made a messenger was sent to the magistrates house he presently returned with the tidings that it had disappeared from among the state archives  the court now pronounced its late decision void since it had been made under a law which had no actual existence  great excitement ensued immediately the news swept abroad over the whole island that the palladium of the public liberties was lostmaybe treasonably destroyed within thirty minutes almost the entire nation were in the courtroomthat is to say the church the impeachment of the chief magistrate followed upon stavelys motion the accused met his misfortune with the dignity which became his great office he did not plead or even argue he offered the simple defense that he had not meddled with the missing law that he had kept the state archives in the same candlebox that had been used as their depository from the beginning and that he was innocent of the removal or destruction of the lost document  but nothing could save him he was found guilty of misprision of treason and degraded from his office and all his property was confiscated  the lamest part of the whole shameful matter was the reason suggested by his enemies for his destruction of the law to wit that he did it to favor christian because christian was his cousin whereas stavely was the only individual in the entire nation who was not his cousin the reader must remember that all these people are the descendants of half a dozen men that the first children intermarried together and bore grandchildren to the mutineers that these grandchildren intermarried after them great and greatgreatgrandchildren intermarried so that today everybody is blood kin to everybody moreover the relationships are wonderfully even astoundingly mixed up and complicated a stranger for instance says to an islander  you speak of that young woman as your cousin a while ago you called her your aunt  well she is my aunt and my cousin too and also my stepsister my niece my fourth cousin my thirtythird cousin my fortysecond cousin my greataunt my grandmother my widowed sisterinlawand next week she will be my wife  so the charge of nepotism against the chief magistrate was weak but no matter weak or strong it suited stavely stavely was immediately elected to the vacant magistracy and oozing reform from every pore he went vigorously to work in no long time religious services raged everywhere and unceasingly by command the second prayer of the sunday morning service which had customarily endured some thirtyfive or forty minutes and had pleaded for the world first by continent and then by national and tribal detail was extended to an hour and a half and made to include supplications in behalf of the possible peoples in the several planets everybody was pleased with this everybody said now this is something like by command the usual threehour sermons were doubled in length the nation came in a body to testify their gratitude to the new magistrate the old law forbidding cooking on the sabbath was extended to the prohibition of eating also by command sundayschool was privileged to spread over into the week the joy of all classes was complete in one short month the new magistrate had become the peoples idol  the time was ripe for this mans next move he began cautiously at first to poison the public mind against england he took the chief citizens aside one by one and conversed with them on this topic presently he grew bolder and spoke out he said the nation owed it to itself to its honor to its great traditions to rise in its might and throw off this galling english yoke  but the simple islanders answered  we had not noticed that it galled how does it gall england sends a ship once in three or four years to give us soap and clothing and things which we sorely need and gratefully receive but she never troubles us she lets us go our own way  she lets you go your own way so slaves have felt and spoken in all the ages this speech shows how fallen you are how base how brutalized you have become under this grinding tyranny what has all manly pride forsaken you is liberty nothing are you content to be a mere appendage to a foreign and hateful sovereignty when you might rise up and take your rightful place in the august family of nations great free enlightened independent the minion of no sceptered master but the arbiter of your own destiny and a voice and a power in decreeing the destinies of your sistersovereignties of the world  speeches like this produced an effect byandby citizens began to feel the english yoke they did not know exactly how or whereabouts they felt it but they were perfectly certain they did feel it they got to grumbling a good deal and chafing under their chains and longing for relief and release they presently fell to hating the english flag that sign and symbol of their nations degradation they ceased to glance up at it as they passed the capitol but averted their eyes and grated their teeth and one morning when it was found trampled into the mud at the foot of the staff they left it there and no man put his hand to it to hoist it again a certain thing which was sure to happen sooner or later happened now some of the chief citizens went to the magistrate by night and said  we can endure this hated tyranny no longer how can we cast it off  by a coup detat  how  a coup detat it is like this everything is got ready and at the appointed moment i as the official head of the nation publicly and solemnly proclaim its independence and absolve it from allegiance to any and all other powers whatsoever  that sounds simple and easy we can do that right away then what will be the next thing to do  seize all the defenses and public properties of all kinds establish martial law put the army and navy on a war footing and proclaim the empire  this fine program dazzled these innocents they said  this is grandthis is splendid but will not england resist  let her this rock is a gibraltar  true but about the empire do we need an empire and an emperor  what you need my friends is unification look at germany look at italy they are unified unification is the thing it makes living dear that constitutes progress we must have a standing army and a navy taxes follow as a matter of course all these things summed up make grandeur with unification and grandeur what more can you want very wellonly the empire can confer these boons  so on the 8th day of december pitcairns island was proclaimed a free and independent nation and on the same day the solemn coronation of butterworth i emperor of pitcairns island took place amid great rejoicings and festivities the entire nation with the exception of fourteen persons mainly little children marched past the throne in single file with banners and music the procession being upward of ninety feet long and some said it was as much as threequarters of a minute passing a given point nothing like it had ever been seen in the history of the island before public enthusiasm was measureless  now straightway imperial reforms began orders of nobility were instituted a minister of the navy was appointed and the whaleboat put in commission a minister of war was created and ordered to proceed at once with the formation of a standing army a first lord of the treasury was named and commanded to get up a taxation scheme and also open negotiations for treaties offensive defensive and commercial with foreign powers some generals and admirals were appointed also some chamberlains some equerries in waiting and some lords of the bedchamber  at this point all the material was used up the grand duke of galilee minister of war complained that all the sixteen grown men in the empire had been given great offices and consequently would not consent to serve in the ranks wherefore his standing army was at a standstill the marquis of ararat minister of the navy made a similar complaint he said he was willing to steer the whaleboat himself but he must have somebody to man her  the emperor did the best he could in the circumstances he took all the boys above the age of ten years away from their mothers and pressed them into the army thus constructing a corps of seventeen privates officered by one lieutenantgeneral and two majorgenerals this pleased the minister of war but procured the enmity of all the mothers in the land for they said their precious ones must now find bloody graves in the fields of war and he would be answerable for it some of the more heartbroken and unappeasable among them lay constantly wait for the emperor and threw yams at him unmindful of the bodyguard  on account of the extreme scarcity of material it was found necessary to require the duke of bethany postmastergeneral to pull strokeoar in the navy and thus sit in the rear of a noble of lower degree namely viscount canaan lordjustice of the common pleas this turned the duke of bethany into tolerably open malcontent and a secret conspiratora thing which the emperor foresaw but could not help  things went from bad to worse the emperor raised nancy peters to the peerage on one day and married her the next notwithstanding for reasons of state the cabinet had strenuously advised him to marry emmeline eldest daughter of the archbishop of bethlehem this caused trouble in a powerful quarterthe church the new empress secured the support and friendship of twothirds of the thirtysix grown women in the nation by absorbing them into her court as maids of honor but this made deadly enemies of the remaining twelve the families of the maids of honor soon began to rebel because there was nobody at home to keep house the twelve snubbed women refused to enter the imperial kitchen as servants so the empress had to require the countess of jericho and other great court dames to fetch water sweep the palace and perform other menial and equally distasteful services this made bad blood in that department  everybody fell to complaining that the taxes levied for the support of the army the navy and the rest of the imperial establishment were intolerably burdensome and were reducing the nation to beggary the emperors replylooklook at germany look at italy are you better than they and havent you unificationdid not satisfy them they said people cant eat unification and we are starving agriculture has ceased everybody is in the army everybody is in the navy everybody is in the public service standing around in a uniform with nothing whatever to do nothing to eat and nobody to till the fields  look at germany look at italy it is the same there such is unification and theres no other way to get itno other way to keep it after youve got it said the poor emperor always  but the grumblers only replied we cant stand the taxeswe cant stand them  now right on top of this the cabinet reported a national debt amounting to upward of fortyfive dollarshalf a dollar to every individual in the nation and they proposed to fund something they had heard that this was always done in such emergencies they proposed duties on exports also on imports and they wanted to issue bonds also paper money redeemable in yams and cabbages in fifty years they said the pay of the army and of the navy and of the whole governmental machine was far in arrears and unless something was done and done immediately national bankruptcy must ensue and possibly insurrection and revolution the emperor at once resolved upon a highhanded measure and one of a nature never before heard of in pitcairns island he went in state to the church on sunday morning with the army at his back and commanded the minister of the treasury to take up a collection  that was the feather that broke the camels back first one citizen and then another rose and refused to submit to this unheardof outrageand each refusal was followed by the immediate confiscation of the malcontents property this vigor soon stopped the refusals and the collection proceeded amid a sullen and ominous silence as the emperor withdrew with the troops he said i will teach you who is master here several persons shouted down with unification they were at once arrested and torn from the arms of their weeping friends by the soldiery  but in the mean time as any prophet might have foreseen a social democrat had been developed as the emperor stepped into the gilded imperial wheelbarrow at the church door the social democrat stabbed at him fifteen or sixteen times with a harpoon but fortunately with such a peculiarly social democratic unprecision of aim as to do no damage  that very night the convulsion came the nation rose as one manthough fortynine of the revolutionists were of the other sex the infantry threw down their pitchforks the artillery cast aside their cocoanuts the navy revolted the emperor was seized and bound hand and foot in his palace he was very much depressed he said  i freed you from a grinding tyranny i lifted you up out of your degradation and made you a nation among nations i gave you a strong compact centralized government and more than all i gave you the blessing of blessingsunification i have done all this and my reward is hatred insult and these bonds take me do with me as you will i here resign my crown and all my dignities and gladly do i release myself from their too heavy burden for your sake i took them up for your sake i lay them down the imperial jewel is no more now bruise and defile as ye will the useless setting  by a unanimous voice the people condemned the exemperor and the social democrat to perpetual banishment from church services or to perpetual labor as galleyslaves in the whaleboatwhichever they might prefer the next day the nation assembled again and rehoisted the british flag reinstated the british tyranny reduced the nobility to the condition of commoners again and then straightway turned their diligent attention to the weeding of the ruined and neglected yam patches and the rehabilitation of the old useful industries and the old healing and solacing pieties the exemperor restored the lost trespass law and explained that he had stolen itnot to injure any one but to further his political projects therefore the nation gave the late chief magistrate his office again and also his alienated property  upon reflection the exemperor and the social democrat chose perpetual banishment from religious services in preference to perpetual labor as galleyslaves with perpetual religious services as they phrased it wherefore the people believed that the poor fellows troubles had unseated their reason and so they judged it best to confine them for the present which they did  such is the history of pitcairns doubtful acquisition     the canvassers tale  poor sadeyed stranger there was that about his humble mien his tired look his decayedgentility clothes that almost reached the mustardseed of charity that still remained remote and lonely in the empty vastness of my heart notwithstanding i observed a portfolio under his arm and said to myself behold providence hath delivered his servant into the hands of another canvasser  well these people always get one interested before i well knew how it came about this one was telling me his history and i was all attention and sympathy he told it something like this  my parents died alas when i was a little sinless child my uncle ithuriel took me to his heart and reared me as his own he was my only relative in the wide world but he was good and rich and generous he reared me in the lap of luxury i knew no want that money could satisfy  in the fullness of time i was graduated and went with two of my servantsmy chamberlain and my valetto travel in foreign countries during four years i flitted upon careless wing amid the beauteous gardens of the distant strand if you will permit this form of speech in one whose tongue was ever attuned to poesy and indeed i so speak with confidence as one unto his kind for i perceive by your eyes that you too sir are gifted with the divine inflation in those far lands i reveled in the ambrosial food that fructifies the soul the mind the heart but of all things that which most appealed to my inborn esthetic taste was the prevailing custom there among the rich of making collections of elegant and costly rarities dainty objets de vertu and in an evil hour i tried to uplift my uncle ithuriel to a plane of sympathy with this exquisite employment  i wrote and told him of one gentlemans vast collection of shells anothers noble collection of meerschaum pipes anothers elevating and refining collection of undecipherable autographs anothers priceless collection of old china anothers enchanting collection of postagestampsand so forth and so on soon my letters yielded fruit my uncle began to look about for something to make a collection of you may know perhaps how fleetly a taste like this dilates his soon became a raging fever though i knew it not he began to neglect his great pork business presently he wholly retired and turned an elegant leisure into a rabid search for curious things his wealth was vast and he spared it not first he tried cowbells he made a collection which filled five large salons and comprehended all the different sorts of cowbells that ever had been contrived save one that onean antique and the only specimen extantwas possessed by another collector my uncle offered enormous sums for it but the gentleman would not sell doubtless you know what necessarily resulted a true collector attaches no value to a collection that is not complete his great heart breaks he sells his hoard he turns his mind to some field that seems unoccupied  thus did my uncle he next tried brickbats after piling up a vast and intensely interesting collection the former difficulty supervened his great heart broke again he sold out his souls idol to the retired brewer who possessed the missing brick then he tried flint hatchets and other implements of primeval man but by and by discovered that the factory where they were made was supplying other collectors as well as himself he tried aztec inscriptions and stuffed whalesanother failure after incredible labor and expense when his collection seemed at last perfect a stuffed whale arrived from greenland and an aztec inscription from the cundurango regions of central america that made all former specimens insignificant my uncle hastened to secure these noble gems he got the stuffed whale but another collector got the inscription a real cundurango as possibly you know is a possession of such supreme value that when once a collector gets it he will rather part with his family than with it so my uncle sold out and saw his darlings go forth never more to return and his coalblack hair turned white as snow in a single night  now he waited and thought he knew another disappointment might kill him he was resolved that he would choose things next time that no other man was collecting he carefully made up his mind and once more entered the fieldthis time to make a collection of echoes  of what said i  echoes sir his first purchase was an echo in georgia that repeated four times his next was a sixrepeater in maryland his next was a thirteenrepeater in maine his next was a ninerepeater in kansas his next was a twelverepeater in tennessee which he got cheap so to speak because it was out of repair a portion of the crag which reflected it having tumbled down he believed he could repair it at a cost of a few thousand dollars and by increasing the elevation with masonry treble the repeating capacity but the architect who undertook the job had never built an echo before and so he utterly spoiled this one before he meddled with it it used to talk back like a motherinlaw but now it was only fit for the deafanddumb asylum well next he bought a lot of cheap little doublebarreled echoes scattered around over various states and territories he got them at twenty per cent off by taking the lot next he bought a perfect gatlinggun of an echo in oregon and it cost a fortune i can tell you you may know sir that in the echo market the scale of prices is cumulative like the caratscale in diamonds in fact the same phraseology is used a singlecarat echo is worth but ten dollars over and above the value of the land it is on a twocarat or doublebarreled echo is worth thirty dollars a fivecarat is worth nine hundred and fifty a tencarat is worth thirteen thousand my uncles oregonecho which he called the great pitt echo was a twentytwo carat gem and cost two hundred and sixteen thousand dollarsthey threw the land in for it was four hundred miles from a settlement  well in the mean time my path was a path of roses i was the accepted suitor of the only and lovely daughter of an english earl and was beloved to distraction in that dear presence i swam in seas of bliss the family were content for it was known that i was sole heir to an uncle held to be worth five millions of dollars however none of us knew that my uncle had become a collector at least in anything more than a small way for esthetic amusement  now gathered the clouds above my unconscious head that divine echo since known throughout the world as the great kohinoor or mountain of repetitions was discovered it was a sixtyfive carat gem you could utter a word and it would talk back at you for fifteen minutes when the day was otherwise quiet but behold another fact came to light at the same time another echocollector was in the field the two rushed to make the peerless purchase the property consisted of a couple of small hills with a shallow swale between out yonder among the back settlements of new york state both men arrived on the ground at the same time and neither knew the other was there the echo was not all owned by one man a person by the name of williamson bolivar jarvis owned the east hill and a person by the name of harbison j bledso owned the west hill the swale between was the dividingline so while my uncle was buying jarviss hill for three million two hundred and eightyfive thousand dollars the other party was buying bledsos hill for a shade over three million  now do you perceive the natural result why the noblest collection of echoes on earth was forever and ever incomplete since it possessed but the onehalf of the king echo of the universe neither man was content with this divided ownership yet neither would sell to the other there were jawings bickerings heartburnings and at last that other collector with a malignity which only a collector can ever feel toward a man and a brother proceeded to cut down his hill  you see as long as he could not have the echo he was resolved that nobody should have it he would remove his hill and then there would be nothing to reflect my uncles echo my uncle remonstrated with him but the man said i own one end of this echo i choose to kill my end you must take care of your own end yourself  well my uncle got an injunction put on him the other man appealed and fought it in a higher court they carried it on up clear to the supreme court of the united states it made no end of trouble there two of the judges believed that an echo was personal property because it was impalpable to sight and touch and yet was purchasable salable and consequently taxable two others believed that an echo was real estate because it was manifestly attached to the land and was not removable from place to place other of the judges contended that an echo was not property at all  it was finally decided that the echo was property that the hills were property that the two men were separate and independent owners of the two hills but tenants in common in the echo therefore defendant was at full liberty to cut down his hill since it belonged solely to him but must give bonds in three million dollars as indemnity for damages which might result to my uncles half of the echo this decision also debarred my uncle from using defendants hill to reflect his part of the echo without defendants consent he must use only his own hill if his part of the echo would not go under these circumstances it was sad of course but the court could find no remedy the court also debarred defendant from using my uncles hill to reflect his end of the echo without consent you see the grand result neither man would give consent and so that astonishing and most noble echo had to cease from its great powers and since that day that magnificent property is tied up and unsalable  a week before my weddingday while i was still swimming in bliss and the nobility were gathering from far and near to honor our espousals came news of my uncles death and also a copy of his will making me his sole heir he was gone alas my dear benefactor was no more the thought surcharges my heart even at this remote day i handed the will to the earl i could not read it for the blinding tears the earl read it then he sternly said sir do you call this wealthbut doubtless you do in your inflated country sir you are left sole heir to a vast collection of echoesif a thing can be called a collection that is scattered far and wide over the huge length and breadth of the american continent sir this is not all you are head and ears in debt there is not an echo in the lot but has a mortgage on it sir i am not a hard man but i must look to my childs interest if you had but one echo which you could honestly call your own if you had but one echo which was free from incumbrance so that you could retire to it with my child and by humble painstaking industry cultivate and improve it and thus wrest from it a maintenance i would not say you nay but i cannot marry my child to a beggar leave his side my darling go sir take your mortgageridden echoes and quit my sight forever  my noble celestine clung to me in tears with loving arms and swore she would willingly nay gladly marry me though i had not an echo in the world but it could not be we were torn asunder she to pine and die within the twelvemonth i to toil lifes long journey sad and alone praying daily hourly for that release which shall join us together again in that dear realm where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest now sir if you will be so kind as to look at these maps and plans in my portfolio i am sure i can sell you an echo for less money than any man in the trade now this one which cost my uncle ten dollars thirty years ago and is one of the sweetest things in texas i will let you have for  let me interrupt you i said my friend i have not had a moments respite from canvassers this day i have bought a sewingmachine which i did not want i have bought a map which is mistaken in all its details i have bought a clock which will not go i have bought a moth poison which the moths prefer to any other beverage i have bought no end of useless inventions and now i have had enough of this foolishness i would not have one of your echoes if you were even to give it to me i would not let it stay on the place i always hate a man that tries to sell me echoes you see this gun now take your collection and move on let us not have bloodshed  but he only smiled a sad sweet smile and got out some more diagrams you know the result perfectly well because you know that when you have once opened the door to a canvasser the trouble is done and you have got to suffer defeat  i compromised with this man at the end of an intolerable hour i bought two doublebarreled echoes in good condition and he threw in another which he said was not salable because it only spoke german he said she was a perfect polyglot once but somehow her palate got down     an encounter with an interviewer  the nervous dapper peart young man took the chair i offered him and said he was connected with the daily thunderstorm and added  hoping its no harm ive come to interview you  come to what  interview you  ah i see yesyes um yesyes  i was not feeling bright that morning indeed my powers seemed a bit under a cloud however i went to the bookcase and when i had been looking six or seven minutes i found i was obliged to refer to the young man i said  how do you spell it  spell what  interview  oh my goodness what do you want to spell it for  i dont want to spell it i want to see what it means  well this is astonishing i must say i can tell you what it means if youif you  oh all right that will answer and much obliged to you too  in in ter

pardon i mean no harm in the world but you do not look asasintelligent as i had expected you would no harmi mean no harm at all  oh dont mention it it has often been said and by people who would not flatter and who could have no inducement to flatter that i am quite remarkable in that way yesyes they always speak of it with rapture  i can easily imagine it but about this interview you know it is the custom now to interview any man who has become notorious  indeed i had not heard of it before it must be very interesting what do you do it with  ah wellwellwellthis is disheartening it ought to be done with a club in some cases but customarily it consists in the interviewer asking questions and the interviewed answering them it is all the rage now will you let me ask you certain questions calculated to bring out the salient points of your public and private history  oh with pleasurewith pleasure i have a very bad memory but i hope you will not mind that that is to say it is an irregular memorysingularly irregular sometimes it goes in a gallop and then again it will be as much as a fortnight passing a given point this is a great grief to me  oh it is no matter so you will

you consider the most remarkable man you ever met  a aaron burr  q but you never could have met aaron burr if you are only nineteen years  a now if you know more about me than i do what do you ask me for  q well it was only a suggestion nothing more how did you happen to meet burr  a well i happened to be at his funeral one day and he asked me to make less noise and  q but good heavens if you were at his funeral he must have been dead and if he was dead how could he care whether you made a noise or not  a i dont know he was always a particular kind of a man that way  q still i dont understand it at all you say he spoke to you and that he was dead  a i didnt say he was dead  q but wasnt he dead  a well some said he was some said he wasnt  q what did you think  a oh it was none of my business it wasnt any of my funeral  q did youhowever we can never get this matter straight let me ask about something else what was the date of your birth  a monday october 31 1693  q what impossible that would make you a hundred and eighty years old how do you account for that  a i dont account for it at all  q but you said at first you were only nineteen and now you make yourself out to be one hundred and eighty it is an awful discrepancy  a why have you noticed that shaking hands many a time it has seemed to me like a discrepancy but somehow i couldnt make up my mind how quick you notice a thing  q thank you for the compliment as far as it goes had you or have you any brothers or sisters  a eh iii think soyesbut i dont remember  q well that is the most extraordinary statement i ever heard  a why what makes you think that  q how could i think otherwise why look here who is this a picture of on the wall isnt that a brother of yours  a oh yes yes yes now you remind me of it that was a brother of mine thats williambill we called him poor old bill  q why is he dead then  a ah well i suppose so we never could tell there was a great mystery about it  q that is sad very sad he disappeared then  a well yes in a sort of general way we buried him  q buried him buried him without knowing whether he was dead or not  a oh no not that he was dead enough  q well i confess that i cant understand this if you buried him and you knew he was dead  a no no we only thought he was  q oh i see he came to life again  a i bet he didnt  q well i never heard anything like this somebody was dead somebody was buried now where was the mystery  a ah thats just it thats it exactly you see we were twinsdefunct and iand we got mixed in the bathtub when we were only two weeks old and one of us was drowned but we didnt know which some think it was bill some think it was me  q well that is remarkable what do you think  a goodness knows i would give whole worlds to know this solemn this awful mystery has cast a gloom over my whole life but i will tell you a secret now which i never have revealed to any creature before one of us had a peculiar marka large mole on the back of his left hand that was me that child was the one that was drowned  q very well then i dont see that there is any mystery about it after all  a you dont well i do anyway i dont see how they could ever have been such a blundering lot as to go and bury the wrong child but shdont mention it where the family can hear of it heaven knows they have heartbreaking troubles enough without adding this  q well i believe i have got material enough for the present and i am very much obliged to you for the pains you have taken but i was a good deal interested in that account of aaron burrs funeral would you mind telling me what particular circumstance it was that made you think burr was such a remarkable man  a oh it was a mere trifle not one man in fifty would have noticed it at all when the sermon was over and the procession all ready to start for the cemetery and the body all arranged nice in the hearse he said he wanted to take a last look at the scenery and so he got up and rode with the driver  then the young man reverently withdrew he was very pleasant company and i was sorry to see him go     paris notes       crowded out of a tramp abroad to make room for more      vital statisticsm t  the parisian travels but little he knows no language but his own reads no literature but his own and consequently he is pretty narrow and pretty selfsufficient however let us not be too sweeping there are frenchmen who know languages not their own these are the waiters among the rest they know english that is they know it on the european planwhich is to say they can speak it but cant understand it they easily make themselves understood but it is next to impossible to word an english sentence in such a way as to enable them to comprehend it they think they comprehend it they pretend they do but they dont here is a conversation which i had with one of these beings i wrote it down at the time in order to have it exactly correct  i these are fine oranges where are they grown  he more yes i will bring them  i no do not bring any more i only want to know where they are fromwhere they are raised  he yes with imperturbable mien and rising inflection  i yes can you tell me what country they are from  he yes blandly with rising inflection  i disheartened they are very nice  he good night bows and retires quite satisfied with himself  that young man could have become a good english scholar by taking the right sort of pains but he was french and wouldnt do that how different is the case with our people they utilize every means that offers there are some alleged french protestants in paris and they built a nice little church on one of the great avenues that lead away from the arch of triumph and proposed to listen to the correct thing preached in the correct way there in their precious french tongue and be happy but their little game does not succeed our people are always there ahead of them sundays and take up all the room when the minister gets up to preach he finds his house full of devout foreigners each ready and waiting with his little book in his handa moroccobound testament apparently but only apparently it is mr bellowss admirable and exhaustive little frenchenglish dictionary which in look and binding and size is just like a testament and those people are there to study french the building has been nicknamed the church of the gratis french lesson  these students probably acquire more language than general information for i am told that a french sermon is like a french speechit never names a historical event but only the date of it if you are not up in dates you get left a french speech is something like this       comrades citizens brothers noble parts of the only sublime and      perfect nation let us not forget that the 21st january cast off our      chains that the 10th august relieved us of the shameful presence of      foreign spies that the 5th september was its own justification      before heaven and humanity that the 18th brumaire contained the      seeds of its own punishment that the 14th july was the mighty voice      of liberty proclaiming the resurrection the new day and inviting      the oppressed peoples of the earth to look upon the divine face of      france and live and let us here record our everlasting curse      against the man of the 2d december and declare in thunder tones      the native tones of france that but for him there had been no 17th      march in history no 12th october no 19th january no 22d april      no 16th november no 30th september no 2d july no 14th february      no 29th june no 15th august no 31st maythat but for him france      the pure the grand the peerless had had a serene and vacant      almanac today  i have heard of one french sermon which closed in this odd yet eloquent way       my hearers we have sad cause to remember the man of the 13th      january  the results of the vast crime of the 13th january have      been in just proportion to the magnitude of the set itself  but for      it there had been no 30 novembersorrowful spectacle  the grisly      deed of the 16th june had not been done but for it nor had the man      of the 16th june known existence to it alone the 3d september was      due also the fatal 12th october  shall we then be grateful for      the 13th january with its freight of death for you and me and all      that breathe  yes my friends for it gave us also that which had      never come but for it and it alonethe blessed 25th december  it may be well enough to explain though in the case of many of my readers this will hardly be necessary the man of the 13th january is adam the crime of that date was the eating of the apple the sorrowful spectacle of the 30th november was the expulsion from eden the grisly deed of the 16th june was the murder of abel the act of the 3d september was the beginning of the journey to the land of nod the 12th day of october the last mountaintops disappeared under the flood when you go to church in france you want to take your almanac with youannotated     legend of sagenfeld in germany    left out of a tramp abroad because its authenticity seemed   doubtful and could not at that time be provedm t   more than a thousand years ago this small district was a kingdoma little bit of a kingdom a sort of dainty little toy kingdom as one might say it was far removed from the jealousies strifes and turmoils of that old warlike day and so its life was a simple life its people a gentle and guileless race it lay always in a deep dream of peace a soft sabbath tranquillity there was no malice there was no envy there was no ambition consequently there were no heartburnings there was no unhappiness in the land  in the course of time the old king died and his little son hubert came to the throne the peoples love for him grew daily he was so good and so pure and so noble that by and by his love became a passion almost a worship now at his birth the soothsayers had diligently studied the stars and found something written in that shining book to this effect       in huberts fourteenth year a pregnant event will happen the animal      whose singing shall sound sweetest in huberts ear shall save      huberts life  so long as the king and the nation shall honor this      animals race for this good deed the ancient dynasty shall not fail      of an heir nor the nation know war or pestilence or poverty  but      beware an erring choice  all through the kings thirteenth year but one thing was talked of by the soothsayers the statesmen the little parliament and the general people that one thing was this how is the last sentence of the prophecy to be understood what goes before seems to mean that the saving animal will choose itself at the proper time but the closing sentence seems to mean that the king must choose beforehand and say what singer among the animals pleases him best and that if he choose wisely the chosen animal will save his life his dynasty his people but that if he should make an erring choicebeware  by the end of the year there were as many opinions about this matter as there had been in the beginning but a majority of the wise and the simple were agreed that the safest plan would be for the little king to make choice beforehand and the earlier the better so an edict was sent forth commanding all persons who owned singing creatures to bring them to the great hall of the palace in the morning of the first day of the new year this command was obeyed when everything was in readiness for the trial the king made his solemn entry with the great officers of the crown all clothed in their robes of state the king mounted his golden throne and prepared to give judgment but he presently said  these creatures all sing at once the noise is unendurable no one can choose in such a turmoil take them all away and bring back one at a time  this was done one sweet warbler after another charmed the young kings ear and was removed to make way for another candidate the precious minutes slipped by among so many bewitching songsters he found it hard to choose and all the harder because the promised penalty for an error was so terrible that it unsettled his judgment and made him afraid to trust his own ears he grew nervous and his face showed distress his ministers saw this for they never took their eyes from him a moment now they began to say in their hearts  he has lost couragethe cool head is gonehe will errhe and his dynasty and his people are doomed  at the end of an hour the king sat silent awhile and then said  bring back the linnet  the linnet trilled forth her jubilant music in the midst of it the king was about to uplift his scepter in sign of choice but checked himself and said  but let us be sure bring back the thrush let them sing together  the thrush was brought and the two birds poured out their marvels of song together the king wavered then his inclination began to settle and strengthenone could see it in his countenance hope budded in the hearts of the old ministers their pulses began to beat quicker the scepter began to rise slowly when there was a hideous interruption it was a sound like thisjust at the door  waw he waw he wawhewaw hewawhe  everybody was sorely startledand enraged at himself for showing it  the next instant the dearest sweetest prettiest little peasantmaid of nine years came tripping in her brown eyes glowing with childish eagerness but when she saw that august company and those angry faces she stopped and hung her head and put her poor coarse apron to her eyes nobody gave her welcome none pitied her presently she looked up timidly through her tears and said  my lord the king i pray you pardon me for i meant no wrong i have no father and no mother but i have a goat and a donkey and they are all in all to me my goat gives me the sweetest milk and when my dear good donkey brays it seems to me there is no music like to it so when my lord the kings jester said the sweetest singer among all the animals should save the crown and nation and moved me to bring him here  all the court burst into a rude laugh and the child fled away crying without trying to finish her speech the chief minister gave a private order that she and her disastrous donkey be flogged beyond the precincts of the palace and commanded to come within them no more  then the trial of the birds was resumed the two birds sang their best but the scepter lay motionless in the kings hand hope died slowly out in the breasts of all an hour went by two hours still no decision the day waned to its close and the waiting multitudes outside the palace grew crazed with anxiety and apprehension the twilight came on the shadows fell deeper and deeper the king and his court could no longer see each others faces no one spokenone called for lights the great trial had been made it had failed each and all wished to hide their faces from the light and cover up their deep trouble in their own hearts  finallyhark a rich full strain of the divinest melody streamed forth from a remote part of the hallthe nightingales voice  up shouted the king let all the bells make proclamation to the people for the choice is made and we have not erred king dynasty and nation are saved from henceforth let the nightingale be honored throughout the land forever and publish it among all the people that whosoever shall insult a nightingale or injure it shall suffer death the king hath spoken  all that little world was drunk with joy the castle and the city blazed with bonfires all night long the people danced and drank and sang and the triumphant clamor of the bells never ceased  from that day the nightingale was a sacred bird its song was heard in every house the poets wrote its praises the painters painted it its sculptured image adorned every arch and turret and fountain and public building it was even taken into the kings councils and no grave matter of state was decided until the soothsayers had laid the thing before the state nightingale and translated to the ministry what it was that the bird had sung about it  ii  the young king was very fond of the chase when the summer was come he rode forth with hawk and hound one day in a brilliant company of his nobles he got separated from them by and by in a great forest and took what he imagined a near cut to find them again but it was a mistake he rode on and on hopefully at first but with sinking courage finally twilight came on and still he was plunging through a lonely and unknown land then came a catastrophe in the dim light he forced his horse through a tangled thicket overhanging a steep and rocky declivity when horse and rider reached the bottom the former had a broken neck and the latter a broken leg the poor little king lay there suffering agonies of pain and each hour seemed a long month to him he kept his ear strained to hear any sound that might promise hope of rescue but he heard no voice no sound of horn or bay of hound so at last he gave up all hope and said let death come for come it must  just then the deep sweet song of a nightingale swept across the still wastes of the night  saved the king said saved it is the sacred bird and the prophecy is come true the gods themselves protected me from error in the choice  he could hardly contain his joy he could not word his gratitude every few moments now he thought he caught the sound of approaching succor but each time it was a disappointment no succor came the dull hours drifted on still no help camebut still the sacred bird sang on he began to have misgivings about his choice but he stifled them toward dawn the bird ceased the morning came and with it thirst and hunger but no succor the day waxed and waned at last the king cursed the nightingale  immediately the song of the thrush came from out the wood the king said in his heart this was the truebirdmy choice was falsesuccor will come now  but it did not come then he lay many hours insensible when he came to himself a linnet was singing he listened with apathy his faith was gone these birds he said can bring no help i and my house and my people are doomed he turned him about to die for he was grown very feeble from hunger and thirst and suffering and felt that his end was near in truth he wanted to die and be released from pain for long hours he lay without thought or feeling or motion then his senses returned the dawn of the third morning was breaking ah the world seemed very beautiful to those worn eyes suddenly a great longing to live rose up in the lads heart and from his soul welled a deep and fervent prayer that heaven would have mercy upon him and let him see his home and his friends once more in that instant a soft a faint a faroff sound but oh how inexpressibly sweet to his waiting ear came floating out of the distance  waw he waw he wawhewawhewawhe  that oh that song is sweeter a thousand times sweeter than the voice of the nightingale thrush or linnet for it brings not mere hope but certainty of succor and now indeed am i saved the sacred singer has chosen itself as the oracle intended the prophecy is fulfilled and my life my house and my people are redeemed the ass shall be sacred from this day  the divine music grew nearer and nearer strongerand stronger and ever sweeter and sweeter to the perishing sufferers ear down the declivity the docile little donkey wandered cropping herbage and singing as he went and when at last he saw the dead horse and the wounded king he came and snuffed at them with simple and marveling curiosity the king petted him and he knelt down as had been his wont when his little mistress desired to mount with great labor and pain the lad drew himself upon the creatures back and held himself there by aid of the generous ears the ass went singing forth from the place and carried the king to the little peasantmaids hut she gave him her pallet for a bed refreshed him with goats milk and then flew to tell the great news to the first scoutingparty of searchers she might meet  the king got well his first act was to proclaim the sacredness and inviolability of the ass his second was to add this particular ass to his cabinet and make him chief minister of the crown his third was to have all the statues and effigies of nightingales throughout his kingdom destroyed and replaced by statues and effigies of the sacred donkey and his fourth was to announce that when the little peasant maid should reach her fifteenth year he would make her his queen and he kept his word  such is the legend this explains why the moldering image of the ass adorns all these old crumbling walls and arches and it explains why during many centuries an ass was always the chief minister in that royal cabinet just as is still the case in most cabinets to this day and it also explains why in that little kingdom during many centuries all great poems all great speeches all great books all public solemnities and all royal proclamations always began with these stirring words  waw he waw hewaw he wawhe     speech on the babies  at the banquet in chicago given by the army of the tennessee to their first commander general u s grant november 1879       the fifteenth regular toast was the babiesas they comfort us in      our sorrows let us not forget them in our festivities  i like that we have not all had the good fortune to be ladies we have not all been generals or poets or statesmen but when the toast works down to the babies we stand on common ground it is a shame that for a thousand years the worlds banquets have utterly ignored the baby as if he didnt amount to anything if you will stop and think a minuteif you will go back fifty or one hundred years to your early married life and recontemplate your first babyyou will remember that he amounted to a great deal and even something over you soldiers all know that when the little fellow arrived at family headquarters you had to hand in your resignation he took entire command you became his lackey his mere bodyservant and you had to stand around too he was not a commander who made allowances for time distance weather or anything else you had to execute his order whether it was possible or not and there was only one form of marching in his manual of tactics and that was the doublequick he treated you with every sort of insolence and disrespect and the bravest of you didnt dare to say a word you could face the deathstorm at donelson and vicksburg and give back blow for blow but when he clawed your whiskers and pulled your hair and twisted your nose you had to take it when the thunders of war were sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the batteries and advanced with steady tread but when he turned on the terrors of his warwhoop you advanced in the other direction and mighty glad of the chance too when he called for soothingsyrup did you venture to throw out any side remarks about certain services being unbecoming an officer and a gentleman no you got up and got it when he ordered his papbottle and it was not warm did you talk back not you you went to work and warmed it you even descended so far in your menial office as to take a suck at that warm insipid stuff yourself to see if it was rightthree parts water to one of milk a touch of sugar to modify the colic and a drop of peppermint to kill those hiccoughs i can taste that stuff yet and how many things you learned as you went along sentimental young folks still take stock in that beautiful old saying that when the baby smiles in his sleep it is because the angels are whispering to him very pretty but too thinsimply wind on the stomach my friends if the baby proposed to take a walk at his usual hour two oclock in the morning didnt you rise up promptly and remark with a mental addition which would not improve a sundayschool book much that that was the very thing you were about to propose yourself oh you were under good discipline and as you went fluttering up and down the room in your undress uniform you not only prattled undignified babytalk but even tuned up your martial voices and tried to singrockaby baby in the treetop for instance what a spectacle for an army of the tennessee and what an affliction for the neighbors too for it is not everybody within a mile around that likes military music at three in the morning and when you had been keeping this sort of thing up two or three hours and your little velvethead intimated that nothing suited him like exercise and noise what did you do go on you simply went on until you dropped in the last ditch the idea that a baby doesnt amount to anything why one baby is just a house and a front yard full by itself one baby can furnish more business than you and your whole interior department can attend to he is enterprising irrepressible brimful of lawless activities do what you please you cant make him stay on the reservation sufficient unto the day is one baby as long as you are in your right mind dont you ever pray for twins twins amount to a permanent riot and there aint any real difference between triplets and an insurrection  yes it was high time for a toastmaster to recognize the importance of the babies think what is in store for the present crop fifty years from now we shall all be dead i trust and then this flag if it still survive and let us hope it may will be floating over a republic numbering 200000000 souls according to the settled laws of our increase our present schooner of state will have grown into a political leviathana great eastern the cradled babies of today will be on deck let them be well trained for we are going to leave a big contract on their hands among the three or four million cradles now rocking in the land are some which this nation would preserve for ages as sacred things if we could know which ones they are in one of those cradles the unconscious farragut of the future is at this moment teethingthink of itand putting in a world of dead earnest unarticulated but perfectly justifiable profanity over it too in another the future renowned astronomer is blinking at the shining milky way with but a languid interestpoor little chapand wondering what has become of that other one they call the wetnurse in another the future great historian is lyingand doubtless will continue to lie until his earthly mission is ended in another the future president is busying himself with no profounder problem of state than what the mischief has become of his hair so early and in a mighty array of other cradles there are now some 60000 future officeseekers getting ready to furnish him occasion to grapple with that same old problem a second time and in still one more cradle somewhere under the flag the future illustrious commanderinchief of the american armies is so little burdened with his approaching grandeurs and responsibilities as to be giving his whole strategic mind at this moment to trying to find out some way to get his big toe into his mouthan achievement which meaning no disrespect the illustrious guest of this evening turned his entire attention to some fiftysix years ago and if the child is but a prophecy of the man there are mighty few who will doubt that he succeeded     speech on the weather  at the new england societys seventyfirst annual dinner new york city       the next toast was the oldest inhabitantthe weather of new      england                      who can lose it and forget it                     who can have it and regret it                      be interposer twixt us twain                                     merchant of venice       to this samuel l clemens mark twain replied as follows  i reverently believe that the maker who made us all makes everything in new england but the weather i dont know who makes that but i think it must be raw apprentices in the weatherclerks factory who experiment and learn how in new england for board and clothes and then are promoted to make weather for countries that require a good article and will take their custom elsewhere if they dont get it there is a sumptuous variety about the new england weather that compels the strangers admirationand regret the weather is always doing something there always attending strictly to business always getting up new designs and trying them on the people to see how they will go but it gets through more business in spring than in any other season in the spring i have counted one hundred and thirtysix different kinds of weather inside of fourandtwenty hours it was i that made the fame and fortune of that man that had that marvelous collection of weather on exhibition at the centennial that so astounded the foreigners he was going to travel all over the world and get specimens from all the climes i said dont you do it you come to new england on a favorable spring day i told him what we could do in the way of style variety and quantity well he came and he made his collection in four days as to variety why he confessed that he got hundreds of kinds of weather that he had never heard of before and as to quantitywell after he had picked out and discarded all that was blemished in any way he not only had weather enough but weather to spare weather to hire out weather to sell to deposit weather to invest weather to give to the poor the people of new england are by nature patient and forbearing but there are some things which they will not stand every year they kill a lot of poets for writing about beautiful spring these are generally casual visitors who bring their notions of spring from somewhere else and cannot of course know how the natives feel about spring and so the first thing they know the opportunity to inquire how they feel has permanently gone by old probabilities has a mighty reputation for accurate prophecy and thoroughly well deserves it you take up the paper and observe how crisply and confidently he checks off what todays weather is going to be on the pacific down south in the middle states in the wisconsin region see him sail along in the joy and pride of his power till he gets to new england and then see his tail drop he doesnt know what the weather is going to be in new england well he mulls over it and by and by he gets out something about like this probable northeast to southwest winds varying to the southward and westward and eastward and points between high and low barometer swapping around from place to place probable areas of rain snow hail and drought succeeded or preceded by earthquakes with thunder and lightning then he jots down this postscript from his wandering mind to cover accidents but it is possible that the program may be wholly changed in the mean time yes one of the brightest gems in the new england weather is the dazzling uncertainty of it there is only one thing certain about it you are certain there is going to be plenty of ita perfect grand review but you never can tell which end of the procession is going to move first you fix up for the drought you leave your umbrella in the house and sally out and two to one you get drowned you make up your mind that the earthquake is due you stand from under and take hold of something to steady yourself and the first thing you know you get struck by lightning these are great disappointments but they cant be helped the lightning there is peculiar it is so convincing that when it strikes a thing it doesnt leave enough of that thing behind for you to tell whetherwell youd think it was something valuable and a congressman had been there and the thunder when the thunder begins to merely tune up and scrape and saw and key up the instruments for the performance strangers say why what awful thunder you have here but when the baton is raised and the real concert begins youll find that stranger down in the cellar with his head in the ashbarrel now as to the size of the weather in new england lengthways i mean it is utterly disproportioned to the size of that little country half the time when it is packed as full as it can stick you will see that new england weather sticking out beyond the edges and projecting around hundreds and hundreds of miles over the neighboring states she cant hold a tenth part of her weather you can see cracks all about where she has strained herself trying to do it i could speak volumes about the inhuman perversity of the new england weather but i will give but a single specimen i like to hear rain on a tin roof so i covered part of my roof with tin with an eye to that luxury well sir do you think it ever rains on that tin no sir skips it every time mind in this speech i have been trying merely to do honor to the new england weatherno language could do it justice but after all there is at least one or two things about that weather or if you please effects produced by it which we residents would not like to part with if we hadnt our bewitching autumn foliage we should still have to credit the weather with one feature which compensates for all its bullying vagariesthe icestorm when a leafless tree is clothed with ice from the bottom to the topice that is as bright and clear as crystal when every bough and twig is strung with icebeads frozen dewdrops and the whole tree sparkles cold and white like the shah of persias diamond plume then the wind waves the branches and the sun comes out and turns all those myriads of beads and drops to prisms that glow and burn and flash with all manner of colored fires which change and change again with inconceivable rapidity from blue to red from red to green and green to goldthe tree becomes a spraying fountain a very explosion of dazzling jewels and it stands there the acme the climax the supremest possibility in art or nature of bewildering intoxicating intolerable magnificence one cannot make the words too strong     concerning the american language   being part of a chapter which was      crowded out of a tramp abroadmt   there was as englishman in our compartment and he complimented me onon what but you would never guess he complimented me on my english he said americans in general did not speak the english language as correctly as i did i said i was obliged to him for his compliment since i knew he meant it for one but that i was not fairly entitled to it for i did not speak english at alli only spoke american  he laughed and said it was a distinction without a difference i said no the difference was not prodigious but still it was considerable we fell into a friendly dispute over the matter i put my case as well as i could and said  the languages were identical several generations ago but our changed conditions and the spread of our people far to the south and far to the west have made many alterations in our pronunciation and have introduced new words among us and changed the meanings of many old ones english people talk through their noses we do not we say know english people say nao we say cow the briton says kaow we  oh come that is pure yankee everybody knows that  yes it is pure yankee that is true one cannot hear it in america outside of the little corner called new england which is yankee land the english themselves planted it there two hundred and fifty years ago and there it remains it has never spread but england talks through her nose yet the londoner and the backwoods newenglander pronounce know and cow alike and then the briton unconsciously satirizes himself by making fun of the yankees pronunciation  we argued this point at some length nobody won but no matter the fact remains englishmen say nao and kaow for know and cow and that is what the rustic inhabitant of a very small section of america does  you conferred your a upon new england too and there it remains it has not traveled out of the narrow limits of those six little states in all these two hundred and fifty years all england uses it new englands small populationsay four millionsuse it but we have fortyfive millions who do not use it you say glahs of wawtah so does new england at least new england says glahs america at large flattens the a and says glass of water these sounds are pleasanter than yours you may think they are not rightwell in english they are not right but in american they are you say flahsk and bahsket and jackahss we say flask basket jackasssounding the a as it is in tallow fallow and so on up to as late as 1847 mr websters dictionary had the impudence to still pronounce basket bahsket when he knew that outside of his little new england all america shortened the a and paid no attention to his english broadening of it however it called itself an english dictionary so it was proper enough that it should stick to english forms perhaps it still calls itself an english dictionary today but it has quietly ceased to pronounce basket as if it were spelt bahsket in the american language the h is respected the h is not dropped or added improperly  the same is the case in englandi mean among the educated classes of course  yes that is true but a nations language is a very large matter it is not simply a manner of speech obtaining among the educated handful the manner obtaining among the vast uneducated multitude must be considered also your uneducated masses speak english you will not deny that our uneducated masses speak american it wont be fair for you to deny that for you can see yourself that when your stableboy says it isnt the unting that urts the orse but the ammer ammer ammer on the ard ighway and our stableboy makes the same remark without suffocating a single h these two people are manifestly talking two different languages but if the signs are to be trusted even your educated classes used to drop the h they say humble now and heroic and historic etc but i judge that they used to drop those hs because your writers still keep up the fashion of putting an an before those words instead of a this is what mr darwin might call a rudimentary sign that as an was justifiable once and useful when your educated classes used to say umble and eroic and istorical correct writers of the american language do not put an before those words  the english gentleman had something to say upon this matter but never mind what he saidim not arguing his case i have him at a disadvantage now i proceeded  in england you encourage an orator by exclaiming hyaah hyaah we pronounce it heer in some sections hyer in others and so on but our whites do not say hyaah pronouncing the as like the a in ah i have heard english ladies say dont youmaking two separate and distinct words of it your mr burnand has satirized it but we always say dontchu this is much better your ladies say oh its oful nice ours say oh its awful nice we say four hundred you say foras in the word or your clergymen speak of the lawd ours of the lord yours speak of the gawds of the heathen ours of the gods of the heathen when you are exhausted you say you are knocked up we dont when you say you will do a thing directly you mean immediately in the american languagegenerally speakingthe word signifies after a little when you say clever you mean capable with us the word used to mean accommodating but i dont know what it means now your word stout means fleshy our word stout usually means strong your words gentleman and lady have a very restricted meaning with us they include the barmaid butcher burglar harlot and horsethief you say i havent got any stockings on i havent got any memory i havent got any money in my purse we usually say i havent any stockings on i havent any memory i havent any money in my purse you say out of window we always put in a the if one asks how old is that man the briton answers he will be about forty in the american language we should say he is about forty however i wont tire you sir but if i wanted to i could pile up differences here until i not only convinced you that english and american are separate languages but that when i speak my native tongue in its utmost purity an englishman cant understand me at all  i dont wish to flatter you but it is about all i can do to understand you now  that was a very pretty compliment and it put us on the pleasantest terms directlyi use the word in the english sense  later1882 esthetes in many of our schools are now beginning to teach the pupils to broaden the a and to say dont you in the elegant foreign way     rogers  this man rogers happened upon me and introduced himself at the town of  in the south of england where i stayed awhile his stepfather had married a distant relative of mine who was afterward hanged and so he seemed to think a blood relationship existed between us he came in every day and sat down and talked of all the bland serene human curiosities i ever saw i think he was the chiefest he desired to look at my new chimneypot hat i was very willing for i thought he would notice the name of the great oxford street hatter in it and respect me accordingly but he turned it about with a sort of grave compassion pointed out two or three blemishes and said that i being so recently arrived could not be expected to know where to supply myself said he would send me the address of his hatter then he said pardon me and proceeded to cut a neat circle of red tissue paper daintily notched the edges of it took the mucilage and pasted it in my hat so as to cover the manufacturers name he said no one will know now where you got it i will send you a hattip of my hatter and you can paste it over this tissue circle it was the calmest coolest thingi never admired a man so much in my life mind he did this while his own hat sat offensively near our noses on the tablean ancient extinguisher of the slouch pattern limp and shapeless with age discolored by vicissitudes of the weather and banded by an equator of bears grease that had stewed through  another time he examined my coat i had no terrors for over my tailors door was the legend by special appointment tailor to h r h the prince of wales etc i did not know at the time that the most of the tailor shops had the same sign out and that whereas it takes nine tailors to make an ordinary man it takes a hundred and fifty to make a prince he was full of compassion for my coat wrote down the address of his tailor for me did not tell me to mention my nom de plume and the tailor would put his best work on my garment as complimentary people sometimes do but said his tailor would hardly trouble himself for an unknown person unknown person when i thought i was so celebrated in englandthat was the cruelest cut but cautioned me to mention his name and it would be all right thinking to be facetious i said  but he might sit up all night and injure his health  well let him said rogers ive done enough for him for him to show some appreciation of it  i might as well have tried to disconcert a mummy with my facetiousness said rogers i get all my coats theretheyre the only coats fit to be seen in  i made one more attempt i said i wish you had brought one with youi would like to look at it  bless your heart havent i got one onthis article is morgans make  i examined it the coat had been bought readymade of a chatham street jew without any questionabout 1848 it probably cost four dollars when it was new it was ripped it was frayed it was napless and greasy i could not resist showing him where it was ripped it so affected him that i was almost sorry i had done it first he seemed plunged into a bottomless abyss of grief then he roused himself made a feint with his hands as if waving off the pity of a nation and saidwith what seemed to me a manufactured emotionno matter no matter dont mind me do not bother about it i can get another  when he was thoroughly restored so that he could examine the rip and command his feelings he said ah now he understood ithis servant must have done it while dressing him that morning  his servant there was something aweinspiring in effrontery like this  nearly every day he interested himself in some article of my clothing one would hardly have expected this sort of infatuation in a man who always wore the same suit and it a suit that seemed coeval with the conquest  it was an unworthy ambition perhaps but i did wish i could make this man admire something about me or something i didyou would have felt the same way i saw my opportunity i was about to return to london and had listed my soiled linen for the wash it made quite an imposing mountain in the corner of the roomfiftyfour pieces i hoped he would fancy it was the accumulation of a single week i took up the washlist as if to see that it was all right and then tossed it on the table with pretended forgetfulness sure enough he took it up and ran his eye along down to the grand total then he said you get off easy and laid it down again  his gloves were the saddest ruin but he told me where i could get some like them his shoes would hardly hold walnuts without leaking but he liked to put his feet up on the mantelpiece and contemplate them he wore a dim glass breastpin which he called a morphylitic diamondwhatever that may meanand said only two of them had ever been foundthe emperor of china had the other one  afterward in london it was a pleasure to me to see this fantastic vagabond come marching into the lobby of the hotel in his grandducal way for he always had some new imaginary grandeur to developthere was nothing stale about him but his clothes if he addressed me when strangers were about he always raised his voice a little and called me sir richard or general or your lordshipand when people began to stare and look deferential he would fall to inquiring in a casual way why i disappointed the duke of argyll the night before and then remind me of our engagement at the duke of westminsters for the following day i think that for the time being these things were realities to him he once came and invited me to go with him and spend the evening with the earl of warwick at his town house i said i had received no formal invitation he said that that was of no consequence the earl had no formalities for him or his friends i asked if i could go just as i was he said no that would hardly do evening dress was requisite at night in any gentlemans house he said he would wait while i dressed and then we would go to his apartments and i could take a bottle of champagne and a cigar while he dressed i was very willing to see how this enterprise would turn out so i dressed and we started to his lodgings he said if i didnt mind we would walk so we tramped some four miles through the mud and fog and finally found his apartments they consisted of a single room over a barbers shop in a back street two chairs a small table an ancient valise a washbasin and pitcher both on the floor in a corner an unmade bed a fragment of a lookingglass and a flowerpot with a perishing little rose geranium in it which he called a century plant and said it had not bloomed now for upward of two centuriesgiven to him by the late lord palmerstonbeen offered a prodigious sum for itthese were the contents of the room also a brass candlestick and a part of a candle rogers lit the candle and told me to sit down and make myself at home he said he hoped i was thirsty because he would surprise my palate with an article of champagne that seldom got into a commoners system or would i prefer sherry or port said he had port in bottles that were swathed in stratified cobwebs every stratum representing a generation and as for his cigarswell i should judge of them myself then he put his head out at the door and called  sackville no answer  hisackville no answer  now what the devil can have become of that butler i never allow a servant tooh confound that idiot hes got the keys cant get into the other rooms without the keys  i was just wondering at his intrepidity in still keeping up the delusion of the champagne and trying to imagine how he was going to get out of the difficulty  now he stopped calling sackville and began to call anglesy but anglesy didnt come he said this is the second time that that equerry has been absent without leave tomorrow ill discharge him now he began to whoop for thomas but thomas didnt answer then for theodore but no theodore replied  well i give it up said rogers the servants never expect me at this hour and so theyre all off on a lark might get along without the equerry and the page but cant have any wine or cigars without the butler and cant dress without my valet  i offered to help him dress but he would not hear of it and besides he said he would not feel comfortable unless dressed by a practised hand however he finally concluded that he was such old friends with the earl that it would not make any difference how he was dressed so we took a cab he gave the driver some directions and we started by and by we stopped before a large house and got out i never had seen this man with a collar on he now stepped under a lamp and got a venerable paper collar out of his coat pocket along with a hoary cravat and put them on he ascended the stoop and entered presently he reappeared descended rapidly and said  comequick  we hurried away and turned the corner  now were safe he said and took off his collar and cravat and returned them to his pocket  made a mighty narrow escape said he  how said i  b george the countess was there  well what of thatdont she know you  know me absolutely worships me i just did happen to catch a glimpse of her before she saw meand out i shot havent seen her for two monthsto rush in on her without any warning might have been fatal she could not have stood it i didnt know she was in townthought she was at the castle let me lean on youjust a momentthere now i am betterthank you thank you ever so much lord bless me what an escape  so i never got to call on the earl after all but i marked the house for future reference it proved to be an ordinary family hotel with about a thousand plebeians roosting in it  in most things rogers was by no means a fool in some things it was plain enough that he was a fool but he certainly did not know it he was in the deadest earnest in these matters he died at sea last summer as the earl of ramsgate
