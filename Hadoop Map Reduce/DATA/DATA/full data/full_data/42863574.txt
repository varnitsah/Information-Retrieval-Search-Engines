42863574	the awkward age  by henry james     preface  i recall with perfect ease the idea in which the awkward age had its origin but reperusal gives me pause in respect to naming it this composition as it stands makes to my visionand will have made perhaps still more to that of its readersso considerable a mass beside the germ sunk in it and still possibly distinguishable that i am halfmoved to leave my small secret undivulged i shall encounter i think in the course of this copious commentary no better example and none on behalf of which i shall venture to invite more interest of the quite incalculable tendency of a mere grain of subjectmatter to expand and develop and cover the ground when conditions happen to favour it i say all surely when i speak of the thing as planned in perfect good faith for brevity for levity for simplicity for jocosity in fine and for an accommodating irony i invoked for my protection the spirit of the lightest comedy but the awkward age was to belong in the event to a group of productions here reintroduced which have in common to their authors eyes the endearing sign that they asserted in each case an unforeseen principle of growth they were projected as small things yet had finally to be provided for as comparative monsters that is my own title for them though i should perhaps resent it if applied by another criticabove all in the case of the piece before us the careful measure of which i have just freshly taken the result of this consideration has been in the first place to render sharp for me again the interest of the whole process thus illustrated and in the second quite to place me on unexpectedly good terms with the work itself as i scan my list i encounter none the history of which embodies a greater number of curious truthsor of truths at least by which i find contemplation more enlivened the thing done and dismissed has ever at the best for the ambitious workman a trick of looking dead if not buried so that he almost throbs with ecstasy when on an anxious review the flush of life reappears it is verily on recognising that flush on a whole side of the awkward age that i brand it all but ever so tenderly as monstrouswhich is but my way of noting the quantity of finish it stows away since i speak so undauntedly when need is of the value of composition i shall not beat about the bush to claim for these pages the maximum of that advantage if such a feat be possible in this field as really taking a lesson from ones own adventure i feel i have now not failed of itto so much more demonstration of my profit than i can hope to carry through do i find myself urged thus it is that still with a remnant of selfrespect or at least of sanity one may turn to complacency one may linger with pride let my pride provoke a frown till i justify it whichthough with more matters to be noted here than i have room for i shall accordingly proceed to do  yet i must first make a brave face no doubt and present in its native humility my scant but quite ponderable germ the seed sprouted in that vast nursery of sharp appeals and concrete images which calls itself for blest convenience london it fell even into the order of the minor social phenomena with which as fruit for the observer that mightiest of the trees of suggestion bristles it was not no doubt a fine purple peach but it might pass for a round ripe plum the note one had inevitably had to take of the difference made in certain friendly houses and for certain flourishing mothers by the sometimes dreaded often delayed but never fully arrested coming to the forefront of some vague slip of a daughter for such mild revolutions as these not to ones imagination to remain mild one had had i dare say to be infinitely addicted to noticing under the rule of that secret vice or that unfair advantage at any rate the sitting downstairs from a given date of the merciless maiden previously perched aloft could easily be felt as a crisis this crisis and the sense for it in those whom it most concerns has to confess itself courageously the prime propulsive force of the awkward age such a matter might well make a scant show for a thick book and no thick book but just a quite charmingly thin one was in fact originally dreamt of for its proposed scale the little idea seemed happyhappy that is above all in having come very straight but its proposed scale was the limit of a small square canvas one had been present again and again at the exhibition i refer towhich is what i mean by the coming straight of this particular london impression yet one was and through fallibilities that after all had their sweetness so that one would on the whole rather have kept them than parted with them still capable of so false a measurement when i think indeed of those of my many false measurements that have resulted after much anguish in decent symmetries i find the whole case i profess a theme for the philosopher the little ideas one wouldnt have treated save for the design of keeping them small the developed situations that one would never with malice prepense have undertaken the long stories that had thoroughly meant to be short the short subjects that had underhandedly plotted to be long the hypocrisy of modest beginnings the audacity of misplaced middles the triumph of intentions never entertainedwith these patches as i look about i see my experience paved an experience to which nothing is wanting save i confess some grasp of its final lesson  this lesson would if operative surely provide some law for the recognition the determination in advance of the just limits and the just extent of the situation any situation that appeals and that yet by the presumable the helpful law of situations must have its reserves as well as its promises the storyteller considers it because it promises and undertakes it often just because also making out as he believes where the promise conveniently drops the promise for instance of the case i have just named the case of the account to be taken in a circle of free talk of a new and innocent a wholly unacclimatised presence as to which such accommodations have never had to come up might well have appeared as limited as it was lively and if these pages were not before us to register my illusion i should never have made a braver claim for it they themselves admonish me however in fifty interesting ways and they especially emphasise that truth of the vanity of the a priori test of what an ideemere may have to give the truth is that what a happy thought has to give depends immensely on the general turn of the mind capable of it and on the fact that its loyal entertainer cultivating fondly its possible relations and extensions the bright efflorescence latent in it but having to take other things in their order too is terribly at the mercy of his mind that organ has only to exhale in its degree a fostering tropic air in order to produce complications almost beyond reckoning the trap laid for his superficial convenience resides in the fact that though the relations of a human figure or a social occurrence are what make such objects interesting they also make them to the same tune difficult to isolate to surround with the sharp black line to frame in the square the circle the charming oval that helps any arrangement of objects to become a picture the storyteller has but to have been condemned by nature to a liberally amused and beguiled a richly sophisticated view of relations and a fine inquisitive speculative sense for them to find himself at moments flounder in a deep warm jungle these are the moments at which he recalls ruefully that the great merit of such and such a small case the merit for his particular advised use had been precisely in the smallness  i may say at once that this had seemed to me under the first flush of recognition the good mark for the pretty notion of the free circle put about by having of a sudden an ingenuous mind and a pair of limpid searching eyes to count with half the attraction was in the current actuality of the thing repeatedly right and left as i have said one had seen such a drama constituted and always to the effect of proposing to the interested view one of those questions that are of the essence of drama what will happen who suffer who not suffer what turn be determined what crisis created what issue found there had of course to be as a basis the free circle but this was material of that admirable order with which the good london never leaves its true lover and believer long unprovided one could count them on ones fingers an abundant allowance the liberal firesides beyond the wide glow of which in a comparative dimness female adolescence hovered and waited the wide glow was bright was favourable to real talk to play of mind to an explicit interest in life a due demonstration of the interest by persons i qualified to feel it all of which meant frankness and ease the perfection almost as it were of intercourse and a tone as far as possible removed from that of the nursery and the schoolroomas far as possible removed even no doubt in its appealing modernity from that of supposedly privileged scenes of conversation twenty years ago the charm was with a hundred other things in the freedomthe freedom menaced by the inevitable irruption of the ingenuous mind whereby if the freedom should be sacrificed what would truly become of the charm the charm might be figured as dear to members of the circle consciously contributing to it but it was none the less true that some sacrifice in some quarter would have to be made and what meditator worth his salt could fail to hold his breath while waiting on the event the ingenuous mind might it was true be suppressed altogether the general disconcertment averted either by some masterstroke of diplomacy or some rude simplification yet these were ugly matters and in the examples before ones eyes nothing ugly nothing harsh or crude had flourished a girl might be married off the day after her irruption or better still the day before it to remove her from the sphere of the play of mind but these were exactly not crudities and even then at the worst an interval had to be bridged the awkward age is precisely a study of one of these curtailed or extended periods of tension and apprehension an account of the manner in which the resented interference with ancient liberties came to be in a particular instance dealt with  i note once again that i had not escaped seeing it actually and traceably dealt withi admit a good deal of friendly suspense also with the nature and degree of the sacrifice left very much to ones appreciation in circles highly civilised the great things the real things the hard the cruel and even the tender things the true elements of any tension and true facts of any crisis have ever for the outsiders for the critics use to be translated into termsterms in the distinguished name of which terms for the right employment of which more than one situation of the type i glance at had struck me as all irresistibly appealing there appeared in fact at moments no end to the things they said the suggestions into which they flowered one of these latter in especial arriving at the highest intensity putting vividly before one the perfect system on which the awkward age is handled in most other european societies it threw again into relief the inveterate english trick of the so morally wellmeant and so intellectually helpless compromise we live notoriously as i suppose every age lives in an epoch of transition but it may still be said of the french for instance i assume that their social scheme absolutely provides against awkwardness that is it would be by this scheme so infinitely awkward so awkward beyond any patchingup for the hovering female young to be conceived as present at good talk that their presence is theoretically at least not permitted till their youth has been promptly corrected by marriagein which case they have ceased to be merely young the better the talk prevailing in any circle accordingly the more organised the more complete the element of precaution and exclusion talkgiving the term a wide applicationis one thing and a proper inexperience another and it has never occurred to a logical people that the interest of the greater the general need be sacrificed to that of the less the particular such sacrifices strike them as gratuitous and barbarous as cruel above all to the social intelligence also as perfectly preventable by wise arrangement nothing comes home more on the other hand to the observer of english manners than the very moderate degree in which wise arrangement in the french sense of a scientific economy has ever been invoked a fact indeed largely explaining the great interest of their incoherence their heterogeneity their wild abundance the french all analytically have conceived of fifty different proprieties meeting fifty different cases whereas the english mind less intensely at work has never conceived but of onethe grand propriety for every case it should in fairness be said of just being english as practice however has always to be a looser thing than theory so no application of that rigour has been possible in the london world without a thousand departures from the grim ideal  the american theory if i may drag it in would be i think that talk should never become better than the female young either actually or constructively present are minded to allow it that system involves as little compromise as the french it has been absolutely simple and the beauty of its success shines out in every record of our conditions of intercoursepremising always our basic assumption that the female young read the newspapers the english theory may be in itself almost as simple but different and much more complex forces have ruled the application of it so much does the goodness of talk depend on what there may be to talk about there are more things in london i think than anywhere in the world hence the charm of the dramatic struggle reflected in my book the struggle somehow to fit propriety into a smooth general case which is really all the while bristling and crumbling into fierce particular ones the circle surrounding mrs brookenham in my pages is of course nothing if not a particular even a peculiar oneand its rather vain effort the vanity the real inexpertness being precisely part of my tale is toward the courage of that condition it has cropped up in a social order where individual appreciations of propriety have not been formally allowed for in spite of their having very often quite rudely and violently and insolently rather of course than insidiously flourished so that as the matter stands rightly or wrongly nandas retarded but eventually none the less real incorporation means virtually nandas exposure it means this that is and many things besidemeans them for nanda herself and with a various intensity for the other participants in the action but what it particularly means surely is the failure of successful arrangement and the very moral sharply pointed of the fruits of compromise it is compromise that has suffered her to be in question at all and that has condemned the freedom of the circle to be selfconscious compunctious on the whole much more timid than bravethe consequent muddle if the term be not too gross representing meanwhile a great inconvenience for life but as i found myself feeling an immense promise a much greater one than on the foreign showing for the painted picture of life beyond which let me add that here immediately is a prime specimen of the way in which the obscurer the lurking relations of a motive apparently simple always in wait for their spring may by seizing their chance for it send simplicity flying poor nandas little case and her mothers and mr longdons and vanderbanks and mitchys to say nothing of that of the others has only to catch a reflected light from over the channel in order to double at once its appeal to the imagination i am considering all these matters i need scarce say only as they are concerned with that faculty with a relation not imaginative to his material the storyteller has nothing whatever to do  it exactly happened moreover that my own material here was to profit in a particular way by that extension of view my idea was to be treated with light ironyit would be light and ironical or it would be nothing so that i asked myself naturally what might be the least solemn form to give it among recognised and familiar forms the question thus at once arose what form so familiar so recognised among alert readers as that in which the ingenious and inexhaustible the charming philosophic gyp casts most of her social studies gyp had long struck me as mistress in her levity of one of the happiest of formsthe only objection to my use of which was a certain extraordinary benightedness on the part of the anglosaxon reader one had noted this reader as perverse and inconsequent in respect to the absorption of dialogueobserved the public for fiction consume it in certain connexions on the scale and with the smack of lips that mark the consumption of breadandjam by a childrens schoolfeast consume it even at the theatre so far as our theatre ever vouchsafes it and yet as flagrantly reject it when served so to speak au naturel one had seen good solid slices of fiction well endued one might surely have thought with this easiest of lubrications deplored by editor and publisher as positively not for the general gullet as known to them made adequately slick dialogue always dialogue i had seemed from far back to hear them mostly cry we cant have too much of it we cant have enough of it and no excess of it in the form of no matter what savourless dilution or what boneless dispersion ever began to injure a book so much as even the very scantest claim put in for form and substance this wisdom had always been in ones ears but it had at the same time been equally in ones eyes that really constructive dialogue dialogue organic and dramatic speaking for itself representing and embodying substance and form is among us an uncanny and abhorrent thing not to be dealt with on any terms a comedy or a tragedy may run for a thousand nights without prompting twenty persons in london or in new york to desire that view of its text which is so desired in paris as soon as a play begins to loom at all large that the number of copies of the printed piece in circulation far exceeds at last the number of performances but as with the printed piece our own public infatuated as it may be with the theatre refuses all commercethough indeed this cant but be without cynicism very much through the infirmity the piece if printed would revealso the same horror seems to attach to any typographic hint of the proscribed playbook or any insidious plea for it the immense oddity resides in the almost exclusively typographic order of the offence an english an american gyp would typographically offend and that would be the end of her there gloomed at me my warning as well as shone at me my provocation in respect to the example of this delightful writer i might emulate her since i presumptuously would but dishonour would await me if proposing to treat the different faces of my subject in the most completely instituted colloquial form i should evoke the figure and affirm the presence of participants by the repeated and prefixed name rather than by the recurrent and affixed said he and said she all i have space to go into heremuch as the funny fact i refer to might seem to invite us to dance hand in hand round itis that i was at any rate duly admonished that i took my measures accordingly and that the manner in which i took them has lived again for me ever so arrestingly so amusingly on reexamination of the book  but that i did positively and seriouslyah so seriouslyemulate the levity of gyp and by the same token of that hardiest of flowers fostered in her school m henri lavedan is a contribution to the history of the awkward age that i shall obviously have had to brace myself in order to make vivid enough to me the expression of face of any kindest of critics even moved to declare that he would never in the least have suspected it let me say at once in extenuation of the too respectful distance at which i may thus have appeared to follow my model that my first care had to be the covering of my trackslest i truly should be caught in the act of arranging of organising dialogue to speak for itself what i now see to have happened is that i organised and arranged but too welltoo well i mean for any betrayal of the gyp taint however faded and feeble the trouble appears to have been that while i on the one hand exorcised the baleful association i succeeded in rousing on nobodys part a sense of any other association whatever or of my having cast myself into any conceivable or calculable form my private inspiration had been in the gyp plan artfully dissimulated for dear life and applied with the very subtlest consistency but none the less kept in secret view yet i was to fail to make out in the event that the book succeeded in producing the impression of any plan on any person no hint of that sort of success or of any critical perception at all in relation to the business has ever come my way in spite of which when i speak as just above of what was to happen under the law of my ingenious labour i fairly lose myself in the vision of a hundred bright phenomena some of these incidents i must treat myself to naming for they are among the best i shall have on any occasion to retail but i must first give the measure of the degree in which they were mere matters of the study this composition had originally appeared in harpers weekly during the autumn of 1898 and the first weeks of the winter and the volume containing it was published that spring i had meanwhile been absent from england and it was not till my return some time later that i had from my publisher any news of our venture but the news then met at a stroke all my curiosity im sorry to say the book has done nothing to speak of ive never in all my experience seen one treated with more general and complete disrespect there was thus to be nothing left me for fond subsequent referenceof which i doubtless give even now so adequate an illustrationsave the rich reward of the singular interest attaching to the very intimacies of the effort  it comes back to me the whole job as wonderfully amusing and delightfully difficult from the first since amusement deeply abides i think in any artistic attempt the basis and groundwork of which are conscious of a particular firmness on that hard fine floor the element of execution feels it may more or less confidently dance in which case puzzling questions sharp obstacles dangers of detail may come up for it by the dozen without breaking its heart or shaking its nerve it is the difficulty produced by the loose foundation or the vague scheme that breaks the heartwhen a luckless fatuity has overpersuaded an author of the saving virtue of treatment being treated is never in a workable idea a mere passive condition and i hold no subject ever susceptible of help that isnt like the embarrassed man of our proverbial wisdom first of all able to help itself i was thus to have here an envious glimpse in carrying my design through of that artistic rage and that artistic felicity which i have ever supposed to be intensest and highest the confidence of the dramatist strong in the sense of his postulate the dramatist has verily to build is committed to architecture to construction at any cost to driving in deep his vertical supports and laying across and firmly fixing his horizontal his resting piecesat the risk of no matter what vibration from the tap of his masterhammer this makes the active value of his basis immense enabling him with his flanks protected to advance undistractedly even if not at all carelessly into the comparative fairyland of the mere minor anxiety in other words his scheme holds and as he feels this in spite of noted strains and under repeated tests so he keeps his face to the day i rejoiced by that same token to feel my scheme hold and even a little ruefully watched it give me much more than i had ventured to hope for i promptly found my conceived arrangement of my material open the door wide to ingenuity i remember that in sketching my project for the conductors of the periodical i have named i drew on a sheet of paperand possibly with an effect of the cabalistic it now comes over me that even anxious amplification may have but vainly attenuatedthe neat figure of a circle consisting of a number of small rounds disposed at equal distance about a central object the central object was my situation my subject in itself to which the thing would owe its title and the small rounds represented so many distinct lamps as i liked to call them the function of each of which would be to light with all due intensity one of its aspects i had divided it didnt they see into aspectsuncanny as the little term might sound though not for a moment did i suggest we should use it for the public and by that sign we would conquer  they saw all genially and generouslyfor i must add that i had made to the best of my recollection no morbid scruple of not blabbing about gyp and her strange incitement i the more boldly held my tongue over this that the more i by my intelligence lived in my arrangement and moved about in it the more i sank into satisfaction it was clearly to work to a charm and during this processby calling at every step for an exquisite managementto haunt to startle and waylay each of my lamps would be the light of a single social occasion in the history and intercourse of the characters concerned and would bring out to the full the latent colour of the scene in question and cause it to illustrate to the last drop its bearing on my theme i revelled in this notion of the occasion as a thing by itself really and completely a scenic thing and could scarce name it while crouching amid the thick arcana of my plan with a large enough o the beauty of the conception was in this approximation of the respective divisions of my form to the successive acts of a playas to which it was more than ever a case for charmed capitals the divine distinction of the act of a playand a greater than any other it easily succeeds in arriving atwas i reasoned in its special its guarded objectivity this objectivity in turn when achieving its ideal came from the imposed absence of that going behind to compass explanations and amplifications to drag out odds and ends from the mere storytellers great propertyshop of aids to illusion a resource under denial of which it was equally perplexing and delightful for a change to proceed everything for that matter becomes interesting from the moment it has closely to consider for full effect positively to bestride the law of its kind kinds are the very life of literature and truth and strength come from the complete recognition of them from abounding to the utmost in their respective senses and sinking deep into their consistency i myself have scarcely to plead the cause of going behind which is right and beautiful and fruitful in its place and order but as the confusion of kinds is the inelegance of letters and the stultification of values so to renounce that line utterly and do something quite different instead may become in another connexion the true course and the vehicle of effect something in the very nature in the fine rigour of this special sacrifice which is capable of affecting the formlover i think as really more of a projected form than any other lends it moreover a coercive charm a charm that grows in proportion as the appeal to it tests and stretches and strains it puts it powerfully to the touch to make the presented occasion tell all its story itself remain shut up in its own presence and yet on that patch of stakedout ground become thoroughly interesting and remain thoroughly clear is a process not remarkable no doubt so long as a very light weight is laid on it but difficult enough to challenge and inspire great adroitness so soon as the elements to be dealt with begin at all to size up  the disdainers of the contemporary drama deny obviously with all promptness that the matter to be expressed by its meansrichly and successfully expressed that iscan loom with any largeness since from the moment it does one of the conditions breaks down the process simply collapses under pressure they contend proves its weakness as quickly as the office laid on it ceases to be simple remember they say to the dramatist that you have to be supremely three things you have to be true to your form you have to be interesting you have to be clear you have in other words to prove yourself adequate to taking a heavy weight but we defy you really to conform to your conditions with any but a light one make the thing you have to convey make the picture you have to paint at all rich and complex and you cease to be clear remain clearand with the clearness required by the infantine intelligence of any public consenting to see a playand what becomes of the importance of your subject if its important by any other critical measure than the little footrule the produced piece has to conform to it is predestined to be a muddle when it has escaped being a muddle the note it has succeeded in striking at the furthest will be recognised as one of those that are called high but by the courtesy by the intellectual provinciality of theatrical criticism which as we can see for ourselves any morning iswell an abyss even deeper than the theatre itself dont attempt to crush us with dumas and ibsen for such values are from any informed and enlightened point of view that is measured by other high values literary critical philosophic of the most moderate order ibsen and dumas are precisely cases of men men in their degree in their poor theatrical straightjacket speculative who have had to renounce the finer thing for the coarser the thick in short for the thin and the curious for the selfevident what earthly intellectual distinction what prestige of achievement would have attached to the substance of such things as denise as monsieur alphonse as francillon and we take the dumas of the supposedly subtler period in any other form what virtues of the same order would have attached to the pillars of society to an enemy of the people to ghosts to rosmersholm or taking also ibsens subtler period to john gabriel borkmann to the masterbuilder ibsen is in fact wonderfully a case in point since from the moment hes clear from the moment hes amusing its on the footing of a thesis as simple and superficial as that of a dolls housewhile from the moment hes by apparent intention comprehensive and searching its on the footing of an effect as confused and obscure as the wild duck from which you easily see all the conditions cant be met the dramatist has to choose but those hes most capable of and by that choice hes known  so the objector concludes and never surely without great profit from his having been drawn his apparent triumphif it be even apparentstill leaves it will be noted convenient cover for retort in the riddled face of the opposite stronghold the last word in these cases is for nobody who cant pretend to an absolute test the terms here used obviously are matters of appreciation and there is no short cut to proof luckily for us all round either that monsieur alphonse develops itself on the highest plane of irony or that ghosts simplifies almost to excruciation if john gabriel borkmann is but a pennyworth of effect as to a character we can imagine much more amply presented and if hedda gabler makes an appeal enfeebled by remarkable vagueness there is by the nature of the case no catching the convinced or call him the deluded spectator or reader in the act of a mistake he is to be caught at the worst in the act of attention of the very greatest attention and that is all as a precious preliminary at least that the playwright asks of him besides being all the very divinest poet can get i remember rejoicing as much to remark this after getting launched in the awkward age as if i were in fact constructing a playjust as i may doubtless appear now not less anxious to keep the philosophy of the dramatists course before me than if i belonged to his order i felt certainly the support he feels i participated in his technical amusement i tasted to the full the bittersweetness of his draughtthe beauty and the difficulty to harp again on that string of escaping poverty even though the references in ones action can only be with intensity to each other to things exactly on the same plane of exhibition with themselves exhibition may mean in a story twenty different ways fifty excursions alternatives excrescences and the novel as largely practised in english is the perfect paradise of the loose end the play consents to the logic of but one way mathematically right and with the loose end as gross an impertinence on its surface and as grave a dishonour as the dangle of a snippet of silk or wool on the right side of a tapestry we are shut up wholly to crossrelations relations all within the action itself no part of which is related to anything but some other partsave of course by the relation of the total to life and after invoking the protection of gyp i saw the point of my game all in the problem of keeping these conditioned relations crystalline at the same time that i should in emulation of life consent to their being numerous and fine and characteristic of the london world as the london world was in this quarter and that to be deciphered all of which was to make in the event for complications  i see now of course how far with my complications i got away from gyp but i see today so much else too that this particular deflexion from simplicity makes scarce a figure among the others after having once served its purpose i mean of lighting my original imitative innocence for i recognise in especial with a waking vibration of that interest in which as i say the plan of the book is embalmed for me that my subject was probably condemned in advance to appreciable or more exactly perhaps to almost preposterously appreciative overtreatment it places itself for me thus in a group of small productions exhibiting this perversity representations of conceived cases in which my process has been to pump the case gaspingly dry dry not only of superfluous moisture but absolutely for i have encountered the charge of breathable air i may note in fine that coming back to the pages before us with a strong impression of their recording to my shame that disaster even to the extent of its disqualifying them for decent reappearance i have found the adventure taking to my relief quite another turn and have lost myself in the wonder of what overtreatment may in the detail of its desperate ingenuity consist of the revived interest i speak of has been therefore that of following critically from page to page even as the red indian tracks in the forest the paleface the footsteps of the systematic loyalty i was able to achieve the amusement of this constatation is as i have hinted in the detail of the matter and the detail is so dense the texture of the figured and smoothed tapestry so loose that the genius of gyp herself muse of general looseness would certainly once warned have uttered the first disavowal of my homage but what has occurred meanwhile is that this high consistency has itself so to speak constituted an exhibition and that an important artistic truth has seemed to me thereby lighted we brushed against that truth just now in our glance at the denial of expansibility to any idea the mould of the stageplay may hope to express without cracking and burstingand we bear in mind at the same time that the picture of nanda brookenhams situation though perhaps seeming to a careless eye so to wander and sprawl yet presents itself on absolutely scenic lines and that each of these scenes in itself and each as related to each and to all of its companions abides without a moments deflexion by the principle of the stageplay in doing this then it does moreit helps us ever so happily to see the grave distinction between substance and form in a really wrought work of art signally break down i hold it impossible to say before the awkward age where one of these elements ends and the other begins i have been unable at least myself on reexamination to mark any such joint or seam to see the two discharged offices as separate they are separate before the fact but the sacrament of execution indissolubly marries them and the marriage like any other marriage has only to be a true one for the scandal of a breach not to show the thing done artistically is a fusion or it has not been donein which case of course the artist may be and all deservedly pelted with any fragment of his botch the critic shall choose to pick up but his ground once conquered in this particular field he knows nothing of fragments and may say in all security detach one if you can you can analyse in your way oh yesto relate to report to explain but you cant disintegrate my synthesis you cant resolve the elements of my whole into different responsible agents or find your way at all for your own fell purpose my mixture has only to be perfect literally to bewilder youyou are lost in the tangle of the forest prove this value this effect in the air of the whole result to be of my subject and that other value other effect to be of my treatment prove that i havent so shaken them together as the conjurer i profess to be must consummately shake and i consent but to parade as before a booth at the fair the exemplary closeness of the awkward age even affects me on reperusal i confess as treasure quite instinctively and foreseeingly laid up against my present opportunity for these remarks i have been positively struck by the quantity of meaning and the number of intentions the extent of ground for interest as i may call it that i have succeeded in working scenically yet without loss of sharpness clearness or atmosphere into each of my illuminating occasionswhere at certain junctures the due preservation of all these values took in the familiar phrase a good deal of doing  i should have liked just here to reexamine with the reader some of the positively most artful passages i have in mindsuch as the hour of mr longdons beautiful and as it were mystic attempt at a compact with vanderbank late at night in the billiardroom of the countryhouse at which they are staying such as the other nocturnal passage under mr longdons roof between vanderbank and mitchy where the conduct of so much fine meaning so many flares of the exhibitory torch through the labyrinth of mere immediate appearances mere familiar allusions is successfully and safely effected such as the whole array of the terms of presentation that are made to serve all systematically yet without a gap anywhere for the presentation throughout of a mitchy subtle no less than concrete and concrete no less than deprived of that officious explanation which we know as going behind such as briefly the general service of coordination and vivification rendered on lines of ferocious of really quite heroic compression by the picture of the assembled group at mrs grendons where the crossreferences of the action are as thick as the green leaves of a garden but none the less as they have scenically to be counted and disposed weighted with responsibility were i minded to use in this connexion a loud wordand the critic in general hates loud words as a man of taste may hate loud coloursi should speak of the composition of the chapters entitled tishy grendon with all the pieces of the game on the table together and each unconfusedly and contributively placed as triumphantly scientific i must properly remind myself rather that the better lesson of my retrospect would seem to be really a supreme revision of the question of what it may be for a subject to suffer to call it suffering by overtreatment bowed down so long by the inference that its product had in this case proved such a betrayal my artistic conscience meets the relief of having to recognise truly here no traces of suffering the thing carries itself to my maturer and gratified sense as with every symptom of soundness an insolence of health and joy and from this precisely i deduce my moral which is to the effect that since our only way in general of knowing that we have had too much of anything is by feeling that too much so by the same token when we dont feel the excess and i am contending mind that in the awkward age the multiplicity yields to the order how do we know that the measure not recorded the notch not reached does represent adequacy or satiety the mere feeling helps us for certain degrees of congestion but for exact science that is for the criticism of fine art we want the notation the notation however is what we lack and the verdict of the mere feeling is liable to fluctuate in other words an imputed defect is never at the worst disengageable or other than matter for appreciationto come back to my claim for that felicity of the dramatists case that his synthetic whole is his form the only one we have to do with i like to profit in his company by the fact that if our art has certainly for the impression it produces to defer to the rise and fall in the critical temperature of the telltale mercury it still hasnt to reckon with the engraved thermometerface  henry james     the awkward age     book first lady julia    i  save when it happened to rain vanderbank always walked home but he usually took a hansom when the rain was moderate and adopted the preference of the philosopher when it was heavy on this occasion he therefore recognised as the servant opened the door a congruity between the weather and the fourwheeler that in the empty street under the glazed radiance waited and trickled and blackly glittered the butler mentioned it as on such a wild night the only thing they could get and vanderbank having replied that it was exactly what would do best prepared in the doorway to put up his umbrella and dash down to it at this moment he heard his name pronounced from behind and on turning found himself joined by the elderly fellow guest with whom he had talked after dinner and about whom later on upstairs he had sounded his hostess it was at present a clear question of how this amiable this apparently unassertive person should get homeof the possibility of the other cab for which even now one of the footmen with a whistle to his lips craned out his head and listened through the storm mr longdon wondered to vanderbank if their course might by any chance be the same which led our young friend immediately to express a readiness to see him safely in any direction that should accommodate him as the footmans whistle spent itself in vain they got together into the fourwheeler where at the end of a few moments more vanderbank became conscious of having proposed his own rooms as a windup to their drive wouldnt that be a better finish of the evening than just separating in the wet he liked his new acquaintance who struck him as in a manner clinging to him who was staying at an hotel presumably at that hour dismal and who confessing with easy humility to a connexion positively timid with a club at which one couldnt have a visitor accepted his invitation under pressure vanderbank when they arrived was amused at the air of added extravagance with which he said he would keep the cab he so clearly enjoyed to that extent the sense of making a night of it you young men i believe keep them for hours eh at least they did in my time he laughedthe wild ones but i think of them as all wild then i dare say that when one settles in town one learns how to manage only im afraid you know that ive got completely out of it i do feel really quite mouldy its a matter of thirty years  since youve been in london  for more than a few days at a time upon my honour you wont understand thatany more i dare say than i myself quite understand how at the end of all ive accepted this queer view of the doom of coming back but i dont doubt i shall ask you if youll be so good as to let me for the help of a hint or two as to how to do dont you know and not towhat do you fellows call itbe done now about one of these things  one of these things was the lift in which at no great pace and with much rumbling and creaking the porter conveyed the two gentlemen to the alarming eminence as mr longdon measured their flight at which vanderbank perched the impression made on him by this contrivance showed him as unsophisticated yet when his companion at the top ushering him in gave a touch to the quick light and in the pleasant ruddy room all convenience and character had before the fire another look at him it was not to catch in him any protrusive angle mr longdon was slight and neat delicate of body and both keen and kind of face with black brows finely marked and thick smooth hair in which the silver had deep shadows he wore neither whisker nor moustache and seemed to carry in the flicker of his quick brown eyes and the positive sunplay of his smile even more than the equivalent of what might superficially or stupidly elsewhere be missed in him which was mass substance presencewhat is vulgarly called importance he had indeed no presence but had somehow an effect he might almost have been a priest if priests as it occurred to vanderbank were ever such dandies he had at all events conclusively doubled the cape of the yearshe would never again see fiftyfive to the warning light of that bleak headland he presented a back sufficiently conscious yet though to vanderbank he couldnt look young he came nearstrikingly and amusinglylooking new this after a minute appeared mainly perhaps indeed in the perfection of his evening dress and the special smartness of the sleeveless overcoat he had evidently had made to wear with it and might even actually be wearing for the first time he had talked to vanderbank at mrs brookenhams about beccles and suffolk but it was not at beccles nor anywhere in the county that these ornaments had been designed his action had already been with however little purpose to present the region to his interlocutor in a favourable light vanderbank for that matter had the kind of imagination that likes to place an object even to the point of losing sight of it in the conditions he already saw the nice old nook it must have taken to keep a man of intelligence so fresh while suffering him to remain so fine the product of beccles accepted at all events a cigarettestill much as a joke and an adventureand looked about him as if even more pleased than he expected then he broke through his double eyeglass into an exclamation that was like a passing pang of envy and regret you young men you young men  well what about us vanderbanks tone encouraged the courtesy of the reference im not so young moreover as that comes to  how old are you then pray  why im thirtyfour  what do you call that im a hundred and three mr longdon at all events took out his watch its only a quarter past eleven then with a quick change of interest what did you say is your public office he enquired  the general audit im deputy chairman  dear mr longdon looked at him as if he had had fifty windows what a head you must have  oh yesour heads sir digby dence  and what do we do for you  well you gild the pillthough not perhaps very thick but its a decent berth  a thing a good many fellows would give a pound of their flesh for  vanderbanks visitor appeared so to deprecate too faint a picture that he dropped all scruples im the most envied man i knowso that if i were a shade less amiable i should be one of the most hated  mr longdon laughed yet not quite as if they were joking i see your pleasant way carries it off  vanderbank was however not serious wouldnt it carry off anything  again his friend through the pincenez appeared to crown him with a whitehall cornice i think i ought to let you know im studying you its really fair to tell you he continued with an earnestness not discomposed by the indulgence in vanderbanks face its all rightall right he reassuringly added having meanwhile stopped before a photograph suspended on the wall thats your mother he brought out with something of the elation of a child making a discovery or guessing a riddle i dont make you out in her yetin my recollection of her which as i told you is perfect but i dare say i soon shall  vanderbank was more and more aware that the kind of amusement he excited would never in the least be a bar to affection please take all your time  mr longdon looked at his watch again do you think i had better keep it  the cab vanderbank liked him so found in him such a promise of pleasant things that he was almost tempted to say dear and delightful sir dont weigh that question ill pay myself for the mans whole night his approval at all events was complete  most certainly thats the only way not to think of it  oh you young men you young men his guest again murmured he had passed on to the photographvanderbank had many too many photographsof some other relation and stood wiping the goldmounted glasses through which he had been darting admirations and catching sidelights for shocks dont talk nonsense he continued as his friend attempted once more to throw in a protest i belong to a different period of history there have been things this evening that have made me feel as if i had been disinterredliterally dug up from a long sleep i assure you there havehe really pressed the point  vanderbank wondered a moment what things in particular these might be he found himself wanting to get at everything his visitor represented to enter into his consciousness and feel as it were on his side he glanced with an intention freely sarcastic at an easy possibility the extraordinary vitality of brookenham  mr longdon with nippers in place again fixed on him a gravity that failed to prevent his discovering in the eyes behind them a shy reflexion of his irony oh brookenham you must tell me all about brookenham  i see thats not what you mean  mr longdon forbore to deny it i wonder if youll understand what i mean vanderbank bristled with the wish to be put to the test but was checked before he could say so and whats his placebrookenhams  oh rivers and lakesan awfully good thing he got it last year  mr longdonbut not too grosslywondered how did he get it  vanderbank laughed well she got it  his friend remained grave and about how much now  oh twelve hundredand lots of allowances and boats and things to do the work vanderbank still with a certain levity added  and what is the work  the young man had a pause ask him hell like to tell you  yet he seemed to have but little to say mr longdon exactly measured it again  ah not about that try him  he looked more sharply at his host as if vaguely suspicious of a trap then not less vaguely he sighed well its what i came up forto try you all but do they live on that he continued  vanderbank once more debated one doesnt quite know what they live on but theyve meansfor it was just that fact i remember that showed brookenhams getting the place wasnt a job it was given i mean not to his mere domestic need but to his notorious efficiency he has a propertyan ugly little place in gloucestershirewhich they sometimes let his elder brother has the better one but they make up an income  mr longdon for an instant lost himself yes i rememberone heard of those things at the time and she must have had something  yes indeed she had somethingand she always has her intense cleverness she knows thoroughly how they do it tremendously well  tremendously well mr longdon intelligently echoed but a house in buckingham crescent with the way they seem to have built through to all sorts of other places  oh theyre all right vanderbank soothingly dropped  one likes to feel that of people with whom one has dined there are four children his friend went on  the older boy whom you saw and who in his way is a wonder the older girl whom you must see and two youngsters male and female whom you mustnt  there might by this time in the growing interest of their talk have been almost nothing too uncanny for mr longdon to fear it you mean the youngsters areunfortunate  notheyre only like all the modern young i think mysteries terrible little baffling mysteries vanderbank had found amusement againit flickered so from his friends face that really at moments to the point of alarm his explanations deepened darkness then with more interest he harked back i know the thing you just mentionedthe thing that strikes you as odd he produced his knowledge quite with elation the talk mr longdon on this only looked at him in silence and harder but he went on with assurance yes the talkfor we do talk i think still his guest left him without relief only fixing him and his suggestion with a suspended judgement whatever the old man was on the point of saying however he disposed of in a curtailed murmur he had already turned afresh to the series of portraits and as he glanced at another vanderbank spoke afresh  it was very interesting to me to hear from you there when the ladies had left us how many old threads you were prepared to pick up  mr longdon had paused im an old boy who remembers the mothers he at last replied  yes you told me how well you remember mrs brookenhams  oh ohand he arrived at a new subject this must be your sister mary  yes its very bad but as shes dead  dead dear dear  oh long agovanderbank eased him off its delightful of you this informant went on to have known also such a lot of my people  mr longdon turned from his contemplation with a visible effort i feel obliged to you for taking it so it mightntone never knowshave amused you as i told you there the first thing i did was to ask fernanda about the company and when she mentioned your name i immediately said would he like me to speak to him  and what did fernanda say  mr longdon stared do you call her fernanda  vanderbank felt ever so much more guilty than he would have expected you think it too much in the manner we just mentioned  his friend hesitated then with a smile a trifle strange pardon me i didnt mention  no you didnt and your scruple was magnificent in point of fact vanderbank pursued i dont call mrs brookenham by her christian name  mr longdons clear eyes were searching unless in speaking of her to others he seemed really to wish to know  vanderbank was but too ready to satisfy him i dare say we seem to you a vulgar lot of people thats not the way i can see you speak of ladies at beccles  oh if you laugh at me and his visitor turned off  dont threaten me said vanderbank or i will send away the cab of course i know what you mean it will be tremendously interesting to hear how the sort of thing weve fallen intooh we have fallen instrikes your fresh your uncorrupted ear do have another cigarette sunk as i must appear to you it sometimes strikes even mine but im not sure as regards mrs brookenham whom ive known a long time  mr longdon again took him up what do you people call a long time  vanderbank considered ah there you are and now were we people thats rightgive it to us im sure that in one way or another its all earned well ive known her ten years but awfully well  what do you call awfully well  we people vanderbanks enquirer with his continued restless observation moving nearer the young man had laid on his shoulder the lightest of friendly hands dont you perhaps ask too much but no he added quickly and gaily of course you dont if i dont look out i shall have exactly the effect on you i dont want i dare say i dont know how well i know mrs brookenham mustnt that sort of thing be put in a manner to the proof what i meant to say just now was that i wouldntat least i hope i shouldnthave named her as i did save to an old friend  mr longdon looked promptly satisfied and reassured you probably heard me address her myself  i did but youve your rights and that wouldnt excuse me the only thing is that i go to see her every sunday  mr longdon pondered and then a little to vanderbanks surprise at any rate to his deeper amusement candidly asked only fernanda no other lady  oh yes several other ladies  mr longdon appeared to hear this with pleasure youre quite right we dont make enough of sunday at beccles  oh we make plenty of it in london vanderbank said and i think its rather in my interest i should mention that mrs brookenham calls me  his visitor covered him now with an attention that just operated as a check by your christian name  before vanderbank could in any degree attenuate what is your christian name mr longdon asked  vanderbank felt of a sudden almost guiltyas if his answer could only impute extravagance to the lady my christian namehe blushed it outis gustavus  his friend took a droll conscious leap and she calls you gussy  no not even gussy but i scarcely think i ought to tell you he pursued if she herself gave you no glimpse of the fact any implication that she consciously avoided it might make you see deeper depths  he spoke with pointed levity but his companion showed him after an instant a face just coveredand a little painfullywith the vision of the possibility brushed away by the joke oh im not so bad as that mr longdon modestly ejaculated  well she doesnt do it always vanderbank laughed and its nothing moreover to what some people are called why there was a fellow there he pulled up however and thinking better of it selected another instance the duchesswerent you introduced to the duchessnever calls me anything but vanderbank unless she calls me caro mio it wouldnt have taken much to make her appeal to you with an i say longdon i can quite hear her  mr longdon focussing the effect of the sketch pointed its moral with an indulgent oh well a foreign duchess he could make his distinctions  yes shes invidiously cruelly foreign vanderbank agreed ive never indeed seen a woman avail herself so cleverly to make up for the obloquy of that state of the benefits and immunities it brings with it she has bloomed in the hothouse of her widowhoodshes a neapolitan hatched by an incubator  a neapolitanmr longdon seemed all civilly to wish he had only known it  her husband was one but i believe that dukes at naples are as thick as princes at petersburg hes dead at any rate poor man and she has come back here to live  gloomily i should thinkafter naples mr longdon threw out  oh it would take more than even a neapolitan past howeverand the young man caught himself upshe lives not in whats behind her but in whats beforeshe lives in her precious little aggie  little aggie mr longdon risked a cautious interest  i dont take a liberty there vanderbank smiled i speak only of the young agnesina a little girl the duchesss niece or rather i believe her husbands whom she has adoptedin the place of a daughter early lostand has brought to england to marry  ah to some great man of course  vanderbank thought i dont know he gave a vague but expressive sigh shes rather lovely little aggie  mr longdon looked conspicuously subtle then perhaps youre the man  do i look like a great one vanderbank broke in  his visitor turning away from him again embraced the room oh dear yes  well then to show how right you are theres the young lady he pointed to an object on one of the tables a small photograph with a very wide border of something that looked like crimson fur  mr longdon took up the picture he was serious now shes very beautifulbut shes not a little girl  at naples they develop early shes only seventeen or eighteen i suppose but i never know how oldor at least how younggirls are and im not sure an aunt at any rate has of course nothing to conceal she is extremely prettywith extraordinary red hair and a complexion to match great rarities i believe in that race and latitude she gave me the portraitframe and all the frame is neapolitan enough and little aggies charming then vanderbank subjoined but not so charming as little nanda  little nandahave you got her the old man was all eagerness  shes over there beside the lampalso a present from the original    ii  mr longdon had gone to the placelittle nanda was in glazed white wood he took her up and held her out for a moment he said nothing but presently over his glasses rested on his host a look intenser even than his scrutiny of the faded image do they give their portraits now  little girlsinnocent lambs surelyto old friends didnt they in your time  mr longdon studied the portrait again after which with an exhalation of something between superiority and regret they never did to me he returned  well you can have all you want now vanderbank laughed  his friend gave a slow droll headshake i dont want them now  you could do with them my dear sir still vanderbank continued in the same manner every bit i do  im sure you do nothing you oughtnt mr longdon kept the photograph and continued to look at it her mother told me about herpromised me i should see her next time  you mustshes a great friend of mine  mr longdon was really deep in it is she clever  vanderbank turned it over well youll tell me if you think so  ah with a child of seventeen mr longdon murmured it as if in dread of having to pronounce this one too is seventeen  vanderbank again considered eighteen he just hung fire once more then brought out well call it nearly nineteen ive kept her birthdays he laughed  his companion caught at the idea upon my honour i should like to when is the next  youve plenty of timethe fifteenth of june  im only too sorry to wait laying down the object he had been examining mr longdon took another turn about the room and his manner was such an appeal to his host to accept his restlessness that as he circulated the latter watched him with encouragement i said to you just now that i knew the mothers but it would have been more to the point to say the grandmothers he stopped before his young friend then nodded at the image of nanda i knew hers she put it at something less  vanderbank rather failed to understand the old lady put what  mr longdons face showed him as for a moment feeling his way im speaking of mrs brookenham she spoke of her daughter as only sixteen  vanderbanks amusement at the tone of this broke out she usually does she has done so i think for the last year or two  his visitor dropped upon his sofa as with the weight of something sudden and fresh then from this place with a sharp little movement tossed into the fire the end of a cigarette vanderbank offered him another and as he accepted it and took a light he said i dont know what youre doing with mei never at home smoke so much but he puffed away and seated near laid his hand on vanderbanks arm as to help himself to utter something too delicate not to be guarded and yet too important not to be risked now thats the sort of thing i did meanas one of my impressions vanderbank continued at a loss and he went on i referif you dont mind my saying soto what you said just now  vanderbank was conscious of a deep desire to draw from him whatever might come so sensible was it somehow that whatever in him was good was also thoroughly personal but our young friend had to think a minute i see i see nothings more probable than that ive said something nasty but which of my particular horrors  well then your conveying that she makes her daughter out younger  to make herself out the same vanderbank took him straight up it was nasty my doing that i see i see yes yes i rather gave her away and youre struck by itas is most delightful you should bebecause youre in every way of a better tradition and knowing mrs brookenhams my friend cant conceive of ones playing on a friend a trick so vulgar and odious it strikes you also probably as the kind of thing we must be constantly doing it strikes you that right and left probably we keep giving each other away well i dare say we do yes come to think of it as they say in america we do but what shall i tell you practically we all know it and allow for it and its as broad as its long whats london life after all its tit for tat  ah but what becomes of friendship mr longdon earnestly and pleadingly asked while he still held vanderbanks arm as if under the spell of the vivid explanation supplied him  the young man met his eyes only the more sociably friendship  friendship mr longdon maintained the full value of the word  well his companion risked i dare say it isnt in london by any means what it is at beccles i quite literally mean that vanderbank reassuringly added i never really have believed in the existence of friendship in big societiesin great towns and great crowds its a plant that takes time and space and air and london society is a huge squash as we elegantly call itan elbowing pushing perspiring chattering mob  ah i dont say that of you the visitor murmured with a withdrawal of his hand and a visible scruple for the sweeping concession he had evoked  do say it thenfor gods sake let some one say it so that something or other whatever it may be may come of it its impossible to say too muchits impossible to say enough there isnt anything any one can say that i wont agree to  that shows you really dont care the old man returned with acuteness  oh were past saving if thats what you mean vanderbank laughed  you dont care you dont care his guest repeated andif i may be frank with youi shouldnt wonder if it were rather a pity  a pity i dont care  you ought to you ought to and mr longdon paused may i say all i think  i assure you i shall youre awfully interesting  so are you if you come to that its just what ive had in my head theres something i seem to make out in you he abruptly dropped this however going on in another way i remember the rest of you but why did i never see you  i must have been at schoolat college perhaps you did know my brothers elder and younger  there was a boy with your mother at malvern i was near her there for three months inwhat was the year  yes i know vanderbank replied while his guest tried to fix the date it was my brother miles he was awfully clever but had no health poor chap and we lost him at seventeen she used to take houses at such places with himit was supposed to be for his benefit  mr longdon listened with a visible recovery he used to talk to mei remember he asked me questions i couldnt answer and made me dreadfully ashamed but i lent him bookspartly upon my honour to make him think that as i had them i did know something he read everything and had a lot to say about it i used to tell your mother he had a great future  vanderbank shook his head sadly and kindly so he had and you remember nancy who was handsome and who was usually with them he went on  mr longdon looked so uncertain that he explained he meant his other sister on which his companion said oh her yes she was charmingshe evidently had a future too  well shes in the midst of her future now shes married  and whom did she marry  a fellow called toovey a man in the city  oh said mr longdon a little blankly then as if to retrieve his blankness but why do you call her nancy wasnt her name blanche  exactlyblanche bertha vanderbank  mr longdon looked halfmystified and halfdistressed and now shes nancy toovey  vanderbank broke into laughter at his dismay thats what every one calls her  but why  nobody knows you see you were right about her future  mr longdon gave another of his soft smothered sighs he had turned back again to the first photograph which he looked at for a longer time well it wasnt her way  my mothers no indeed oh my mothers way vanderbank waited then added gravely she was taken in time  mr longdon turned halfround as to reply to this but instead of replying proceeded afresh to an examination of the expressive oval in the red plush frame he took up little aggie who appeared to interest him and abruptly observed nanda isnt so pretty  no not nearly theres a great question whether nandas pretty at all  mr longdon continued to inspect her more favoured friend which led him after a moment to bring out she ought to be you know her grandmother was  oh and her mother vanderbank threw in dont you think mrs brookenham lovely  mr longdon kept him waiting a little not so lovely as lady julia lady julia had he faltered then as if there were too much to say disposed of the question lady julia had everything  vanderbank gathered hence an impression that determined him more and more to diplomacy but isnt that just what mrs brookenham has  this time the old man was prompt yes shes very brilliant but its a totally different thing he laid little aggie down and moved away as without a purpose but his friend presently perceived his purpose to be another glance at the other young lady as if all accidentally and absently he bent again over the portrait of nanda lady julia was exquisite and this childs exactly like her  vanderbank more and more conscious of something working in him was more and more interested if nandas so like her was she so exquisite  oh yes every one was agreed about that mr longdon kept his eyes on the face trying a little vanderbank even thought to conceal his own she was one of the greatest beauties of her day  then is nanda so like her vanderbank persisted amused at his friends transparency  extraordinarily her mother told me all about her  told you shes as beautiful as her grandmother  mr longdon turned it over well that she has just lady julias expression she absolutely has iti see it here he was delightfully positive shes much more like the dead than like the living  vanderbank saw in this too many deep things not to follow them up one of these was to begin with that his guest had not more than halfsuccumbed to mrs brookenhams attraction if indeed he had by a fine originality not resisted it altogether that in itself for an observer deeply versed in this lady was attaching and beguiling another indication was that he found himself in spite of such a break in the chain distinctly predisposed to nanda if she reproduces then so vividly lady julia the young man threw out why does she strike you as so much less pretty than her foreign friend there who is after all by no means a prodigy  the subject of this address with one of the photographs in his hand glanced while he reflected at the other then with a subtlety that matched itself for the moment with vanderbanks you just told me yourself that the little foreign person  is ever so much the lovelier of the two so i did but youve promptly recognised it its the first time vanderbank went on to let him down more gently that ive heard mrs brookenham admit the girls good looks  her own girls admit them  i mean grant them to be even as good as they are i myself i must tell you extremely like nandas appearance i think lady julias granddaughter has in her face in spite of everything  what do you mean by everything mr longdon broke in with such an approach to resentment that his hosts gaiety overflowed  youll seewhen you do see she has no features no not one vanderbank inexorably pursued unless indeed you put it that she has two or three too many what i was going to say was that she has in her expression all thats charming in her nature but beauty in londonand feeling that he held his visitors attention he gave himself the pleasure of freely presenting his ideastaring glaring obvious knockdown beauty as plain as a poster on a wall an advertisement of soap or whiskey something that speaks to the crowd and crosses the footlights fetches such a price in the market that the absence of it for a woman with a girl to marry inspires endless terrors and constitutes for the wretched pair to speak of mother and daughter alone a sort of social bankruptcy london doesnt love the latent or the lurking has neither time nor taste nor sense for anything less discernible than the red flag in front of the steamroller it wants cash over the counter and letters ten feet high therefore you see its all as yet rather a dark question for poor nandaa question that in a way quite occupies the foreground of her mothers earnest little life how will she look what will be thought of her and what will she be able to do for herself shes at the age when the whole thingspeaking of her attractions her possible share of good looksis still to a degree in a fog but everything depends on it  mr longdon had by this time come back to him excuse my asking it againfor you take such jumps what once more do you mean by everything  why naturally her marrying above all her marrying early  mr longdon stood before the sofa what do you mean by early  well we do doubtless get up later than at beccles but that gives us you see shorter days i mean in a couple of seasons soon enough vanderbank developed to limit the strain he was moved to higher gaiety by his friends expression  what do you mean by the strain  well the complication of her being there  being where  you do put one through vanderbank laughed but he showed himself perfectly prepared out of the schoolroom and where she is now in her mothers drawingroom at her mothers fireside  mr longdon stared but where else should she be  at her husbands dont you see  he looked as if he quite saw yet was nevertheless not to be put off from his original challenge ah certainly but not as if she had been pushed down the chimney all in good time  what do you call good time  why time to make herself loved  vanderbank wondered by the men who come to the house  mr longdon slightly attenuated this way of putting it yesand in the home circle wheres the strain of her being suffered to be a member of it    iii  vanderbank at this left his corner of the sofa and with his hands in his pockets and a manner so amused that it might have passed for excited took several paces about the room while his interlocutor watching him waited for his response that gentleman as this response for a minute hung fire took his turn at sitting down and then vanderbank stopped before him with a face in which something had been still more brightly kindled you ask me more things than i can tell you you ask me more than i think you suspect you must come and see me againyou must let me come and see you you raise the most interesting questions and we must sooner or later have them all out  mr longdon looked happy in such a prospect but once more took out his watch it wants five minutes to midnight which means that i must go now  not in the least there are satisfactions you too must give his host with an irresistible hand confirmed him in his position and pressed upon him another cigarette his resistance rang hollowit was clearly he judged such an occasion for sacrifices vanderbanks view of it meanwhile was quite as marked you see theres ever so much more you must in common kindness tell me  mr longdon sat there like a shy singer invited to strike up i told you everything at mrs brookenhams it comes over me now how i dropped on you  what you told me vanderbank returned was excellent so far as it went but it was only after all that having caught my name you had asked of our friend if i belonged to people you had known years before and then from what she had said hadwith what you were so good as to call great pleasuremade out that i did you came round to me on this after dinner and gave me a pleasure still greater but that only takes us part of the way mr longdon said nothing but there was something appreciative in his conscious lapses they were a tribute to his young friends frequent felicity this personage indeed appeared more and more to take them for thatwhich was not without its effect on his spirits at last with a flight of some freedom he brought their pause to a close you loved lady julia then as the attitude of his guest who serenely met his eyes was practically a contribution to the subject he went on with a feeling that he had positively pleased you lost herand youre unmarried  mr longdons smile was beautifulit supplied so many meanings that when presently he spoke he seemed already to have told half his story well my life took a form it had to or i dont know what would have become of me and several things that all happened at once helped me out my father diedi came into the little place in suffolk my sister my only one who had married and was older than i lost within a year or two both her husband and her little boy i offered her in the country a home for her trouble was greater than any trouble of mine she came she stayed it went on and on and we lived there together we were sorry for each other and it somehow suited us but she died two years ago  vanderbank took all this in only wishing to showwishing by this time quite tenderlythat he even read into it deeply enough all the unsaid he filled out another of his friends gaps and here you are then he invited mr longdon himself to make the stride well youll be a great success  what do you mean by that  why that we shall be so infatuated with you that we shall make your life a burden to you youll see soon enough what i mean by it  possibly the old man said to understand you i shall have to you speak of something that as yetwith my race practically runi know nothing about i was no success as a young man i mean of the sort that would have made most difference people wouldnt look at me  well we shall look at you vanderbank declared then he added what people do you mean and before his friend could reply lady julia  mr longdons assent was mute ah she was not the worst i mean that what made it so bad he continued was that they all really liked me your mother i thinkas to that the dreadful consolatory likingeven more than the others  my mothervanderbank was surprised you mean there was a question  oh for but half a minute it didnt take her long it was five years after your fathers death  this explanation was very delicately made she could marry again  and i suppose you know she did vanderbank returned  i knew it soon enough with this abruptly mr longdon pulled himself forward goodnight goodnight  goodnight said vanderbank but wasnt that after lady julia  on the edge of the sofa his hands supporting him mr longdon looked straight there was nothing after lady julia  i see his companion smiled my mother was earlier  she was extremely good to me im not speaking of that time at malvernthat came later  preciselyi understand youre speaking of the first years of her widowhood  mr longdon just faltered i should call them rather the last six months later came her second marriage  vanderbanks interest visibly improved ah it was then that was about my seventh year he called things back and pieced them together but she must have been older than you  yesa little she was kindness itself to me at all events then and afterwards that was the charm of the weeks at malvern  i see the young man laughed the charm was that you had recovered  oh dear no mr longdon rather to his mystification exclaimed im afraid i hadnt recovered at allhadnt if thats what you mean got over my misery and my melancholy she knew i hadntand that was what was nice of her she was a person with whom i could talk about her  vanderbank took a moment to clear up the ambiguity oh you mean you could talk about the other you hadnt got over lady julia  mr longdon sadly smiled at him i havent got over her yet then however as if not to look morbid he took pains to be clear the first wound was badbut from that one always comes round your mother dear woman had known how to help me lady julia was at that time her intimate friendit was she who introduced me there she couldnt help what happenedshe did her best what i meant just now was that in the aftertime when opportunity occurred she was the one person with whom i could always talk and who always understood he lost himself an instant in the deep memories to attest which he had survived alone then he sighed out as if the taste of it all came back to him with a faint sweetness i think they must both have been good to me at the malvern time the particular time i just mentioned to you lady julia was already married and during those first years she had been whirled out of my ken then her own life took a quieter turn we met again i went for a good while often to her house i think she rather liked the state to which she had reduced me though she didnt you know in the least presume on it the better a woman isit has often struck methe more she enjoys in a quiet way some fellows having been rather bad rather dark and desperate about herfor her i dare say i mean that though lady julia insisted i ought to marry she wouldnt really have liked it much if i had at any rate it was in those years i saw her daughter just cease to be a childthe little girl who was to be transformed by time into the so different person with whom we dined tonight that comes back to me when i hear you speak of the growing up in turn of that persons own daughter  i follow you with a sympathy vanderbank replied the situations reproduced  ah partlynot altogether the things that are unlikewell are so very unlike mr longdon for a moment on this fixed his companion with eyes that betrayed one of the restless little jumps of his mind i told you just now that theres something i seem to make out in you  yes that was meant for better thingsvanderbank frankly took him up there is something i really believemeant for ever so much better ones those are just the sort i like to be supposed to have a real affinity with help me to them mr longdon help me to them and i dont know what i wont do for you  then after alland his friend made the point with innocent sharpnessyoure not past saving  well i individuallyhow shall i put it to you if i tell you vanderbank went on that ive that sort of fulcrum for salvation which consists at least in a deep consciousness and the absence of a rag of illusion i shall appear to say im wholly different from the world i live in and to that extent present myself as superior and fatuous try me at any rate let me try myself dont abandon me see what can be done with me perhaps im after all a case i shall certainly cling to you  youre too cleveryoure too clever thats whats the matter with you all mr longdon sighed  with us all vanderbank echoed dear mr longdon its the first time ive heard it if you should say the matter with me in particular why there might be something in it what you mean at any ratei see where you come outis that were cold and sarcastic and cynical without the soft human spot i think you flatter us even while you attempt to warn but whats extremely interesting at all events is that as i gather we made on you this evening in a particular way a collective impressionsomething in which our trifling varieties are merged his visitors face at this appeared to acknowledge his putting the case in perfection so that he was encouraged to go on there was something particular with which you werent altogether pleasantly struck  mr longdon who decidedly changed colour easily showed in his clear cheek the effect at once of feeling a finger on his fault and of admiring his companions insight but he accepted the situation i couldnt help noticing your tone  do you mean its being so low  he had smiled at first but looked grave now do you really want to know  just how you were affected i assure you theres at this moment nothing i desire nearly so much  im no judge then mr longdon began im no critic im no talker myself im oldfashioned and narrow and ignorant ive lived for years in a hole im not a man of the world  vanderbank considered him with a benevolence a geniality of approval that he literally had to hold in check for fear of seeming to patronise theres not one of us who can touch you youre delightful youre wonderful and im intensely curious to hear you the young man pursued were we absolutely odious before his guests puzzled finally almost pained face such an air of appreciating so much candour yet of looking askance at so much freedom he could only try to smooth the way and light the subject you see we dont in the least know where we are were lostand you find us mr longdon as he spoke had prepared at last really to go reaching the door with a manner that denoted however by no means so much satiety as an attention that felt itself positively too agitated vanderbank had helped him on with the inverness cape and for an instant detained him by it just tell me as a kindness do we talk  too freely mr longdon with his clear eyes so untouched by time speculatively murmured  too outrageously i want the truth  the truth evidently for mr longdon was difficult to tell wellit was certainly different  from you and lady julia i see well of course with time some change is natural isnt it but so different vanderbank pressed that you were really shocked  his visitor smiled at this but the smile somehow made the face graver i think i was rather frightened goodnight     book second little aggie  mrs brookenham stopped on the threshold with the sharp surprise of the sight of her son and there was disappointment though rather of the afflicted than of the irritated sort in the question that slowly advancing she launched at him if youre still lolling about why did you tell me two hours ago that you were leaving immediately  deep in a large brocaded chair with his little legs stuck out to the fire he was so much at his ease that he was almost flat on his back she had evidently roused him from sleep and it took him a couple of minutesduring which without again looking at him she directly approached a beautiful old french secretary a fine piece of the period of louis seizeto justify his presence i changed my mind i couldnt get off  do you mean to say youre not going  well im thinking it over whats a fellow to do he sat up a little staring with conscious solemnity at the fire and if it had beenas it was notone of the annoyances she in general expected from him she might have received the impression that his flush was the heat of liquor  hes to keep out of the way she returnedwhen he has led one so deeply to hope it there had been a bunch of keys dangling from the secretary of which as she said these words mrs brookenham took possession her air on observing them had promptly become that of having been in search of them and a moment after she had passed across the room they were in her pocket if you dont go what excuse will you give  do you mean to you mummy  she stood before him and now dismally looked at him whats the matter with you what an extraordinary time to take a nap  he had fallen back in the chair from the depths of which he met her eyes why its just the time mummy i did it on purpose i can always go to sleep when i like i assure you it sees one through things  she turned away with impatience and glancing about the room perceived on a small table of the same type as the secretary a somewhat massive book with the label of a circulating library which she proceeded to pick up as for refuge from the impression made on her by her boy he watched her do this and watched her then slightly pause at the wide window that in buckingham crescent commanded the prospect they had ramified rearward to enjoy a medley of smoky brick and spotty stucco of other undressed backs of glass invidiously opaque of roofs and chimneypots and stables unnaturally nearone of the private pictures that in london in select situations run up as the phrase is the rent there was no indication of value now however in the character conferred on the scene by a cold spring rain the place had moreover a confessed outofseason vacancy she appeared to have determined on silence for the present mark of her relation with harold yet she soon failed to resist a sufficiently poor reason for breaking it be so good as to get out of my chair  what will you do for me he asked if i oblige you  he never movedbut as if only the more directly and intimately to meet herand she stood again before the fire and sounded his strange little face i dont know what it is but you give me sometimes a kind of terror  a terror mamma  she found another place sinking sadly down and opening her book and the next moment he got up and came over to kiss her on which she drew her cheek wearily aside you bore me quite to death she coldly said and i give you up to your fate  what do you call my fate  oh something dreadfulif only by its being publicly ridiculous she turned vaguely the pages of her book youre too selfishtoo sickening  oh dear dear he wonderingly whistled while he wandered back to the hearthrug on which with his hands behind him he lingered a while he was small and had a slight stoop which somehow gave him charactercharacter of the insidious sort carried out in the acuteness difficult to trace to a source of his smooth fair face where the lines were all curves and the expression all needles he had the voice of a man of forty and was dressedas if markedly not for londonwith an air of experience that seemed to match it he pulled down his waistcoat smoothing himself feeling his neat hair and looking at his shoes  i took your five pounds also two of the sovereigns he went on i left you two pound ten his mother jerked up her head at this facing him in dismay and immediately on her feet passed back to the secretary its quite as i say he insisted you should have locked it before dont you know it grinned at me there with all its charming brasses and what was i to do darling mummy i couldnt startthat was the truth i thought i should find somethingi had noticed and i do hope youll let me keep it because if you dont its all up with me i stopped over on purposeon purpose i mean to tell you what ive done dont you call that a sense of honour and now you only stand and glower at me  mrs brookenham was in her fortyfirst year still charmingly pretty and the nearest approach she made at this moment to meeting her sons description of her was by looking beautifully desperate she had about her the pure light of youthwould always have it her head her figure her flexibility her flickering colour her lovely silly eyes her natural quavering tone all played together toward this effect by some trick that had never yet been exposed it was at the same time remarkable thatat least in the bosom of her familyshe rarely wore an appearance of gaiety less qualified than at the present juncture she suggested for the most part the luxury the novelty of woe the excitement of strange sorrows and the cultivation of fine indifferences this was her special signan innocence dimly tragic it gave immense effect to her other resources she opened the secretary with the key she had quickly found then with the aid of another rattled out a small drawer after which she pushed the drawer back closing the whole thing you terrify meyou terrify me she again said  how can you say that when you showed me just now how well you know me wasnt it just on account of what you thought i might do that you took out the keys as soon as you came in harolds manner had a way of clearing up whenever he could talk of himself  youre too utterly disgustingi shall speak to your father with which going to the chair he had given up his mother sank down again with her heavy book there was no anger however in her voice and not even a harsh plaint only a detached accepted disenchantment mrs brookenhams supreme rebellion against fate was just to show with the last frankness how much she was bored  no darling mummy you wont speak to my fatheryoull do anything in the world rather than that harold replied quite as if he were kindly explaining her to herself i thank you immensely for the charming way you take what ive done it was because i had a conviction of that that i waited for you to know it it was all very well to tell you id start on my visitbut how the deuce was i to start without a penny in the world dont you see that if you want me to go about you must really enter into my needs  i wish to heaven youd leave mei wish to heaven youd get out of the house mrs brookenham went on without looking up  harold took out his watch well mamma now i am ready i wasnt in the least before but it will be going forth you know quite to seek my fortune for do you really thinki must have from you what you do thinkthat it will be all right for me  she fixed him at last with her pretty pathos you mean for you to go to brander  you know he answered with his manner as of letting her see her own attitude you know you try to make me do things you wouldnt at all do yourself at least i hope you wouldnt and dont you see that if i so far oblige you i must at least be paid for it  his mother leaned back in her chair gazed for a moment at the ceiling and then closed her eyes you are frightful she said youre appalling  youre always wanting to get me out of the house he continued i think you want to get us all out for you manage to keep nanda from showing even more than you do me dont you think your children good enough mummy dear at any rate its as plain as possible that if you dont keep us at home you must keep us in other places one cant live anywhere for nothingits all bosh that a fellow saves by staying with people i dont know how it is for a lady but a mans practically let in  do you know you kill me harold mrs brookenham woefully interposed but it was with the same remote melancholy that she asked in the next breath it wasnt an invitationto brander  its as i told you she said shed write fixing a time but she never did write  but if you wrote  it comes to the same thing does itthats the question if on my note she didnt writethats what i mean should one simply take it that ones wanted i like to have these things from you mother i do i believe everything you say but to feel safe and right i must just have them any one would want me eh  mrs brookenham had opened her eyes but she still attached them to the cornice if she hadnt wanted you shed have written to keep you off in a great house like that theres always room  the young man watched her a moment how you do like to tuck us in and then sit up yourself what do you want to do anyway what are you up to mummy  she rose at this turning her eyes about the room as if from the extremity of martyrdom or the wistfulness of some deep thought yet when she spoke it was with a different expression an expression that would have served for an observer as a marked illustration of that disconnectedness of her parts which frequently was laughable even to the degree of contributing to her social success youve spent then more than four pounds in five days it was on friday i gave them to you what in the world do you suppose is going to become of me  harold continued to look at her as if the question demanded some answer really helpful do we live beyond our means  she now moved her gaze to the floor will you please get away  anything to assist you only if i should find im not wanted  she met his look after an instant and the wan loveliness and vagueness of her own had never been greater be wanted and you wont find it youre odious but youre not a fool  he put his arms about her now for farewell and she submitted as if it was absolutely indifferent to her to whose bosom she was pressed you do dearest he laughed say such sweet things and with that he reached the door on opening which he pulled up at a sound from below the duchess shes coming up  mrs brookenham looked quickly round the room but she spoke with utter detachment well let her come  as id let her go i take it as a happy sign she wont be at brander he stood with his hand on the knob he had another quick appeal but after tuesday  mrs brookenham had passed half round the room with the glide that looked languid but that was really a remarkable form of activity and had given a transforming touch on sofa and chairs to three or four crushed cushions it was all with the hanging head of a broken lily youre to stay till the twelfth  but if i am kicked out  it was as a broken lily that she considered it then go to the mangers  happy thought and shall i write  his mother raised a little more a windowblind noi will  delicious mummy and harold blew her a kiss  yes rathershe corrected herself do writefrom brander its the sort of thing for the mangers or even wire  both the young man laughed oh you duck he cried and from where will you let them have it  from pewbury she replied without wincing ill write on sunday  good how dye do duchessand harold before he disappeared greeted with a rapid concentration of all the shades of familiarity a large high lady the visitor he had announced who rose in the doorway with the manner of a person used to arriving on thresholds very much as people arrive at stationswith the expectation of being met    ii  goodbye hes off mrs brookenham who had remained quite on her own side of the room explained to her friend  wheres he off to this friend enquired with a casual advance and a look not so much at her hostess as at the cushions just rearranged  oh to some places to brander today  how he does run about and the duchess still with a glance hither and yon sank upon the sofa to which she had made her way unaided mrs brookenham knew perfectly the meaning of this glance she had but three or four comparatively good pieces whereas the duchess rich with the spoils of italy had but three or four comparatively bad this was the relation as between intimate friends that the duchess visibly preferred and it was quite groundless in buckingham crescent ever to enter the drawingroom with an expression suspicious of disloyalty the duchess was a woman who so cultivated her passions that she would have regarded it as disloyal to introduce there a new piece of furniture in an underhand waythat is without a full appeal to herself the highest authority and the consequent bestowal of opportunity to nip the mistake in the bud mrs brookenham had repeatedly asked herself where in the world she might have found the money to be disloyal the duchesss standard was of a height it matched for that matter her other elements which were wontedly conspicuous as usual as she sat there suggestive of early tea she always suggested tea before the hour and her friend always but with so different a wistfulness rang for it whos to be at brander she asked  i havent the least ideahe didnt tell me but theyve always a lot of people  oh i knowextraordinary mixtures has he been there before  mrs brookenham thought oh yesif i remembermore than once in fact her notewhich he showed me but which only mentioned some friendswas a sort of appeal on the ground of something or other that had happened the last time  the duchess dealt with it she writes the most extraordinary notes  well this was nice i thought mrs brookenham saidfrom a woman of her age and her immense position to so young a man  again the duchess reflected my dear shes not an american and shes not on the stage arent those what you call positions in this country and shes also not a hundred  yes but harolds a mere baby  then he doesnt seem to want for nurses the duchess replied she smiled at her hostess your children are like their mothertheyre eternally young  well im not a hundred moaned mrs brookenham as if she wished with dim perversity she were  every ones at any rate awfully kind to harold she waited a moment to give her visitor the chance to pronounce that eminently natural but no pronouncement camenothing but the footman who had answered her ring and of whom she ordered tea and where did you say youre going she enquired after this  for easter the duchess achieved a direct encounter with her charming eyeswhich was not in general an easy feat i didnt say i was going anywhere i havent of a sudden changed my habits you know whether i leave my childexcept in the sense of having left her an hour ago at mr garlicks class in modern light literature i confess im a little nervous about the subjects and am going for her at five  and then where do you take her  home to her tea where should you think  mrs brookenham declined in connexion with the matter any responsibility of thought she did indeed much better by saying after a moment you are devoted  miss merriman has her afternooni cant imagine what they do with their afternoons the duchess went on but shes to be back in the schoolroom at seven  and you have aggie till then  till then said the duchess cheerfully youre off for easter towhere is it she continued  mrs brookenham had received with no flush of betrayal the various discriminations thus conveyed by her visitor and her only revenge for the moment was to look as sweetly resigned as if she really saw what was in them where were they going for easter she had to think an instant but she brought it out oh to pewburyweve been engaged so long that i had forgotten we go once a yearone does it for edward  ah you spoil him smiled the duchess whos to be there  oh the usual thing i suppose a lot of my lords tiresome supporters  to pay his debt then why are you poor things asked  mrs brookenham looked on this quite adorablythat is most wonderinglygrave how do i know my dear jane why in the world were ever asked anywhere fancy people wanting edward she exhaled with stupefaction yet we can never get off pewbury  youre better for getting on cara mia than for getting off the duchess blandly returned she was a person of no small presence filling her place however without ponderosity with a massiveness indeed rather artfully kept in bounds her head her chin her shoulders were well aloft but she had not abandoned the cultivation of a figure or any of the distinctively finer reasons for passing as a handsome woman she was secretly at war moreover in this endeavour with a lurking no less than with a public foe and thoroughly aware that if she didnt look well she might at times only and quite dreadfully look good there were definite ways of escape none of which she neglected and from the total of which as she flattered herself the air of distinction almost mathematically resulted this air corresponded superficially with her acquired calabrian sonorities from her voluminous title down but the colourless hair the passionless forehead the mild cheek and long lip of the british matron the type that had set its trap for her earlier than any other were elements difficult to deal with and were at moments all a sharp observer saw the battleground then was the haunting danger of the bourgeois she gave mrs brookenham no time to resent her last note before enquiring if nanda were to accompany the couple  mercy mercy noshes not asked mrs brookenham on nandas behalf fairly radiated obscurity my children dont go where theyre not asked  i never said they did love the duchess returned but what then do you do with her  if you mean sociallymrs brookenham looked as if there might be in some distant sphere for which she almost yearned a maternal opportunity very different from thatif you mean socially i dont do anything at all ive never pretended to do anything you know as well as i do dear jane that i havent begun yet janes hostess now spoke as simply as an earnest anxious child she gave a vague patient sigh i suppose i must begin  the duchess remained for a little rather grimly silent how old is shetwenty  thirty said mrs brookenham with distilled sweetness then with no transition of tone she has gone for a few days to tishy grendon  in the country  she stays with her tonight in hill street they go down together tomorrow why hasnt aggie been mrs brookenham went on  the duchess handsomely stared been where  why here to see nanda  here the duchess echoed fairly looking again about the room when is nanda ever here  ah you know ive given her a room of her ownthe sweetest little room in the world mrs brookenham never looked so comparatively hopeful as when obliged to explain she has everything there a girl can want  my dear woman asked the duchess has she sometimes her own mother  the men had now come in to place the teatable and it was the movements of the redhaired footman that mrs brookenham followed you had better ask my child herself  the duchess was frank and jovial i would i promise you if i could get at her but isnt that woman always with her  mrs brookenham smoothed the little embroidered teacloth do you call tishy grendon a woman  again the duchess had one of her pauses which were indeed so frequent in her talks with this intimate that an auditor could sometimes wonder what particular form of relief they represented they might have been a habit proceeding from the fear of undue impatience if the duchess had been as impatient with mrs brookenham as she would possibly have seemed without them her frequent visits in the face of irritation would have had to be accounted for what do you call her she demanded  why nandas best friendif not her only one thats the place i should have liked for aggie mrs brookenham ever so graciously smiled  the duchess hereupon going beyond her gave way to free mirth my dear thing youre delightful aggie or tishy is a sweet thought since youre so good as to ask why aggie has fallen off youll excuse my telling you that youve just named the reason youve known ever since we came to england what i feel about the proper personsand the most improperfor her to meet the tishy grendons are not a bit the proper  mrs brookenham continued to assist a little in the preparations for tea why not say at once janeand her tone in its appeal was almost infantinethat youve come at last to placing even poor nanda for aggies wonderful purpose in the same impossible class  the duchess took her time but at last she accepted her duty well if you will have it you know my ideas if it isnt my notion of the way to bring up a girl to give her up in extreme youth to an intimacy with a young married woman whos both unhappy and silly whose conversation has absolutely no limits who says everything that comes into her head and talks to the poor child about god only knows whatif i should never dream of such an arrangement for my niece i can almost as little face the prospect of throwing her much dont you see with any young person exposed to such an association it would be in the natural order certainlyin spite of which natural order the duchess made the point with but moderate emphasisthat since dear edward is my cousin aggie should see at least as much of nanda as of any other girl of their age but what will you have i must recognise the predicament im placed in by the more and more extraordinary development of english manners many things have altered goodness knows since i was aggies age but nothings so different as what you all do with your girls its all a muddle a compromise a monstrosity like everything else you produce theres nothing in it that goes on allfours i see but one consistent way which is our fine old foreign way and which makesin the upper classes mind you for its with them only im concerneddes femmes bien gracieuses i allude to the immemorial custom of my husbands race which was good enough for his mother and his mothers mother for aggies own for his other sisters for toutes ces dames it would have been good enough for my child as i call hermy dear husband called her hisif not losing her parents she had remained in her own country she would have been brought up there under an anxious eyethats the great point privately carefully tenderly and with what she was not to learntill the proper timelooked after quite as much as the rest i can only go on with her in that spirit and make of her under providence what i consider any young person of her condition of her name of her particular traditions should be voila ma chere should you put it to me whether i think youre surrounding nanda with any such security as thatwell i shouldnt be able to help it if i offended you by an honest answer what it comes to simply stated is that really she must choose between aggie and tishy im afraid i should shock you were i to tell you what i should think of myself for packing my child all alone off for a week with mrs grendon  mrs brookenham who had many talents had none perhaps that she oftener found useful than that of listening with the appearance of being fairly hypnotised it was the way she listened to her housekeeper at their regular morning conference and if the rejoinder ensuing upon it frequently appeared to have nothing to do with her manner this was a puzzle for her interlocutor alone oh of course i know your theory dear jane and i dare say its very charming and oldfashioned and if you like aristocratic in a frowsy foolish old waythough even upon that at the same time there would be something too to be said but i can only congratulate you on finding it more workable than there can be any question of my finding it if youre all armed for the sacrifices you speak of i simply am not i dont think im quite a monster but i dont pretend to be a saint im an english wife and an english motheri live in the mixed english world my daughter at any rate is just my daughter i thank my stars and one of a good english bunch shes not the unique niece of my dead italian husband nor doubtless either in spite of her excellent birth of a lineage like aggies so very tremendous ive my life to lead and shes a part of it sugar she wound up on a still softer note as she handed the cup of tea  never well with me said the duchess with spirit she would be all  all is soon said life is composed of many things mrs brookenham gently rang outof such mingled intertwisted strands then still with the silver bell dont you really think tishy nice she asked  i think little girls should live with little girls and young femmes du monde so immensely initiated shouldwell said the duchess with a toss of her head let them alone what do they want of them at all at all  well my dear if tishy strikes you as initiated all one can ask is initiated into what i should as soon think of applying such a term to a little shivering shorn lamb is it your theory mrs brookenham pursued that our unfortunate unmarried daughters are to have no intelligent friends  unfortunate indeed cried the duchess precisely because theyre unmarried and unmarried if you dont mind my saying so a good deal because theyre unmarriageable men after all the nice onesby which i mean the possible onesare not on the lookout for little brides whose usual associates are so up to snuff its not their idea that the girls they marry shall already have been pitchforkedby talk and contacts and visits and newspapers and by the way the poor creatures rush about and all the extraordinary things they doquite into everything a girls most intelligent friend is her motheror the relative acting as such perhaps you consider that tishy takes your place  mrs brookenham waited so long to say what she considered that before she next spoke the question appeared to have dropped then she only replied as if suddenly remembering her manners wont you eat something she indicated a particular plate one of the nice little round ones the duchess appropriated a nice little round one and her hostess presently went on theres one thing i mustnt forgetdont let us eat them all i believe theyre what lord petherton really comes for  the duchess finished her mouthful imperturbably before she took this up does he come so often  mrs brookenham might have been for judicious candour the muse of history i dont know what he calls it but he said yesterday that hed come today ive had tea earlier for you she went on with her most melancholy kindnessand hes always late but we mustnt between us lick the platter clean  the duchess entered very sufficiently into her companions tone oh i dont feel at all obliged to consider him for he has not of late particularly put himself out for me he has not been to see me since i dont know when and the last time he did come he brought mr mitchett  here it was the other way round it was mr mitchett the other year who first brought lord petherton  and who asked the duchess had first brought mr mitchett  mrs brookenham meeting her friends eyes looked for an instant as if trying to recall i give it up i muddle beginnings  that doesnt matter if you only make them the duchess smiled  no does it to which mrs brookenham added did he bring mr mitchett for aggie  if he did theyll have been disappointed neither of them has seen in my house the tip of her nose the duchess announced it with a pomp of pride  ah but with your ideas that doesnt prevent  prevent what  why what i suppose you call the pourparlers  for aggies hand my dear said the duchess im glad you do me the justice of feeling that im a person to take time by the forelock it was not as you seem to remember with the sight of mr mitchett that the question of aggies hand began to occupy me i should be ashamed of myself if it werent constantly before me and if i hadnt my feelers out in more quarters than one but ive not so much as thought of mr mitchettwho rich as he may be is the son of a shoemaker and superlatively hideousfor a reason i dont at all mind telling you dont be outraged if i say that ive for a long time hoped you yourself would find the right use for him she pausedat present with a momentary failure of assurance from which she rallied however to proceed with a burst of earnestness that was fairly noble forgive me if i just tell you once for all how it strikes me im stupefied at your not seeming to recognise either your interest or your duty oh i know you want to but you appear to mein your perfect good faith of courseutterly at sea theyre one and the same thing dont you make out your interest and your duty why isnt it convincingly plain to you that the thing to do with nanda is just to marry herand to marry her soon thats the great thingdo it while you can if you dont want her downstairsat which let me say i dont in the least wonderyour remedy is to take the right alternative dont send her to tishy  send her to mr mitchett mrs brookenham unresentfully quavered her colour during her visitors address had distinctly risen but there was no irritation in her voice how do you know jane that i dont want her downstairs  the duchess looked at her with an audacity confirmed by the absence from her face of everything but the plaintive there you are with your eternal english false positions jaime moi les situations nettesje rien comprends pas dautres it wouldnt be to your honourto that of your delicacythat with your impossible house you should wish to plant your girl in your drawingroom but such a way of keeping her out of it as throwing her into a worse  well jane you do say things to me mrs brookenham blandly broke in she had sunk back into her chair her hands in her lap pressed themselves together and her wan smile brought a tear into each of her eyes by the very effort to be brighter it might have been guessed of her that she hated to seem to care but that she had other dislikes too if one were to take up you know some of the things you say and she positively sighed for the wealth of amusement at them of which her tears were the sign her friend could quite match her indifference well my child take them up if you were to do that with them candidly one by one you would do really very much what i should like to bring you to do you see mrs brookenhams failure to repudiate the vision appeared to suffice and her visitor cheerfully took a further jump as much of tishy as she wantsafter but not before  after what  wellsay after mr mitchett mr mitchett wont take her after mrs grendon  and what are your grounds for assuming that hell take her at all then as the duchess hung fire a moment have you got it by chance from lord petherton  the eyes of the two women met for a little on this and there might have been a consequence of it in the manner of what came ive got it from not being a fool men i repeat like the girls they marry  oh i already know your old song the way they like the girls they dont marry seems to be mrs brookenham mused what more immediately concerns us you had better wait till you have made aggies fortune perhapsto be so sure of the working of your system pardon me darling if i dont take you for an example until youve a little more successfully become one i know what the sort of men worth speaking of are not looking for they are looking for smart safe sensible english girls  the duchess glanced at the clock whats mr vanderbank looking for  her companion appeared to oblige her by anxiously thinking oh he im afraid poor dearfor nothing at all  the duchess had taken off a glove to appease her appetite and now drawing it on she smoothed it down i think he has his ideas  the same as yours  well more like them than like yours  ah perhaps thenfor he and i said mrs brookenham dont agree i feel on two things in the world so you think poor mitchy she went on whos the son of a shoemaker and who might be the grandson of a grasshopper good enough for my child  the duchess appreciated for a moment the superior fit of her glove i look facts in the face its exactly what im doing for aggie then she grew easy to extravagance what are you giving her  but mrs brookenham took without wincing whatever as between a masterful relative and an exposed frivolity might have been the sting of it that you must ask edward i havent the least idea  there you are againthe virtuous english mother ive got aggies little fortune in an old stocking and i count it over every night if youve no old stocking for nanda there are worse fates than shoemakers and grasshoppers even with one you know i dont at all say that i should sniff at poor mitchy we must take what we can get and i shall be the first to take it you cant have everything for ninepence and the duchess got upshining however with a confessed light of fantasy speak to him my dearspeak to him  do you mean offer him my child  she laughed at the intonation there you are once morevous autres if youre shocked at the idea you place drolement your delicacy id offer mine to the son of a chimneysweep if the principal guarantees were there nandas charmingyou dont do her justice i dont say mr mitchetts either beautiful or noble and he certainly hasnt as much distinction as would cover the point of a pin he doesnt mind moreover what he saysthe lengths he sometimes goes tobut that added the duchess with decision is no doubt much a matter of how he finds youll take it and after marriage what does it signify he has forty thousand a year an excellent idea of how to take care of it and a good disposition  mrs brookenham sat still she only looked up at her friend is it by lord petherton that you know of his excellent idea  the duchess showed she was challenged but also that she made allowances i go by my impression but lord petherton has spoken for him  he ought to do that said mrs brookenhamsince he wholly lives on him  lord pethertonon mr mitchett the duchess stared but rather in amusement than in horror why hasnt he aproperty  the loveliest mr mitchetts his property didnt you know there was an artless wail in mrs brookenhams surprise  how should i knowstill a stranger as im often rather happy to feel myself here and choosing my friends and picking my steps very much i can assure youhow should i know about all your social scandals and things  oh we dont call that a social scandal mrs brookenham inimitably returned  well if you should wish to youd have the way i tell you of to stop it divert the stream of mr mitchetts wealth  oh theres plenty for every onemrs brookenham kept up her tone hes always giving us thingsbonbons and dinners and operaboxes  he has never given me any the duchess contentedly declared  mrs brookenham waited a little lord petherton has the giving of some he has never in his life before i imagine made so many presents  ah then its a shame one has nothing on which before reaching the door the duchess changed the subject you say i never bring aggie if you like ill bring her back  mrs brookenham wondered do you mean today  yes when ive picked her up it will be something to do with her till miss merriman can take her  delighted dearest do bring her and i think she should see mr mitchett  shall i find him here too then  oh take the chance  the two women on this exchanged tacitly and across the roomthe duchess at the door which a servant had arrived to open for her and mrs brookenham still at her teatablea further stroke of intercourse over which the latter was not on this occasion the first to lower her lids i think ive shown high scruples the departing guest said but i understand then that im free  free as air dear jane  good then just as she was off ah dear old edward the guest exclaimed her kinsman as she was fond of calling him had reached the top of the staircase and mrs brookenham by the fire heard them meet on the landingheard also the duchess protest against his turning to see her down mrs brookenham listening to them hoped edward would accept the protest and think it sufficient to leave her with the footman their common consciousness that she was a kind of cousin a consciousness not devoid of satisfaction was quite consistent with a view early arrived at of the absurdity of any fuss about her    iii  when mr brookenham appeared his wife was prompt shes coming back for lord petherton  oh he simply said  theres something between them  oh he merely repeated and it would have taken many such sounds on his part to represent a spirit of response discernible to any one but his mate  there have been things before she went on but i havent felt sure dont you know how one has sometimes a flash  it couldnt be said of edward brookenham who seemed to bend for sitting down more hinges than most men that he looked as if he knew either this or anything else he had a pale cold face marked and made regular made even in a manner handsome by a hardness of line in which oddly there was no significance no accent cleanshaven slightly bald with unlighted grey eyes and a mouth that gave the impression of not working easily he suggested a stippled drawing by an inferior master lean moreover and stiff and with the air of having here and there in his person a bone or two more than his share he had once or twice at fancyballs been thought striking in a dress copied from one of holbeins english portraits but when once some such meaning as that had been put into him it took a long time to put another a longer time than even his extreme exposure or anybodys study of the problem had yet made possible if anything particular had finally been expected from him it might have been a summary or an explanation of the things he had always not said but there was something in him that had long since pacified all impatience drugged all curiosity he had never in his life answered such a question as his wife had just put him and which she would not have put had she feared a reply so dry and decent and even distinguished did he look as if he had positively been created to meet a propriety and match some other piece that lady with her famous perceptions would no more have appealed to him seriously on a general proposition than she would for such a response have rung the drawingroom bell he was none the less held to have a great promiscuous wisdom what is it thats between them he demanded  whats between any woman and the man shes making up to  why there may often be nothing i didnt know she even particularly knew him brookenham added  its exactly what she would like to prevent any ones knowing and her coming here to be with him when she knows i know she knowsdont you seethat hes to be here is just one of those calculations that are subtle enough to put off the scent a woman who has but half a nose mrs brookenham as she spoke appeared to attest by the pretty stargazing way she thrust it into the air her own possession of the totality of such a feature i dont know yet quite what i think but one wakes up to such things soon enough  do you suppose its her idea that hell marry her brookenham asked in his colourless way  my dear edward his wife murmured for all answer  but if she can see him in other places why should she want to see him here edward persisted in a voice destitute of expression  mrs brookenham now had plenty of that do you mean if she can see him in his own house  no cream please her husband said hasnt she a house too  yes but so pervaded all over by aggie and miss merriman  oh brookenham commented  there has always been some manive always known there has and now its petherton said his companion  but wheres the attraction  in him why lots of women could tell you petherton has had a career  but i mean in old jane  well i dare say lots of men could tell you shes no older than any one else she has also such great elements  oh i dare say shes all right brookenham returned as if his interest in the case had dropped you might have felt you got a little nearer to him on guessing that in so peopled a circle satiety was never far from him  i mean for instance she has such a grand idea of duty she thinks were nowhere  nowhere  with our childrenwith our home life shes awfully down on tishy  tishyedward appeared for a moment at a loss  tishy grendonand her craze for nanda  has she a craze for nanda  surely i told you nandas to be with her for easter  i believe you did he bethought himself but you didnt say anything about a craze and wheres harold he went on  hes at brander that is he will be by dinner he has just gone  and how does he get there  why by the southwestern theyll send to meet him  brookenham appeared for a moment to view this statement in the dry light of experience theyll only send if there are others too  of course then therell be otherslots the more the better for harold  this young mans father was silent a little perhapsif they dont play high  ah said his mother however harold plays he has a way of winning  he has a way too of being a hopeless ass what i meant was how he comes there at all edward explained  why as any one comesby being invited she wrote to himweeks ago  brookenham just traceably took this in but to what profit was not calculable to harold very goodnatured he had another short reflexion after which he continued if they dont send hell be in for five miles in a flyand the man will see that he gets his money  they will sendafter her note  did it say so  her melancholy eyes seemed from afar to run over the page i dont rememberbut it was so cordial  again he meditated that often doesnt prevent ones being let in for ten shillings  there was more gloom in this forecast than his wife had desired to produce well my dear edward what do you want me to do whatever a young man does it seems to me hes let in for ten shillings  ah but he neednt bethats my point i wasnt at his age  harolds mother took up her book again perhaps you werent the same success i mean at such places  well i didnt borrow money to make me oneas ive a sharp idea our young scamp does  mrs brookenham hesitated from whom do you meanthe jews  he looked at her as if her vagueness might be assumed no they i take it are not quite so cordial to him since you call it so as the old ladies he gets it from mitchy  oh said mrs brookenham are you very sure she then demanded  he had got up and put his empty cup back on the teatable wandering afterwards a little about the room and looking out as his wife had done half an hour before at the dreary rain and the now duskier ugliness he reverted in this attitude with a complete unconsciousness of making for irritation to an issue they might be supposed to have dropped hell have a lovely drive for his money his companion however said nothing and he presently came round again no im not absolutely sureof his having had it from mitchy if i were i should do something  what would you do she put it as if she couldnt possibly imagine  id speak to him  to harold  nothat might just put it into his head brookenham walked up and down a little with his hands in his pockets after which with a complete concealment of the steps of the transition where are we dining tonight he brought out  nowhere thank heaven we grace our own board  ohwith those fellows as you said and jane  thats not for dinner the baggers and mary pinthorpe andupon my word i forget  youll see when she comes suggested brookenham who was again at the window  it isnt a sheits two or three hes i think his wife replied with her indifferent anxiety but i dont know what dinner it is she bethought herself it may be the one thats after easter then that ones this one she added with her eyes once more on her book  well its a relief to dine at homeand brookenham faced about would you mind finding out he asked with some abruptness  do you mean whos to dine  no that doesnt matter but whether mitchy has come down  i can only find out by asking him  oh i could ask him he seemed disappointed at his wifes want of resource  and you dont want to  he looked coldly from before the fire over the prettiness of her brown bent head it will be such a beastly bore if he admits it  and you think poor i can make him not admit it she put the question as if it were really her own thought too but they were a couple who could even face to face and unlike the augurs behind the altar think these things without laughing if he should admit it mrs brookenham threw in will you give me the money  the money  to pay mitchy back  she had now raised her eyes to her husband but turning away he failed to meet them hell deny it  well if they all deny it she presently remarked its a simple enough matter im sure i dont want them to come down on us but thats the advantage she almost prattled on of having so many such charming friends they dont come down  this again was a remark of a sweep that there appeared to be nothing in brookenhams mind to match so that scarcely pausing in the walk he had resumed he only said who do you mean by all  why if he has had anything from mitchy i dare say he has had something from van  oh brookenham returned as if with a still deeper drop of interest  they oughtnt to do it she declared they ought to tell us and when they dont it serves them right even this observation however failed to rouse in her husband a response and as she had quite formed the habit of doing she philosophically answered herself but i dont suppose they do it on spec  it was less apparent than ever what edward supposed oh van hasnt money to chuck about  ah i only mean a sovereign here and there  well brookenham threw out after another turn i think van you know is your affair  it all seems to be my affair she lamented too woefully to have other than a comic effect and of course then it will be still more so if he should begin to apply to mr longdon  we must stop that in time  do you mean by warning mr longdon and requesting him immediately to tell us that wont be very pleasant mrs brookenham noted  well then wait and see  she waited only a minuteit might have appeared she already saw i want him to be kind to harold and cant help thinking he will  yes but i fancy that that will be his notion of itkeeping him from making debts i dare say one neednt trouble about him brookenham added he can take care of himself  he appears to have done so pretty well all these years she mused as i saw him in my childhood i see him now and i see now that i saw then even how awfully in love he was with mamma hes too lovely about mamma mrs brookenham pursued  oh her husband replied  the vivid past held her a moment i see now i must have known a lot as a child  oh her companion repeated  i want him to take an interest in us above all in the children he ought to like usshe followed it up it will be a sort of poetic justice he sees the reasons for himself and we mustnt prevent it she turned the possibilities over but they produced a reserve the thing is i dont see how he can like harold  then he wont lend him money said brookenham with all his grimness  this contingency too she considered you make me feel as if i wished he wouldwhich is too dreadful and i dont think he really likes me she went on  oh her husband again ejaculated i mean not utterly really he has to try to but it wont make any difference she next remarked do you mean his trying  no i mean his not succeeding hell be just the same she saw it steadily and saw it whole on account of mamma  brookenham also with his perfect propriety put it before himself and will heon account of your motheralso like me  she weighed it no edward she covered him with her loveliest expression no not really either but it wont make any difference this time she had pulled him up  not if he doesnt like harold or like you or like me edward clearly found himself able to accept only the premise  hell be perfectly loyal it will be the advantage of mamma mrs brookenham cried mamma edward she brought out with a flash of solemnitymamma was wonderful there have been times when ive always felt her still with us but mr longdon makes it somehow so real whether shes with me or not at any rate shes with him so that when hes with me dont you see  it comes to the same thing her husband intelligently asked i see and when was he with you last  not since the day he dinedbut that was only last week hell come sooni know from van  and what does van know  oh all sorts of things he has taken the greatest fancy to him  the old boyto van  van to mr longdon and the other way too mr longdon has been most kind to him  brookenham still moved about well if he likes van and doesnt like us what good will that do us  youd understand soon enough if you felt vans loyalty  oh the things you expect me to feel my dear edward brookenham lightly moaned  well it doesnt matter but he is as loyal to me as mr longdon to mamma  the statement produced on his part an unusual vision of the comedy of things every jenny has her jockey yet perhapsremarkably enoughthere was even more imagination in his next words and what sort of means  mr longdon oh very good mamma wouldnt have been the loser not that she cared he must like nanda mrs brookenham wound up  her companion appeared to look at the idea and then meet it hell have to see her first  oh he shall see her she rang out its time for her at any rate to sit downstairs  it was time you know i thought a year ago  yes i know what you thought but it wasnt  she had spoken with decision but he seemed unwilling to concede the point you allowed yourself she was all ready  she was all readyyes but i wasnt i am now mrs brookenham with a fine emphasis on her adverb proclaimed as she turned to meet the opening of the door and the appearance of the butler whose announcementlord petherton and mr mitchettmight for an observer have seemed immediately to offer support to her changed state    iv  lord petherton a man of fiveandthirty whose robust but symmetrical proportions gave to his dark blue doublebreasted coat an air of tightness that just failed of compromising his tailor had for his main facial sign a certain pleasant brutality the effect partly of a bold handsome parade of carnivorous teeth partly of an expression of nose suggesting that this feature had paid a little in the heat of youth for some aggression at the time admired and even publicly commemorated he would have been ugly he substantively granted had he not been happy he would have been dangerous had he not been warranted many things doubtless performed for him this last service but none so much as the delightful sound of his voice the voice as it were of another man a nature reclaimed supercivilised adjusted to the perpetual chaff which kept him smiling in a way that would have been a mistake and indeed an impossibility if he had really been witty his bright familiarity was that of a young prince whose confidence had never had to falter and the only thing that at all qualified the resemblance was the equal familiarity excited in his subjects  mr mitchett had so little intrinsic appearance that an observer would have felt indebted for help in placing him to the rare prominence of his colourless eyes and the positive attention drawn to his chin by the precipitation of its retreat from discovery dressed on the other hand not as gentlemen dress in london to pay their respects to the fair he excited by the exhibition of garments that had nothing in common save the violence and the independence of their pattern a belief that in the desperation of humility he wished to render public his having thrown to the winds the effort to please it was written all over him that he had judged once for all his personal case and that as his character superficially disposed to gaiety deprived him of the resource of shyness and shade the effect of comedy might not escape him if secured by a real plunge there was comedy therefore in the form of his pothat and the colour of his spotted shirt in the systematic disagreement above all of his coat waistcoat and trousers it was only on long acquaintance that his so many ingenious ways of showing he appreciated his commonness could present him as secretly rare  and wheres the child this time he asked of his hostess as soon as he was seated near her  why do you say this time as if it were different from any other time she replied as she gave him his tea  only because as the months and the years elapse its more and more of a wonder whenever i dont see her to think what she does with herselfor what you do with her what it does show i suppose mr mitchett went on is that she takes no trouble to meet me  my dear mitchy said mrs brookenham what do you know about troubleeither poor nandas or mine or anybodys else youve never had to take any in your life youre the spoiled child of fortune and you skim over the surface of things in a way that seems often to represent you as supposing everybody else has wings most other people are sticking fast in their native mud  mud mrs brookmud mud he protestingly cried as while he watched his fellow visitor move to a distance with their host he glanced about the room taking in afresh the louis seize secretary which looked better closed than open and for which he always had a knowing eye remarkably charmingmud  well thats what a great deal of the element really appears today to be thought and precisely as a specimen mitchy dear those two french books you were so good as to send me and whichreally this time you extraordinary man she fell back intimately reproachful from the effect produced on her renouncing all expression save that of the rolled eye  why were they particularly dreadfulmitchy was honestly surprised i rather liked the one in the pink coverwhats the confounded thing calledi thought it had a sort of a somethingorother he had cast his eye about as if for a glimpse of the forgotten title and she caught the question as he vaguely and goodhumouredly dropped it  a kind of a morbid modernity there is that she dimly conceded  is that what they call it awfully good name you must have got it from old van he gaily declared  i dare say i did i get the good things from him and the bad ones from you but youre not to suppose mrs brookenham went on that ive discussed your horrible book with him  come i say mr mitchett protested ive seen you with books from vanderbank which if you have discussed them with himwell he laughed i should like to have been there  you havent seen me with anything like yoursno no never never she was particularly positive van on the contrary gives tremendous warnings makes apologies in advance for things thatwell after all havent killed one  that have even perhaps a little after the warnings let one down  she took no notice of this coarse pleasantry she simply adhered to her thesis one has taken ones dose and one isnt such a fool as to be deaf to some fresh true note if it happens to turn up but for abject horrid unredeemed vileness from beginning to end  so you read to the end mr mitchett interposed  i read to see what you could possibly have sent such things to me for and because so long as they were in my hands they were not in the hands of others please to remember in future that the children are all over the place and that harold and nanda have their nose in everything  i promise to remember mr mitchett returned as soon as you make old van do the same  i do make old vani pull old van up much oftener than i succeed in pulling you i must say mrs brookenham went on youre all getting to require among you in general an amount of what one may call editing she gave one of her droll universal sighs ive got your books at any rate locked up and i wish youd send for them quickly again ones too nervous about anything happening and their being perhaps found among ones relics charming literary remains she laughed  the friendly mitchy was also much amused by jove the most awful things are found have you heard about old randage and what his executors have just come across the most abominable  i havent heard she broke in and i dont want to but you give me a shudder and i beg youll have your offerings removed since i cant think of confiding them for the purpose to any one in this house i might burn them up in the dead of night but even then i should be fearfully nervous  ill send then my usual messenger said mitchy a person i keep for such jobs thoroughly seasoned as you may imagine and of a discretionwhat do you call ita toute epreuve only you must let me say that i like your terror about harold do you think he spends his time over dr wattss hymns  mrs brookenham just hesitated and nothing in general was so becoming to her as the act of hesitation dear mitchy do you know i want awfully to talk to you about harold  about his french reading mrs brook mitchy responded with interest the worse things are let me just mention to you about that the better they seem positively to be for ones feeling up in the language theyre more difficult the bad onesand theres a lot in that all the young men know itthose who are going up for exams  she had her eyes for a little on lord petherton and her husband then as if she had not heard what her interlocutor had just said she overcame her last scruple dear mitchy has he had money from you  he stared with his good goggle eyeshe laughed out why on earth but do you suppose id tell you if he had  he hasnt really borrowed the most dreadful sums  mitchy was highly diverted why should he for what please  thats just itfor what what does he do with it all what in the world becomes of it  well mitchy suggested hes saving up to start a business harolds irreproachablehasnt a vice who knows in these days what may happen he sees further than any young man i know do let him save  she looked far away with her sweet worldweariness if you werent an angel it would be a horror to be talking to you but i insist on knowing she insisted now with her absurdly pathetic eyes on him what kind of sums  you shall never never find outnot if you were never to speak to me again mr mitchett replied with extravagant firmness harolds one of my great amusementsi really have awfully few and if you deprive me of him youll be a fiend there are only one or two things i want to live for but one of them is to see how far harold will go please give me some more tea  do you positively swear she asked with intensity as she helped him then without waiting for his answer you have the common charity to us i suppose to see the position youd put us in fancy edward she quite austerely threw off  mr mitchett at this had on his side a wonder does edward imagine  my dear man edward never imagined anything in life she still had her eyes on him therefore if he sees a thing dont you know it must exist  mitchy for a little fixed the person mentioned as he sat with his other guest but whatever this person saw he failed just then to see his wifes companion whose eyes he never met his face only offered itself after the fashion of a clean domestic vessel a receptacle with the peculiar property of constantly serving yet never filling to lord pethertons talkative splash well only dont let him take it up let it be only between you and me mr mitchett pleaded keep him quietdont let him speak to me he appeared to convey with his pleasant extravagance that edward looked dangerous and he went on with a rigour of levity it must be our little quarrel  there were different ways of meeting such a tone but mrs brookenhams choice was remarkably prompt i dont think i quite understand what dreadful joke you may be making but i dare say if you had let harold borrow youd have another manner and i was at any rate determined to have the question out with you  let us always have everything outthats quite my own idea its you said mr mitchett who are by no means always so frank with me as i recogniseoh i do thatwhat it must have cost you to be over this little question of harold theres one thing mrs brook you do dodge  what do i ever dodge dear mitchy mrs brook quite tenderly asked  why when i ask you about your other child youre off like a frightened fawn when have you ever on my doing so said my darling mitchy ill ring for her to be asked to come down so that you can see her for yourselfwhen have you ever said anything like that  i see mrs brookenham mused you think i sacrifice her youre very interesting among you all and ive certainly a delightful circle the duchess has just been letting me have it most remarkably hot and as shes presently coming back youll be able to join forces with her  mitchy looked a little at a loss on the subject of your sacrifice  of my innocent and helpless yet somehow at the same time as a consequence of my cynicism dreadfully damaged and depraved daughter she took in for an instant the slight bewilderment against which as a result of her speech even so expert an intelligence as mr mitchetts had not been proof then with a small jerk of her head at the other side of the room made the quickest of transitions what is there between her and him  mitchy wondered at the other two between edward and the girl  dont talk nonsense between petherton and jane  mitchy could only stare and the wide noonday light of his regard was at such moments really the redemption of his ugliness what is there is there anything  its too beautiful mrs brookenham appreciatively sighed your relation with him you wont compromise him  it would be nicer of me mitchy laughed not to want to compromise her  oh jane mrs brookenham dropped does he like her she continued you must know  ah its just my knowing that constitutes the beauty of my loyaltyof my delicacy he had his quick jumps too am i never never to see the child  this enquiry appeared only to confirm his friend in the view of what was touching in him youre the most delicate thing i know and it crops up with effect the oddest in the intervals of your corruption your talks half the time impossible you respect neither age nor sex nor condition one doesnt know what youll say or do next and one has to return your bookscest tout direunder cover of darkness yet theres in the midst of all this and in the general abyss of you a little deepdown delicious niceness a sweet sensibility that one has actually ones self shocked as one perpetually is at you quite to hold ones breath and stay ones hand for fear of ruffling or bruising theres no one in talk with whom she balmily continued i find myself half so often suddenly moved to pull up short youve more little toes to tread onthough you pretend you havent i mean morally speaking dont you knowthan even i have myself and ive so many that i could wish most of them cut off you never spare me a shockno you dont do that it isnt the form your delicacy takes but youll know what i mean all the same i think when i tell you that there are lots i spare you  mr mitchett fairly glowed with the candour of his attention know what you mean dearest lady how can a man handicapped to death a man of my origin my appearance my general weaknesses drawbacks immense indebtedness all round for the start as it were that i feel my friends have been so good as to allow me how can such a man not be conscious every moment that every one about him goes on tiptoe and winks at every one else what can you all mention in my presence poor things that isnt personal  mrs brookenhams face covered him for an instant as no painted madonnas had ever covered the little charge at the breast beneath it and the finest thing of all in you is your beautiful beautiful pride youre prouder than all of us put together she checked a motion that he had apparently meant as a protestshe went on with her muffled wisdom there isnt a man but you whom petherton wouldnt have made vulgar he isnt vulgar himselfat least not exceptionally but hes just one of those people a class one knows well who are so fearfully in this country the cause of it in others for all i know hes the cause of it in methe cause of it even in poor edward for im vulgar mitchy dearvery often and the marvel of you is that you never are  thank you for everything thank you above all for marvel mitchy grinned  oh i know what i sayshe didnt in the least blush ill tell you something she pursued with the same gravity if youll promise to tell no one on earth if youre proud im not there its most extraordinary and i try to conceal it even to myself but theres no doubt whatever about itim not proud pour deux sous and some day on some awful occasion i shall show it soi notify you shall you love me still  to the bitter end mitchy loyally responded for how can how need a woman be proud whos so preternaturally clever prides only for use when wit breaks downits the train the cyclist takes when his tires deflated when that happens to your tire mrs brook youll let me know and you do make me wonder just now he confessed why youre taking such particular precautions and throwing out such a cloud of skirmishers if you want to shoot me dead a single bullet will do he faltered but an instant before completing his sense where you really want to come out is at the fact that nanda loathes me and that i might as well give up asking for her  are you quite serious his companion after a moment resumed do you really and truly like her mitchy  i like her as much as i dare toas much as a man can like a girl when from the very first of his seeing her and judging her he has also seen and seen with all the reasons that theres no chance for him whatever of course with all that he has done his best not to let himself go but there are moments mr mitchett ruefully added when it would relieve him awfully to feel free for a good spin  i think you exaggerate his hostess replied the difficulties in your way what do you mean by all the reasons  why one of them ive already mentioned i make her flesh creep  my own mitchy mrs brookenham protestingly moaned  the other is thatvery naturallyshes in love  with whom under the sun  mrs brookenham had with her startled stare met his eyes long enough to have taken something from him before he next spoke  you really have never suspected with whom conceivably but old van  nandas in love with old vanthe degree to which she had never suspected was scarce to be expressed why hes twice her agehe has seen her in a pinafore with a dirty face and well slapped for it he has never thought of her in the world  how can a person of your acuteness my dear woman mitchy asked mention such trifles as having the least to do with the case how can you possibly have such a fellow about so beastly goodlooking so infernally well turned out in the way of culture and so bringing them down in short on every side and expect in the bosom of your family the absence of history of the reigns of the good kings if you were a girl wouldnt you turn purple if i were a girl shouldnt iunless as is more likely i turned green  mrs brookenham was deeply affected nanda does turn purple  the loveliest shade you ever saw its too absurd that you havent noticed  it was characteristic of mrs brookenhams amiability that with her sudden sense of the importance of this new light she should be quite ready to abase herself there are so many things in ones life one follows false scents one doesnt make out everything at once if youre right you must help me we must see more of her  but what good will that do me mitchy appealed  dont you care enough for her to want to help her then before he could speak poor little darling dear his hostess tenderly ejaculated what does she think or dream truly shes laying up treasure  oh he likes her said mitchy he likes her in fact extremely  do you mean he has told you so  oh nowe never mention it but he likes her mr mitchett stubbornly repeated and hes thoroughly straight  mrs brookenham for a moment turned these things over after which she came out in a manner that visibly surprised him it isnt as if you wished to be nasty about him is itbecause i know you like him yourself youre so wonderful to your friendsoh she could let him see that she knewand in such different and exquisite ways there are those like himshe signified her other visitorwho get everything out of you and whom you really appear fond of or at least to put up with just for that then there are those who ask nothingand whom youre fond of in spite of it  mitchy leaned back from this fist within fist watching her with a certain disguised emotion he grinned almost too much for mere amusement thats the class to which you belong  its the best one she returned and im careful to remain in it you try to get us by bribery into the inferior place because proud as you are it bores you a little that you like us so much but we wont goat least i wont you may make van she wonderfully continued theres nothing you wouldnt do for him or give him mitchy admired her from his position slowly shaking his head with it hes the manwith no fortune and just as he is to the smallest particularwhom you would have liked to be whom you intensely envy and yet to whom youre magnanimous enough for almost any sacrifice  mitchys appreciation had fairly deepened to a flush magnificent magnificent mrs brook what are you in thunder up to  therefore as i say she imperturbably went on its not to do him an ill turn that you make a point of what youve just told me  mr mitchett for a minute gave no sign but his high colour and his queer glare how could it do him an ill turn  oh it would be a way dont you see to put before me the need of getting rid of him for he may like nanda as much as you please hell never never mrs brookenham resolutely quaveredhell never come to the scratch and to feel that as i do she explained can only be dont you also see to want to save her  it would have appeared at last that poor mitchy did see by taking it in time by forbidding him the house  she seemed to stand with little nipping scissors in a garden of alternatives or by shipping her off will you help me to save her she broke out again after a moment it isnt true she continued that she has any aversion to you  have you charged her with it mitchy demanded with a courage that amounted to high gallantry  it inspired on the spot his interlocutress and her own pluck of as fine a quality now as her diplomacy which was saying much fell but little below yes my dear friendfrankly  good then i know what she said  she absolutely denied it  oh yesthey always do because they pity me mitchy smiled she said what they always saythat the effect i produce is though at first upsetting one that little by little they find it possible to get used to the worlds full of people who are getting used to me mr mitchett concluded  its what i shall never do for youre quite too great a luxury mrs brookenham declared if i havent threshed you out really more with nanda she continued it has been from a scruple of a sort you people never do a woman the justice to impute youre the object of views that have so much more to set them off  mr mitchett on this jumped up he was clearly conscious of his nerves he fidgeted away a few steps and then his hands in his pockets fixed on his hostess a countenance more controlled what does the duchess mean by your daughters beingas i understood you to quote her just nowdamaged and depraved  mrs brookenham came upshe literally rosesmiling you fit the cap you know how shed like you for little aggie  what does she mean what does she mean mitchy repeated  the door as he spoke was thrown open mrs brookenham glanced round youve the chance to find out from herself the duchess had come back and little aggie was in her wake    v  that young lady in this relation was certainly a figure to have offered a foundation for the highest hopes as slight and white as delicately lovely as a gathered garden lily her admirable training appeared to hold her out to them all as with precautionary fingertips she presumed however so little on any introduction that shyly and submissively waiting for the word of direction she stopped short in the centre of the general friendliness till mrs brookenham fairly became to meet her also a shy little girlput out a timid hand with wonderstruck innocent eyes that hesitated whether a kiss of greeting might be dared why you dear good strange ickle thing you havent been here for ages but it is a joy to see you and i do hope youve brought your dollsuch might have been the sense of our friends fond murmur while looking at her up and down with pure pleasure she drew the rare creature to a sofa little aggie presented up and down an arrangement of dress exactly in the key of her age her complexion her emphasised virginity she might have been prepared for her visit by a cluster of doting nuns cloistered daughters of ancient houses and educators of similar products whose taste hereditarily good had grown out of the world and most delightfully so queer as to leave on everything they touched a particular shade of distinction the duchess had brought in with the child an air of added confidence for which an observer would in a moment have seen the grounds the association of the pair being so markedly favourable to each its younger member carried out the style of her aunts presence quite as one of the accessory figures effectively thrown into old portraits the duchess on the other hand seemed with becoming blandness to draw from her niece the dignity of a kind of office of statehereditary governess of the children of the blood little aggie had a smile as softly bright as a southern dawn and the friends of her relative looked at each other according to a fashion frequent in mrs brookenhams drawingroom in free exchange of their happy impression mr mitchett was none the less scantly diverted from his estimate of the occasion mrs brookenham had just named to him  my dear duchess he promptly asked do you mind explaining to me an opinion ive just heard of yourwith marked originalityholding  the duchess her head all in the air considered an instant her little ivory princess im always ready mr mitchett to defend my opinions but if its a question of going much into the things that are the subjects of some of them perhaps we had better if you dont mind choose our time and our place  no time gracious lady for my impatience mr mitchett replied could be better than the presentbut if youve reasons for wanting a better place why shouldnt we go on the spot into another room  lord petherton at this enquiry broke into instant mirth well of all the coolness mitchyhe does go at it doesnt he mrs brook what do you want to do in another room he demanded of his friend upon my word duchess under the nose of those  the duchess on the first blush lent herself to the humour of the case well petherton of thosei defy him to finish his sentence she smiled to the others  of those said his lordship who flatter themselves that when you do happen to find them somewhere your first idea is not quite to jump at a pretext for getting off somewhere else especially he continued to jest with a man of mitchys vile reputation  oh edward brookenham exclaimed at this but only as with quiet relief  mitchys offer is perfectly safe i may let him know his wife remarked for i happen to be sure that nothing would really induce jane to leave aggie five minutes among us here without remaining herself to see that we dont become improper  well then if were already pretty far on the way to it lord petherton resumed what on earth might we arrive at in the absence of your control i warn you duchess he joyously pursued that if you go out of the room with mitchy i shall rapidly become quite awful  the duchess during this brief passage never took her eyes from her niece who rewarded her attention with the sweetness of consenting dependence the childs foreign origin was so delicately but unmistakeably written in all her exquisite lines that her look might have expressed the modest detachment of a person to whom the language of her companions was unknown her protectress then glanced round the circle youre very odd people all of you and i dont think you quite know how ridiculous you are aggie and i are simple strangerfolk theres a great deal we dont understand yet were none the less not easily frightened in what is it mr mitchett the duchess asked that ive wounded your susceptibilities  mr mitchett cast about he had apparently found time to reflect on his precipitation i see what pethertons up to and i wont by drawing you aside just now expose your niece to anything that might immediately oblige mrs brook to catch her up and flee with her but the first time i find you more isolatedwell he laughed though not with the clearest ring all i can say is mind your eyes dear duchess  its about your thinking jane mrs brookenham placidly explained that nanda suffersin her morals dont you knowby my neglect i wouldnt say anything about you that i cant bravely say to you therefore since he has plumped out with it i do confess that ive appealed to him on what as so good an old friend he thinks of your contention  what in the world is janes contention edward brookenham put the question as if they were stuck at cards  you really all of you the duchess replied with excellent coolness choose extraordinary conditions for the discussion of delicate matters there are decidedly too many things on which we dont feel alike youre all inconceivable just now je ne peux pourtant pas la mettre a la porte cette cheriewhom she covered again with the gay solicitude that seemed to have in it a vibration of private entreaty dont understand my own darlingdont understand  little aggie looked about with an impartial politeness that as an expression of the general blind sense of her being as to every particular in hands at full liberty either to spot or to spare her was touching enough to bring tears to all eyes it perhaps had to do with the sudden emotion with whichusing now quite a different mannermrs brookenham again embraced her and even with this ladys equally abrupt and altogether wonderful address to her between you and me straight my dear and as from friend to friend i know youll never doubt that everything must be all rightwhat i spoke of to poor mitchy she went on to the duchess is the dreadful view you take of my letting nanda go to tishyand indeed of the general question of any acquaintance between young unmarried and young married females mr mitchetts sufficiently interested in us jane to make it natural of me to take him into our confidence in one of our difficulties on the other hand we feel your solicitude and i neednt tell you at this time of day what weight in every respect we attach to your judgement therefore it will be a difficulty for us cara mia dont you see if we decide suddenly under the spell of your influence that our daughter must break off a friendshipit will be a difficulty for us to put the thing to nanda herself in such a way as that she shall have some sort of notion of what suddenly possesses us then therell be the much stiffer job of putting it to poor tishy yet if her house is an impossible place what else is one to do carrie donners to be there and carrie donners a nature apart but how can we ask even a little lamb like tishy to give up her own sister  the question had been launched with an argumentative sharpness that made it for a moment keep possession of the air and during this moment before a single member of the circle could rally mrs brookenhams effect was superseded by that of the reappearance of the butler i say my dear dont shriekedward brookenham had only time to sound this warning before a lady presenting herself in the open doorway followed close on the announcement of her name mrs beach donnerthe impression was naturally marked every one betrayed it a little but mrs brookenham who more than the others appeared to have the help of seeing that by a merciful stroke her visitor had just failed to hear this visitor a young woman of striking of startling appearance who in the manner of certain shiny housedoors and railings instantly created a presumption of the lurking label fresh paint found herself with an embarrassment oddly opposed to the positive pitch of her complexion in the presence of a group in which it was yet immediately evident that every one was a friend every one to show no one had been caught said something extremely easy so that it was after a moment only poor mrs donner who seated close to her hostess seemed to be in any degree in the wrong this moreover was essentially her fault so extreme was the anomaly of her having without the means to back it up committed herself to a scheme of colour that was practically an advertisement of courage irregularly pretty and painfully shy she was retouched from brow to chin like a suburban photographthe moral of which was simply that she should either have left more to nature or taken more from art the duchess had quickly reached her kinsman with a smothered hiss an edward dear for gods sake take aggie and at the end of a few minutes had formed for herself in one of mrs brookenhams admirable corners a society consisting of lord petherton and mr mitchett the latter of whom regarded mrs donner across the room with articulate wonder and compassion  its all right its all rightshes frightened only at herself  the duchess watched her as from a box at the play comfortably shut in as in the old operatic days at naples with a pair of entertainers youre the most interesting nation in the world one never gets to the end of your hatred of the nuance the sense of the suitable the harmony of partswhat on earth were you doomed to do that to be punished sufficiently in advance you had to be deprived of it in your very cradles look at her little black dressrather good but not so good as it ought to be and mixed up with all the rest see her type her beauty her timidity her wickedness her notoriety and her impudeur its only in this country that a woman is both so shocking and so shaky the duchesss displeasure overflowed if she doesnt know how to be good  let her at least know how to be bad ah mitchy replied your irritation testifies more than anything else could do to our peculiar genius or our peculiar want of it our vice is intolerably clumsyif it can possibly be a question of vice in regard to that charming child who looks like one of the newfashioned billposters only in the way of morbid modernity as mrs brook would say more extravagant and funny than any that have yet been risked i remember he continued mrs brooks having spoken of her to me lately as wild wildwhy shes simply tameness run to seed such an expression shows the state of training to which mrs brook has reduced the rest of us  it doesnt prevent at any rate mrs brooks training some of the rest of you from being horrible the duchess declared what did you mean just now really by asking me to explain before aggie this so serious matter of nandas exposure then instantly taking herself up before mr mitchett could answer what on earth do you suppose edwards saying to my darling  brookenham had placed himself side by side with the child on a distant little settee but it was impossible to make out from the countenance of either if a sound had passed between them aggies little manner was too developed to show and her hosts not developed enough oh hes awfully careful lord petherton reassuringly observed if you or i or mitchy say anything bad its sure to be before we know it and without particularly meaning it but old edward means it  so much that as a general thing he doesnt dare to say it the duchess asked thats a pretty picture of him inasmuch as for the most part he never speaks what therefore must he mean  hes an abysshes magnificent mr mitchett laughed i dont know a man of an understanding more profound and hes equally incapable of uttering and of wincing if by the same token im horrible as you call me he pursued its only because im in everyway so beastly superficial all the same i do sometimes go into things and i insist on knowing he again broke out what it exactly was you had in mind in saying to mrs brook the things about nanda and myself that she repeated to me  you insist you silly manthe duchess had veered a little to indulgence pray on what ground of right in such a connexion do you do anything of the sort  poor mitchy showed but for a moment that he felt pulled up do you mean that when a girl liked by a fellow likes him so little in return  i dont mean anything said the duchess that may provoke you to suppose me vulgar and odious enough to try to put you out of conceit of a most interesting and unfortunate creature and i dont quite as yet seethough i dare say i shall soon make outwhat our friend has in her head in tattling to you on these matters as soon as my backs turned petherton will tell youi wonder he hasnt told you beforewhy mrs grendon though not perhaps herself quite the rose is decidedly in these days too near it  oh petherton never tells me anything mitchys answer was brisk and impatient but evidently quite as sincere as if the person alluded to had not been there  the person alluded to meanwhile fidgeting frankly in his chair alternately stretching his legs and resting his elbows on his knees had reckoned as small the profit he might derive from this colloquy his bored state indeedif he was boredprompted in him the honest impulse to clear as he would have perhaps considered it the atmosphere he indicated mrs donner with a remarkable absence of precautions why what the duchess alludes to is my poor sister fannys stupid grievancesurely you know about that he made oddly vivid for a moment the nature of his relatives allegation his somewhat cynical treatment of which became peculiarly derisive in the light of the attitude and expression at that minute of the figure incriminated my brotherinlaws too thick with her but cashmores such a fine old ass its excessively unpleasant he added for affairs are just in that position in which from one day to another there may be something that people will get hold of fancy a man he robustly reflected while the three took in more completely the subject of mrs brookenhams attentionfancy a man with that odd piece on his hands the beauty of it is that the two women seem never to have broken off blest if they dont still keep seeing each other  the duchess as on everything else passed succinctly on this ah how can hatreds comfortably flourish without the nourishment of such regular seeing as what you call here bosom friendship alone supplies what are parties given for in london butthat enemies may meet i grant you its inconceivable that the husband of a superb creature like your sister should find his requirements better met by an object comme cette petite who looks like a penwiperan actresss idea of onemade up for a theatrical bazaar at the same time if youll allow me to say so it scarcely strikes one that your sisters prudence is such as to have placed all the cards in her hands shes the most beautiful woman in england but her esprit de conduite isnt quite on a level one cant have everything she philosophically sighed  lord petherton met her comfortably enough on this assumption of his detachments if you mean by that her being the biggest fool alive im quite ready to agree with you its exactly what makes me afraid yet how can i decently say in especial he asked of what  the duchess still perched on her critical height of what but one of your amazing english periodical public washings of dirty linen theres not the least necessity to say she laughed if theres anything more remarkable than these purifications its the domestic comfort with which when all has come and gone you sport the articles purified  it comes back in all that sphere mr mitchett instructively opined to our national our fatal want of style we can never dear duchess take too many lessons and theres probably at the present time no more useful function to be performed among us than that dissemination of neater methods to which youre so good as to contribute  he had had another idea but before he reached it his companion had gaily broken in awfully good one for you duchessand im bound to say that for a clever woman you exposed yourself ive at any rate a sense of comfort lord petherton pursued in the good relations now more and more established between poor fanny and mrs brook mrs brooks awfully kind to her and awfully sharp and fanny will take things from her that she wont take from me i keep saying to mrs brookdont you knowdo keep hold of her and let her have it strong she hasnt upon my honour any one in the world but me  and we know the extent of that resource the duchess freely commented  thats exactly what fanny saysthat she knows it petherton goodhumouredly agreed she says my beastly hypocrisy makes her sick there are people he pleasantly rambled on who are awfully free with their advice but its mostly fearful rot mrs brooks isnt upon my wordive tried some myself  you talk as if it were something nasty and homemadegooseberry wine the duchess laughed but one cant know the dear soul of course without knowing that she has set up for the convenience of her friends a little office for consultations she listens to the case she strokes her chin and prescribes  and the beauty of it is cried lord petherton that she makes no charge whatever  she doesnt take a guinea at the time but you may still get your account the duchess returned of course we know that the great business she does is in husbands and wives  this then seems the day of the wives mr mitchett interposed as he became aware the first of the illustration the duchesss image was in the act of receiving lady fanny cashmorethe butler was already in the field and the company with the exception of mrs donner who remained seated was apparently conscious of a vibration that brought it afresh but still more nimbly than on aggies advent to its feet    vi  go to her straightbe nice to her you must have plenty to say you stay with mewe have our affair the latter of these commands the duchess addressed to mr mitchett while their companion in obedience to the former and affected as it seemed by an unrepressed familiar accent that stirred a fresh flicker of mitchys grin met the new arrival in the middle of the room before mrs brookenham had had time to reach her the duchess quickly reseated watched an instant the inexpressive concussion of the tall brother and sister then while mitchy again subsided into his place youre not as a race clever youre not delicate youre not sane but youre capable of extraordinary good looks she resumed vous avez parfois la grande beaute  mitchy was much amused do you really think petherton has  the duchess withstood it theyve got both outside and in the same great general things only turned in each rather different ways a way safer for him as a man and more triumphant for her aswhatever you choose to call her what can a woman do she richly mused with such beauty as that  except come desperately to advise with mrs brookmitchy undertook to complete her questionas to the highest use to make of it but see he immediately added how perfectly competent to instruct her our friend now looks their hostess had advanced to lady fanny with an outstretched hand but with an eagerness of greeting merged a little in the sweet predominance of wonder as well as in the habit at such moments most perceptible of the languid lilybend nothing in general could have been less conventionally poor than the kind of reception given in mrs brookenhams drawingroom to the particular elementthe element of physical splendour void of those disparities that make the question of others tiresomecomprised in lady fannys presence it was a place in which at all times before interesting objects the unanimous occupants almost more concerned for each others vibrations than for anything else were apt rather more to exchange sharp and silent searchings than to fix their eyes on the object itself in the case of lady fanny however the object itselfand quite by the same law that had worked though less profoundly on the entrance of little aggiesuperseded the usual rapt communion very much in the manner of some beautiful tame tigress who might really coerce attention there was in mrs brookenhams way of looking up at her a dim despairing abandonment of the idea of any common personal ground lady fanny magnificent simple stupid had almost the stature of her brother a forehead unsurpassably low and an air of sombre concentration just sufficiently corrected by something in her movements that failed to give it a point her blue eyes were heavy in spite of being perhaps a couple of shades too clear and the wealth of her black hair the disposition of the massive coils of which was all her own had possibly a satin sheen depreciated by the current fashion but the great thing in her was that she was with unconscious heroism thoroughly herself and what were mrs brook and mrs brooks intimates after all in their free surrender to the play of perception but a happy association for keeping her so the duchess was moved to the liveliest admiration by the grand simple sweetness of her encounter with mrs donner a combination indeed in which it was a question if she or mrs brook appeared to the higher advantage it was poor mrs donnernot like mrs brook subtle in sufficiency nor like lady fanny almost too simplewho made the poorest show the duchess immediately marked it to mitchy as infinitely characteristic that their hostess instead of letting one of her visitors go kept them together by some sweet ingenuity and while lord petherton dropping his sister joined edward and aggie in the other angle sat there between them as if in pursuance of some awfully clever line of her own she were holding a hand of each mr mitchett of course did justice all round or at least as would have seemed from an enquiry he presently made wished not to fail of it is it your real impression then that lady fanny has serious grounds  for jealousy of that preposterous little person my dear mitchett the duchess resumed after a moments reflexion if youre so rash as to ask me in any of these connexions for my real impression you deserve whatever you may get the penalty mitchy had incurred was apparently grave enough to make his companion just falter in the infliction of it which gave him the opportunity of replying that the little person was perhaps not more preposterous than any one else that there was something in her he rather liked and that there were many different ways in which a woman could be interesting this further levity it was therefore that laid him fully open do you mean to say youve been living with petherton so long without becoming aware that hes shockingly worried  my dear duchess mitchy smiled petherton carries his worries with a bravery theyre so many that ive long since ceased to count them and in general ive been disposed to let those pass that i cant help him to meet youve made i judge he went on a better use of opportunities perhaps not so goodsuch as at any rate enables you to see further than i into the meaning of the impatience he just now expressed  the duchess was admirable in conversation for neglecting everything not essential to her present plausibility a woman like lady fanny can have no grounds for anythingfor any indignation i mean or for any revenge worth twopence in this particular case at all events theyve been sacrificed with such extravagance that as an injured wife she hasnt had the gumption to keep back an inch or two to stand on she can do absolutely nothing  then you take the view mitchy who had after all his delicacies pulled up as at sight of a name  i take the view said the duchess and i know exactly why elle se les passeher little fancies shes a phenomenon poor dear and all withwhat shall i call itthe absence of haunting remorse of a good housemother who makes the family accounts balance she looksand its what they love her for here when they say watch her nowlike an angry saint but shes neither a saint nor to be perfectly fair to her really angry at all she has only just enough reflexion to make out that it may some day be a little better for her that her husband shall on his side too have committed himself and shes only in secret too pleased to be sure whom it has been with all the same i must tell you the duchess still more crisply added that our little friend nanda is of the opinionwhich i gather her to be quite ready to defendthat lady fannys wrong  poor mitchy found himself staring but what has our little friend nanda to do with it  what indeed bless her heart if you will ask questions however you must take as i say your risks there are days when between you all you stupefy me one of them was when i happened about a month ago to make some allusion to the charming example of mr cashmores fine taste that we have there before us what was my surprise at the tone taken by mrs brook to deny on this little ladys behalf the soft impeachment it was quite a mistake that anything had happenedmrs donner had pulled through unscathed she had been but a day or two at the most in danger for her family and friendsthe best influenceshad rallied to her support the flurry was all over she was now perfectly safe do you think she looks so the duchess asked  this was not a point that mitchy was conscious of freedom of mind to examine do i understand you that nanda was her mothers authority  for the exact shade of the intimacy of the two friends and the state of mrs brooks information preciselyit was the latest before going to press our own correspondent her mother quoted her  mr mitchett visibly wondered but how should nanda know  anything about the matter how should she not know everything youve not i suppose lost sight of the fact that this lady and mrs grendon are sisters carries situation and carries perils are naturally very present to the extremely unoccupied tishy who is unhappily married into the bargain who has no children and whose house as you may imagine has a good thick atmosphere of partisanship so as with nanda on her side theres no more absorbing interest than her dear friend tishy with whom shes at present staying and under whose roof she perpetually meets this victim of unjust aspersions  i see the whole thing from here you imply mr mitchett under the influence of this rapid evocation had already taken his line well he said bravely nandas not a fool  a momentary silence on the part of the duchess might have been her tribute to his courage no i dont agree with her as it happens here but that there are matters as to which shes not in general at all befogged is exactly the worst i ever said of her and i hold that in putting it soon the basis of my little anecdoteyou clearly give out that youre answered  mitchy turned it over answered  in the quarrel that a while back you sought to pick with me what i touched on to her mother was the peculiar range of aspects and interests shes compelled to cultivate by the special intimacies that mrs brook permits her there they areand thats all i said judge them for yourself  the duchess had risen as she spoke which was also what mrs donner and mrs brookenham had done and mr mitchett was on his feet as well to act on this last admonition mrs donner was taking leave and there occurred among the three ladies in connexion with the circumstance a somewhat striking exchange of endearments mr mitchett observing this expressed himself suddenly as diverted by jove theyre kissingshes in lady fannys arms but his hilarity was still to deepen and lady fanny by jove is in mrs brooks  oh its all beyond me the duchess cried and the little wail of her baffled imagination had almost the austerity of a complaint  not a bittheyre all right mrs brook has acted mitchy went on  ah it isnt that she doesnt act his interlocutress ejaculated  mrs donners face presented as she now crossed the room something that resembled the ravage of a deathstruggle between its artificial and its natural elegance well mitchy said with decision as he caught iti back nanda and while a whiff of derision reached him from the duchess nothing has happened he murmured  as to reward him for an indulgence that she must much more have divined than overheard the visitor approached him with her sweet bravery of alarm i go on thursday to my sisters where i shall find nanda brookenham can i take her any message from you  mr mitchett showed a rosiness that might positively have been reflected why should you dream of her expecting one  oh said the duchess with a cheer that but half carried off her asperity mrs brook must have told mrs donner to ask you  the latter lady at this rested strange eyes on the speaker and they had perhaps something to do with a quick flare of mitchys wit tell her pleaseif as i suppose you came here to ask the same of her motherthat i adore her still more for keeping in such happy relations with you as enable me thus to meet you  mrs donner overwhelmed took flight with a nervous laugh leaving mr mitchett and the duchess still confronted nothing had passed between the two ladies yet it was as if there were a trace of something in the eyes of the elder which during a moments silence moved from the retreating visitor now formally taken over at the door by edward brookenham to lady fanny and her hostess who in spite of the embraces just performed had again subsided together while mrs brook gazed up in exalted intelligence its a funny house said the duchess at last she makes me such a scene over my not bringing aggie and still more over my very faint hint of my reasons for it that i fly off in compunction to do what i can on the spot to repair my excess of prudence i reappear panting with my nieceand its to this company i introduce her  her companion looked at the charming child to whom lord petherton was talking with evident kindness and gaietya conjunction that evidently excited mitchys interest may we then know her he asked with an effect of drollery may iif he may  the duchesss eyes turned to him had taken another light he even gaped a little at their expression which was in a manner carried out by her tone go and talk to her you perverse creature and send him over to me lord petherton a minute later had joined her old edward had left the room with mrs donner his wife and lady fanny were still more closely engaged and the young agnesina though visibly a little scared at mitchys queer countenance had begun after the fashion he had touched on to mrs brook politely to invoke the aid of the idea of habit look hereyou must help me the duchess said to petherton you can perfectlyand its the first thing ive yet asked of you  oh oh oh her interlocutor laughed  i must have mitchy she went on without noticing his particular shade of humour  mitchy toohe appeared to wish to leave her in no doubt of it  how low you are she simply said there are times when i despair of you hes in every way your superior and i like him so thatwell he must like her make him feel that he does  lord petherton turned it over as something put to him practically i could wish for him that he would i see in her possibilities he continued to laugh  i dare say you do i see them in mitchett and i trust youll understand me when i say i appeal to you  appeal to him straight thats much better petherton lucidly observed  the duchess wore for a moment her proudest air which made her in the connexion exceptionally gentle he doesnt like me  her interlocutor looked at her with all his bright brutality oh my dear i can speak for youif thats what you want  the duchess met his eyes and so for an instant they sounded each other youre so abysmally coarse that i often wonder but as the door reopened she caught herself it was the effect of a face apparently directed at her be quiet heres old edward     book third mr longdon  if mitchy arrived exactly at the hour it was quite by design and on a calculationover and above the prized little pleasure it might give himof ten minutes clear with his host whom it rarely befell him to see alone he had a theory of something special to go into of a plummet to sink or a feeler to put forth his state of mind in short was diplomatic and anxious but his hopes had a drop as he crossed the threshold his precaution had only assured him the company of a stranger for the person in the room to whom the servant announced him was not old van on the other hand this gentleman would clearly be oldwhat was it the fellow vanderbank had made it a matter of such importance he should really know but were they then simply to have tea there together no the candidate for mr mitchetts acquaintance as if quickly guessing his apprehension mentioned on the spot that their entertainer would be with them he had just come home in a hurry fearing he was late and then had rushed off to make a change fortunately said the speaker who offered his explanation as if he had had it on his mindfortunately the ladies havent yet come  oh there are to be ladiesmr mitchett was all response his fellow guest who was shy and apparently nervous sidled about a little swinging an eyeglass yet glancing in a manner a trifle birdlike from object to object mrs edward brookenham i think  oh mitchy himself felt as soon as this comment had quitted his lips that it might sound even to a stranger like a sign such as the votaries of mrs edward brookenham had fallen into the way of constantly throwing off that he recognised her hand in the matter there was however something in his entertainers face that somehow encouraged frankness it had the sociability of surpriseit hadnt the chill mitchy saw at the same time that this friend of old vans would never really understand him though that was a thing he at times liked people as much for as he liked them little for it at others it was in fact when he most liked that he was on the whole most tempted to mystify only mrs brookno others  mrs brook his elder echoed staring an instant as if literally missing the connexion but quickly after to show he was not stupidand indeed it seemed to show he was delightfulsmiling with extravagant intelligence is that the right thing to say  mitchy gave the kindest of laughs well i dare say i oughtnt to  oh i didnt mean to correct you his interlocutor hastened to profess i meant on the contrary will it be right for me too  mitchys great goggle attentively fixed him try it  to her  to every one  to her husband  oh to edward mitchy laughed again perfectly  and must i call him edward  whatever you do will be right mitchy returnedeven though it should happen to be sometimes what i do  his companion as if to look at him with a due appreciation of this stopped swinging the nippers and put them on you people here have a pleasant way  oh we havemitchy taking him up was gaily emphatic he began however already to perceive the mystification which in this case was to be his happy effect  mr vanderbank his victim remarked with perhaps a shade more of reserve has told me a good deal about you then as if in a finer manner to keep the talk off themselves he knows a great many ladies  oh yes poor chap he cant help it he finds a lady wherever he turns  the stranger took this in but seemed a little to challenge it well thats reassuring if one sometimes fancies there are fewer  fewer than there used to bei see what you mean said mitchy but if it has struck you so thats awfully interesting he glared and grinned and mused i wonder  well we shall see his friend seemed to wish not to dogmatise  shall we mitchy considered it again in its high suggestive light you willbut how shall i then he caught himself up with a blush what a beastly thing to sayas if it were mere years that make you see it  his companion this time gave way to the joke what else can it beif ive thought so  why its the facts themselves and the fine taste and above all something qui ne court pas les rues an approach to some experience of what a lady is the young mans acute reflexion appeared suddenly to flower into a vision of opportunity that swept everything else away excuse my insisting on your time of lifebut you have seen some the question was of such interest that he had already begun to follow it oh the charm of talk with some one who can fill out ones idea of the really distinguished women of the past if i could get you he continued to be so awfully valuable as to fill out mine  his fellow visitor on this made in a pause a nearer approach to taking visibly his measure are you sure youve got an idea mr mitchett brightly thought no that must be just why i appeal to you and it cant therefore be for confirmation can it he went on it must be for the beautiful primary hint altogether  his interlocutor began with a shake of the eyeglass to shift and sidle again as if distinctly excited by the subject but it was as if his very excitement made the poor gentleman a trifle coy are there no nice ones now  oh yes there must be lots in fact i know quantities  this had the effect of pulling the stranger up ah quantities there it is  yes said mitchy fancy the lady in her millions have you come up to london wondering as you must about whats happeningfor vanderbank mentioned i think that you have come upin pursuit of her  ah laughed the subject of vanderbanks information im afraid pursuit with me is over  why youre at the age mitchy returned ofthe most exquisite form of it observation  yet its a form i seem to see that youve not waited for my age to cultivate this was followed by a decisive headshake im not an observer im a hater  that only means mitchy explained that you keep your observation for your likeswhich is more admirable than prudent but between my fear in the one direction and my desire in the other he lightly added i scarcely know how to present myself i must study the ground meanwhile has old van told you much about me  old vans possible confidant instead of immediately answering again assumed the pincenez is that what you call him  in general i thinkfor shortness  and alsothe speaker hesitatedfor esteem  mitchy laughed out for veneration our disrespects i think are all tender and we wouldnt for the world do to a person we dont like anything so nice as to call him or even to call her dont you know  his questioner had quickly looked as if he knew something pleasant and vulgar  mitchys gaiety deepened that discriminations our only austerity you must fall in  then what will you call me  what can we after which sustainingly im mitchy our friend stated  his interlocutor looked slightly queer i dont think i can quite begin im mr longdon he almost blushed to articulate  absolutely and essentiallythats exactly what i recognise i defy any one to see you mitchy declared as anything else and on that footing youll be among us unique  mr longdon appeared to accept his prospect of isolation with a certain gravity i gather from youive gathered indeed from mr vanderbankthat youre a little sort of a set that hang very much together  oh yes not a formal association nor a secret societystill less a dangerous gang or an organisation for any definite end were simply a collection of natural affinities mitchy explained meeting perhaps principally in mrs brooks drawingroomthough sometimes also in old vans as you see sometimes even in mineand governed at any rate everywhere by mrs brook in our mysterious ebbs and flows very much as the tides are governed by the moon as i say mitchy pursued you must join but if van has got hold of you he added or youve got hold of him you have joined were not quite so numerous as i could wish and we want variety we want just what im sure youll bring usa fresh eye an outside mind  mr longdon wore for a minute the air of a man knowing but too well what it was to be asked to put down his name my friend vanderbank swaggers so little that its rather from you than from himself that i seem to catch the idea  of his being a great figure among us i dont know what he may have said to you or have suppressed but you can take it from meas between ourselves you knowthat hes very much the best of us old van in factif you really want a candid opinion and mitchy shone still brighter as he talked is formed for a distinctly higher sphere i should go so far as to say that on our level hes positively wasted  and are you very sure youre not mr longdon asked with a smile  dear noim in my element my elements to grovel before van youve only to look at me as you must already have made out to see im everything dreadful that he isnt but youve seen him for yourselfi neednt tell you mitchy sighed  mr longdon as under the coercion of so much confidence had stood in place longer than for any previous moment and the spell continued for a minute after mitchy had paused then nervously and abruptly he turned away his friend watching him rather aimlessly wander our host has spoken of you to me in high terms he said as he came back youd have no fault to find with them  mitchy took it with his highest light i know from your taking the trouble to remember that how much what ive said of him pleases and touches you were a little sort of religion then you and i were an organisation of two at any rate and we cant help ourselves therethats settled he glanced at the clock on the chimney but whats the matter with him  you gentlemen dress so much said mr longdon  mitchy met the explanation quite halfway i try to look funnybut why should apollo in person  mr longdon weighed it do you think him like apollo  the very image ask any of the women  but do i know  how apollo must look mitchy considered why the way it works is that its just from vans appearance they get the tip and that then dont you see theyve their term of comparison isnt it what you call a vicious circle i borrow a little their vice  mr longdon who had once more been arrested once more sidled away then he spoke from the other side of the expanse of a table covered with books for which the shelves had no spacecovered with portfolios with wellworn leathercased boxes with documents in neat piles the place was a miscellany yet not a litter the picture of an admirable order if were a fond association of two you and i let me accepting your idea do what this way under a gentlemans roof and while enjoying his hospitality i should in ordinary circumstances think perhaps something of a breach  oh strike out mitchy laughed it possibly chilled his interlocutor who again hung fire so long that he himself at last adopted his image why doesnt he marry you mean  mr longdon fairly flushed with recognition youre very deep but with what we perceivewhy doesnt he  mitchy continued visibly to have his amusement which might have been this time and in spite of the amalgamation he had pictured for what they perceived but he threw off after an instant an answer clearly intended to meet the case he thinks he hasnt the means he has great ideas of what a fellow must offer a woman  mr longdons eyes travelled a while over the amenities about him he hasnt such a view of himself alone  as to make him think hes enough as he stands no said mitchy i dont fancy he has a very awful view of himself alone and since we are burning this incense under his nose he added its also my impression that he has no private means women in london cost so much  mr longdon had a pause they come very high i dare say  oh tremendously they want so muchthey want everything i mean the sort of women he lives with a modest manwhos also poorisnt in it i give you that at any rate as his view there are lots of them that wouldand only too gladlove him for himself but things are much mixed and these not necessarily the right ones and at all events he doesnt see it the result of which is that hes waiting  waiting to feel himself in love  mitchy just hesitated well were talking of marriage of course youll say there are women with money there arehe seemed for a moment to meditatedreadful ones  the two men on this exchanged a long regard he mustnt do that  mitchy again hesitated he wont  mr longdon had also a silence which he presently terminated by one of his jerks into motion he shant  once more mitchy watched him revolve a little but now familiarly yet with a sharp emphasis he himself resumed their colloquy see here mr longdon are you seriously taking him up  yet again at the tone of this appeal the old man perceptibly coloured it was as if his friend had brought to the surface an inward excitement and he laughed for embarrassment you see things with a freedom  yes and its so i express them i see them i know with a raccourci but time after all rather presses and at any rate we understand each other what i want now is just to sayand mitchy spoke with a simplicity and a gravity he had not yet usedthat if your interest in him should at any time reach the point of your wishing to do something or other no matter what dont you see for him  mr longdon as he faltered appeared to wonder but emitted a sound of gentleness yes  why said the stimulated mitchy do for gods sake just let me have a finger in it  mr longdons momentary mystification was perhaps partly but the natural effect of constitutional prudence a finger  i meanlet me help  oh breathed the old man thoughtfully and without meeting his eyes  mitchy as if with more to say watched him an instant then before speaking caught himself up look outhere he comes  hearing the stir of the door by which he had entered he looked round but it opened at first only to admit vanderbanks servant miss brookenham the man announced on which the two gentlemen in the room wereaudibly almost violentlyprecipitated into a union of surprise    ii  however she might have been discussed nanda was not one to shrink for though she drew up an instant on failing to find in the room the person whose invitation she had obeyed she advanced the next moment as if either of the gentlemen before her would answer as well how do you do mr mitchy how do you do mr longdon she made no difference for them speaking to the elder whom she had not yet seen as if they were already acquainted there was moreover in the air of that personage at this juncture little to invite such a confidence he appeared to have been startled in the oddest manner into stillness and holding out no hand to meet her only stared rather stiffly and without a smile an observer disposed to interpret the scene might have fancied him a trifle put off by the girls familiarity or even as by a singular effect of her selfpossession stricken into deeper diffidence this selfpossession however took on her own part no account of any awkwardness it seemed the greater from the fact that she was almost unnaturally grave and it overflowed in the immediate challenge do you mean to say van isnt here ive come without mothershe said i could to see him she went on addressing herself more particularly to mitchy but she didnt say i might do anything of that sort to see you  if there was something serious in nanda and something blank in their companion there was superficially at least nothing in mr mitchett but his usual flush of gaiety did she really send you off this way alone then while the girls face met his own with the clear confession of it isnt she too splendid for anything he asked with immense enjoyment what do you suppose is her idea nandas eyes had now turned to mr longdon whom she fixed with her mild straightness which led to mitchys carrying on and repeating the appeal isnt mrs brook charming what do you suppose is her idea  it was a bound into the mystery a bound of which his fellow visitor stood quite unconscious only looking at nanda still with the same coldness of wonder all expression had for the minute been arrested in mr longdon but he at last began to show that it had merely been retarded yet it was almost with solemnity that he put forth his hand how do you do how do you do im so glad  nanda shook hands with him as if she had done so already though it might have been just her look of curiosity that detracted from her air of amusing herself mother has wanted me awfully to see you she told me to give you her love she said then she added with odd irrelevance i didnt come in the carriage nor in a cab nor an omnibus  you came on a bicycle mitchy enquired  no i walked she still spoke without a gleam mother wants me to do everything  even to walk mitchy laughed oh yes we must in these times keep up our walking the ingenious observer just now suggested might even have detected in the still higher rise of this visitors spirits a want of mere inward ease  she had taken no notice of the effect upon him of her mention of her mother and she took none visibly of mr longdons manner or of his words what she did while the two men without offering her either a seat practically lost themselves in their deepening vision was to give her attention all to the place looking at the books pictures and other significant objects and especially at the small table set out for tea to which the servant who had admitted her now returned with a steaming kettle isnt it charming here will there be any one else where is mr van shall i make tea there was just a faint quaver showing a command of the situation more desired perhaps than achieved in the very rapid sequence of these ejaculations the servant meanwhile had placed the hot water above the little silver lamp and left the room  do you suppose theres anything the matter oughtnt the manor do you know our hosts room mr longdon addressing mitchy with solicitude yet began to show in a countenance less blank a return of his sense of relations it was as if something had happened to him and he were in haste to convert the signs of it into an appearance of care for the proprieties  oh said mitchy vans only making himself beautifulwhich account of their absent entertainer gained a point from his appearance at the moment in the doorway furthest removed from the place where the three were gathered  vanderbank came in with friendly haste and with something of the look indeedrefreshed almost rosy brightly brushed and quickly buttonedof emerging out of breath from pleasant ablutions and renewals what a brute to have kept you waiting i came back from work quite begrimed how dye do how dye do how dye do whats the matter with you huddled there as if you were on a streetcrossing i want you to think this a refugebut not of that kind he laughed sit down for heavens sake lie downbe happy of course youve made acquaintance allexcept that mitchys so modest tea teaand he bustled to the table where the next minute he appeared rather helpless nanda you blessed child do you mind making it how jolly of youare you all right he seemed with this for the first time to be aware of somebodys absence your mother isnt coming she let you come alone how jolly of her pulling off her gloves nanda had come immediately to his assistance on which quitting the table and laying hands on mr longdons shoulder to push him toward a sofa he continued to talk to sound a note of which the humour was the exaggeration of his flurry how jolly of you to be willing to comemost awfully kind i hope she isnt ill do mitchy lie down down mitchy downthats the only way to keep you he had waited for no account of mrs brookenhams health and it might have been apparentstill to our sharp spectatorthat he found nothing wonderful in her daughters unsupported arrival  i can make tea beautifully she said from behind her table mother showed me how this morning  this morningand mitchy who before the fire and still erect had declined to be laid low greeted the simple remark with uproarious mirth dear young lady youre the most delicious family  she showed me at breakfast about the little things to do she thought i might have to make it here and told me to offer the girl went on i havent yet done it this way at homei usually have my tea upstairs they bring it up in a cup all made and very weak with a piece of breadandbutter in the saucer thats because im so young tishy never lets me touch hers either so we had to make up for lost time thats what mother saidshe followed up her story and her young distinctness had clearly something to do with a certain pale concentration in mr longdons face mother isnt ill but she told me already yesterday she wouldnt come she said its really all for me im sure i hope it iswith which there flickered in her eyes dimly but perhaps all the more prettily the first intimation they had given of the light of laughter she told me youd understand mr vanfrom something youve said to her its for my seeing mr longdon withoutshe thinksher spoiling it  oh my dear child spoiling it vanderbank protested as he took a cup of tea from her to carry to their friend when did your mother ever spoil anything i told her mr longdon wanted to see you but i didnt say anything of his not yearning also for the rest of the family  a sound of protest rather formless escaped from the gentleman named but nanda continued to carry out her duty she told me to ask why he hadnt been again to see her mr mitchy sugarisnt that the way to say it three lumps youre like me only that i more often take five mitchy had dashed forward for his tea she gave it to him then she added with her eyes on mr longdons which she had had no difficulty in catching she told me to ask you all sorts of things  this acquaintance had got up to take his cup from vanderbank whose hand however dealt with him on the question of his sitting down again mr longdon resisting kept erect with a low gasp that his host only was near enough to catch this suddenly appeared to confirm an impression gathered by vanderbank in their contact a strange sense that his visitor was so agitated as to be trembling in every limb it brought to his own lips a kind of ejaculationi say but even as he spoke mr longdons face still white but with a smile that was not all pain seemed to supplicate him not to notice and he was not a man to require more than this to achieve a divination as deep as it was rapid why weve all been scattered for easter havent we he asked of nanda mr longdon has been at home your mother and father have been paying visits i myself have been out of london mitchy has been to paris and youoh yes i know where youve been  ah we all know thatthere has been such a row made about it mitchy said  yes ive heard of the feeling there is nanda replied  its supposed to be awful my knowing tishyquite too awful  mr longdon with vanderbanks covert aid had begun to appear to have pulled himself together dropping back on his sofa and attending in a manner to his tea it might have been with the notion of showing himself at ease that he turned on this a benevolent smile to the girl but what my dear is the objection  she looked gravely from him to vanderbank and to mitchy and then back again from one of these to the other do you think i ought to say  they both laughed and they both just appeared uncertain but vanderbank spoke first i dont imagine nanda that you really know  noas a family youre perfection mitchy broke out before the fire again with his cup he addressed his hilarity to mr longdon i told you a tremendous lot didnt i but i didnt tell you about that  his elder maintained yet with a certain vagueness the attitude of amiable enquiry about theafamily  well mitchy smiled about its ramifications this young lady has a tremendous friendshipand in short its all very complicated  my dear nanda said vanderbank its all very simple dont believe a word of anything of the sort  he had spoken as with the intention of a large vague optimism but there was plainly something in the girl that would always make for lucidity do you mean about carrie donner i dont believe it and at any rate i dont think its any ones business i shouldnt have a very high opinion of a person who would give up a friend she stopped short with the sense apparent that she was saying more than she meant though strangely as if it had been an effect of her type and of her voice there was neither pertness nor passion in the profession she had just made curiously wanting as she seemed both in timidity and in levity she was to a certainty not selfconsciousshe was extraordinarily simple mr longdon looked at her now with an evident surrender to his extreme interest and it might well have perplexed him to see her at once so downright as from experience and yet of so fresh and sweet a tenderness of youth  thats right thats right my dear young lady never never give up a friend for anything any one says it was mitchy who rang out with this lively wisdom the action of which on mr longdonunless indeed it was the action of something elsewas to make that personage in a manner that held the others watching him in slight suspense suddenly spring to his feet again put down his teacup carefully on a table near and then without a word as if no one had been present quietly wander away and disappear through the door left open on vanderbanks entrance it opened into a second a smaller sittingroom into which the eyes of his companions followed him  whats the matter nanda asked has he been taken ill  he is rum my dear van mitchy said but youre rightof a charm a distinction in short just the sort of thing we want  the sort of thing we wanti dare say vanderbank laughed but its not the sort of thing thats to be had for the askingits a sort we shall be mighty lucky if we can get  mitchy turned with amusement to nanda van has invented him and with the natural greed of the inventor wont let us have him cheap well he went on ill stand my share  the difficulty is that hes so much too good for us vanderbank explained  ungrateful wretch his friend cried thats just what ive been telling him that you are let the return you make not be to deprive me  mr vans not at all too good for me if you mean that nanda broke in she had finished her teamaking and leaned back in her chair with her hands folded on the edge of the tray  vanderbank only smiled at her in silence but mitchy took it up theres nobody too good for you of course only youre not quite dont you know in our set youre in mrs grendons i know what youre going to saythat she hasnt got any set that shes just a loose little white flower dropped on the indifferent bosom of the world but youre the small sprig of tender green that added to her makes her immediately compose  nanda looked at him with her cold kindness what nonsense you do talk  your tones sweet to me he returned as showing that you dont think me either too good for you no one remember will take that for your excuse when the world some day sees me annihilated by your having put an end to our so harmless relations  the girl appeared to lose herself a moment in theabysmal humanity over which his fairly fascinating ugliness played like the whirl of an eddy martyr she gently exclaimed but there was no smile with it she turned to vanderbank who during the previous minute had moved toward the neighbouring room then faltering taking counsel of discretion had come back on a scruple what is the matter  what do you want to get out of him you wretch mitchy went on as their host for an instant said nothing  vanderbank whose handsome face had a fine thought in it looked a trifle absently from one of them to the other but it was to nanda he spoke do you like him nanda  she showed surprise at the question how can i know so soon  he knows already  mitchy with his eyes on her became radiant to interpret he knows that hes pierced to the heart  the matter with him as you call it vanderbank brought out is one of the most beautiful things ive ever seen he looked at her as with a hope shed understand beautiful beautiful beautiful  precisely mitchy continued the victim done for by one glance of the goddess  nanda motionless in her chair fixed her other friend with clear curiosity beautiful why beautiful  vanderbank about to speak checked himself  i wont spoil it have it from himand returning to their friend he this time went out  mitchy and nanda looked at each other but isnt it rather awful mitchy demanded  she got up without answering she slowly came away from the table i think i do know if i like him  well you may mitchy exclaimed after his putting before you probably on the whole the greatest of your triumphs  and i also know i think mr mitchy that i like you she spoke without attention to this hyperbole  in spite of my ineffectual attempts to be brilliant thats a joy he went on if its not drawn out by the mere clumsiness of my flattery she had turned away from him kindly enough as if time for his talk in the air were always to be allowed him she took in vaguely vanderbanks books and prints why didnt your mother come mitchy then enquired  at this she again looked at him do you mention her as a way of alluding to something you guess she must have told me  that ive always supposed i make your flesh creep yes mitchy admitted i see she must have said to you be nice to him to show him it isnt quite so bad as that so you are niceso you always will be nice but i adore you all the same without illusions  she had opened at one of the tables unperceivingly a big volume of which she turned the leaves dont adore a girl mr mitchyjust help her thats more to the purpose  help you he cried you bring tears to my eyes  cant a girl have friends she went on i never heard of anything so idiotic giving him however no chance to take her up on this she made a quick transition mother didnt come because she wants me now as she says more to share her own life  mitchy looked at it but is this the way for her to share yours  ah thats another matterabout which you must talk to her she wants me no longer to keep seeing only with her eyes shes throwing me into the world  mitchy had listened with the liveliest interest but he presently broke into a laugh what a good thing then that im there to catch you  withoutit might have been seenhaving gathered the smallest impression of what they enclosed she carefully drew together again the covers of her folio there was deliberation in her movements i shall always be glad when youre there but where do you suppose theyve gone her eyes were on what was visible of the other room from which there arrived no sound of voices  theyre off there said mitchy but just looking unutterable things about you the impressions too deep let them look and tell me meanwhile if mrs donner gave you my message  oh yes she told me some humbug  the humbug then was in the tone my perfectly sincere speech took from herself she gives things i recognise rather that sound its her weakness he continued and perhaps even one may say her danger all the more reason you should help her as i believe youre supposed to be doing arent you i hope you feel you are he earnestly added  he had spoken this time gravely enough and with magnificent gravity nanda replied i have helped her tishys sure i have thats what tishy wants me for she says that to be with some nice girls really the best thing for her  poor mitchys face hereupon would have been interesting would have been distinctly touching to other eyes but nandas were not heedful of it oh he returned after an instant and without profane mirth that seems to me the best thing for any one  vanderbank however might have caught his expression for vanderbank now reappeared smiling on the pair as if struck by their intimacy how you are keeping it up then to nanda persuasively do you mind going to him in there i want him so really to see you its quite you know what he came for  nanda seemed to wonder what will he do to me anything dreadful  hell tell you what i meant just now  oh said nanda if hes a person who can tell me sometimes what you mean with which she went quickly off  and cant i hear mitchy asked of his host while they looked after her  yes but only from me vanderbank had pushed him to a seat again and was casting about for cigarettes be quiet and smoke and ill tell you  mitchy on the sofa received with meditation a light will she understand she has everything in the world but one he added but thats half  vanderbank before him lighted for himself what is it  a sense of humour  oh yes shes serious  mitchy smoked a little shes tragic  his friend at the fire watched a moment the empty portion of the other room then walked across to give the door a light push that all but closed it its rather odd he remarked as he came backthats quite what i just said to him but he wont treat her to comedy    iii  is it the shock of the resemblance to her grandmother vanderbank had asked of mr longdon on rejoining him in his retreat this victim of memory with his back turned was gazing out of the window and when in answer he showed his face there were tears in his eyes his answer in fact was just these tears the significance of which vanderbank immediately recognised its still greater then than you gathered from her photograph  its the most extraordinary thing in the world im too absurd to be so upsetmr longdon smiled through his tearsbut if you had known lady julia youd understand its she again as i first knew her to the life and not only in feature in stature in colour in movement but in every bodily mark and sign in every look of the eyes above alloh to a degreein the sound in the charm of the voice he spoke low and confidentially but with an intensity that now relieved himhe was as restless as with a discovery he moved about as with a sacred awehe might a few steps away have been in the very presence shes all lady julia there isnt a touch of her mother its uniquean absolute revival i see nothing of her father i see nothing of any one else isnt it thought wonderful by every one he went on why didnt you tell me  to have prepared you a littlevanderbank felt almost guilty i seei should have liked to make more of it though he added all lucidly i might so by putting you on your guard have caused myself to lose what if youll allow me to say it strikes me as one of the most touching tributes ive ever seen rendered to a woman in fact however how could i know i never saw lady julia and you had in advance all the evidence i could have the portraitpretty bad in the taste of the time i admitand the three or four photographs you must have noticed with it at mrs brooks these things must have compared themselves for you with my photograph in there of the granddaughter the similarity of course we had all observed but it has taken your wonderful memory and your happy vision to put into it all the detail  mr longdon thought a moment giving a dab with his pockethandkerchief very trueyoure quite right its far beyond any identity in the pictures but why did you tell me he added more sharply that she isnt beautiful  youve deprived me vanderbank laughed of the power of expressing civilly any surprise at your finding her so but i said to you please remember nothing that qualified a jot my sense of the special stamp of her face ive always positively found in it a recall of the type of the period you must be thinking of it isnt a bit modern its a face of sir thomas lawrence  its a face of gainsborough mr longdon returned with spirit lady julia herself harked back  vanderbank clearly was equally touched and amused let us say at once that its a face of raphael  his old friends hand was instantly on his arm thats exactly what i often said to myself of lady julias  the foreheads a little too high said vanderbank  but its just that excess that with the exquisite eyes and the particular disposition round it of the fair hair makes the individual grace makes the beauty of the resemblance  released by lady julias lover the young man in turn grasped him as an encouragement to confidence its a face that should have the long sideringlets of 1830 it should have the rest of the personal arrangement the pelisse the shape of bonnet the sprigged muslin dress and the crosslaced sandals it should have arrived in a peagreen tilbury and be a reader of mrs radcliffe and all this to complete the raphael  mr longdon who his discovery proclaimed had begun as might have been said to live with it looked hard a moment at his companion how youve observed her  vanderbank met it without confusion whom havent i observed do you like her he then rather oddly and abruptly asked  the old man broke away again how can i tellwith such disparities  the manner must be different vanderbank suggested and the things she says  his visitor was before him again i dont know what to make of them they dont go with the rest of her lady julia said mr longdon was rather shy  on this too his host could meet him she must have been and nandayes certainlydoesnt give that impression  on the contrary but lady julia was gay he added with an eagerness that made vanderbank smile  i can also see that nanda doesnt joke and yet vanderbank continued with his exemplary candour we mustnt speak of her must we as if she were bold and grim  mr longdon fixed him do you think shes sad  they had preserved their lowered tone and might with their heads together have been conferring as the party out in some game with the couple in the other room yes sad but vanderbank broke off ill send her to you thus it was he had come back to her  nanda on joining the elder man went straight to the point he says its so beautifulwhat you feel on seeing me if that is what he meant mr longdon kept silent again at first only smiling at her but less strangely now and then appeared to look about him for some place where she could sit near him there was a sofa in this room too on which observing it she quickly sank down so that they were presently together placed a little sideways and face to face she had shown perhaps that she supposed him to have wished to take her hand but he forbore to touch her though letting her feel all the kindness of his eyes and their long backward vision these things she evidently felt soon enough she went on before he had spoken i know how well you knew my grandmother mother has told meand im so glad she told me to say to you that she wants you to tell me just a shade at this might have appeared to drop over his face but who was there to know if the girl observed it it didnt prevent at any rate her completing her statement thats why she wished me today to come alone she said she wished you to have me all to yourself  no decidedly she wasnt shy that mute reflexion was in the air an instant that no doubt is the best way i thank her very much i called after having had the honour of diningi called i think three times he went on with a sudden displacement of the question but i had the misfortune each time to miss her  she kept looking at him with her crude young clearness i didnt know about that mother thinks shes more at home than almost any one she does it on purpose she knows what it is nanda pursued with her perfect gravity for people to be disappointed of finding her  oh i shall find her yet said mr longdon and then i hope i shall also find you  she appeared simply to consider the possibility and after an instant to think well of it i dare say you will now for now i shall be down  her companion just blinked in the drawingroom you meanalways  it was quite what she meant always i shall see all the people who come it will be a great thing for me i want to hear all the talk mr mitchett says i ought tothat it helps to form the young mind i hoped for that reason she went on with the directness that made her honesty almost violenti hoped there would be more people here today  im very glad there are notthe old man rang equally clear mr vanderbank kindly arranged the matter for me just this way i met him at dinner at your mothers three weeks ago and he brought me home here that night when as knowing you so differently we took the liberty of talking you all over it naturally had the effect of making me want to begin with you afreshonly that seemed difficult too without further help this he goodnaturedly offered me he saidand mr longdon recovered his spirits to repeat ithang it ill have em here for you  i seehe knew wed come then she caught herself up but we havent come have we  oh its all rightits all right to me the occasions brilliant and the affluence great ive had such talk with those young men  i seeshe was again prompt but beyond any young person he had ever met she might have struck him as literal youre not used to such talk neither am i its rather wonderful isnt it theyre thought awfully clever mr van and mr mitchy do you like them she pushed on  mr longdon who as compared with her might have struck a spectator as infernally subtle took an instant to think ive never met mr mitchett before  well he always thinks one doesnt like him nanda explained but one does one ought to she added  her companion had another pause he likes you  oh mr longdon neednt have hesitated i know he does he has told mother he has told lots of people  he has told even you mr longdon smiled  yesbut that isnt the same i dont think hes a bit dreadful she pursued still there was a greater interest do you like mr van  this time her interlocutor indeed hung fire how can i tell he dazzles me  but dont you like that then before he could really say youre afraid he may be false  at this he fairly laughed you go to the point she just coloured to have amused him so but he quickly went on i think one has a little natural nervousness at being carried off ones feet im afraid ive always liked too much to see where im going  and you dont with him she spoke with her curious hard interest i understand but i think i like to be dazzled  oh youve got timeyou can come round again youve a margin for accidents for disappointments and recoveries you can take one thing with another but ive only my last little scrap  and you want to make no mistakesi see  well im too easily upset  ah so am i said nanda i assure you that in spite of what you say i want to make no mistakes either ive seen a great manythough you mightnt think it she persisted i really know what they may be do you like me she brought forth but even on this she spared him too a look appeared to have been enough for her how can you say of course alreadyif you cant say for mr van i mean as youve seen him so much when he asked me just now if i liked you i told him it was too soon but it isnt now you see it goes fast i do like you she gave him no time to acknowledge this tribute butas if it were a matter of coursetried him quickly with something else can you say if you like mother  he could meet it pretty well now there are immense reasons why i should  yesi know about them as i mentioned mother has told me but what she had to put to him kept up his surprise have reasons anything to do with it i dont believe you like her she exclaimed she doesnt think so she added  the old mans face at last partly bewildered partly reassured showed something finer still in the effect she produced into what mysteries you plunge  oh we do thats what every one says of us we discuss everything and every onewere always discussing each other i think we must be rather celebrated for it and its a kind of trickisnt itthats catching but dont you think its the most interesting sort of talk mother says we havent any prejudices you have probably quantitiesand beautiful ones so perhaps i oughtnt to tell you but youll find out for yourself  yesim rather slow but i generally end by finding out and ive got thank heaven said mr longdon quite prejudices enough  then i hope youll tell me some of them nanda replied in a tone evidently marking how much he pleased her  ah you must do as i doyou must find out for yourself your resemblance to your grandmother is quite prodigious he immediately added  thats what i wish youd tell me aboutyour recollection of her and your wonderful feeling about her mother has told me things but that i should have something straight from you is exactly what she also wants my grandmother must have been awfully nice the girl rambled on and i somehow dont see myself at all as the same sort of person  oh i dont say youre in the least the same sort all i allude to mr longdon returned is the miracle of the physical heredity nothing could be less like her than your manner and your talk  nanda looked at him with all her honesty theyre not so good you must think  he hung fire an instant but was as honest as she youre separated from her by a gulfand not only of time personally you see you breathe a different air  she thoughtshe quite took it in of course and you breathe the samethe same old one i mean as my grandmother  the same old one mr longdon smiled as much as possible some day ill tell you more of what youre curious of i cant go into it now  because ive upset you so nanda frankly asked  thats one of the reasons  i think i can see another too she observed after a moment youre not sure how much i shall understand but i shall understand she went on more perhaps than you think in fact she said earnestly i promise to understand ive some imagination had my grandmother she asked her actual sequences were not rapid but she had already anticipated him ive thought of that before because i put the same question to mother  and what did your mother say  imaginationdear mamma not a grain  the old man showed a faint flush your mother then has a supply that makes up for it  the girl fixed him on this with a deeper attention you dont like her having said that  his colour came stronger though a slightly strained smile did what it could to diffuse coolness i dont care a single scrap my dear in respect to the friend im speaking of for any judgement but my own  not even for her daughters  not even for her daughters mr longdon had not spoken loud but he rang as clear as a bell  nanda for admiration of it broke almost for the first time into the semblance of a smile you feel as if my grandmother were quite your property  oh quite  i saythats splendid  im glad you like it he answered kindly  the very kindness pulled her up pardon my speaking so but im sure you know what i mean you mustnt think she eagerly continued that mother wont also want to hear you  on the subject of lady julia he gently but very effectively shook his head your mother shall never hear me  nanda appeared to wonder at it an instant and it made her completely grave again it will be all for me  whatever there may be of it my dear  oh i shall get it all out of you she returned without hesitation her mixture of free familiarity and of the vividness of evocation of something whatever it was sharply opposedthe little worry of this contradiction not altogether unpleasant continued to fill his consciousness more discernibly than anything else it was really reflected in his quick brown eyes that she alternately drew him on and warned him off but also that what they were beginning more and more to make out was an emotion of her own trembling there beneath her tension his glimpse of it widenedhis glimpse of it fairly triumphed when suddenly after this last declaration she threw off with quite the same accent but quite another effect im glad to be like any one the thought of whom makes you so good you are good she continued i see already how i shall feel it she stared at him with tears the sight of which brought his own straight back so that thus for a moment they sat there together  my dear child he at last simply murmured but he laid his hand on her now and her own immediately met it  youll get used to me she said with the same gentleness that the response of her touch had tried to express and i shall be so careful with you thatwell youll see she broke short off with a quaver and the next instant she turnedthere was some one at the door vanderbank still not quite at his ease had come back to smile upon them detaching herself from mr longdon she got straight up to meet him you were right mr van its beautiful beautiful beautiful     book fourth mr cashmore  harold brookenham whom mr cashmore ushered in and announced had found in the act of helping himself to a cup of tea at the table apparently just preparedharold brookenham arrived at the point with a dash so direct as to leave the visitor an option between but two suppositions that of a desperate plunge to have his shame soon over or that of the acquired habit of such appeals which had taught him the easiest way there was no great sharpness in the face of mr cashmore who was somehow massive without majesty yet he mightnt have been proof against the suspicion that his young friends embarrassment was an easy precaution a conscious corrective to the danger of audacity it wouldnt have been impossible to divine that if harold shut his eyes and jumped it was mainly for the appearance of doing so experience was to be taken as showing that one might get a fivepound note as one got a light for a cigarette but one had to check the friendly impulse to ask for it in the same way mr cashmore had in fact looked surprised yet not on the whole so surprised as the young man seemed to have expected of him there was almost a quiet grace in the combination of promptitude and diffidence with which harold took over the responsibility of all proprietorship of the crisp morsel of paper that he slipped with slow firmness into the pocket of his waistcoat rubbing it gently in its passage against the delicately buffcoloured duck of which that garment was composed so quite too awfully kind of you that i really dont know what to saythere was a marked recall in the manner of this speech of the sweetness of his mothers droop and the tenderness of her wail it was as if he had been moved for the moment to moralise but the eyes he raised to his benefactor had the oddest effect of marking that personage himself as a theme for the moralist  mr cashmore who would have been very redhaired if he had not been very bald showed a single eyeglass and a long upper lip he was large and jaunty with little petulant movements and intense ejaculations that were not in the line of his type you may say anything you like if you dont say youll repay it thats always nonsensei hate it  harold remained sad but showed himself really superior then i wont say it pensively a minute he appeared to figure the words in their absurdity on the lips of some young man not like himself tactful i know just what you mean  but i think you know that you ought to tell your father mr cashmore said  tell him ive borrowed of you  mr cashmore goodhumouredly demurred it would serve me rightits so wretched my having listened to you tell him certainly he went on after an instant but what i mean is that if youre in such straits you should speak to him like a man  harold smiled at the innocence of a friend who could suppose him not to have exhausted that resource im always speaking to him like a man and thats just what puts him so awfully out he denies to my face that i am one one would suppose to hear him not only that im a small objectionable child but that im scarcely even human he doesnt conceive me as with human wants  oh mr cashmore laughed youve allyou youngstersas many wants i know as an advertisement page of the times  harold showed an admiration thats awfully good if you think you ought to speak of it he continued do it rather to mamma he noted the hour ill go if youll excuse me to give you the chance  the visitor referred to his own watch its your mother herself who gives the chancesthe chances you take  harold looked kind and simple she has come in i know shell be with you in a moment  he was halfway to the door but mr cashmore though so easy had not done with him i suppose you mean that if its only your mother whos told you may depend on her to shield you  harold turned this over as if it were a questionable sovereign but on second thoughts he wonderfully smiled do you think that after youve let me have it you can tell you could of course if you hadnt he appeared to work it out for mr cashmores benefit but i dont mind he added your telling mamma  dont mind you mean really its annoying her so awfully  the invitation to repent thrown off in this could only strike the young man as absurdit was so previous to any enjoyment harold liked things in their proper order but at the same time his evolutions were quick i dare say i am selfish but what i was thinking was that the terrific wigging dont you knowwell id take it from her she knows about ones lifeabout our having to go on by no fault of our own as our parents start us she knows all about wantsno one has more than mamma  mr cashmore soundlessly glared his amusement so shell say its all right  oh no shell let me have it hot but shell recognise that at such a pass more must be done for a fellow and that may lead to somethingindirectly dont you see for she wont tell my father shell only in her own way work on himthat will put me on a better footing and for which therefore at bottom i shall have to thank you  the eye assisted by mr cashmores glass had with a discernible growth of something like alarm fixed during this address the subject of his beneficence the thread of their relations somehow lost itself in the subtler twist and he fell back on mere stature position and property things always convenient in the presence of crookedness i shall say nothing to your mother but i think i shall be rather glad youre not a son of mine  harold wondered at this new element in their talk do your sons never  borrow money of their mothers visitors mr cashmore had taken him up eager evidently quite to satisfy him but the question was caught on the wing by mrs brookenham herself who had opened the door as her friend spoke and who quickly advanced with an echo of it  lady fannys visitorsand though her eyes rather avoided than met his own she seemed to cover her ladyships husband with a vague but practised sympathy what on earth are you saying to harold about them thus it was that at the end of a few minutes mr cashmore on the sofa face to face with her found his consciousness quite purged of its actual sense of his weakness and a new turn given to the idea of what in ones very drawingroom might go on behind ones back harold had quickly vanishedhad been tacitly disposed of and mrs brooks caller had moved even in the short space of time so far in another direction as to have drawn from her the little cold question presents you dont mean money  he clearly felt the importance of expressing at least by his silence and his eyeglass what he meant her extravagance is beyond everything and though there are bills enough god knows that do come in to me i dont see how she pulls through unless there are others that go elsewhere  mrs brookenham had given him his teaher own she had placed on a small table near her and she could now respond freely to the impulse felt on this of settling herself to something of real interest except to harold she was incapable of reproach though there were of course shades in her resignation and her daughters report of her to mr longdon as conscious of an absence of prejudice would have been justified for a spectator by the particular feeling that mr cashmores speech caused her to disclose what did this feeling wonderfully appear unless strangely irrelevant ive no patience when i hear you talk as if you werent horribly rich  he looked at her an instant as if guessing she might have derived that impression from harold what has that to do with it does a rich man enjoy any more than a poor his wifes making a fool of him  her eyes opened wider it was one of her very few ways of betraying amusement there was little indeed to be amused at here except his choice of the particular invidious name you know i dont believe a word you say  mr cashmore drank his tea then rose to carry the cup somewhere and put it down declining with a motion any assistance when he was on the sofa again he resumed their intimate talk i like tremendously to be with you but you mustnt think ive come here to let you say to me such dreadful things as that he was an odd compound mr cashmore and the air of personal good health the untarnished bloom which sometimes lent a monstrous serenity to his mention of the barely mentionable was on occasion balanced or matched by his playful application of extravagant terms to matters of much less moment you know what i come to you for mrs brook i wont come any more if youre going to be horrid and impossible  you come to me i suppose becausefor my deep misfortune i assure youive a kind of vision of things of the wretched miseries in which you all knot yourselves up which you yourselves are as little blessed with as if tumbling about together in your heap you were a litter of blind kittens  awfully good thatyou do lift the burden of my trouble he had laughed out in the manner of the man who made notes for platform use of things that might serve but the next moment he was grave again as if his observation had reminded him of harolds praise of his wit it was in this spirit that he abruptly brought out where by the way is your daughter  i havent the least idea i do all i can to enter into her life but you cant get into a railway train while its on the rush  mr cashmore swung back to hilarity you give me lots of things do you mean shes so fast he could keep the ball going  mrs brookenham obliged him with what she meant no shes a tremendous dear and were great friends but she has her free young life which by that law of our time that im sure i only want like all other laws once i know what they are to acceptshe has her precious freshness of feeling which i say to myself that so far as control is concerned i ought to respect i try to get her to sit with me and she does so a little because shes kind but before i know it she leaves me again she feels what a difference her presence makes in ones liberty of talk  mr cashmore was struck by this picture thats awfully charming of her  isnt it too dear the thought of it for mrs brook seemed fairly to open out vistas the modern daughter  but not the ancient mother mr cashmore smiled  she shook her head with a world of accepted woe give me back give me back one hour of my youth oh i havent a single thrill left to answer a compliment i sit here now face to face with things as they are they come in their turn i assure youand they find me mrs brook sighed ready nanda has stepped on the stage and i give her up the house besides she went on musingly its awfully interesting it is the modern daughterwere really doing her the child and i and as the modern has always been my own noteive gone in i mean frankly for my very own timewho is one after all that one should pretend to decline to go where it may lead mr cashmore was unprepared with an answer to this question and his hostess continued in a different tone its sweet her sparing one  this for the visitor was firmer ground do you mean about talking before her  mrs brooks assent was positively tender she wont have a difference in my freedom its as if the dear thing knew dont you see what we must keep back she wants us not to have to think its quite maternal she mused again then as if with the pleasure of presenting it to him afresh thats the modern daughter  well said mr cashmore i cant help wishing she were a trifle less considerate in that case i might find her with you and i may tell you frankly that i get more from her than i do from you she has the great merit for me in the first place of not being such an admirer of my wife  mrs brookenham took this up with interest noyoure right she doesnt as i do see lady fanny and thats a kind of mercy  there you are then you inconsistent creature he cried with a laugh after all you do believe me you recognise how benighted it would be for your daughter not to feel that fannys bad  youre too tiresome my dear man mrs brook returned with your ridiculous simplifications fannys not bad shes magnificently goodin the sense of being generous and simple and true too adorably unaffected and without the least mesquinerie shes a great calm silver statue  mr cashmore showed on this something of the strength that comes from the practice of public debate then why are you glad your daughter doesnt like her  mrs brook smiled as with the sadness of having too much to triumph because im not like fanny without mesquinerie im not generous and simple im exaggeratedly anxious about nanda i care in spite of myself for what people may say your wife doesntshe towers above them i can be a shade less brave through the chance of my girls not happening to feel her as the rest of us do  mr cashmore too heavily followed to feel her  mrs brook floated over there would be in that case perhaps something to hint to her not to shriek on the housetops when you say she continued that one admits as regards fanny anything wrong you pervert dreadfully what one does freely grantthat shes a great glorious pagan its a real relief to know such a typeits like a flash of insight into history none the less if you ask me why then it isnt all right for young things to shriek as i say i have my answer perfectly ready after which as her visitor seemed not only too reduced to doubt it but too baffled to distinguish audibly for his credit between resignation and admiration she produced because shes purely instinctive her instincts are splendidbut its terrific  thats all i ever maintained it to be mr cashmore cried it is terrific  well his friend answered im watching her were all watching her its like some great natural poetic thingan alpine sunrise or a big high tide  youre amazing mr cashmore laughed im watching her too  and im also watching you mrs brook lucidly continued what i dont for a moment believe is that her bills are paid by any one its much more probable she sagaciously observed that theyre not paid at all  oh well if she can get on that way  there cant be a place in london mrs brook pursued where theyre not delighted to dress such a woman she shows things dont you see as some fine tourist region shows the placards in the fields and the posters on the rocks and what proof can you adduce she asked  mr cashmore had grown restless he picked a stray thread off the knee of his trousers ah when you talk about adducing he appeared to intimateas with the hint that if she didnt take care she might bore himthat it was the kind of word he used only in the house of commons  when i talk about it you cant meet me she placidly returned but she fixed him with her weary penetration you try to believe what you cant believe in order to give yourself excuses and she does the sameonly less for she recognises less in general the need of them shes so grand and simple  poor mr cashmore stared grander and simpler than i you mean  mrs brookenham thought not simplerno but very much grander she wouldnt in the case you conceive recognise really the need of what you conceive  mr cashmore wonderedit was almost mystic i dont understand you  mrs brook seeing it all from dim depths tracked it further and further weve talked her over so  mr cashmore groaned as if too conscious of it indeed we have  i mean weand it was wonderful how her accent discriminated weve talked you toobut of course we talk to every one she had a pause through which there glimmered a ray from luminous hours the inner intimacy which privileged as he was he couldnt pretend to share then she broke out almost impatiently were looking after herleave her to us  his envy of this nearer approach to what so touched him than he could himself achieve was in his face but he tried to throw it off i doubt if after all youre good for her  but mrs brookenham knew shes just the sort of person we are good for and the thing for her is to be with us as much as possiblejust live with us naturally and easily listen to our talk feel our confidence in her be kept up dont you know by the sense of what we expect of her splendid type and so little by little let our influence act what i meant to say just now is that i do perfectly see her taking what you call presents  well then mr cashmore enquired what do you want more  mrs brook hung fire an instantshe seemed on the point of telling him i dont see her as i said recognising the obligation  the obligation  to give anything back anything at all mrs brook was positive the comprehension of petty calculations never  i dont say the calculations are petty mr cashmore objected  well shes a great creature if she does fall his hostess lost herself in the view which was at last all before her be sure we shall all know it  thats exactly what im afraid of  then dont be afraid till we do she would fall as it were on us dont you see and said mrs brook with decision this time in her headshake that couldnt be we must keep her upthats your guarantee its rather too much she added with the same increase of briskness to have to keep you up too be very sure that if carrie really wavers  carrie  his interruption was clearly too vague to be sincere and it was as such that going straight on she treated it i shall never again give her three minutes attention to answer to you for fanny without being able  to answer to fanny for me do you mean he had flushed quickly as if he awaited her there it wouldnt suit you you contend well then i hope it will ease you off he went on with spirit to know that i wholly loathe mrs donner  mrs brook staring met the announcement with an absolute change of colour and since when pray it was as if a fabric had crumbled she was here but the other day and as full of you poor thing as an egg of meat  mr cashmore could only blush for her i dont say she wasnt my lifes a burden from her  nothing for a spectator could have been so odd as mrs brooks disappointment unless it had been her determination have you done with her already  one has never done with a buzzing insect  until one has literally killed it mrs brookenham wailed i cant take that from you my dear man it was yourself who originally distilled the poison that courses through her veins he jumped up at this as if he couldnt bear it presenting as he walked across the room however a large foolish fugitive back on which her eyes rested as on a proof of her penetration if you spoil everything by trying to deceive me how can i help you  he had looked in his restlessness at a picture or two but he finally turned round with whom is it you talk us over with petherton and his friend mitchy with your adored vanderbank with your awful duchess  you know my little circle and youve not always despised it she met him on his return with a figure that had visibly flashed out for her dont foul your own nest remember that after all weve more or less produced you she had a smile that attenuated a little her image for there were things that on a second thought he appeared ready to take from her she patted the sofa as if to invite him again to be seated and though he still stood before her it was with a face that seemed to show how her touch went home you know ive never quite thought you do us full honour but it was because she took you for one of us that carrie first  at this to stop her he dropped straight into the seat i assure you there has really been nothing with a continuation of his fidget he pulled out his watch wont she come in at all  do you mean nanda  talk me over with her he smiled if you like if you dont believe mrs donner is dust and ashes to me he continued you do little justice to your daughter  do you wish to break it to me that youre in love with nanda  he hesitated but only as if to give weight to his reply awfully i cant tell you how i like her  she wondered and pray how will that help me help me i mean to help you is it what im to tell your wife  he sat looking away but he evidently had his idea which he at last produced why wouldnt it be just the thing it would exactly prove my purity  there might have been in her momentary silence a hint of acceptance of it as a practical contribution to their problem and there were indeed several lights in which it could be considered mrs brook on a quick survey selected the ironic i see i see i might by the same law arrange somehow that lady fanny should find herself in love with edward that would prove her purity and you could be quite at ease she laughedhe wouldnt make any presents  mr cashmore regarded her with a candour that was almost a reproach to her mirth i like your daughter better than i like you  but it only amused her more is that perhaps because i dont prove your purity  what he might have replied remained in the air for the door opened so exactly at the moment she spoke that he rose again with a start and the butler coming in received her enquiry full in the face this functionarys answer to it however had no more than the usual austerity mr vanderbank and mr longdon  these visitors took a minute to appear and mrs brook not stirringstill only looking from the sofa calmly up at mr cashmoreused the time it might have seemed for correcting any impression of undue levity made by her recent question where did you last meet nanda  he glanced at the door to see if he were heard at the grendons  so you do go there  i went over from hicks the other day for an hour  and carrie was there  yes it was a dreadful horrid bore but i talked only to your daughter  she got upthe others were at handand offered mr cashmore an expression that might have struck him as strange its serious  serioushe had no eyes for the others  she didnt tell me  he gave a sound controlled by discretion which sufficed none the less to make mr longdonbeholding him for the first timereceive it with a little of the stiffness of a person greeted with a guffaw mr cashmore visibly liked this silence of nandas about their meeting    ii  mrs brookenham who had introduced him to the elder of her visitors had also found in serving these gentlemen with tea a chance to edge at him with an intensity not to be resisted talk to mr longdontake him off there she had indicated the sofa at the opposite end of the room and had set him an example by possessing herself in the place she already occupied of her adored vanderbank this arrangement however constituted for her in her own corner as soon as she had made it the ground of an appeal will he hate me any worse for doing that  vanderbank glanced at the others will cashmore do you mean  dear noi dont care whom he hates but with mr longdon i want to avoid mistakes  then dont try quite so hard vanderbank laughed is that your reason for throwing him into cashmores arms  yes preciselyso that i shall have these few moments to ask you for directions you must know him by this time so well i only want heaven help me to be as nice to him as i possibly can  thats quite the best thing for you and altogether why this afternoon i brought him he might have better luck in finding youit was he who suggested itthan he has had by himself im in a general way vanderbank added watching over him  i seeand hes watching over you mrs brooks sweet vacancy had already taken in so much he wants to judge of what i may be doing to youhe wants to save you from me he quite detests me  vanderbank with the interest as well as the amusement fairly threw himself back theres nobody like youyoure too magnificent  i am and that i can look the truth in the face and not be angry or silly about it is as you know the one thing in the world for which i think a bit well of myself  oh yes i knowi know youre too wonderful  mrs brookenham in a brief pause completed her covert consciousness theyre doing beautifullyhes taking cashmore with a seriousness  and with what is cashmore taking him  with the hope that from one moment to another nanda may come in  but how on earth does that concern him  through an extraordinary fancy he has suddenly taken to her mrs brook had been swift to master the facts he has been meeting her at tishys and she has talked to him so effectually about his behaviour that she has quite made him cease to care for carrie he prefers her nowand of course shes much nicer  vanderbanks attention it was clear had now been fully seized shes much nicer rather what you mean is he asked the next moment that nanda this afternoon has been the object of his call  yesreally though he tried to keep it from me she makes him feel she went on so innocent and good  her companion for a moment said nothing but then at last and will she come in  i havent the least idea  dont you know where she is  i suppose shes with tishy who has returned to town  vanderbank turned this over is that your system nowto ask no questions  why should i ask anywhen i want her life to be as much as possible like my own its simply that the hour has struck as you know from the moment she is down the only thing for us is to live as friends i think its so vulgar mrs brook sighed not to have the same good manners with ones children as one has with other people she asks me nothing  nothing vanderbank echoed  nothing  he paused again after which its very disgusting he declared then while she took it up as he had taken her word of a moment before its very preposterous he continued  mrs brook appeared at a loss do you mean her helping him  its not of nanda im speakingits of him vanderbank spoke with a certain impatience his being with her in any sort of direct relation at all his mixing her up with his other beastly affairs  mrs brook looked intelligent and wan about it but also perfectly goodhumoured my dear man he and his affairs are such twaddle  vanderbank laughed in spite of himself and does that make it any better  mrs brook thought but presently had a lightshe almost smiled with it for us then more woefully dont you want carrie to be saved she asked  why should i not a jot carrie be hanged  but its for fanny mrs brook protested if carrie is rescued its a pretext the less for fanny as the young man looked for an instant rather gloomily vague she softly quavered i suppose you dont positively want fanny to bolt  to bolt  surely ive not to remind you at this time of day how captain dentdouglas is always round the corner with the postchaise and how tight on our side were all clutching her  but why not let her go  mrs brook at this showed real resentment go then what would become of us she recalled his wandering fancy shes the delight of our life  oh vanderbank sceptically murmured  shes the ornament of our circle his companion insisted she will she wontshe wont she will its the excitement every day of plucking the daisy over vanderbanks attention as she spoke had attached itself across the room to mr longdon it gave her thus an image of the way his imagination had just seemed to her to stray and she saw a reason in it moreover for her coming up in another place  isnt he rather rich she allowed the question all its effect of abruptness  vanderbank looked round at her mr longdon i havent the least idea  not after becoming so intimate its usually with people the very first thing i get my impression of there came into her face for another glance at their friend no crudity of curiosity but an expression more tenderly wistful he must have some mysterious box under his bed  down in suffolka misers hoard who knows i dare say vanderbank went on he isnt a miser but he strikes me as careful  mrs brook meanwhile had thought it out then he has something to be careful of it would take something really handsome to inspire in a man like him that sort of interest with his small expenses all these years his savings must be immense and how could he have proposed to mamma unless he had originally had money  if vanderbank a little helplessly wondered he also laughed you must remember your mother refused him  ah but not because there wasnt enough  noi imagine the force of the blow for him was just in the other reason  well it would have been in that one just as much if that one had been the other mrs brook was sagacious though a trifle obscure and she pursued the next moment mamma was so sincere the fortune was nothing to her that shows it was immense  it couldnt have been as great as your logic vanderbank smiled but of course if it has been growing ever since  i can see it grow while he sits there mrs brook declared but her logic had in fact its own law and her next transition was an equal jump it was too lovely the frankness of your admission a minute ago that i affect him uncannily ah dont spoil it by explanations she beautifully pleaded hes not the first and he wont be the last with whom i shall not have been what they call a combination the only thing that matters is that i mustnt if possible make the case worse so you must guide me what is one to do  vanderbank now amused again looked at her kindly be yourself my dear woman obey your fine instincts  how can you be she sweetly asked so hideously hypocritical you know as well as you sit there that my fine instincts are the thing in the world youre most in terror of be myself she echoed what youd like to say is be somebody elsethats your only chance well ill tryill try  he laughed again shaking his head dontdont  you mean its too hopeless theres no way of effacing the bad impression or of starting a good one on this with a drop of his mirth he met her eyes and for an instant through the superficial levity of their talk they might have appeared to sound each other it lasted till mrs brook went on i should really like not to lose him  vanderbank seemed to understand and at last said i think you wont lose him  do you mean youll help me van you will her voice had at moments the most touching tones of any in england and humble helpless affectionate she spoke with a familiarity of friendship its for the sense of the link with mamma she explained hes simply full of her  oh i know hes prodigious  he has told you morehe comes back to it mrs brook eagerly asked  well the young man replied a trifle evasively weve had a great deal of talk and hes the jolliest old boy possible and in short i like him  i see said mrs brook blandly and he likes you in return as much as he despises me that makes it all rightmakes me somehow so happy for you theres something in himwhat is itthat suggests the oncle damerique the eccentric benefactor the fairy godmother hes a little of an old womanbut all the better for it she hung fire but an instant before she pursued what can we make him do for you  vanderbank at this was very blank do for me  how can any one love you she asked without wanting to show it in some way you know all the ways dear van she breathed in which i want to show it  he might have known them something suddenly fixed in his face appeared to say but they were not what was on this speech of hers most immediately present to him that for instance is the tone not to take with him  there you are she sighed with discouragement well only tell me then as he said nothing i must be more like mamma  his expression confessed to his feeling an awkwardness youre perhaps not quite enough like her  oh i know that if he deplores me as i am now she would have done so quite as much in fact probably as seeing it nearer a good deal more shed have despised me even more than he but if its a question mrs brook went on of not saying what mamma wouldnt how can i know dont you see what she would have said mrs brook became as wonderful as if she saw in her friends face some admiring reflexion of the fine freedom of mind thatin such a connexion quite as much as in any othershe could always show of course i revere mamma just as much as he does and there was everything in her to revere but she was none the less in every way a charming woman too and i dont know after all do i what even shein their peculiar relationmay not have said to him  vanderbanks laugh came back very goodvery good i return to my first idea try with him whatever comes into your head youre a woman of genius after all and genius mostly justifies itself to make you right he went on pleasantly and inexorably might perhaps be to make you wrong since you have so great a charm trust it not at all or all in all that i dare say is all you can do thereforeyesbe yourself  these remarks were followed on either side by the repetition of a somewhat intenser mutual gaze though indeed the speakers eyes had more the air of meeting his friends than of seeking them i cant be you certainly van mrs brook sadly brought forth  i know what you mean by that he rejoined in a moment you mean im hypocritical  hypocritical  im diplomatic and calculatingi dont show him how bad i am whereas with you he knows the worst  of this observation mrs brook whose eyes attached themselves again to mr longdon took at first no further notice than might have been indicated by the way it set her musing  calculatingshe at last took him up on what is there to calculate  why said vanderbank if as you just hinted hes a blessing in disguise i perfectly admit he resumed that im capable of sacrifices to keep on good terms with him  youre not afraid hell bore you  oh yesdistinctly  but hell be worth it then mrs brook said as he appeared to assent hell be worth a great deal she continued to watch mr longdon who without his glasses stared straight at the floor while mr cashmore talked to him she pursued however dispassionately enough he must be of a narrowness  oh beautiful  she was silent again i shall broaden him you wont  heaven forbid vanderbank heartily concurred but none the less as ive said ill help you  her attention was still fixed it will be him youll help if youre to make sacrifices to keep on good terms with him the first sacrifice will be of me then on his leaving this remark so long unanswered that she had finally looked at him again im perfectly prepared for it  it was as if jocosely enough he had had time to make up his mind how to meet her what will you havewhen he loved my mother  nothing could have been droller than the gloom of her surprise yours too  i didnt tell you the other dayout of delicacy  mrs brookenham darkly thought he didnt tell me either  the same consideration deterred him but if i didnt speak of it vanderbank continued when i arranged with you after meeting him here at dinner that you should come to tea with him at my roomsif i didnt mention it then it wasnt because i hadnt learnt it early  mrs brook more deeply sounded this affair but she spoke with the exaggerated mildness that was the form mostly taken by her gaiety it was because of course it makes him out such a wretch what becomes in that case of his loyalty  to your mothers memory oh its all righthe has it quite straight she came later mine after my fathers death had refused him but you see he might have been my stepfather  mrs brookenham took it in but she had suddenly a brighter light he might have been my own father besides she went on if his line is to love the mothers why on earth doesnt he love me im in all conscience enough of one  ah but isnt there in your case the fact of a daughter vanderbank asked with a slight embarrassment  mrs brookenham stared what good does that do me  why didnt she tell you  nanda she told me he doesnt like her any better than he likes me  vanderbank in his turn showed surprise thats really what she said  she had on her return from your rooms a most unusual fit of frankness for she generally tells me nothing  well said vanderbank how did she put it  mrs brook reflectedrecovered it i like him awfully but i am not in the least his idea  his idea of what  thats just what i asked her of the proper grandchild for mamma  vanderbank hesitated well she isnt then after another pause but shell do  his companion gave him a deep look youll make her  he got up and on seeing him move mr longdon also rose so that facing each other across the room they exchanged a friendly signal or two ill make her    iii  their hostesss account of mr cashmores motive for his staying on was so far justified as that vanderbank while mr longdon came over to mrs brook appeared without difficulty further to engage him the lady in question meanwhile had drawn her old friend down and her present method of approach would have interested an observer aware of the unhappy conviction she had just privately expressed some trace indeed of the glimpse of it enjoyed by mr cashmeres present interlocutor might have been detected in the restlessness that vanderbanks desire to keep the other pair uninterrupted was still not able to banish from his attitude not however that mrs brook took the smallest account of it as she quickly broke out how can we thank you enough my dear man for your extraordinary kindness the reference was vivid yet mr longdon looked so blank about it that she had immediately to explain i mean to dear van who has told us of your giving him the great happinessunless hes too dreadfully mistakenof letting him really know you hes such a tremendous friend of ours that nothing so delightful can befall him without its affecting us in the same way she had proceeded with confidence but suddenly she pulled up dont tell me he is mistakeni shouldnt be able to bear it she challenged the pale old man with a loveliness that was for the moment absolutely juvenile arent you letting himreally  mr longdons smile was queer i cant prevent him im not a great houseto give orders to go over me the kindness is mr vanderbanks own and ive taken up im afraid a great deal of his precious time  you have indeed mrs brook was undiscouraged he has been talking with me just now of nothing else you may say she went on that its i who have kept him at it so i have for his pleasures a joy to us if you cant prevent what he feels you know you cant prevent either what we feel  mr longdons face reflected for a minute something he could scarcely have supposed her acute enough to make out the struggle between his real mistrust of her founded on the unconscious violence offered by her nature to his every memory of her mother and his sense on the other hand of the high propriety of his liking her to which latter force his interest in vanderbank was a contribution inasmuch as he was obliged to recognise on the part of the pair an alliance it would have been difficult to explain at beccles perhaps i dont quite see the value of what your husband and you and i are in a position to do for him  do you mean because hes himself so clever  well said mr longdon i dare say thats at the bottom of my feeling so proud to be taken up by him i think of the young men of my time and see that he takes in more but thats what you all do he rather helplessly sighed youre very very wonderful  she met him with an almost extravagant eagerness that the meeting should be just where he wished i dont take in everything but i take in all i can thats a great affair in london today and i often feel as if i were a circuswoman in pink tights and no particular skirts riding half a dozen horses at once were all in the troupe now i suppose she smiled and we must travel with the show but when you say were different she added think after all of mamma  mr longdon stared its from her you are different  ah but she had an awfully fine mind were not cleverer than she  his conscious honest eyes looked away an instant its perhaps enough for the present that youre cleverer than i i was very glad the other day he continued to make the acquaintance of your daughter i hoped i should find her with you  if mrs brook cast about it was but for a few seconds if she had known you were coming she would certainly have been here she wanted so to please you then as her visitor took no further notice of this speech than to ask if nanda were out of the house she had to admit it as an aggravation of failure but she pursued in the next breath of course you wont care but she raves about you  he appeared indeed at first not to care isnt she eighteenit was oddly abrupt  i have to think wouldnt it be nearer twenty mrs brook audaciously returned she tried again she told me all about your interview i stayed away on purposei had my idea  and what was your idea  i thought shed remind you more of mamma if i wasnt there but shes a little person who sees perhaps you didnt think it but she knew  and what did she know asked mr longdon who was unable however to keep from his tone a certain coldness which really deprived the question of its proper curiosity  mrs brook just showed the chill of it but she had always her courage why that you dont like her she had the courage of carrying off as well as of backing out she too has her little place with the circusits the way we earn our living  mr longdon said nothing for a moment and when he at last spoke it was almost with an air of contradiction shes your mother to the life  his hostess for three seconds looked at him hard ah but with such differences youll lose it she added with a headshake of pity  he had his eyes only on vanderbank well my losses are my own affair then his face came back did she tell you i didnt like her  the indulgence in mrs brooks view of his simplicity was marked you thought you succeeded so in hiding it no mattershe bears up i think she really feels a great deal as i dothat its no matter how many of us you hate if youll only go on feeling as you do about mamma show us thatthats what we want  nothing could have expressed more the balm of reassurance but the mild drops had fallen short of the spot to which they were directed show you  oh how he had sounded the word i seeyou dont show thats just what nanda saw you thought but you cant keep us from knowing itcant keep it in fact i think from affecting your own behaviour youd be much worse to us if it wasnt for the still warm ashes of your old passion it was an immense pity for vanderbanks amusement that he was at this moment too far off to fit to the expression of his old friends face so much of the cause of it as had sprung from the deeply informed tone of mrs brooks allusion to what degree the speaker herself made the connexion will never be known to history nor whether as she went on she thought she bettered her case or she simply lost her head the great thing for us is that we can never be for you quite like other ordinary people  and whats the great thing for me  oh for you theres nothing im afraid but small thingsso small that they can scarcely be worth the trouble of your making them out our being so happy that youve come back to usif only just for a glimpse and to leave us again in no matter what horror for ever our positive delight in your being exactly so different the pleasure we have in talking about you and shall still haveor indeed all the moreeven if weve seen you only to lose you whatever all this represents for ourselves its for none of us to pretend to say how much or how little you may pick out of it and yet mrs brook wandered on however much we may disappoint you some little spark of the past cant help being in usfor the past is the one thing beyond all spoiling there it is dont you thinkto speak for itself and if need be only of itself she pulled up but she appeared to have destroyed all power of speech in him so that while she waited she had time for a fresh inspiration it might perhaps frankly have been mentioned as on the whole her finest dont you think it possible that if you once get the point of view of realising that i know  she held the note so long that he at last supplied a sound that you know what  why that compared with her im a poor creeping thing i meanshe hastened to forestall any protest of mere decency that would spoil her ideathat of course i ache in every limb with the certainty of my dreadful difference it isnt as if i didnt know it dont you see there it is as a matter of course ive helplessly but finally and completely accepted it wont that help you she so ingeniously pleaded it isnt as if i tormented you with any recall of her whatever i can quite see how awful it would be for you if with the effect i produce on you i did have her lovely eyes or her distinguished nose or the shape of her forehead or the colour of her hair strange as it is in a daughter im disconnected altogether and dont you think i may be a little saved for you by becoming thus simply out of the question of course she continued your real trial is poor nandashes likewise so fearfully out of it and yet shes so fearfully in it and she said mrs brook for a climaxshe doesnt know  a strange faint flush while she talked had come into mr longdons face and whatever effect as she put it she produced on him it was clearly not that of causing his attention to wander she held him at least for weal or woe his bright eyes grew brighter and opened into a stare that finally seemed to offer him as submerged in mere wonder at last however he rose to the surface and he appeared to have lighted at the bottom of the sea on the pearl of the particular wisdom he needed i dare say there may be something in what you so extraordinarily suggest  she jumped at it as if in pleasant pain in just letting me go  but at this he dropped i shall never let you go  it renewed her fear not just for what i am  he rose from his place beside her but looking away from her and with his colour marked i shall never let you go he repeated  oh you angel she sprang up more quickly and the others were by this time on their feet ive done it ive done it she joyously cried to vanderbank he likes me or at least he can bear meive found him the way and now i dont care even if he says i havent then she turned again to her old friend we can manage about nandayou neednt ever see her shes down now but she can go up again we can arrange it at any ratecest la moindre des choses  upon my honour i protest mr cashmore exclaimed against anything of the sort i defy you to arrange that young lady in any such manner without also arranging me im one of her greatest admirers he gaily announced to mr longdon  vanderbank said nothing and mr longdon seemed to show he would have preferred to do the same that visitors eyes might have represented an appeal to him somehow to intervene to show the due acquaintance springing from practice and wanting in himself with the art of conversation developed to the point at which it could thus sustain a lady in the upper air vanderbanks silence might without his mere kind pacific look have seemed almost inhuman poor mr longdon had finally to do his own simple best will you bring your daughter to see me he asked of mrs brookenham  oh ohthats an idea will you bring her to see me mr cashmore again broke out  mrs brook had only fixed mr longdon with the air of unutterable things you angel you angelthey found expression but in that  i dont need to ask you to bring her do i vanderbank now said to his hostess i hope you dont mind my bragging all over the place of the great honour she did me the other day in appearing quite by herself  quite by herself i say mrs brook mr cashmore flourished on  it was only now that she noticed him which she did indeed but by answering vanderbank she didnt go for you im afraidthough of course she might she went because you had promised her mr longdon but i should have no more feeling about her going to youand should expect her to have no morethan about her taking a pound of tea as she sometimes does to her old nurse or her going to read to the old women at the workhouse may you never have less to brag of  i wish shed bring me a pound of tea mr cashmore resumed or aint i enough of an old woman for her to come and read to me at home  does she habitually visit the workhouse mr longdon enquired of mrs brook  this lady kept him in a moments suspense which another contemplation might moreover have detected that vanderbank in some degree shared every friday at three  vanderbank with a sudden turn moved straight to one of the windows and mr cashmore had a happy remembrance why this is fridayshe must have gone today but does she stay so late  she was to go afterwards to little aggie im trying so in spite of difficulties mrs brook explained to keep them on together she addressed herself with a new thought to mr longdon you must know little aggiethe niece of the duchess i forget if youve met the duchess but you must know her toothere are so many things on which im sure shell feel with you little aggies the one she continued youll delight in her she ought to have been mammas grandchild  dearest lady how can you pretend or for a moment compare her mr cashmore broke in she says nothing to me at all  she says nothing to any one mrs brook serenely replied thats just her type and her charmjust above all her education then she appealed to vanderbank wont mr longdon be struck with little aggie and wont he find it interesting to talk about all that sort of thing with the duchess  vanderbank came back laughing but mr longdon anticipated his reply what sort of thing do you mean  oh said mrs brook the whole question dont you know of bringing girls forward or not the question ofwell what do you call ittheir exposure its the question it appearsthe questionof the future its awfully interesting and the duchess at any rate is great on it nanda of course is exposed mrs brook pursuedfearfully  and what on earth is she exposed to mr cashmore gaily demanded  shes exposed to you it would seem my dear fellow vanderbank spoke with a certain discernible impatience not so much of the fact he mentioned as of the turn of their talk  it might have been in almost compassionate deprecation of this weak note that mrs brookenham looked at him her own reply to mr cashmeres question however was uttered at mr longdon shes exposedits much worseto me but aggie isnt exposed to anythingnever has been and never is to be and were watching to see if the duchess can carry it through  why not asked mr cashmore if theres nothing she can be exposed to but the duchess herself  he had appealed to his companions impartially but mr longdon whose attention was now all for his hostess appeared unconscious if youre all watching is it your idea that i should watch with you  the enquiry on his lips was a waft of cold air the sense of which clearly led mrs brook to put her invitation on the right ground not of course on the chance of anythings happening to the dear childto whom nothing obviously can happen but that her aunt will marry her off in the shortest possible time and in the best possible conditions no the interest is much more in the way the duchess herself steers  ah shes in a boat mr cashmore fully concurred that will take a good bit of that  it is not for mr longdons historian to overlook that if he was not unnaturally mystified he was yet also visibly interested what boat is she in  he had addressed his curiosity with politeness to mr cashmore but they were all arrested by the wonderful way in which mrs brook managed to smile at once very dimly very darkly and yet make it take them all in i think you must tell him van  heaven forbidand van again retreated  ill tell him like a shotif you really give me leave said mr cashmore for whom any scruple referred itself manifestly not to the subject of the information but to the presence of a lady  i dont give you leave and i beg youll hold your tongue mrs brookenham returned you handle such matters with a minuteness in short she broke off to mr longdon he would tell you a good deal more than youll care to know she is in a boatbut shes an experienced mariner basta as she would say do you know mitchy mrs brook suddenly asked  oh yes he knows mitchyvanderbank had approached again  then make him tell himshe put it before the young man as a charming turn for them all mitchy can be refined when he tries  oh dearwhen mitchy tries vanderbank laughed i think i should rather for the job offer him to mr longdon abandoned to his native wild impulse  i like mr mitchett the old man said endeavouring to look his hostess straight in the eye and speaking as if somewhat to defy her to convict him even from the point of view of beccles of a mistake  mrs brookenham took it with a wonderful bright emotion my dear friend vous me rendez la vie if you can stand mitchy you can stand any of us  upon my honour i should think so mr cashmore was eager to remark what on earth do you mean he demanded of mrs brook by saying that im more minute than he  she turned her beauty an instant on this critic i dont say youre more minutei say hes more brilliant besides as ive told you before youre not one of us with which as a check to further discussion she went straight on to mr longdon the point about aggies conservative education is the wonderful sincerity with which the duchess feels that ones girl may so perfectly and consistently be hedged in without ones really ever for it comes to that depriving ones own self  well of what mr longdon boldly demanded while his hostess appeared thoughtfully to falter  she addressed herself mutely to vanderbank in whom the movement produced a laugh i defy you he exclaimed to say  well you dont defy me mr cashmore cried as mrs brook failed to take up the challenge if you know mitchy he went on to mr longdon you must know petherton  the elder man remained vague and not imperceptibly cold petherton  my brotherinlawwhom god knows why mitchy runs  runs mr longdon again echoed  mrs brook appealed afresh to vanderbank i think we ought to spare him i may not remind you of mamma she continued to their companion but i hope you dont mind my saying how much you remind me explanations after all spoil things and if you can make anything of us and will sometimes come back youll find everything in its native freshness youll see youll feel for yourself  mr longdon stood before her and raised to vanderbank when she had ceased the eyes he had attached to the carpet while she talked and must i go now explanations she had said spoiled things but he might have been a stranger at an eastern courtcomically helpless without his interpreter  if mrs brook desires to spare you vanderbank kindly replied the best way to make sure of it would perhaps indeed be to remove you but hadnt we a hope of nanda  it might be of use for us to wait for herit was still to his young friend that mr longdon put it  ah when shes once on the loose mrs brookenham sighed  unless la voila she said as a hand was heard at the doorlatch it was only however a footman who entered with a little tray that on his approaching his mistress offered to sight the brown envelope of a telegram she immediately took leave to open this missive after the quick perusal of which she had another vision of them all it is shethe modern daughter tishy keeps me dinner and opera clothes all right return uncertain but if before morning have latchkey she wont come home till morning said mrs brook  but think of the comfort of the latchkey vanderbank laughed you might go to the opera he said to mr longdon  hanged if i dont mr cashmore exclaimed  mr longdon appeared to have caught from nandas message an obscure agitation he met his young friends suggestion at all events with a visible intensity will you go with me  vanderbank had just debated recalling engagements which gave mrs brook time to intervene cant you live without him she asked of her elder friend  vanderbank had looked at her an instant i think i can get there late he then replied to mr longdon  i think i can get there early mr cashmore declared mrs grendon must have a box in fact i know which and they dont he jocosely continued to his hostess  mrs brook meanwhile had given mr longdon her hand well in any case the child shall soon come to you and oh alone she insisted you neednt make phrasesi know too well what im about  one hopes really you do pursued the unquenched mr cashmore  if thats what one gets by having known your mother  it wouldnt have helped you mrs brook retorted and wont you have to say its all you were to get she pityingly murmured to her other visitor  he turned to vanderbank with a strange gasp and that comforter said come     book fifth the duchess  the lower windows of the great white house which stood high and square opened to a wide flagged terrace the parapet of which an old balustrade of stone was broken in the middle of its course by a flight of stone steps that descended to a wonderful garden the terrace had the afternoon shade and fairly hung over the prospect that dropped away and circled itthe prospect beyond the series of gardens of scattered splendid trees and green glades an horizon mainly of woods nanda brookenham one day at the end of july coming out to find the place unoccupied as yet by other visitors stood there a while with an air of happy possession she moved from end to end of the terrace pausing gazing about her taking in with a face that showed the pleasure of a brief independence the combination of delightful thingsof old rooms with old decorations that gleamed and gloomed through the high windows of old gardens that squared themselves in the wide angles of old walls of woodwalks rustling in the afternoon breeze and stretching away to further reaches of solitude and summer the scene had an expectant stillness that she was too charmed to desire to break she watched it listened to it followed with her eyes the white butterflies among the flowers below her then gave a start as the cry of a peacock came to her from an unseen alley it set her after a minute into less difficult motion she passed slowly down the steps wandering further looking back at the big bright house but pleased again to see no one else appear if the sun was still high enough she had a pink parasol she went through the gardens one by one skirting the high walls that were so like collections and thinking how later on the nectarines and plums would flush there she exchanged a friendly greeting with a man at work passed through an open door and turning this way and that finally found herself in the park at some distance from the house it was a point she had had to take another rise to reach a place marked by an old green bench for a larger sweep of the view which in the distance where the woods stopped showed in the most english way in the world the colourspot of an old red village and the tower of an old grey church she had sunk down upon the bench almost with a sense of adventure yet not too fluttered to wonder if it wouldnt have been happy to bring a book the charm of which precisely would have been in feeling everything about her too beautiful to let her read  the sense of adventure grew in her presently becoming aware of a stir in the thicket below followed by the coming into sight on a path that mounting passed near her seat of a wanderer whom had his particular his exceptional identity not quickly appeared it might have disappointed her a trifle to have to recognise as a friend he saw her immediately stopped laughed waved his hat then bounded up the slope and brushing his forehead with his handkerchief confessing as to a red face was rejoicingly there before her her own ejaculation on first seeing himwhy mr vanhad had an ambiguous sharpness that was rather for herself than for her visitor she made room for him on the bench where in a moment he was cooling off and they were both explaining the great thing was that he had walked from the station to stretch his legs coming far round for the lovely hour and the pleasure of it by a way he had learnt on some previous occasion of being at mertle  youve already stayed here then nanda who had arrived but half an hour before spoke as if she had lost the chance to give him a new impression  ive stayed hereyes but not with mitchy with some people or otherwho the deuce can they have beenwho had the place for a few months a year or two ago  dont you even remember  vanderbank wondered and laughed it will come to me but its a charming sign of london relations isnt itthat one can come down to people this way and be awfully well done for and all that and then go away and lose the whole thing quite forget to whom one has been beholden its a queer life  nanda seemed for an instant to wish to say that one might deny the queerness but she said something else instead i suppose a man like you doesnt quite feel that he is beholden its awfully good of himits doing a great deal for anybodythat he should come down at all so that it would add immensely to his burden if anybody had to be remembered for it  i dont know what you mean by a man like me vanderbank returned im not any particular kind of a man she had been looking at him but she looked away on this and he continued goodhumoured and explanatory if you mean that i go about such a lot how do you know it but by the fact that youre everywhere now yourselfso that whatever i am in short youre just as bad  you admit then that you are everywhere i may be just as bad the girl went on but the point is that im not nearly so good girls are such natural hacksthey cant be anything else  and pray what are fellows who are in the beastly grind of fearfully busy offices there isnt an old cabhorse in london thats kept at it i assure you as i am besides the young man added if im out every night and off somewhere like this for sunday cant you understand my dear child the fundamental reason of it  nanda with her eyes on him again studied an instant this mystery am i to infer with delight that its the sweet hope of meeting me it isnt she continued in a moment as if there were any necessity for your saying that whats the use but all impatiently she stopped short  he was eminently gay even if his companion was not because were such jolly old friends that we really neednt so much as speak at all yes thank goodnessthank goodness he had been looking round him taking in the scene he had dropped his hat on the ground and completely at his ease though still more wishing to show it had crossed his legs and closely folded his arms what a tremendously jolly place if i cant for the life of me recall who they werethe other peopleive the comfort of being sure their minds are an equal blank do they even remember the place they had we had some fellows down atwhere was it the big white house last novemberand there was one of them out of the whatdoyoucallityou knowwho might have been a decent enough chap if he hadnt presumed so on his gifts vanderbank paused a minute but his companion said nothing and he pursued it does show doesnt itthe fact that we do meet this waythe tremendous change that has taken place in your life in the last three months i mean if im everywhere as you said just now your being just the same  yesyou see what youve done  how what ive done  you plunge into the woods for change for solitude the girl said and the first thing you do is to find me waylaying you in the depths of the forest but i really couldntif youll reflect upon itknow you were coming this way  he sat there with his position unchanged but with a constant little shake in the foot that hung down as if everythingand what she now put before him not leastwas much too pleasant to be reflected on may i smoke a cigarette  nanda waited a little her friend had taken out his silver case which was of ample form and as he extracted a cigarette she put forth her hand may i she turned the case over with admiration  vanderbank demurred do you smoke with mr longdon  immensely but what has that to do with it  everything everything he spoke with a faint ring of impatience i want you to do with me exactly as you do with him  ah thats soon said the girl replied in a peculiar tone how do you mean to do  well then to be what shall i say vanderbank pleasantly wondered while his foot kept up its motion to feel  she continued to handle the cigarettecase without however having profited by its contents i dont think that as regards mr longdon and me you know quite so much as you suppose  vanderbank laughed and smoked i take for granted he tells me everything  ah but you scarcely take for granted i do she rubbed her cheek an instant with the polished silver and again the next moment turned over the case this is the kind of one i should like  her companion glanced down at it why it holds twenty  well i want one that holds twenty  vanderbank only threw out his smoke i want so to give you something he said at last that in my relief at lighting on an object that will do i will if you dont look out give you either that or a pipe  do you mean this particular one  ive had it for yearsbut even that one if you like it  she kept itcontinued to finger it and by whom was it given you  at this he turned to her smiling you think ive forgotten that too  certainly you must have forgotten to be willing to give it away again  but how do you know it was a present  such things always arepeople dont buy them for themselves  she had now relinquished the object laying it upon the bench and vanderbank took it up its origins lost in the night of timeit has no history except that ive used it but i assure you that i do want to give you something ive never given you anything  she was silent a little the exhibition youre making she seriously sighed at last of your inconstancy and superficiality all the relics of you that ive treasured and that i supposed at the time to have meant something  the relics have you a lock of my hair then as her meaning came to him oh little christmas things have you really kept them  laid away in a drawer of their owndone up in pink paper  i know what youre coming to vanderbank said youve given me things and youre trying to convict me of having lost the sweet sense of them but you cant do it where my hearts concerned im a walking reliquary pink paper i use gold paperand the finest of all the gold paper of the mind he gave a flip with a fingernail to his cigarette and looked at its quickened fire after which he pursued very familiarly but with a kindness that of itself qualified the mere humour of the thing dont talk my dear child as if you didnt really know me for the best friend you have in the world as soon as he had spoken he pulled out his watch so that if his words had led to something of a pause this movement offered a pretext for breaking it nanda asked the hour and on his replying fivefifteen remarked that there would now be tea on the terrace with every one gathered at it then shall we go and join them her companion demanded  he had made however no other motion and when after hesitating she said yes with pleasure it was also without a change of position i like this she inconsequently added  so do i awfully tea on the terrace vanderbank went on isnt in it but whos here  oh every one all your set  mine have i still a setwith the universal vagabondism you accuse me of  well then mitchyswhoever they are  and nobody of yours  oh yes nanda said all mine he must at least have arrived by this time my sets mr longdon she explained hes all of it now  then where in the world am i  oh youre an extra there are always extras  a complete set and one over vanderbank laughed where thens tishy  charming and grave the girl thought a moment shes in paris with her motheron their way to aixlesbains then with impatience she continued do you know thats a great deal to saywhat you said just now i mean about your being the best friend i have  of course i do and thats exactly why i said it you see im not in the least delicate or graceful or shy about iti just come out with it and defy you to contradict me who if im not the best is a better one  well nanda replied i feel since ive known mr longdon that ive almost the sort of friend who makes every one else not count  then at the end of three months he has arrived at a value for you that i havent reached in all these years  yes she returnedthe value of my not being afraid of him  vanderbank on the bench shifted his position turning more to her and throwing an arm over the back and youre afraid of me  horriblyhideously  then our long our happy relations  theyre just what makes my terror she broke in particularly abject happy relations dont matter i always think of you with fear  his elbow rested on the back and his hand supported his head how awfully curiousif it be true  she had been looking away to the sweet english distance but at this she made a movement oh mr van im true  as mr van himself couldnt have expressed at any subsequent time to any interested friend the particular effect upon him of the tone of these words his chronicler takes advantage of the fact not to pretend to a greater intelligenceto limit himself on the contrary to the simple statement that they produced in mr vans cheek a flush just discernible fear of what  i dont know fear is fear  yes yesi see he took out another cigarette and occupied a moment in lighting it well kindness is kindness toothats all one can say  he had smoked again a while before she turned to him have i wounded you by saying that  a certain effect of his flush was still in his smile it seems to me i should like you to wound me i did what i wanted a moment ago he continued with some precipitation i brought you out handsomely on the subject of mr longdon that was my ideajust to draw you  well said nanda looking away again he has come into my life  he couldnt have come into a place where it gives me more pleasure to see him  but he didnt like the other day when i used it to him that expression the girl returned he called it mannered modern slang and came back again to the extraordinary difference between my speech and my grandmothers  of course the young man understandingly assented but i rather like your speech hasnt he by this time with you he pursued crossed the gulf he has with me  ah with you there was no gulf he liked you from the first  vanderbank wondered you mean i managed him so well  i dont know how you managed him but liking me has been for him a painful gradual process i think he does now nanda declared he accepts me at last as differenthes trying with me on that basis he has ended by understanding that when he talks to me of granny i cant even imagine her  vanderbank puffed away i can  thats what mitchy says too but youve both probably got her wrong  i dont know said vanderbankive gone into it a good deal but its too late we cant be greeks if we would  even for this nanda had no laugh though she had a quick attention do you call granny a greek  her companion slowly rose yesto finish her off handsomely and have done with her he looked again at his watch shall we go i want to see if my man and my things have turned up  she kept her seat there was something to revert to my fear of you isnt superficial i mean it isnt immediatenot of you just as you stand she explained its of some dreadfully possible future you  well said the young man smiling down at her dont forget that if theres to be such a monster therell also be a future you proportionately developed to deal with him  she had closed her parasol in the shade and her eyes attached themselves to the small hole she had dug in the ground with its point we shall both have moved you mean  its charming to feel we shall probably have moved together  ah if movings changing she returned there wont be much for me in that i shall never changei shall be always just the same the same old mannered modern slangy hack she continued quite gravely mr longdon has made me feel that  vanderbank laughed aloud and it was especially at her seriousness well upon my soul  yes she pursued what i am i must remain i havent whats called a principle of growth making marks in the earth with her umbrella she appeared to cipher it out im about as good as i can beand about as bad if mr longdon cant make me different nobody can  vanderbank could only speak in the tone of high amusement and he has given up the hope  yesthough not me altogether he has given up the hope he originally had  he gives up quicklyin three months  oh these three months she answered have been a long time the fullest the most important for what has happened in them of my life she still poked at the ground then she added and all thanks to you  to mevanderbank couldnt fancy  why for what we were speaking of just nowmy being today so in everything and squeezing up and down no matter whose staircase isnt it one crowded hour of glorious life she asked what preceded it was an age no doubtbut an age without a name  vanderbank watched her a little in silence then spoke quite beside the question its astonishing how at moments you remind me of your mother  at this she got up ah there it is its what i shall never shake off that i imagine is what mr longdon feels  both on their feet now as if ready for the others they yetand even a trifle awkwardlylingered it might in fact have appeared to a spectator that some climax had come on the young mans part to some state of irresolution about the utterance of something what were the words so repeatedly on his lips yet so repeatedly not sounded it would have struck our observer that they were probably not those his lips even now actually formed doesnt he perhaps talk to you too much about yourself  nanda gave him a dim smile and he might indeed then have exclaimed on a certain resemblance a resemblance of expression that had nothing to do with form it wouldnt have been diminished for him moreover by her successful suppression of every sign that she felt his question a little of a snub the recall he had previously mentioned could however as she answered him only have been brushed away by a supervening sense of his roughness it probably isnt so much that as my own way of going on she spoke with a mildness that could scarce have been so full without being an effort between his patience and my egotism anythings possible it isnt his talkingits his listening she gave up the point at any rate as if from softness to her actual companion wasnt it you who spoke to mamma about my sitting with her thats what i mean by my debt to you its through you that im always therethrough you and perhaps a little through mitchy  oh through mitchyit must have beenmore than through me vanderbank spoke with the manner of humouring her about a trifle mitchy delightful man felt on the subject of your eternal exile i think still more strongly  they quitted their place together and at the end of a few steps became aware of the approach of one of the others a figure but a few yards off arriving from the quarter from which nanda had come ah mr longdonshe spoke with eagerness now  vanderbank instantly waved his hat dear old boy  between you all at any rate she said more gaily youve brought me down  vanderbank made no answer till they met their friend when by way of greeting he simply echoed her words between us all youll be glad to know weve brought her down  mr longdon looked from one of them to the other where have you been together  nanda was the first to respond only talkingon a bench  well i want to talk on a bench their friend showed a spirit  with me of coursevanderbank met it with encouragement  the girl said nothing but mr longdon sought her eyes nowith nanda you must mingle in the crowd  ah the their companion laughed you two are the crowd  wellhave your tea first  vanderbank on this giving it up with the air of amused accommodation that was nevercertainly for these twoat fault in him offered to mr longdon before departing the handshake of greeting he had omitted a demonstration really the warmer for the tone of the joke that went with it intrigant    ii  nanda praised to the satellite so fantastically described the charming spot she had quitted with the effect that they presently took fresh possession of it finding the beauty of the view deepened as the afternoon grew old and the shadows long they were of a comfortable agreement on these matters by which moreover they were but little delayed one of the pair at least being too conscious for the hour of still other phenomena than the natural and peaceful process that filled the air well you must tell me about these things mr longdon sociably said he had joined his young friend with a budget of impressions rapidly gathered at the house as to which his appeal to her for a light or two may be taken as the measure of the confidence now ruling their relations he had come to feel at last he mentioned that he could allow for most differences yet in such a situation as the present bewilderment could only come back there were no differences in the worldso it had all ended for himbut those that marked at every turn the manners he had for three months been observing in good society the general wide deviation of this body occupied his mind to the exclusion of almost everything else and he had finally been brought to believe that even in his slowpaced prime he must have hung behind his contemporaries he had not supposed at the momentin the fifties and the sixtiesthat he passed for oldfashioned but life couldnt have left him so far in the rear had the start between them originally been fair this was the way he had more than once put the matter to the girl which gives a sufficient hint it is hoped of the range of some of their talk it had always wound up indeed their talk with some assumption of the growth of his actual understanding but it was just these pauses in the fray that seemed to lead from time to time to a sharper clash it was apt to be when he felt as if he had exhausted surprises that he really received his greatest shocks there were no such queertasting draughts as some of those yielded by the bucket that had repeatedly as he imagined touched the bottom of the well now this sudden invasion of somebodysheaven knows whosehouse and our dropping down on it like a swarm of locusts i dare say it isnt civil to criticise it when ones going too so almost culpably with the stream but what are people made of that they consent just for money to the violation of their homes  nanda wondered she cultivated the sense of his making her intensely reflect but havent people in england always let their places  if were a nation of shopkeepers you mean it cant date on the scale on which we show it only from last week no doubt no doubt and the more one thinks of it the more one seems to see that societyfor were in society arent we and thats our horizoncan never have been anything but increasingly vulgar the point is that in the twilight of timeand i belong you see to the twilightit had made out much less how vulgar it could be it did its best very probably but there were too many superstitions it had to get rid of it has been throwing them overboard one by one so that now the ship sails uncommonly light thats the wayand with his eyes on the golden distance he ingeniously followed it outi come to feel so the lurching and pitching if i werent a pretty fair sailorwell as it is my dear he interrupted himself with a laugh i show you often enough what grabs i make for support he gave a faint gasp half amusement half anguish then abruptly relieved himself by a question to whom in point of fact does the place belong  im awfully ashamed but im afraid i dont know that just came up here the girl went on for mr van  mr longdon seemed to think an instant oh it came up did it and mr van couldnt tell  he has quite forgottenthough he has been here before of course it may have been with other people she added in extenuation i mean it maynt have been theirs then any more than its mitchys  i see they too had just bundled in  nanda completed the simple history today its mitchy who bundles and i believe that really he bundled only yesterday he turned in his people and here we are  here we are here we are her friend more gravely echoed well its splendid  as if at a note in his voice her eyes while his own still strayed away just fixed him dont you think its really rather exciting everythings ready the feast all spread and with nothing to blunt our curiosity but the general knowledge that there will be people and thingswith nothing but that we comfortably take our places he answered nothing though her picture apparently reached him there are people there are things and all in a plenty had every one when you came away turned up she asked as he was still silent  i dare say there were some ladies and gentlemen on the terrace whom i didnt know but i looked only for you and came this way on an indication of your mothers  and did she ask that if you should find me with mr van youd make him come to her  mr longdon replied to this with some delay and without movement how could she have supposed he was here  since he had not yet been to the house oh it has always been a wonder to me the things that mamma supposes i see she asked you nanda insisted  at this her old friend turned to her but it wasnt because of that i got rid of him  she had a pause noyou dont mind everything mamma says  i dont mind everything anybody says not even my dear when the persons you  again she waited an instant not even when its mr van  mr longdon candidly considered oh i take him up on all sorts of things  that shows then the importance they have for you is he like his grandmother the girl pursued then as her companion looked vague wasnt it his grandmother too you knew  he had an extraordinary smile his mother  she exclaimed colouring on her mistake and he added im not so bad as that but youre none of you like them  wasnt she pretty nanda asked  very handsome but it makes no difference she herself today wouldnt know him  she gave a small gasp his own mother wouldnt  his headshake just failed of sharpness no nor he her theres a link missing then as if after all she might take him too seriously of course its i he more gently moralised who have lost the link in my sleep ive slept half the centuryim rip van winkle he went back after a moment to her question hes not at any rate like his mother  she turned it over perhaps you wouldnt think so much of her now  perhaps not at all events my snatching you from mr vanderbank was my own idea  i wasnt thinking nanda said of your snatching me i was thinking of your snatching yourself  i might have sent you to the house well mr longdon replied i find i take more and more the economical view of my pleasures i run them less and less together i get all i can out of each  so now youre getting all you can out of me  all i can my dearall i can he watched a little the flushed distance then mildly broke out it is as you said just now exciting but it makes meand he became abrupt againwant you as ive already told you to come to my place not however that we may be still more mad together  the girl shared from the bench his contemplation do you call this madness  well he rather stuck to it you spoke of it yourself as excitement youll make of course one of your fine distinctions but i take it in my rough way as a whirl were going round and round in a minute he had folded his arms with the same closeness vanderbank had usedin a minute he too was nervously shaking his foot steady steady if we sit close we shall see it through but come down to suffolk for sanity  you do mean then that i may come alone  i wont receive you i assure you on any other terms i want to show you he continued what life can give not of course he subjoined of this sort of thing  noyouve told me of peace  of peace said mr longdon oh you dont knowyou havent the least idea thats just why i want to show you  nanda looked as if already she saw it in the distance but will it be peace if im there i mean for you she added  it isnt a question of me everybodys omelet is made of somebodys eggs besides i think that when were alone together  he had dropped for so long that she wondered well when we are  why it will be all right he simply concluded temples of peace the ancients used to call them well set up one and i shall be at least doorkeeper youll come down whenever you like  she gave herself to him in her silence more than she could have done in words have you arranged it with mamma she said however at last  ive arranged everything  she wont want to come  her friends laugh turned him to her dont be nervous there are things as to which your mother trusts me  but others as to which not  their eyes met for some time on this and it ended in his saying well you must help me nanda but without shrinking looked away again and mr longdon as if to consecrate their understanding by the air of ease passed to another subject mr mitchetts the most princely host  isnt he too kind for anything do you know what he pretends nanda went on he says in the most extraordinary way that he does it all for me  takes this great place and fills it with servants and company  yes just so that i may come down for a sunday or two of course he has only taken it for three or four weeks but even for that time its a handsome compliment he doesnt care what he does its his way of amusing himself he amuses himself at our expense the girl continued  well i hope that makes up my dear for the rate at which were doing so at his  his amusement said nanda is to see us believe what he says  mr longdon thought a moment really my child youre most acute  oh i havent watched life for nothing mitchy doesnt care she repeated  her companion seemed divided between a desire to draw and a certain fear to encourage her doesnt care for what  she considered an instant all coherently and it might have added to mr longdons impression of her depth well for himself i mean for his money for anything any one may think for lord petherton for instance really at all lord petherton thinks he has helped himthinks that is that mitchy thinks he has but mitchys more amused at him than at anybody else he takes every one in  every one but you  oh i like him  my poor child youre of a profundity mr longdon murmured  he spoke almost uneasily but she was not too much alarmed to continue lucid and he likes me and i know just how muchand just how little hes the most generous man in the world it pleases him to feel that hes indifferent and splendidthere are so many things it makes up to him for the old man listened with attention and his young friend conscious of it proceeded as on ground of which she knew every inch hes the son as you know of a great bootmakerto all the courts of europewho left him a large fortune which had been made i believe in the most extraordinary way by buildingspeculations as well  oh yes i know its astonishing her companion sighed  that he should be of such extraction  well everything that you should be talking as you arethat you should have watched life as you say to such purpose that we should any of us be heremost of all that mr mitchett himself should that your grandmothers daughter should have brought her daughter  to stay with a personnanda took it up as apparently out of delicacy he fairly failedwhose father used to take the measure down on his knees on a little mat as mamma says of my grandfathers remarkably large foot yes we none of us mind do you think we should nanda asked  mr longdon turned it over ill answer you by a question would you marry him  never then as if to show there was no weakness in her mildness never never never she repeated  and yet i dare say you know but mr longdon once more faltered his scruple came uppermost you dont mind my speaking of it  of his thinking he wants to marry me not a bit i positively enjoy telling you theres nothing in it  not even for him  nanda considered not more than is made up to him by his having found out through talks and thingswhich mightnt otherwise have occurredthat i do like him i wouldnt have come down here if i hadnt liked him  not for any other reasonmr longdon put it gravely  not for your being here do you mean  he delayed me and other persons  she showed somehow that she wouldnt flinch you werent asked till after he had made sure id come weve become you and i she smiled one of the couples who are invited together  these were couples his speculative eye seemed to show he didnt even yet know about and if he mentally took them up a moment it was all promptly to drop them i dont think you state it quite strongly enough you know  that mitchy is hard hit he states it so strongly himself that it will surely do for both of us im a part of what i just spoke ofhis indifference and magnificence its as if he could only afford to do whats not vulgar he might perfectly marry a dukes daughter but that would be vulgarwould be the absolute necessity and ideal of nine out of ten of the sons of shoemakers made ambitious by riches mitchy says no i take my own line i go in for a beggarmaid and its only because im a beggarmaid that he wants me  but there are plenty of other beggarmaids mr longdon objected  oh i admit im the one he least dislikes but if i had any money nanda went on or if i were really goodlookingfor that today the real thing will do as well as being a dukes daughterhe wouldnt come near me and i think that ought to settle it besides he must marry aggie shes a beggarmaid tooas well as an angel so theres nothing against it  mr longdon stared but even in his surprise seemed to take from the swiftness with which she made him move over the ground a certain agreeable glow does aggie like him  she likes every one as i say shes an angelbut a real real real one the kindest man in the worlds therefore the proper husband for her if mitchy wants to do something thoroughly nice she declared with the same high competence hell take her out of her situation which is awful  mr longdon looked graver in what way awful  why dont you know his eye was now cold enough to give her in her chill a flurried sense that she might displease him least by a graceful lightness the duchess and lord petherton are like you and me  is it a conundrum he was serious indeed  theyre one of the couples who are invited together but his face reflected so little success for her levity that it was in another tone she presently added mitchy really oughtnt her friend in silence fixed his eyes on the ground an attitude in which there was something to make her strike rather wild but of course kind as he is he can scarcely be called particular he has his ideashe thinks nothing matters he says weve all come to a pass thats the end of everything  mr longdon remained mute a while and when he at last raised his eyes it was without meeting nandas and with some dryness of manner the end of everything one might easily receive that impression  he again became mute and there was a pause between them of some length accepted by nanda with an anxious stillness that it might have touched a spectator to observe she sat there as if waiting for some further sign only wanting not to displease her friend yet unable to pretend to play any part and with something in her really that she couldnt take back now something involved in her original assumption that there was to be a kind of intelligence in their relation i dare say she said at last that i make allusions you dont like but i keep forgetting  he waited a moment longer then turned to her with a look rendered a trifle strange by the way it happened to reach over his glasses it was even austerer than before keep forgetting what  she gave after an instant a faint feeble smile which seemed to speak of helplessness and which when at rare moments it played in her face was expressive from her positive lack of personal superficial diffidence welli dont know it was as if appearances became at times so complicated thatso far as helping others to understand was concernedshe could only give up  i hope you dont think i want you to be with me as you wouldnt beso to speakwith yourself i hope you dont think i dont want you to be frank if you were to try to appear to me anything he ended in simple sadness that for instance would be so little what he should like  anything different you mean from what i am thats just what ive thought from the first ones just what one isisnt one i dont mean so much she went on in ones character or temperfor they have havent they to be whats called properly controlledas in ones mind and what one sees and feels and the sort of thing one notices nanda paused an instant then there you are she simply but rather desperately brought out  mr longdon considered this with visible intensity what you suggest is that the things you speak of depend on other people  well every one isnt so beautiful as you she had met him with promptitude yet no sooner had she spoken than she appeared again to encounter a difficulty but there it ismy just saying even that oh how i always knowas ive told you beforewhenever im different i cant ask you to tell me the things granny would have said because thats simply arranging to keep myself back from you and so being nasty and underhand which you naturally dont want nor i either nevertheless when i say the things she wouldnt then i put before you too muchtoo much for your liking itwhat i know and see and feel if were both partly the result of other people her other people were so different the girls sensitive boldness kept it up but there was something in her that pleaded for patience and yet if she had you so ive got you too its the flattery of that or the sound of it i know that must be so unlike her of course its awfully like mother yet it isnt as if you hadnt already let me seeis itthat you dont really think me the same again she stopped a minute as to find her scarce possible way with him and again for the time he gave no sign she struck out once more with her strange cool limpidity granny wasnt the kind of girl she couldnt beand so neither am i  mr longdon had fallen while she talked into something that might have been taken for a conscious temporary submission to her he had uncrossed his fidgety legs and thrusting them out with the feet together sat looking very hard before him his chin sunk on his breast and his hands clasped as they met rapidly twirling their thumbs so he remained for a time that might have given his young friend the sense of having made herself right for him so far as she had been wrong he still had all her attention just as previously she had had his but while he now simply gazed and thought she watched him with a discreet solicitude that would almost have represented him as a near relative whom she supposed unwell at the end he looked round and then obeying some impulse that had gathered in her while they sat mute she put out to him the tender hand she might have offered to a sick child they had been talking about frankness but she showed a frankness in this instance that made him perceptibly colour to that in turn however he responded only the more completely taking her hand and holding it keeping it a long minute during which their eyes met and something seemed to clear up that had been too obscure to be dispelled by words finally he brought out as if though it was what he had been thinking of her gesture had most determined him i wish immensely youd get married  his tone betrayed so special a meaning that the words had a sound of suddenness yet there was always in nandas face that odd preparedness of the young person who has unlearned surprise through the habit in company of studiously not compromising her innocence by blinking at things said how can i she asked but appearing rather to take up the proposal than to put it by  cant you cant you he spoke pressingly and kept her hand she shook her head slowly markedly on which he continued you dont do justice to mr mitchy she said nothing but her look was there and it made him resume impossible  impossible at this letting her go mr longden got up he pulled out his watch we must go back she had risen with him and they stood face to face in the faded light while he slipped the watch away well that doesnt make me wish it any less  its lovely of you to wish it but i shall be one of the people who dont i shall be at the end said nanda one of those who havent  no my child he returned gravelyyou shall never be anything so sad  why notif youve been he looked at her a little quietly and then putting out his hand passed her own into his arm exactly because i have    iii  would you the duchess said to him the next day be for five minutes awfully kind to my poor little niece the words were spoken in charming entreaty as he issued from the house late on the sunday afternoonthe second evening of his stay which the next morning was to bring to an endand on his meeting the speaker at one of the extremities of the wide cool terrace there was at this point a subsidiary flight of steps by which she had just mounted from the grounds one of her purposes being apparently to testify afresh to the anxious supervision of little aggie she had momentarily suffered herself to be diverted from this young lady established in the pleasant shade on a sofa of light construction designed for the open air offered the image of a patience of which it was a questionable kindness to break the spell it was that beautiful hour when toward the close of the happiest days of summer such places as the great terrace at mertle present to the fancy a recall of the banquethall deserteddeserted by the company lately gathered at tea and now dispersed according to affinities and combinations promptly felt and perhaps quite as promptly criticised either in quieter chambers where intimacy might deepen or in gardens and under trees where the stillness knew the click of balls and the good humour of games there had been chairs on the terrace pushed about there were ungathered teacups on the level top of the parapet the servants in fact in the manner of hands mustered by a whistle on the deck of a ship had just arrived to restore things to an order soon again to be broken there were scattered couples in sight below and an idle group on the lawn out of the midst of which in spite of its detachment somebody was sharp enough sometimes to cry out the high daylight was still in the sky but with just the foreknowledge already of the long golden glow in which the manyvoiced caw of the rooks would sound at once sociable and sad there was a great deal all about to be aware of and to look at but little aggie had her eyes on a book over which her pretty head was bent with a docility visible even from afar ive a frienddown there by the laketo go back to the duchess went on and im on my way to my room to get a letter that ive promised to show him i shall immediately bring it down and then in a few minutes be able to relieve youi dont leave her alone too muchone doesnt you know in a house full of people a child of that age besidesand mr longdons interlocutress was even more confidingi do want you so very intensely to know her you par exemple youre what i should like to give her mr longdon looked the noble lady in acknowledgement of her appeal straight in the face and who can tell whether or no she acutely guessed from his expression that he recognised this particular juncture as written on the page of his doomwhether she heard him inaudibly say ah here it is i knew it would have to come she would at any rate have been astute enough had this miracle occurred quite to complete his sense for her own understanding and suffer it to make no difference in the tone in which she still confronted him oh i take the bull by the hornsi know you havent wanted to know me if you had youd have called on meive given you plenty of hints and little coughs now you see i dont cough any morei just rush at you and grab you you dont call on meso i call on you there isnt any indecency moreover that i wont commit for my child  mr longdons impenetrability crashed like glass at the elbowtouch of this large handsome practised woman who walked for him like some brazen pagan goddess in a cloud of queer legend he looked off at her child who at a distance and not hearing them had not moved i know shes a great friend of nandas  has nanda told you that  oftentaking such an interest in her  im glad she thinks so thenthough really her interests are so various but come to my baby i dont make her come she explained as she swept him along because i want you just to sit down by her there and keep the place as one may say  well for whom he demanded as she stopped it was her step that had checked itself as well as her tongue and again suddenly they stood quite consciously and vividly opposed can i trust you the duchess brought out again then she took herself up but as if i werent already doing it its because i do trust you so utterly that i havent been able any longer to keep my hands off you the person i want the place for is none other than mitchy himself and half my occupation now is to get it properly kept for him lord pethertons immensely kind but lord petherton cant do everything i know you really like our host  mr longdon at this interrupted her with a certain coldness how may i ask do you know it  but with a brazen goddess to deal with this personage had to fix him but an instant because you dear honest man youre here you wouldnt be if you hated him for you dont practically condone  this time he broke in with his eyes on the child i feel on the contrary i assure you that i condone a great deal  well dont boast of your cynicism she laughed till youre sure of all it covers let the right thing for you be she went on that nanda herself wants it  nanda herself he continued to watch little aggie who had never yet turned her head im afraid i dont understand you  she swept him on again ill come to you presently and explain i must get my letter for petherton after which ill give up mitchy whom i was going to find and since ive broken the iceif it isnt too much to say to such a polar bearill show you le fond de ma pensee baby darling she said to her niece keep mr longdon show him she benevolently suggested what youve been reading then again to her fellow guest as arrested by this very question caro signore have you a possible book  little aggie had got straight up and was holding out her volume which mr longdon all courtesy for her glanced at stories from english history oh  his ejaculation though vague was not such as to prevent the girl from venturing gently have you read it  mr longdon receiving her pure little smile showed he felt he had never so taken her in as at this moment as well as also that she was a person with whom he should surely get on i think i must have  little aggie was still more encouraged but not to the point of keeping anything back it hasnt any author its anonymous  the duchess borrowed for another question to mr longdon not a little of her gravity is it all right  i dont knowhis answer was to aggie there have been some horrid things in english history  oh horridhavent there aggie whose speech had the prettiest faintest foreignness sweetly and eagerly quavered  well darling mr longdon will recommend to you some nice historical workfor we love history dont wethat leaves the horrors out we like to know the duchess explained to the authority she invoked the cheerful happy right things there are so many after all and this is the place to remember them a tantot  as she passed into the house by the nearest of the long windows that stood open mr longdon placed himself beside her little charge whom he treated for the next ten minutes with an exquisite courtesy a person who knew him well would if present at the scene have found occasion in it to be freshly aware that he was in his quiet way master of two distinct kinds of urbanity the kind that added to distance and the kind that diminished it such an analyst would furthermore have noted in respect to the aunt and the niece of which kind each had the benefit and might even have gone so far as to detect in him some absolute betrayal of the impression produced on him by his actual companion some irradiation of his certitude that from the point of view under which she had been formed she was a remarkable a rare success since to create a particular little rounded and tinted innocence had been aimed at the fruit had been grown to the perfection of a peach on a sheltered wall and this quality of the object resulting from a process might well make him feel himself in contact with something wholly new little aggie differed from any young person he had ever met in that she had been deliberately prepared for consumption and in that furthermore the gentleness of her spirit had immensely helped the preparation nanda beside her was a northern savage and the reason was partly that the elements of that young ladys nature were already were publicly were almost indecorously active they were practically there for good or for ill experience was still to come and what they might work out to still a mystery but the sum would get itself done with the figures now on the slate on little aggies slate the figures were yet to be written which sufficiently accounted for the difference of the two surfaces both the girls struck him as lambs with the great shambles of life in their future but while one with its neck in a pink ribbon had no consciousness but that of being fed from the hand with the small sweet biscuit of unobjectionable knowledge the other struggled with instincts and forebodings with the suspicion of its doom and the farborne scent in the flowery fields of blood  oh nanda shes my best friend after three or four others  after so many mr longdon laughed dont you think thats rather a back seat as they say for ones best  a back seatshe wondered with a purity  if you dont understand said her companion it serves me right as your aunt didnt leave me with you to teach you the slang of the day  the slangshe again spotlessly speculated  youve never even heard the expression i should think that a great compliment to our time if it werent that i fear it may have been only the name that has been kept from you  the light of ignorance in the childs smile was positively golden the name she again echoed  she understood too littlehe gave it up and who are all the other best friends whom poor nanda comes after  well theres my aunt and miss merriman and gelsomina and dr beltram  and who please is miss merriman  shes my governess dont you knowbut such a deliciously easy governess  that i suppose is because she has such a deliciously easy pupil and who is gelsomina mr longdon enquired  shes my old nursemy old maid  i see well one must always be kind to old maids but whos dr beltram  oh the most intimate friend of all we tell him everything  there was for mr longdon in this with a slight incertitude an effect of drollery your little troubles  ah theyre not always so little and he takes them all away  alwayson the spot  sooner or later said little aggie with serenity but why not  why not indeed he laughed it must be very plain sailing decidedly she was as nanda had said an angel and there was a wonder in her possession on this footing of one of the most expressive little faces that even her expressive race had ever shown him formed to express everything it scarce expressed as yet even a consciousness all the elements of play were in it but they had nothing to play with it was a rest moreover after so much that he had lately been through to be with a person for whom questions were so simple but he sounds all the same like the kind of doctor whom as soon as one hears of him one wants to send for  the young girl had at this a small light of confusion oh i dont mean hes a doctor for medicine hes a clergymanand my aunt says hes a saint i dont think youve many in england little aggie continued to explain  many saints im afraid not your aunts very happy to know one we should call dr beltram in england a priest  oh but hes english and he knows everything we doand everything we think  weyour aunt your governess and your nurse what a varied wealth of knowledge  ah miss merriman and gelsomina tell him only what they like  and do you and the duchess tell him what you dont like  oh oftenbut we always like himno matter what we tell him and we know that just the same he always likes us  i see then of course said mr longdon very gravely now what a friend he must be so its after all this he continued in a moment that nanda comes in  his companion had to consider but suddenly she caught assistance this one i think comes before lord petherton arriving apparently from the garden had drawn near unobserved by mr longdon and the next moment was within hail i see him very often she continuedoftener than nanda oh but then nanda and then little aggie wound up mr mitchy  oh im glad he comes in mr longdon returned though rather far down in the list lord petherton was now before them there being no one else on the terrace to speak to and with the odd look of an excess of physical power that almost blocked the way he seemed to give them in the flare of his big teeth the benefit of a kind of brutal geniality it was always to be remembered for him that he could scarce show without surprising you an adjustment to the smaller conveniences so that when he took up a trifle it was not perforce in every case the sign of an uncanny calculation when the elephant in the show plays the fiddle it must be mainly with the presumption of consequent apples which was why doubtless this personage had half the time the air of assuring you that really civilised as his type had now become no apples were required mr longdon viewed him with a vague apprehension and as if quite unable to meet the question of what he would have called for such a personage the social responsibility did this specimen of his class pull the tradition down or did he just take it where he found itin the very different place from that in which on ceasing so long ago to go out mr longdon had left it our friend doubtless averted himself from the possibility of a mental dilemma if the man didnt lower the position was it the position then that let down the man somehow he wasnt positively up more evidence would be needed to decide yet it was just of more evidence that one remained rather in dread lord petherton was kind to little aggie kind to her companion kind to every one after mr longdon had explained that she was so good as to be giving him the list of her dear friends im only a little dismayed the elder man said to find mr mitchett at the bottom  oh but its an awfully short list isnt it if it consists only of me and mitchy hes not so very low down we dont allow her very many friends we look out too well for ourselves he addressed the child as on an easy jocose understanding is the question aggie whether we shall allow you mr longdon wont that rather do for usfor mitchy and me i say duchess he went on as this lady reappeared are we going to allow her mr longdon and do we quite realise what were about we mount guard awfully you knowhe carried the joke back to the person he had named we sift and we sort we pick the candidates over and i should like to hear any one say that in this case at least i dont keep a watch on my taste oh we close in  the duchess the object of her quest in her hand had come back well then mr longdon will close with usyoull consider henceforth that hes as safe as yourself heres the letter i wanted you to readwith which youll please take a turn in strict charge of the child and then restore her to us if you dont come i shall know youve found mitchy and shall be at peace go little heart she continued to the child but leave me your book to look over again i dont know that im quite sure she sent them off together but had a grave protest as her friend put out his hand for the volume no pethertonnot for books for her reading i cant say i do trust you but for everything elsequite she declared to mr longdon with a look of conscientious courage as their companion withdrew i do believe she pursued in the same spirit in a certain amount of intelligent confidence really nice men are steadied by the sense of your having had it but i wouldnt she added gaily trust him all round    iv  many things at mertle were strange for her interlocutor but nothing perhaps as yet had been so strange as the sight of this arrangement for little aggies protection an arrangement made in the interest of her remaining as a young person of her age and her mondeso her aunt would have put itshould remain the strangest part of the impression too was that the provision might really have its happy side and his lordship understand definitely better than any one else his noble friends whole theory of perils and precautions the child herself the spectator of the incident was sure enough understood nothing but the understandings that surrounded her filling all the air made it a heavier compound to breathe than any mr longdon had yet tasted this heaviness had grown for him through the long sweet summer day and there was something in his at last finding himself ensconced with the duchess that made it supremely oppressive the contact was one that none the less he would not have availed himself of a decent pretext to avoid with so many fine mysteries playing about him there was relief at the point he had reached rather than alarm in the thought of knowing the worst which it pressed upon him somehow that the duchess must not only altogether know but must in any relation quite naturally communicate it fluttered him rather that a person who had an understanding with lord petherton should so single him out as to wish for one also with himself such a person must either have great variety of mind or have a wonderful idea of his variety it was true indeed that mr mitchett must have the most extraordinary understanding and yet with mr mitchett he now found himself quite pleasantly at his ease their host however was a person sui generis whom he had accepted once for all the inconsequence of liking in conformity with the need he occasionally felt to put it on record that he was not narrowminded perhaps at bottom he most liked mitchy because mitchy most liked nanda there hung about him still moreover the faded fragrance of the superstition that hospitality not declined is one of the things that oblige it obliged the thoughts for mr longdon as well as the manners and in the especial form in which he was now committed to it would have made him had he really thought any ill ask himself what the deuce then he was doing in the mans house all of which didnt prevent some of mitchys queer condonationsif condonations in fact they werefrom not wholly by themselves soothing his vague unrest an unrest which never had been so great as at the moment he heard the duchess abruptly say to him do you know my idea about nanda its my particular desire you shouldthe reason really why ive thus laid violent hands on you nanda my dear man should marry at the very first moment  this was more interesting than he had expected and the effect produced by his interlocutress as well as doubtless not lost on her was shown in his suppressed start there has been no reason why i should attribute to you any judgement of the matter but ive had one myself and i dont see why i shouldnt say frankly that its very much the one you express it would be a very good thing  a very good thing but none of my businessthe duchesss vivacity was not unamiable  it was on this circumstance that her companion for an instant perhaps meditated its probably not in my interest to say that i should give you too easy a retort it would strike any one as quite as much your business as mine  well it ought to be somebodys you know one would suppose it to be her mothersher fathers but in this country the parents are even more emancipated than the children suppose really since it appears to be nobodys affair that you and i do make it ours we neednt either of us she continued be concerned for the others reasons though im perfectly ready i assure you to put my cards on the table youve your feelingswe know theyre beautiful i on my side have minefor which i dont pretend anything but that theyre strong they can dispense with being beautiful when theyre so perfectly settled besides i may mention theyre rather nice than otherwise edward and i have a cousinage though for all he does to keep it up if he leaves his children to play in the street i take it seriously enough to make an occasional dash for them before theyre run over and i want for nanda simply the man she herself wantsit isnt as if i wanted for her a dwarf or a hunchback or a coureur or a drunkard vanderbanks a man whom any woman dont you think might bewhom more than one woman isglad of for herself beau comme le jour awfully conceited and awfully patronising but clever and successful and yet liked and without so far as i know any of the terrific appendages which in this country so often diminish the value of even the pleasantest people he hasnt five horrible unmarried sisters for his wife to have always on a visit the way your women dont marry is the ruin here of society and ive been assured in good quartersthough i dont know so much about thatthe ruin also of conversation and of literature isnt it precisely just a little to keep nanda herself from becoming that kind of appendagesay to poor harold say one of these days to her younger brother and sisterthat friends like you and me feel the importance of bestirring ourselves in time of course shes supposedly young but shes really any age you like your london world so fearfully batters and bruises them she had gone fast and far but it had given mr longdon time to feel himself well afloat there were so many things in it all to take up that he laid his handof which he was not unconscious the feebleness exposed himon the nearest why im sure her motherafter twenty years of itis fresh enough  fresh you find mrs brook fresh the duchess had a manner that in its allknowingness rather humiliated than encouraged but he was all the more resolute for being conscious of his own reserves it seems to me its fresh to look about thirty  that indeed would be perfect but she doesntshe looks about three she simply looks a baby  oh duchess youre really too particular he retorted feeling that as the trodden worm will turn anxiety itself may sometimes tend to wit  she met him in her own way i know what i mean my niece is a person i call fresh its warranted as they say in the shops besides she went on if a married woman has been knocked about thats only a part of her condition elle la lien voulu and if youre married youre married its the smokeor call it the sootof the fire you know yourself she roundly pursued that nandas situation appals you  oh appals he restrictively murmured  it even tried a little his companions patience there you are you englishyoull never face your own music its amazing what youd rather do with a thinganything not to shoot at or to make money withthan look at its meaning if i wished to save the girl as you wish it i should know exactly from what but why differ about reasons she asked when were at one about the fact i dont mention the greatest of vanderbanks merits she addedhis having so delicious a friend by whom let me hasten to assure you she laughed i dont in the least mean mrs brook she is delicious if you like but believe me when i tell you caro mioif you need to be toldthat for effective action on him youre worth twenty of her  what was most visible in mr longdon was that however it came to him he had rarely before all at once had so much given him to think about again the only way to manage was to take what came uppermost by effective action you mean action on the matter of his proposing for nanda  the duchesss assent was noble you can make him proposeyou can make i mean a sure thing of it you can doter the bride then as with the impulse to meet benevolently and more than halfway her companions imperfect apprehension you can settle on her something that will make her a parti his apprehension was perhaps imperfect but it could still lead somehow to his flushing all over and this demonstration the duchess as quickly took into account poor edward you know wont give her a penny  decidedly she went fast but mr longdon in a moment had caught up mr vanderbankyour idea iswould require on the part of his wife something of that sort  pray who wouldntin the world we all move inrequire it quite as much mr vanderbank im assured has no means of his own at all and if he doesnt believe in impecunious marriages its not i who shall be shocked at him for myself i simply despise them he has nothing but a poor official salary if its enough for one it would be little for two and would be still less for half a dozen theyre just the people to have that blessed pair a fine old english family  mr longdon was now fairly abreast of it what it comes to then the idea youre so good as to put before me is to bribe him to take her  the duchess remained bland but she fixed him you say that as if you were scandalised but if you try mr van with it i dont think hell be and you wont persuade me she went on finely that you havent yourself thought of it she kept her eyes on him and the effect of them soon enough visible in his face was such as presently to make her exult at her felicity youre of a limpidity dear manyouve only to be said bo to and you confess consciously or unconsciouslythe former really im inclined to thinkyouve wanted him for her she paused an instant to enjoy her triumph after which she continued and youve wanted her for him i make you out youll sayfor i see you comingone of those horrible benevolent busybodies who are the worst of the class but youve only to think a littleif i may go so farto see that no making at all is required youve only one link with the brooks but that link is golden how can we all of us by this time not have grasped and admired the beauty of your feeling for lady julia there it isi make you wince to speak of it is to profane it let us by all means not speak of it then but let us act on it he had at last turned his face from her and it now took in from the vantage of his high position only the loveliness of the place and the hour which included a glimpse of lord petherton and little aggie who down in the garden slowly strolled in familiar union each had a hand in the others swinging easily as they went their talk was evidently of flowers and fruits and birds it was quite like father and daughter one could see half a mile off in short that they werent flirting our friends bewilderment came in odd cold gusts these were unreasoned and capricious one of them at all events during his companions pause must have roared in his ears was it not therefore through some continuance of the sound that he heard her go on speaking of course you know the poor childs own condition  it took him a good while to answer do you know it he asked with his eyes still away  if your questions ironical she laughed your ironys perfectly wasted i should be ashamed of myself if with my relationship and my interest i hadnt made sure nandas fairly sickas sick as a little catwith her passion it was with an intensity of silence that he appeared to accept this he was even so dumb for a minute that the oddity of the image could draw from him no natural sound the duchess once more accordingly recognised an occasion it has doubtless already occurred to you that since your sentiment for the living is the charming fruit of your sentiment for the dead there would be a sacrifice to lady julias memory more exquisite than any other  at this finally mr longdon turned the efforton the lines you speak offor nandas happiness  she fairly glowed with hope and by the same token such a piece of poetic justice quite the loveliest it would be i think one had ever heard of  so for some time more they sat confronted i dont quite see your difficulty he said at last i do happen to know i confess that nanda herself extremely desires the execution of your project  his friends smile betrayed no surprise at this effect of her eloquence youre bad at dodging nandas desire is inevitably to stop off for herself every question of any one but vanderbank if she wants me to succeed in arranging with mr mitchett can you ask for a plainer sign of her private predicament but youve signs enough i seeshe caught herself up we may take them all for granted ive known perfectly from the first that the only difficulty would come from her motherbut also that that would be stiff  the movement with which mr longdon removed his glasses might have denoted a certain fear to participate in too much of what the duchess had known ive not been ignorant that mrs brookenham favours mr mitchett  but he was not to be let off with that then youve not been blind i suppose to her reason for doing so he might not have been blind but his vision at this scarce showed sharpness and it determined in his interlocutress the shortest of short cuts she favours mr mitchett because she wants old van herself  he was evidently conscious of looking at her hard in what senseherself  ah you must supply the sense i can give you only the factand its the fact that concerns us voyons she almost impatiently broke out dont try to create unnecessary obscurities by being unnecessarily modest besides im not touching your modesty supply any sense whatever that may miraculously satisfy your fond english imagination i dont insist in the least on a bad one she does want him herselfthats all i say pourquoi faires you askor rather being too shy dont ask but would like to if you dared or didnt fear id be shocked i cant be shocked but frankly i cant tell you either the situation belongs i think to an order i dont understand i understand either one thing or the otheri understand taking a man up or letting him alone but i dont really get at mrs brook you must judge at any rate for yourself vanderbank could of course tell you if he wouldbut it wouldnt be right that he should so the one thing we have to do with is that shes in fact against us i can only work mitchy through petherton but mrs brook can work him straight on the other hand thats the way you my dear man can work vanderbank  one thing evidently beyond the rest as a result of this vivid demonstration disengaged itself to our old friends undismayed sense but his consternation needed a minute or two to produce it i can absolutely assure you that mr vanderbank entertains no sentiment for mrs brookenham  that he may not keep under by just setting his teeth and holding on i never dreamed he does and have nothing so alarming in store for yourassurezvous bienas to propose that he shall be invited to sink a feeling for the mother in order to take one up for the child dont please flutter out of the whole question by a premature scare i never supposed its he who wants to keep her hes not in love with herbe comforted but shes amusinghighly amusing i do her perfect justice as your women go shes rare if she were french shed be a femme desprit she has invented a nuance of her own and she has done it all by herself for edward figures in her drawingroom only as one of those queer extinguishers of fire in the corridors of hotels hes just a bucket on a peg the men the young and the clever ones find it a houseand heaven knows theyre rightwith intellectual elbowroom with freedom of talk most english talk is a quadrille in a sentrybox youll tell me we go further in italy and i wont deny it but in italy we have the common sense not to have little girls in the room the young men hang about mrs brook and the clever ones ply her with the uproarious appreciation that keeps her up to the mark shes in a prodigious fixshe must sacrifice either her daughter or what she once called to me her intellectual habits mr vanderbank youve seen for yourself is of these one of the most cherished the most confirmed three months agoit couldnt be any longer kept offnanda began definitely to sit to be there and look by the teatable modestly and conveniently abstracted  i beg your pardoni dont think she looks that duchess mr longdon lucidly broke in how much she had carried him with her in spite of himself was betrayed by the very terms of his dissent i dont think it would strike any one that she looks convenient  his companion laughing gave a shrug try her and perhaps youll find her so but his objection had none the less pulled her up a little i dont say shes a hypocrite for it would certainly be less decent for her to giggle and wink its mrs brooks theory moreover isnt it that she has from five to seven at least lowered the pitch doesnt she pretend that she bears in mind every moment the tiresome difference made by the presence of sweet virginal eighteen  i havent im afraid a notion of what she pretends  mr longdon had spoken with a curtness to which his friends particular manner of overlooking it only added significance theyve become she pursued superficial or insincere or frivolous but at least theyve become with the way the drags put on quite as dull as other people  he showed no sign of taking this up instead of it he said abruptly but if it isnt mr mitchetts own idea  his fellow visitor barely hesitated it would be his own if he were freeand it would be lord pethertons for him i mean by his being free nandas becoming definitely lost to him then it would be impossible for mrs brook to continue to persuade him as she does now that by a waiting game hell come to his chance his chance will cease to exist and he wants so poor darling to marry youve really now seen my niece she went on thats another reason why i hold you can help me  yesive seen her  well there she is it was as if in the pause that followed this they sat looking at little absent aggie with a wonder that was almost equal the good god has given her to me the duchess said at last  it seems to me then that she herself is in her remarkable loveliness really your help  shell be doubly so if you give me proofs that you believe in her and the duchess appearing to consider that with this she had made herself clear and her interlocutor plastic rose in confident majesty i leave it to you  mr longdon did the same but with more consideration now is it your expectation that i shall speak to mr mitchett  dont flatter yourself he wont speak to you  mr longdon made it out as supposing me you mean an interested party  she clapped her gloved hands for joy its a delight to hear you practically admit that you are one mr mitchett will take anything from youabove all perfect candour it isnt every day one meets your kind and hes a connoisseur i leave it to youi leave it to you  she spoke as if it were something she had thrust bodily into his hands and wished to hurry away from he put his hands behind himstraightening himself a little halfkindled still halfconfused youre all extraordinary people  she gave a toss of her head that showed her as not so dazzled youre the best of us caro mioyou and aggie for aggies as good as you mitchys good too howevermitchys beautiful you see its not only his money hes a gentleman so are you there arent so many but we must move fast she added more sharply  what do you mean by fast  what should i mean but what i say if nanda doesnt get a husband early in the business  well said mr longdon as she appeared to pause with the weight of her idea  why she wont get one lateshe wont get one at all one i mean of the kind shell take shell have been in it overlong for their taste  she had moved looking off and about herlittle aggie always on her mindto the flight of steps where she again hung fire and had really ended by producing in him the manner of keeping up with her to challenge her been in what  she went down a few steps while he stood with his face full of perceptions strained and scattered why in the air they themselves have infected for her    v  late that night in the smoking room when the smokerstalkers and listeners alikewere about to disperse mr longdon asked vanderbank to stay and then it was that the young man to whom all the evening he had not addressed a word could make out why a little unnaturally he had prolonged his vigil ive something particular to say to you and ive been waiting i hope you dont mind its rather important vanderbank expressed on the spot the liveliest desire to oblige him and quickly lighting another cigarette mounted again to the deep divan with which a part of the place was furnished the smokingroom at mertle was not unworthy of the general nobleness and the fastidious spectator had clearly been reckoned on in the great leathercovered lounge that raised by a step or two above the floor applied its back to two quarters of the wall and enjoyed most immediately a view of the billiardtable mr longdon continued for a minute to roam with the air of dissimulated absence that during the previous hour and among the other men his companions eye had not lost he pushed a ball or two about examined the form of an ashstand swung his glasses almost with violence and declined either to smoke or to sit down vanderbank perched aloft on the bench and awaiting developments had a little the look of some prepossessing criminal who in court should have changed places with the judge he was unlike many a man of marked good looks in that the effect of evening dress was not with a perversity often observed in such cases to overemphasise his fineness his type was rather chastened than heightened and he sat there moreover with a primary discretion quite in the note of the deference that from the first with his friend of the elder fashion he had taken as imposed he had a strong sense for shades of respect and was now careful to loll scarcely more than with an official superior if you ask me mr longdon presently continued why at this hour of the nightafter a day at best too heterogeneousi dont keep over till tomorrow whatever i may have to say i can only tell you that i appeal to you now because ive something on my mind that i shall sleep the better for being rid of  there was space to circulate in front of the hautpas where he had still paced and still swung his glasses but with these words he had paused leaning against the billiardtable to meet the interested urbanity of the answer they produced are you very sure that having got rid of it you will sleep is it a pure confidence vanderbank said that you do me the honour to make me is it something terrific that requires a reply so that i shall have to take account on my side of the rest i may deprive you of  dont take account of anythingim myself a man who always takes too much it isnt a matter about which i press you for an immediate answer you can give me no answer probably without a good deal of thought ive thought a good dealotherwise i wouldnt speak i only want to put something before you and leave it there  i never see you said vanderbank that you dont put something before me  that sounds his friend returned as if i rather overloadedwhats the sort of thing you fellows nowadays sayyour intellectual board if theres a congestion of dishes sweep everything without scruple away ive never put before you anything like this  he spoke with a weight that in the great space where it resounded a little made an impressionan impression marked by the momentary pause that fell between them he partly broke the silence first by beginning to walk again and then vanderbank broke it as through the apprehension of their becoming perhaps too solemn well you immensely interest me and you really couldnt have chosen a better time a secretfor we shall make it that of course shant weat this witching hour in this great old house is all my visit here will have required to make the whole thing a rare remembrance so i assure you the more you put before me the better  mr longdon took up another ashtray but with the air of doing so as a direct consequence of vanderbanks tone after he had laid it down he put on his glasses then fixing his companion he brought out have you no idea at all  of what you have in your head dear mr longdon how should i have  well im wondering if i shouldnt perhaps have a little in your place theres nothing that in the circumstances occurs to you as likely i should want to say  vanderbank gave a laugh that might have struck an auditor as a trifle uneasy when you speak of the circumstances you do a thing thatunless you mean the simple thrilling ones of this particular momentalways of course opens the door of the lurid for a man of any imagination to such a man youve only to give a nudge for his conscience to jump thats at any rate the case with mine its never quite on its feetso its now already on its back he stopped a littlehis smile was even strained is what you want to put before me something awful ive done  excuse me if i press this point mr longdon spoke kindly but if his friends anxiety grew his own thereby diminished can you think of nothing at all  do you mean that ive done  no but thatwhether youve done it or noti may have become aware of  there could have been no better proof than vanderbanks expression on this of his having mastered the secret of humouring without appearing to patronise i think you ought to give me a little more of a clue  mr longdon took off his glasses wellthe clues nanda brookenham  oh i see his friend had responded quickly but for a minute said nothing more and the great marble clock that gave the place the air of a club ticked louder in the stillness mr longdon waited with a benevolent want of mercy yet with a look in his face that spoke of what depended for himthough indeed very far withinon the upshot of his patience the hush between them for that matter became a conscious public measure of the young mans honesty he evidently at last felt it as such and there would have been for an observer of his handsome controlled face a study of some sharp things i judge that you ask me for such an utterance he finally said as very few persons at any time have the right to expect of a man think of the peopleand very decent onesto whom on so many a question one must only reply that its none of their business  i see you know what i mean said mr longdon  then you know also the distinguished exception i make of you there isnt another man with whom id talk of it  and even to me you dont but im none the less obliged to you mr longdon added  it isnt only the gravity his companion went on its the ridicule that inevitably attaches  the manner in which mr longdon indicated the empty room was in itself an interruption dont i sufficiently spare you  thank you thank you said vanderbank  besides its not for nothing  of course not the young man returned though with a look of noting the next moment a certain awkwardness in his concurrence but dont spare me now  i dont mean to mr longdon had his back to the table again on which he rested with each hand on the rim i dont mean to he repeated  his victim gave a laugh that betrayed at least the drop of a tension yet i dont quite see what you can do to me  its just what for some time past ive been trying to think  and at last youve discovered  wellit has finally glimmered out a little in this extraordinary place  vanderbank frankly wondered in consequence of anything particular that has happened  mr longdon had a pause for an old idiot who notices as much as i something particulars always happening if youre a man of imagination  oh vanderbank broke in i know how much more in that case youre one it only makes me regret he continued that ive not attended more since yesterday to what youve been about  ive been about nothing but what among you people im always about ive been seeing feeling thinking that makes no show of course im aware for any one but myself and its wholly my own affair except indeed he added so far as ive taken into my head to make on it all this special appeal there are things that have come home to me  oh i see i see vanderbank showed the friendliest alertness im to take it from you then with all the avidity of my vanity that i strike you as the person best able to understand what they are  mr longdon appeared to wonder an instant if his intelligence now had not almost too much of a glitter he kept the same position his back against the table and while vanderbank on the settee pressed upright against the wall they recognised in silence that they were trying each other youre much the best of them ive my ideas about you youve great gifts  well then were worthy of each other when greek meets greek and the young man laughed while a little with the air of bracing himself he folded his arms here we are  his companion looked at him a moment longer then turning away went slowly round the table on the further side of it he stopped again and after a minute with a nervous movement set a ball or two in motion its beautifulbut its terrible he finally murmured he hadnt his eyes on vanderbank who for a minute said nothing and he presently went on to see it and not to want to try to helpwell i cant do that vanderbank still neither speaking nor moving remained as if he might interrupt something of high importance and his friend passing along the opposite edge of the table continued to produce in the stillness without the cue the small click of the ivory how longif you dont mind my askinghave you known it  even for this at first vanderbank had no answernone but to rise from his place come down to the floor and standing there look at mr longdon across the table he was serious now but without being solemn how can one tell one can never be sure a man may fancy may wonder but about a girl a person so much younger than himself and so much more helpless he feels awhat shall i call it  a delicacy mr longdon suggested it may be that the name doesnt matter at all events hes embarrassed he wants not to be an ass on the one side and yet not some other kind of brute on the other  mr longdon listened with considerationwith a beautiful little air indeed of being in his all but finally benighted state earnestly open to information on such points from a magnificent young man he doesnt want you mean to be a coxcomband he doesnt want to be cruel  vanderbank visibly preoccupied produced a faint kind smile oh you know  i i should know less than any one mr longdon had turned away from the table on this and the eyes of his companion who after an instant had caught his meaning watched him move along the room and approach another part of the divan the consequence of the passage was that vanderbanks only rejoinder was presently to say i cant tell you how long ive imaginedhave asked myself shes so charming so interesting and i feel as if i had known her always ive thought of one thing and another to doand then on purpose havent thought at all that has mostly seemed to me best  then i gather said mr longdon that your interest in her  hasnt the same character as her interest in me vanderbank had taken him up responsively but after speaking looked about for a match and lighted a new cigarette im sure you understand he broke out what an extreme effort it is to me to talk of such things  yes yes but its just effort only it gives you no pleasure i mean the fact of her condition mr longdon explained  vanderbank had really to think a little however much it might give me i should probably not be a fellow to gush im a selfconscious stick of a briton  but even a stick of a briton mr longdon faltered and hovered ive gushed in short to you  about lady julia the young man frankly asked is gushing what you call what youve done  say then were sticks of britons youre not in any degree at all in love  there fell between them before vanderbank replied another pause of which he took advantage to move once more round the table mr longdon meanwhile had mounted to the high bench and sat there as if the judge were now in his proper place at last his companion spoke what youre coming to is of course that youve conceived a desire  thats itstrange as it may seem but believe me it has not been precipitate ive watched you both  oh i knew you were watching her said vanderbank  to such a tune that ive made up my mind i want her so to marry but on the odd little quaver of longing with which he brought it out the elder man fairly hung  well said vanderbank  well so that on the day she does shell come into the interest of a considerable sum of moneyalready very decently investedthat ive determined to settle on her  vanderbanks instant admiration flushed across the room how awfully jolly of youhow beautiful  oh theres a way to show practically your appreciation of it  but vanderbank for enthusiasm scarcely heard him i cant tell you how admirable i think you then eagerly does nanda know it he demanded  mr longdon after a wait spoke with comparative dryness my idea has been that for the present you alone shall  vanderbank took it in no other man  his companion looked still graver i need scarcely say that i depend on you to keep the fact to yourself  absolutely then and utterly but that wont prevent what i think of it nothing for a long time has given me such joy  shining and sincere he had held for a minute mr longdons eyes then you do care for her  immensely never i think so much as now that sounds of a grossness doesnt it the young man laughed but your announcement really lights up the mind  his friend for a moment almost glowed with his pleasure the sum ive fixed upon would be i may mention substantial and i should of course be prepared with a clear statementa very definite pledgeof my intentions  so much the better onlyvanderbank suddenly pulled himself upto get it she must marry  its not in my interest to allow you to suppose she neednt and its only because of my intensely wanting her marriage that ive spoken to you  and on the ground also with itvanderbank so far concurredof your quite taking for granted my only having to put myself forward  if his friend seemed to cast about it proved but to be for the fullest expression nothing in fact could have been more charged than the quiet way in which he presently said my dear boy i back you  vanderbank clearly was touched by it how extraordinarily kind you are to me mr longdons silence appeared to reply that he was willing to let it go for that and the young man next went on what it comes to thenas you put itis that its a way for me to add something handsome to my income  mr longdon sat for a little with his eyes attached to the green field of the billiardtable vivid in the spreading suspended lamplight i think i ought to tell you the figure i have in mind  another person present might have felt rather taxed either to determine the degree of provocation represented by vanderbanks considerate smile or to say if there was an appreciable interval before he rang out i think you know you oughtnt to do anything of the sort let that alone please the great thing is the interestthe great thing is the wish you express it represents a view of me an attitude toward me he pulled up dropping his arms and turning away before the complete image  theres nothing in those things that need overwhelm you it would be odd if you hadnt yourself about your value and your future a feeling quite as lively as any feeling of mine there is mine at all events i cant help it accept it then of the other feelinghow she moves mei wont speak  you sufficiently show it  mr longdon continued to watch the bright circle on the table lost in which a moment he let his friends answer pass i wont begin to you on nanda  dont said vanderbank but in the pause that ensued each in one way or another might have been thinking of her for himself  it was broken by mr longdons presently going on of course what it superficially has the air of is my offering to pay you for taking a certain step its open to you to be grand and proudto wrap yourself in your majesty and ask if i suppose you bribeable i havent spoken without having thought of that  yes said vanderbank all responsively but it isnt as if you proposed to me is it anything dreadful if one cares for a girl ones deucedly glad she has money the more of anything good she has the better i may assure you he added with the brightness of his friendly intelligence and quite as if to show his companion the way to be least concernedi may assure you that once i were disposed to act on your suggestion id make short work of any vulgar interpretation of my motive i should simply try to be as fine as yourself he smoked he moved about then came up in another place i dare say you know that dear old mitchy under whose blessed roof were plotting this midnight treason would marry her like a shot and without a penny  i think i know everythingi think ive thought of everything mr mitchett mr longdon added is impossible  vanderbank appeared for an instant to wonder wholly then through her attitude  altogether  again he hesitated youve asked her  ive asked her  once more vanderbank faltered and thats how you know  about your chance thats how i know  the young man consuming his cigarette with concentration took again several turns and your idea is to give one time  mr longdon had for a minute to turn his idea over how much time do you want  vanderbank gave a headshake that was both restrictive and indulgent i must live into it a little your offer has been before me only these few minutes and its too soon for me to commit myself to anything whatever except he added gallantly to my gratitude  mr longdon at this on the divan got up as vanderbank had previously done under the spring of emotion only unlike vanderbank he still stood there his hands in his pockets and his face a little paler directed straight there was disappointment in him even before he spoke youve no strong enough impulse  his friend met him with admirable candour wouldnt it seem that if i had i would by this time have taken the jump  without waiting you mean for anybodys money mr longdon cultivated for a little a doubt of course she has struck one astill nowtremendously young  vanderbank looked about once more for matches and occupied a time with relighting till nowyes but its not he pursued only because shes so young thatfor each of us and for dear old mitchy tooshes so interesting mr longdon had restlessly stepped down and vanderbanks eyes followed him till he stopped again i make out that in spite of what you said to begin with youre conscious of a certain pressure  in the matter of time oh yes i do want it done that nandas patron simply explained is why i myself put on the screw he spoke with the ring of impatience i want her got out  out  out of her mothers house  vanderbank laughed thoughmore immediatelyhe had coloured why her mothers house is just where i see her  precisely and if it only werent we might get on faster  vanderbank for all his kindness looked still more amused but if it only werent as you say i seem to understand you wouldnt have your particular vision of urgency  mr longdon through adjusted glasses took him in with a look that was sad as well as sharp then jerked the glasses off oh you do understand  ah said vanderbank im a mass of corruption  you may perfectly be but you shall not mr longdon returned with decision get off on any such plea if youre good enough for me youre good enough as you thoroughly know on whatever head for any one  thank you but vanderbank for all his happy appreciation thought again we ought at any rate to remember oughtnt we that we should have mrs brook against us  his companion faltered but an instant ah thats another thing i know but its also exactly why why i want nanda away  i see i see  the response had been prompt yet mr longdon seemed suddenly to show that he suspected the superficial unless its with mrs brook youre in love then on his friends taking the idea with a mere headshake of negation a repudiation that might even have astonished by its own lack of surprise or unless mrs brooks in love with you he amended  vanderbank had for this any decent gaiety ah that of course may perfectly be  but is it thats the question  he continued light if she had declared her passion shouldnt i rather compromise her  by letting me know mr longdon reflected im sure i cant sayits a sort of thing for which i havent a measure or a precedent in my time women didnt declare their passion im thinking of what the meaning is of mrs brookenhams wanting youas ive heard it calledherself  vanderbank still with his smile smoked a minute thats what youve heard it called  yes but you must excuse me from telling you by whom  he was amused at his friends discretion its unimaginable but it doesnt matter we all call everythinganything the meaning of it if you and i put it so iswell a modern shade  you must deal then yourself said mr longdon with your modern shades he spoke now as if the case simply awaited such dealing  but at this his young friend was more grave you could do nothingto bring i mean mrs brook round  mr longdon fairly started propose on your behalf for her daughter with your authoritytomorrow authorise me and i instantly act  vanderbanks colour again rosehis flush was complete how awfully you want it  mr longdon after a look at him turned away how awfully you dont  the young man continued to blush noyou must do me justice youve not made a mistake about mei see in your proposal i think all you can desire i should only you see it much more simplyand yet i cant just now explain if it were so simple i should say to you in a moment do speak to them for mei should leave the matter with delight in your hands but i require time let me remind you and you havent yet told me how much i may take  this appeal had brought them again face to face and mr longdons first reply to it was a look at his watch its one oclock  oh i requirevanderbank had recovered his pleasant humourmore than tonight  mr longdon went off to the smaller table that still offered to view two bedroom candles you must take of course the time you need i wont trouble youi wont hurry you im going to bed  vanderbank overtaking him lighted his candle for him after which handing it and smiling shall we have conduced to your rest  mr longdon looked at the other candle youre not coming to bed  to my rest we shall not have conduced i stay up a while longer  good mr longdon was pleased you wont forget then as we promised to put out the lights  if you trust me for the greater you can trust me for the less goodnight  vanderbank had offered his hand goodnight but mr longdon kept him a moment you dont care for my figure  not yetnot yet please vanderbank seemed really to fear it but on mr longdons releasing him with a little drop of disappointment they went together to the door of the room where they had another pause  shes to come down to mealonein september  vanderbank appeared to debate and conclude then may i come  his friend on this footing had to consider shall you know by that time  im afraid i cant promiseif you must regard my coming as a pledge  mr longdon thought on then raising his eyes i dont quite see why you wont suffer me to tell you  the detail of your intention i do then youve said quite enough if my visit must commit me vanderbank pursued im afraid i cant come  mr longdon who had passed into the corridor gave a dry sad little laugh come thenas the ladies sayas you are  on which rather softly closing the door the young man remained alone in the great emptily lighted billiardroom     book sixth mrs brook   presenting himself at buckingham crescent three days after the sunday spent at mertle vanderbank found lady fanny cashmore in the act of taking leave of mrs brook and found mrs brook herself in the state of muffled exaltation that was the mark of all her intercourseand most of all perhaps of her farewellswith lady fanny this splendid creature gave out as it were so little that vanderbank was freshly struck with all mrs brook could take in though nothing for that matter in buckingham crescent had been more fully formulated on behalf of the famous beauty than the imperturbable grandeur of her almost total absence of articulation every aspect of the phenomenon had been freely discussed there and endless ingenuity lavished on the question of how exactly it was that so much of what the world would in another case have called complete stupidity could be kept by a mere wonderful face from boring one to death it was mrs brook who in this relation as in many others had arrived at the supreme expression of the law had thrown off happily enough to whomever it might have concerned my dear thing it all comes back as everything always does simply to personal pluck its only a question no matter when or where of having enough lady fanny has the courage of all her silenceso much therefore that it sees her completely through and is what really makes her interesting not to be afraid of what may happen to you when youve no more to say for yourself than a steamer without a lightthat truly is the highest heroism and lady fannys greatness is that shes never afraid she takes the risk every time she goes outtakes as you may say her life in her hand she just turns that glorious mask upon you and practically says no i wont open my lipsto call it really openfor the forty minutes i shall stay but i calmly defy you all the same to kill me for it and we dont kill herwe delight in her though when either of us watches her in a circle of others its like seeing a very large blind person in the middle of oxford street one fairly looks about for the police vanderbank before his fellow visitor withdrew it had the benefit of the glorious mask and could scarce have failed to be amused at the manner in which mrs brook alone showed the stress of thought lady fanny in the other scale sat aloft and olympian so that though visibly much had happened between the two ladies it had all happened only to the hostess the sense in the air in short was just of lady fanny herself who came to an end like a banquet or a procession mrs brook left the room with her and on coming back was full of it shell go shell go  go where vanderbank appeared to have for the question less attention than usual  well to the place her companion will propose probablylike anna karenineto one of the smaller italian towns  anna karenine she isnt a bit like anna  of course she isnt so clever said mrs brook but that would spoil her so its all right  im glad its all right vanderbank laughed but i dare say we shall still have her with us a while  we shall do that i trust whatever happens shell come up againshell remain i feel one of those enormous things that fate seems somehow to have given me as the occupation of my odd moments i dont see mrs brook added what still keeps her on the edge which isnt an inch wide  vanderbank looked this time as if he only tried to wonder isnt it you  mrs brook mused more deeply sometimes i think so but i dont know  yes how can you of course know since she cant tell you  oh if i depended on her telling mrs brook shook out with this a sofacushion or two and sank into the corner she had arranged the august afternoon was hot and the london air heavy the room moreover though agreeably bedimmed gave out the staleness of the seasons end if you hadnt come today she went on youd have missed me till i dont know when for weve let the hovel againwretchedly but still weve let itand i go down on friday to see that it isnt too filthy edward whos furious at what ive taken for it had his idea that we should go there this year ourselves  and nowvanderbank took her upthat fond fancy has become simply the ghost of a dead thought a ghost that in company with a thousand predecessors haunts the house in the twilight and pops at you out of odd corners  oh edwards dead thoughts are indeed a cheerful company and worthy of the perpetual mental mourning we seem to go about in theyre worse than the relations were always losing without seeming to have any fewer and i expect every day to hear that the morning post regrets to have to announce in that line too some new bereavement the apparitions following the deaths of so many thoughts are particularly awful in the twilight so that at this season while the day drags and drags im glad to have any one with me who may keep them at a distance  vanderbank had not sat down slowly familiarly he turned about and wheres nanda  oh she doesnt helpshe attracts rather the worst of the bogies edward and nanda and harold and i seated together are fairly a case for thatwhat do you call itinvestigating society deprived of the sweet resource of the hovel mrs brook continued we shall each from about the tenth on forage somehow or other for ourselves mitchy perhaps she added will insist on taking us to baireuth  that will be the form you mean of his own forage  mrs brook just hesitated unless you should prefer to take it as the form of yours  vanderbank appeared for a moment obligingly enough to turn this over but with the effect of noting an objection oh im afraid i shall have to grind straight through the month and that by the time im free every ring at baireuth will certainly have been rung is it your idea to take nanda he asked  she reached out for another cushion if its impossible for you to manage what i suggest why should that question interest you  my dear womanand her visitor dropped into a chairdo you suppose my interest depends on such poverties as what i can manage you know well enough he went on in another tone why i care for nanda and enquire about her  she was perfectly ready i know it but only as a bad reason dont be too sure  for a moment they looked at each other dont be so sure you mean that the elation of it may go to my head are you really warning me against vanity  your reallys my dear van are a little formidable but it strikes me that before i tell you theres something ive a right to ask are you really what they call thinking of my daughter  your asking vanderbank returned exactly shows the state of your knowledge of the matter i dont quite see moreover why you speak as if i were paying an abrupt and unnatural attention what have i done the last three months but talk to you about her what have you done but talk to me about her from the moment you first spoke to memonstrously i remember you called itof the difference made in your social life by her finally established her perpetual her inexorable participation from that moment what have we both done but put our heads together over the question of keeping the place tidy as you called itor as i called it was itfor the young female mind  mrs brook faced serenely enough the directness of this challenge well what are you coming to i spoke of the change in my life of course i happen to be so constituted that my life has something to do with my mind and my mind something to do with my talk good talk you knowno one dear van should know betterwhat part for me that plays therefore when one has deliberately to make ones talk bad  bad vanderbank in his amusement fell back in his chair dear mrs brook youre too delightful  you know what i meanstupid flat fourthrate when one has to haul in sail to that degreeand for a perfectly outside reasontheres nothing strange in ones taking a friend sometimes into the confidence of ones irritation  ah vanderbank protested you do yourself injustice irritation hasnt been for you the only consequence of the affair  mrs brook gloomily thought no noive had my calmness the calmness of deep despair ive seemed to see everything go  oh how can you say that her visitor demanded when just what weve most been agreed upon so often is the practical impossibility of making any change hasnt it seemed as if we really cant overcome conversational habits so thoroughly formed  again mrs brook reflected as if our way of looking at things were too serious to be trifled with i dont knowi think its only you who have denied our sacrifices our compromises and concessions i myself have constantly felt smothered in them but there it is she impatiently went on what i dont admit is that youve given me ground to take for a proof of your intentionsto use the odious termyour association with me on behalf of the preposterous fiction as it after all is of nandas blankness of mind  vanderbanks head in his chair was thrown back his eyes ranged over the top of the room there never has been any mystery about my thinking herall in her own waythe nicest girl in london she is  his companion was silent a little she is by all means well she then added so far as i may have been alive to the fact of any ones thinking her so its not out of place i should mention to you the difference made in my appreciation of it by our delightful little stay at mertle my views for nanda said mrs brook have somehow gone up  vanderbank was prompt to show how he could understand it so that you wouldnt consider even mitchy now  but his friend took no notice of the question the way mr longdon distinguishes her is quite the sort of thing that gives a girl as harold says a leg up its awfully curious and has made me think he isnt anything whatever as london estimates go in himselfso that what is it pray that makes him when added on to her so double nandas value i somehow or other see through his being known to back her and through the pretty story of his loyalty to mamma and all the rest of it oh if one chose to work that ever so much more of a chance for her  vanderbanks eyes were on the ceiling it is curious isnt itthough i think hes rather more in himself even for the london estimate than you quite understand he appeared to give her time to take this up but as she said nothing he pursued i dare say that if even i now were to enter myself it would strike you as too late  her attention to this was but indirect its awfully vulgar to be talking about it but i cant help feeling that something possibly rather big will come of mr longdon  ah weve touched on that before said vanderbank and you know you did think something might come even for me  she continued however as if she scarce heard him to work out her own vision its very true that up to now  well up to now he asked as she faltered  she faltered still a little i do say the most hideous things but we have said worse havent we up to now i mean he hasnt given her anything unless indeed she mused she may have had something without telling me  vanderbank went much straighter what sort of thing have you in mind are you thinking of money  yes isnt it awful  that you should think of it  that i should talk this way her friend was apparently not prepared with an assent and she quickly enough pursued if he had given her any it would come out somehow in her expenditure she has tremendous liberty and is very secretive but still it would come out  he wouldnt give her any without letting you know nor would she without doing so vanderbank added take it  ah mrs brook quietly said she hates me enough for anything  thats only your romantic theory  once more she appeared not to hear him she gave the discussion another turn has he given you anything  her visitor smiled not so much as a cigarette ive always my pockets full of them and he never so he only takes mine oh mrs brook he continued with me toothough ive also tremendous libertyit would come out  i think youd let me know she returned  yes id let you know  silence upon this fell between them a little which she was the first to break she has gone with him this afternoonby solemn appointmentto the south kensington museum  there was something in mrs brooks dolorous drop that yet presented the news as a portent so great that he was moved again to mirth ah thats where she is then i confess she has scored he has never taken me to the south kensington museum  you were asking what were going to do she went on what i meant wasabout baireuththat the question for nandas simplified he has pressed her so to pay him a visit  vanderbanks assent was marked i see so that if you do go abroad shell be provided for by that engagement  and by lots of other invitations  these were such things as for the most part the young man could turn over do you mean youd let her go alone  to wherever shes asked said mrs brook why not dont talk like the duchess  vanderbank seemed for a moment to try not to couldnt mr longdon take her why not  his friend looked really struck with it that would be working him but to a beautiful end she meditated the only thing would be to get him also asked  ah but there you are dont you see fancy getting mr longdon anything or anywhere whatever dont you feel vanderbank threw out how the impossibility of exerting that sort of patronage for him immediately places him  mrs brook gave her companion one of those fitful glances of almost grateful appreciation with which their intercourse was even at its darkest hours frequently illumined as if he were the primate or the french ambassador yes youre rightone couldnt do it though its very odd and one doesnt quite see why it does place him but he becomes thereby exactly the very sort of person with whom it would be most of an advantage for her to go about what a pity mrs brook sighed he doesnt know more people  ah well we are in our way bringing that to pass only we mustnt rush it leave it to nanda herself vanderbank presently added on which his companion so manifestly left it that she touched after a moments silence on quite a different matter i dare say hed tell youwouldnt heif he were to give her any considerable sum  she had only obeyed his injunction but he stared at the length of her jump he might attempt to do so but i shouldnt at all like it he was moved immediately to dismiss this branch of the subject and apparently to help himself take up another do you mean she understands he has asked her down for a regular long stay  mrs brook barely hesitated she understands i think that what i expect of her is to make it as long as possible  vanderbank laughed outas it was even after ten years still possible to laughat the childlike innocence with which her voice could invest the hardest teachings of life then with something a trifle nervous in the whole sound and manner he sprang up from his chair what a blessing he is to us all  yes but think what we must be to him  an immense interest no doubt he took a few aimless steps and stooping over a basket of flowers inhaled it with violence almost buried his face i dare say we are interesting he had spoken rather vaguely but mrs brook knew exactly why we render him no end of a service we keep him in touch with old memories  vanderbank had reached one of the windows shaded from without by a great striped sunblind beneath which and between the flowerpots of the balcony he could see a stretch of hot relaxed street he looked a minute at these things i do so like your phrases  she had a pause that challenged his tone do you call mamma a phrase  he went off again quite with extravagance but quickly leaving the window pulled himself up i dare say we must put things for himhe does it cares or is able to do it so little himself  precisely he just quietly acts thats his nature dear thing we must let him act  vanderbank seemed to stifle again too vivid a sense of her particular emphasis yes yeswe must let him  though it wont prevent nanda i imagine his hostess pursued from finding the fun of a whole month at becclesor whatever she puts innot exactly fast and furious  vanderbank had the look of measuring what the girl might put in the place will be quiet of course but when a persons so fond of a person  as she is of him you mean  he hesitated yes then its all right  she is fond of him thank god said mrs brook  he was before her now with the air of a man who had suddenly determined on a great blind leap do you know what he has done he wants me so to marry her that he has proposed a definite basis  mrs brook got straight up proposed to her  no i dont think he has said a word to nandain fact im sure that very properly he doesnt mean to but he spoke to me on sunday night at mertlei had a big talk with him there alone very late in the smokingroom mrs brooks stare was serious and vanderbank now went on as if the sound of his voice helped him to meet it we had things out very much and his kindness was extraordinaryhes the most beautiful old boy that ever lived i dont know now that i come to think of it if im within my rights in telling youand of course i shall immediately let him know that i have told you but i feel i cant arrive at any respectable sort of attitude in the matter without taking you into my confidence which is really what i came here today to do though till this moment ive funked it  it was either as her friends chose to think it an advantage or a drawback of intercourse with mrs brook that her face being at any moment charged with the woe of the world it was unavoidable to remain rather in the dark as to the effect there of particular strokes something in vanderbanks present study of the signs accordingly showed he had had to learn to feel his way and had more or less mastered the trick that she had turned a little pale was really the one fresh mark funked it why in the world his own colour deepened at her accent which was a sufficient light on his having been stupid do you mean youve declined the arrangement  he only with a smile somewhat strained continued for a moment to look at her clearly however at last feeling and not much caring that he got in still deeper youre magnificent youre magnificent  her lovely gaze widened out comment donc wherewhy you have declined her she went on after which as he replied only with a slow headshake that seemed to say it was not for the moment all so simple as that she had one of the inspirations to which she was constitutionally subject do you imagine i want you myself  dear mrs brook youre so admirable he returned with gaiety that if by any chance you did upon my honour i dont see how i should be able not to say all right but he spoke too more responsibly i was shy of really bringing out to you what has happened to me for a reason that ive of course to look in the face whatever you want yourself for nanda you want mitchy  i see i see she did full justice to his explanation and what did you say about a basis the blessed man offers to settle  youre a real prodigy her visitor answered and your imagination takes its fences in a way that when im out with you quite puts mine to shame when he mentioned it to me i was quite surprised  and i mrs brook asked am not surprised a bit isnt it only she modestly suggested because ive taken him in more than you didnt you know he would she quavered  vanderbank thought or at least pretended to make me the condition how could i be sure of it  but the point of his question was lost for her in the growing light oh then the conditions you only  that at any rate is all i have to do with hes ready to settle if im ready to do the rest  to propose to her straight you mean she waited but as he said nothing she went on and youre not ready is that it  im taking my time  of course you know said mrs brook that shed jump at you  he turned away from her now but after some steps came back then you do admit it  she hesitated to you  he had a strange faint smile well as i dont speak of it  noonly to me what is it he settles mrs brook demanded  i cant tell you  you didnt ask  on the contrary i stopped him off  oh then mrs brook exclaimed thats what i call declining  the words appeared for an instant to strike her companion is it is it he almost musingly repeated but he shook himself the next moment free of his wonder was more what would have been called in buckingham crescent on the spot isnt there rather something in my having thus thought it my duty to warn you that im definitely his candidate  mrs brook turned impatiently away youve certainlywith your talk about warningthe happiest expressions she put her face into the flowers as he had done just before then as she raised it what kind of a monster are you trying to make me out  my dear ladyvanderbank was prompti really dont think i say anything but whats fair isnt it just my loyalty to you in fact that has in this case positively strained my discretion  she shook her head in mere mild despair loyalty again is exquisite the tact of men has a charm quite its own and youre rather good she continued as men go  his laugh was now a little awkward as if she had already succeeded in making him uncomfortable i always become aware with you sooner or later that they dont go at allin your sense but how am i after all so far out if you have put your money on another man  you keep coming back to that she wearily sighed  he thought a little no then youve only to tell me not to and ill never speak of it again  youll be in an odd position for speaking of it if you do really go in you deny that youve declined said mrs brook which means then that youve allowed our friend to hope  vanderbank met it bravely yes i think he hopes  and communicates his hope to my child  this arrested the young man but only for a moment ive the most perfect faith in his wisdom with her i trust his particular delicacy he cares more for her he presently added even than we do  mrs brook gazed away at the infinite of space we my dear van she at last returned is one of your own real wonderful touches but theres something in what you say i have as between ourselvesbetween me and himbeen backing mitchy that is ive been saying to him wait wait dont at any rate do anything else only its just from the depth of my thought for my daughters happiness that ive clung to this resource he would so absolutely so unreservedly do anything for her she had reached now with her extraordinary selfcontrol the pitch of quiet bland demonstration i want the poor thing que diable to have another string to her bow and another loaf for her desolate old age on the shelf when everything else is gone mitchy will still be there then it will be at least her own fault mrs brook continued what can relieve me of the primary duty of taking precautions she wound up when i know as well as that i stand here and look at you  yes what he asked as she just paused  why that so far as they count on you they count my dear van on a blank holding him a minute as with the soft low voice of his fate she sadly but firmly shook her head you wont do it  oh he almost too loudly protested  you wont do it she went on  i sayhe made a joke of it  you wont do it she repeated  it was as if he couldnt at last but show himself really struck yet what he exclaimed on was what might in truth most have impressed him you are magnificent really  mr mitchett the butler appearing at the door almost familiarly dropped after which vanderbank turned straight to the person announced  mr mitchett was there and anticipating mrs brook in receiving him her companion passed it straighten shes magnificent  mitchy was already all interest rather but whats her last  it had been though so great so subtle as they said in buckingham crescent that vanderbank scarce knew how to put it well shes so thoroughly superior  oh to whom do you say it mitchy cried as he greeted her    ii  the subject of this eulogy had meanwhile returned to her sofa where she received the homage of her new visitor its not i who am magnificent a bitits dear mr longdon ive just had from van the most wonderful piece of news about himhis announcement of his wish to make it worth somebodys while to marry my child  make itmitchy stared but isnt it  my dear friend you must ask van of course youve always thought so but i must tell you all the same mrs brook went on that im delighted  mitchy had seated himself but vanderbank remained erect and became perhaps even slightly stiff he was not angryno member of the inner circle at buckingham crescent was ever angrybut he looked grave and rather troubled even if it is decidedly finehe addressed his hostess straighti cant make out quite why youre doing thisi mean immediately making it known  ah but what do we keep from mitchy mrs brook asked  what can you keep it comes to the same thing mitchy said besides here we are together share and share alikeone beautiful intelligence mr longdons somebody is of course van dont try to treat me as an outsider  vanderbank looked a little foolishly though it was but the shade of a shade from one of them to the other i think ive been rather an ass  what then by the terms of our friendshipjust as mitchy sayscan he and i have a better right to know and to feel with you about youll want mitchy wont you mrs brook went on to hear all about that  oh i only mean vanderbank explained in having just now blurted my tale out to you however i of course do know he pursued to mitchy that whatevers really between us will remain between us let me then tell you myself exactly whats the matter the length of his pause after these words showed at last that he had stopped short on which his companions as they waited exchanged a sympathetic look they waited another minute and then he dropped into a chair where leaning forward his elbows on the arms and his gaze attached to the carpet he drew out the silence finally he looked at mrs brook you make it clear  the appeal called up for some reason her most infantine manner i dont think i can dear vanreally clear you know however yourself she continued to mitchy enough by this time about mr longdon and mamma  oh rather mitchy laughed  and about mamma and nanda  oh perfectly the way nanda reminds him and the beautiful loyalty that has made him take such a fancy to her but ive already embraced the factsyou neednt dot any is with another glance at his fellow visitor mitchy jumped up and stood there florid he has offered you money to marry her he said this to vanderbank as if it were the most natural thing in the world  oh no mrs brook interposed with promptitude he has simply let him know before any one else that the moneys there for nanda and that therefore  first come first served mitchy had already taken her up i see i see then to make her sure of the money he put to vanderbank you must marry her  if it depends upon that shell never get it mrs brook returned dear van will think conscientiously a lot about it but he wont do it  wont you van really mitchy asked from the hearthrug  never never we shall be very kind to him we shall help him hope and pray for him but we shall be at the end said mrs brook just where we are now dear van will have done his best and we shall have done ours mr longdon will have done hispoor nanda even will have done hers but it will all have been in vain however mrs brook continued to expound shell probably have the money mr longdon will surely consider that shell want it if she doesnt marry still more than if she does so we shall be so much at least she wound upi mean edward and i and the child will beto the good  mitchy for an equal certainty required but an instants thought oh there can be no doubt about that the things about which your mind may now be at ease he cheerfully exclaimed  it does make a great difference mrs brook comfortably sighed then in a different tone what dear van will find at the end that he cant face will be dont you see just this fact of appearing to have accepted a bribe he wont want on the one handout of kindness for nandato have the money suppressed and yet he wont want to have the pecuniary question mixed up with the matter to look in short as if he had had to be paid hes like you you knowhes proud and it will be there we shall break down  mitchy had been watching his friend who a few minutes before perceptibly embarrassed had quite recovered himself and at his ease though still perhaps with a smile a trifle strained leaned back and let his eyes play everywhere but over the faces of the others vanderbank evidently wished now to show a goodhumoured detachment  see here mitchy said to him i remember your once submitting to me a case of some delicacy  oh hell submit it to youhell submit it even to me mrs brook broke in hell be charming touching confidingabove all hell be awfully interesting about it but hell make up his mind in his own way and his own way wont be to accommodate mr longdon  mitchy continued to study their companion in the light of these remarks then turned upon his hostess his sociable glare splendid isnt it the old boys infatuation with him  mrs brook just delayed from the point of view of the immense interest itjust now for instancemakes for you and me oh yes its one of our best things yet it places him a little with lady fannyhe will he wont he wont he will only to be perfect it lacks as i say the element of real suspense  mitchy frankly wondered it does you think not for menot wholly he turned again quite pleadingly to their friend i hope it doesnt for yourself totally either  vanderbank cultivating his detachment made at first no more reply than if he had not heard and the others meanwhile showed faces that testified perhaps less than their respective speeches had done to the absence of anxiety the only token he immediately gave was to get up and approach mitchy before whom he stood a minute laughing kindly enough though not altogether gaily as if then for a better proof of gaiety he presently seized him by the shoulders and still without speaking pushed him backward into the chair he himself had just quitted mrs brooks eyes from the sofa while this went on attached themselves to her visitors it took vanderbank as he moved about and his companions waited a minute longer to produce what he had in mind what is splendid as we call it is this extraordinary freedom and good humour of our intercourse and the fact that we do careso independently of our personal interests with so little selfishness or other vulgarityto get at the idea of things the beautiful specimen mrs brook had just given me of that he continued to mitchy was what made me break out to you about her when you came in he spoke to one friend but he looked at the other whats really superior in her is that though i suddenly show her an interference with a favourite plan her personal resentments nothingall she wants is to see what may really happen to take in the truth of the case and make the best of that she offers me the truth as she sees it about myself and with no nasty elation if it does chance to be the truth that suits her best it was a charming charming stroke  mitchys appreciation was no bar to his amusement youre wonderfully right about us but still it was a stroke  if mrs brook was less diverted she followed perhaps more closely if you do me so much justice then why did you put to me such a cold cruel questioni mean when you so oddly challenged me on my handing on your news to mitchy if the principal beauty of our effort to live together isand quite according to your own eloquencein our sincerity i simply obeyed the impulse to do the sincere thing if were not sincere were nothing  nothingit was mitchy who first responded but we are sincere  yes we are sincere vanderbank presently said its a great chance for us not to fall below ourselves no doubt therefore we shall continue to soar and sing we pay for it people who dont like us say in our selfconsciousness  but people who dont like us mitchy broke in dont matter besides how can we be properly conscious of each other  thats itvanderbank completed his idea without my finding myself for instance in you and mrs brook we see ourselves reflectedwere conscious of the charming whole i thank you he pursued after an instant to mrs brooki thank you for your sincerity  it was a business sometimes really to hold her eyes but they had it must be said for her their steady moments she exchanged with vanderbank a somewhat remarkable look then with an art of her own broke short off without appearing to drop him the thing is dont you thinkshe appealed to mitchyfor us not to be so awfully clever as to make it believed that we can never be simple we mustnt see too tremendous thingseven in each other she quite lost patience with the danger she glanced at we can be simple  we can by god mitchy laughed  well we are nowand its a great comfort to have it settled said vanderbank  then you see mrs brook returned what a mistake youd make to see abysses of subtlety in my having been merely natural  we can be natural mitchy declared  we can by god vanderbank laughed  mrs brook had turned to mitchy i just wanted you to know so i spoke its not more complicated than that as for why i wanted you to know  what better reason could there be mitchy interrupted than your being filled to the fingertips with the sense of how i would want it myself and of the misery the absolute pathos of my being left out fancy my dear chaphe had only to put it to vanmy not knowing  vanderbank evidently couldnt fancy it but he said quietly enough i should have told you myself  well whats the difference  oh there is a difference mrs brook loyally said then she opened an inch or two for vanderbank the door of her dim radiance only i should have thought it a difference for the better of course she added it remains absolutely with us three alone and dont you already feel from it the fresh charmwith it here between usof our being together  it was as if each of the men had waited for the other to assent better than he himself could and mitchy then as vanderbank failed had gracefully to cover him changed the subject but isnt nanda the person most interested to know  vanderbank gave on this a strange sound of hilarity ah that would finish it off  it produced for a few seconds something like a chill a chill that had for consequence a momentary pause which in its turn added weight to the words next uttered its not i who shall tell her mrs brook said gently and gravely thereyou may be sure if you want a promise its a promise so that if mr longdons silent she went on and you are mitchy and i am how in the world shall she have a suspicion  you mean of course except by vans deciding to mention it himself  van might have been from the way they looked at him some beautiful unconscious object but mrs brook was quite ready to answer oh poor man hell never breathe  i see so there we are  to this discussion the subject of it had for the time nothing to contribute even when mitchy rising with the words he had last uttered from the chair in which he had been placed took sociably as well on the hearthrug a position before their hostess this move ministered apparently to vanderbanks mere silence for it was still without speaking that after a little he turned away from his friend and dropped once more into the same seat ive shown you already you of course remember vanderbank presently said to him that im perfectly aware of how much better mrs brook would like you for the position  he thinks i want him myself mrs brook blandly explained  she was indeed as they always thought her wonderful but she was perhaps not even now so much so as mitchy found himself able to be but how would you lose old vaneven at the worst he earnestly asked of her  she just hesitated what do you mean by the worst  then even at the best mitchy smiled in the event of his falsifying your prediction which by the way has the danger hasnt iti mean for your intellectual creditof making him as we all used to be called by our nursemaids contrairy  oh ive thought of that mrs brook returned but he wont do on the whole even for the sweetness of spiting me what he wont want to do i havent said i should lose him she went on thats only the view he himself takesor to do him perfect justice the idea he candidly imputes to me though without i imaginefor i dont go so far as thatattributing to me anything so unutterably bete as a feeling of jealousy  you wouldnt dream of my supposing anything inept of you vanderbank said on this if you understood to the full how i keep on admiring you only what stupefies me a little he continued is the extraordinary critical freedomor we may call it if we like the high intellectual detachmentwith which we discuss a question touching you dear mrs brook so nearly and engaging so your private and most sacred sentiments what are we playing with after all but the idea of nandas happiness  oh im not playing mrs brook declared with a little rattle of emotion  shes not playingmr mitchett gravely confirmed it dont you feel in the very air the vibration of the passion that shes simply too charming to shake at the window as the housemaid shakes the tablecloth or the jingo the flag then he took up what vanderbank had previously said of course my dear man im aware as you just now put it of everything and im not indiscreet am i mrs brook in admitting for you as well as for myself that there was an impossibility you and i used sometimes to turn over together onlylord bless us allit isnt as if i hadnt long ago seen that theres nothing at all for me  ah wait wait mrs brook put in she has a theoryvanderbank from his chair lighted it up for mitchy who hovered before themthat your chance will come later on after ive given my measure  oh but thats exactly mitchy was quick to respond what youll never do you wont give your measure the least little bit youll walk in magnificent mystery later on not a bit less than you do today youll continue to have the benefit of everything that our imagination perpetually engaged often baffled and never fatigued will continue to bedeck you with nanda in the same way to the end of all her time will simply remain exquisite or genuine or generouswhatever we choose to call it it may make a difference to us who are comparatively vulgar but what difference will it make to her whether you do or you dont decide for her you cant belong to her more for herself than you do alreadyand thats precisely so much that theres no room for any one else where therefore without that room do i come in  nowhere i see vanderbank seemed obligingly to muse  mrs brook had followed mitchy with marked admiration but she gave on this a glance at van that was like the toss of a blossom from the same branch oh then shall i just go on with you both that will be joy she had however the next thing a sudden drop which shaded the picture youre so divine mitchy that how can you not in the longrun break any woman down  it was not as if mitchy was struckit was only that he was courteous what do you call the longrun taking about till im eighty  ah your genius is of a kind to which middle life will be particularly favourable youll reap then somehow one feels everything youve sown  mitchy still accepted the prophecy only to control it do you call eighty middle life why my moral beauty my dear womanif thats what you mean by my geniusis precisely my curse what on earthis left for a man just rotten with goodness it renders necessary the kind of liking that renders unnecessary anything else  now that is cheap paradox vanderbank patiently sighed youre down for a fine  it was with less of the patience perhaps that mrs brook took this up yes on that we are stiff five pounds please  mitchy drew out his pocketbook even though he explained what i mean is that i dont give out the great thing with which he produced a crisp banknote  dont you asked vanderbank who having taken it from him to hand to mrs brook held it a moment delicately to accentuate the doubt  the great things the sacred terror its you who give that out  ohand vanderbank laid the money on the small stand at mrs brooks elbow  aint i right mrs brookdoesnt he tremendously and isnt that more than anything else what does it  the two again as if they understood each other gazed in a unity of interest at their companion who sustained it with an air clearly intended as the happy mean between embarrassment and triumph then mrs brook showed she liked the phrase the sacred terror yes one feels it it is that  the finest case of it mitchy pursued that ive ever met so my morals sufficiently pointed  oh i dont think it can be said to be that vanderbank returned till youve put the whole thing into a box by doing for nanda what she does most want you to do  mitchy caught on without a shade of wonder oh by proposing to the duchess for little aggie he took but an instant to turn it over well i would proposeto please nanda only ive never yet quite made out the reason of her wish  the reason is largely his friend answered that being very fond of aggie and in fact extremely admiring her she wants to do something good for her and to keep her from anything bad dont you knowits too charmingshe regularly believes in her mitchy with all his recognition vibrated to the touch isnt it too charming  well then vanderbank went on she secures for her friend a phoenix like you and secures for you a phoenix like her friend its hard to say for which of you she desires most to do the handsome thing she loves you both in shorthe followed it upthough perhaps when one thinks of it the price she puts on you mitchy in the arrangement is a little the higher awfully fine at any rateand yet awfully odd tooher feeling for aggies type which is divided by such abysses from her own  ah laughed mitchy but think then of her feeling for mine  vanderbank still more at his ease now and with his head back had his eyes aloft and far oh there are things in nanda the others exchanged a glance at this while their companion added little aggies really the sort of creature she would have liked to be able to be  well mitchy said i should have adored her even if she had been able  mrs brook had for some minutes played no audible part but the acute observer we are constantly taking for granted would perhaps have detected in her as one of the effects of the special complexion today of vanderbanks presence a certain smothered irritation she couldnt possibly have been able she now interposed with so looseor rather to express it more properly with so perversea mother  and yet my dear lady mitchy promptly qualified how if in little aggies case the duchess hasnt prevented  mrs brook was full of wisdom well its a different thing im not as a motheram i vanbad enough thats whats the matter with me aggie dont you see is the duchesss morality her virtue which by having it that way outside of you as one may say you can make a much better thing of the child has been for jane i admit a capital little subject but jane has kept her on hand and finished her like some wonderful piece of stitching oh as work its of a soigne there it isto show a woman like me has to be herself poor thing her virtue and her morality what will you have its our lumbering english plan  so that her daughter mitchy sympathised can only by the arrangement hope to become at the best her immorality and her vice  but mrs brook without an answer for the question appeared suddenly to have plunged into a sea of thought the only way for nanda to have been really nice  would have been for you to be like jane  mitchy and his hostess seemed for a minute on this to gaze together at the tragic truth then she shook her head we see our mistakes too late she repeated the movement but as if to let it all go and vanderbank meanwhile pulling out his watch had got up with a laugh that showed some inattention and made to mitchy a remark about their walking away together mitchy engaged for the instant with mrs brook had assented only with a nod but the attitude of the two men had become that of departure their friend looked at them as if she would like to keep one of them and for a purpose connected somehow with the other but was oddly almost ludicrously embarrassed to choose what was in her face indeed during this short passage might prove to have been should we penetrate the flicker of a sense that in spite of all intimacy and amiability they could at bottom and as things commonly turned out only be united against her yet she made at the end a sort of choice in going on to mitchy he hasnt at all told you the real reason of nandas idea that you should go in for aggie  oh i draw the line there said vanderbank besides he understands that too  mitchy on the spot did himself and every one justice why it just disposes of me doesnt it  it made vanderbank restless now and turning about the room stop with a smile at mrs brook we understand too well  not if he doesnt understand she replied after a moment while she turned to mitchy that his real combination can in the nature of the case only be  oh yesmitchy took her straight upwith the young thing who is as you say positively and helplessly modern and the pious fraud of whose classic identity with a sheet of white paper has beenah tacitly of course but none the less practicallydropped youve so often reminded me i do understand if i were to go in for aggie it would only be to oblige the modern girl the product of our hard london facts and of her inevitable consciousness of them just as they areshe wonderful being is i fully recognise my real affair and im not ashamed to say that when i like the individual im not afraid of the type she knows too muchi dont say but she doesnt know after all a millionth part of what i do  im not sure mrs brook earnestly exclaimed  he had rung out and he kept it up with a limpidity unusual and product for product when you come to that im a queerer one myself than any other the traditions i smash mitchy laughed  mrs brook had got up and vanderbank had gone again to the window thats exactly why she returned youre a pair of monsters and your monstrosity fits she does know too much she added  well said mitchy with resolution its all my fault  not allunless mrs brook returned thats only a sweet way of saying that its mostly mine  oh yours tooimmensely in fact every ones even edwards i dare say and certainly unmistakably harolds ah and vans ownrather mitchy continued for all he turns his back and will have nothing to say to it  it was on the back vanderbank turned that mrs brooks eyes now rested thats precisely why he shouldnt be afraid of her  he faced straight about oh i dont deny my part  he shone at them brightly enough and mrs brook thoughtful wistful candid took in for a moment the radiance and yet to think that after all it has been mere talk  something in her tone again made her hearers laugh out so it was still with the air of good humour that vanderbank answered mere mere mere but perhaps its exactly the mere that has made us range so wide  mrs brooks intelligence abounded you mean that we havent had the excuse of passion  her companions once more gave way to mirth but there you are vanderbank said after an instant less sociably with it too he held out his hand  you are afraid she answered as she gave him her own on which as he made no rejoinder she held him before her do you mean you really dont know if she gets it  the money if he doesnt go inmitchy broke almost with an air of responsibility into vanderbanks silence ah but as we said surely  it was mitchys eyes that vanderbank met yes i should suppose she gets it  perhaps then as a compensation shell even get more  if i dont go in oh said vanderbank and he changed colour  he was by this time off but mrs brook kept mitchy a moment nowby that suggestionhe has something to show he wont go in    iii  her visitors had been gone half an hour but she was still in the drawingroom when nanda came back the girl found her on the sofa in a posture that might have represented restful oblivion but that after a glance our young lady appeared to interpret as mere intensity of thought it was a condition from which at all events mrs brook was quickly roused by her daughters presence she opened her eyes and put down her feet so that the two were confronted as closely as persons may be when it is only one of them who looks at the other nanda gazing vaguely about and not seeking a seat slowly drew off her gloves while her mothers sad eyes considered her from top to toe teas gone mrs brook then said as if there were something in the loss peculiarly irretrievable but i suppose she added he gave you all you want  oh dear yes thank youive had lots  nanda hovered there slim and charming feathered and ribboned dressed in thin fresh fabrics and faint colours with something in the effect of it all to which the sweeter deeper melancholy in her mothers eyes seemed happily to testify just turn round dear the girl immediately obeyed and mrs brook once more took everything in the backs bestonly she didnt do what she said she would how they do lie she gently quavered  yes but we lie so to them nanda had swung round again producing evidently on her mothers part by the admirable hang of her light skirts a still deeper peace do you mean the middle foldi knew she wouldnt i dont want my back to be besti dont walk backward  yes mrs brook resignedly mused you dress for yourself  oh how can you say that the girl asked when i never stick in a pin but what i think of you  well mrs brook moralised one must always i consider think as a sort of point de repere of some one good person only its best if its a person ones afraid of you do very well but im not enough what one really requires is a kind of salutary terror i never stick in a pin without thinking of your cousin jane what is it that some one quotes somewhere about some ones having said that our antagonist is our helperhe prevents our being superficial the extent to which with my poor clothes the duchess prevents me it was a measure mrs brook could give only by the general soft wail of her submission to fate  yes the duchess isnt a woman is she shes a standard  the speech had for nandas companion however no effect of pleasantry or irony and it was a mark of the special intercourse of these good friends that though they showed each other in manner and tone such sustained consideration as might almost have given it the stamp of diplomacy there was yet in it also something of that economy of expression which is the result of a common experience the recurrence of opportunity to observe them together would have taught a spectator thaton mrs brooks side doubtless more particularlytheir relation was governed by two or three remarkably established and as might have been said refined laws the spirit of which was to guard against the vulgarity so often coming to the surface between parent and child that they were as good friends as if nanda had not been her daughter was a truth that no passage between them might fail in one way or another to illustrate nanda had gathered up for that matter early in life a flower of maternal wisdom people talk about conscience but it seems to me one must just bring it up to a certain point and leave it there you can let your conscience alone if youre nice to the second housemaid mrs brook was as nice to nanda as she was to sarah curdwhich involved as may easily be imagined the happiest conditions for sarah well she resumed reverting to the duchess on a final appraisement of the girls air i really think i do well by you and that jane wouldnt have anything to say today you look awfully like mamma she then threw off as if for the first time of mentioning it  oh cousin jane doesnt care for that nanda returned what i dont look like is aggie for all i try  ah you shouldnt tryyou can do nothing with it one must be what one is  mrs brook was almost sententious but nanda with civility let it pass no one in london touches her shes quite by herself when one sees her one feels her to be the real thing  mrs brook without harshness wondered what do you mean by the real thing  even nanda however had to think a moment  well the real young one thats what lord petherton calls her she mildly jokedthe young un  her mothers echo was not for the joke but for something else i know what you mean whats the use of being good  oh i didnt mean that said nanda besides isnt aggie of a goodness  i wasnt talking of her i was asking myself whats the use of my being  well you cant help it any more than the duchess can help  ah but she could if she would mrs brook broke in with a sharper ring than she had yet given we cant help being good perhaps if that burdens laid on usbut there are lengths in other directions were not absolutely obliged to go and what i think of when i stick in the pins she went on is that jane seems to me really never to have had to pay she appeared for a minute to brood on this till she could no longer bear it after which she jerked out why she has never had to pay for anything  nanda had by this time seated herself taking her place under the interest of their talk on her mothers sofa where except for the removal of her long soft gloves which one of her hands again and again drew caressingly through the other she remained very much as if she were some friendly yet circumspect young visitor to whom mrs brook had on some occasion dropped do come but there was something perhaps more expressly conciliatory in the way she had kept everything on as if in particular serenity and to confirm kindly mrs brooks sense of what had been done for her she had neither taken off her great feathered hat nor laid down her parasol of pale green silk the match of hat and ribbons and which had an expensive precious knob our spectator would possibly have found too much earnestness in her face to be sure if there was also candour and do you mean that you have had to pay  oh yesall the while with this mrs brook was a little short and also as she added as if to banish a slight awkwardness but dont let it discourage you  nanda seemed an instant to weigh the advice and the whole thing would have been striking as another touch in the picture of the odd want on the part of each of any sense of levity in the other whatever escape face to face mother or daughter might ever seek would never be the humorous onea circumstance notwithstanding that would not in every case have failed to make their interviews droll for a third person it would always indeed for such a person have produced an impression of tension beneath the surface i could have done much better at the start and have lost less time the girl at last said if i hadnt had the drawback of not really remembering granny  oh well i remember her mrs brook moaned with an accent that evidently struck her the next moment as so much out of place that she slightly deflected she took nandas parasol and held it as ifa more delicate thing much than any one of hersshe simply liked to have it her clothesat your age at leastmust have been hideous was it at the place he took you to that he gave you tea she then went on  yes at the museum we had an orgy in the refreshmentroom but he took me afterwards to tishys where we had another  he went in with you mrs brook had suddenly flashed into eagerness  oh yesi made him  he didnt want to  on the contraryvery much but he doesnt do everything he wants said nanda  mrs brook seemed to wonder you mean youve also to want it  oh nothat isnt enough what i suppose i mean nanda continued is that he doesnt do anything he doesnt want but he does quite enough she added  and who then was at tishys  oh poor old tish herself naturally and carrie donner  and no one else  the girl just waited yes mr cashmore came in  her mother gave a groan of impatience ah again  nanda thought an instant how do you mean again he just lives there as much as he ever did and tishy cant prevent him  i was thinking of mr longdonof their meeting when he met him here that time he liked it so little did he like it any more today mrs brook quavered  oh no he hated it  but hadnt heif he should go inknown he would  yes perfectly but he wanted to see  to see mrs brook just threw out  well where i go so much and he knew i wished it  i dont quite see why mrs brook mildly observed and then as her daughter said nothing to help her at any rate he did loathe it  nanda for a reply simply after an instant put a question well how can he understand  you mean like me why you do go there so much how can he indeed  i dont mean that the girl returnedits just that he understands perfectly because he saw them all in such an extraordinary waywell what can i ever call itclutch me and cling to me  mrs brook with full gravity considered this picture and was mr cashmore today so ridiculous  ah hes not ridiculous mammahes very unhappy he thinks now lady fanny probably wont go but he feels that may be after all only the worse for him  she will go mrs brook answered with one of her roundabout approaches to decision he is too great an idiot she was here an hour ago and if ever a woman was packed  well nanda objected but doesnt she spend her time in packing and unpacking  this enquiry however scarce pulled up her mother nothough she has no doubt hitherto wasted plenty of labour she has now a dozen boxesi could see them there in her wonderful eyesjust waiting to be called for so if youre counting on her not going my dear mrs brook gave a headshake that was the warning of wisdom  oh i dont care what she does nanda replied what i meant just now was that mr longdon couldnt understand why with so much to make them so they couldnt be decently happy  and did he wish you to explain  i tried to but i didnt make it any better he doesnt like them he doesnt even care for tish  he told you soright out  oh nanda said of course i asked him i didnt press him because i never do  you never do mrs brook broke in as with the glimpse of a new light  the girl showed an indulgence for this interest that was for a moment almost elderly i enjoy awfully with him seeing just how to take him  her tone and her face evidently put forth for her companion at this juncture something freshly even quite supremely suggestive and yet the effect of them on mrs brooks part was only a question so offhand that it might already often have been asked the mothers eyes to ask it we may none the less add attached themselves closely to the daughters and her face just glowed you like him so very awfully  it was as if the next instant nanda felt herself on her guard yet she spoke with a certain surrender well its rather intoxicating to be ones self she had only a drop over the choice of her term  so tremendously made up to you meaneven by a little fussy ancient man but doesnt he my dear mrs brook continued with encouragement make up to you  a supposititious spectator would certainly on this have imagined in the girls face the delicate dawn of a sense that her mother had suddenly become vulgar together with a general consciousness that the way to meet vulgarity was always to be frank and simple and above all to ignore he makes one enjoy being liked so muchliked better i do think than ive ever been liked by any one  if mrs brook hesitated it was however clearly not because she had noticed not better surely than by dear mitchy or even if you come to that by tishy herself  nandas simplicity maintained itself oh mr longdons different from tishy  her mother again hesitated you mean of course he knows more  the girl considered it he doesnt know more but he knows other things and hes pleasanter than mitchy  you mean because he doesnt want to marry you  it was as if she had not heard that nanda continued well hes more beautiful  ooh cried mrs brook with a drawnout extravagance of comment that amounted to an impugnment of her taste even by herself  it contributed to nandas quietness hes one of the most beautiful people in the world  her companion at this with a quick wonder fixed her does he my dear want to marry you  yesto all sorts of ridiculous people  but i meanwould you take him  nanda rising met the question with a short ironic yes that showed her first impatience its so charming being liked without being approved  but mrs brook only wanted to know he doesnt approve  no but it makes no difference its all exactly rightit doesnt matter  mrs brook seemed to wonder however exactly how these things could be he doesnt want you to give up anything she looked as if swiftly thinking what nanda might give up  oh yes everything  it was as if for an instant she found her daughter inscrutable then she had a strange smile me  the girl was perfectly prompt everything but he wouldnt like me nearly so much if i really did  her mother had a further pause does he want to adopt you then more quickly and sadly though also a little as if lacking nerve to push the research we couldnt give you up nanda  thank you so much mamma but we shant be very much tried nanda said because what it comes to seems to be that im really what you may call adopting him i mean im little by little changing himgradually showing him that as i couldnt possibly have been different and as also of course one cant keep giving up the only way is for him not to mind and to take me just as i am that dont you see is what he would never have expected to do  mrs brook recognised in a manner the explanation but still had her wistfulness butato take you as you are where  well to the south kensington museum  oh said mrs brook then however in a more exemplary tone do you enjoy so very much your long hours with him  nanda appeared for an instant to think how to express it well were great friends  and always talking about granny  oh noreally almost never now  he doesnt think so awfully much of her there was an oddity of eagerness in the questiona hope a kind of dash for something that might have been in nandas interest  the girl met these things only with obliging gravity i think hes losing any sense of my likeness hes too used to itor too many things that are too different now cover it up  well said mrs brook as she took this in i think its awfully clever of you to get only the good of him and have none of the worry  nanda wondered the worry  you leave that all to me her mother went on but quite forgivingly i hope at any rate that the good for you will be real  real the girl remaining vague again echoed  mrs brook showed for this not perhaps an irritation but a flicker of austerity you must remember weve a great many things to think about there are things we must take for granted in each otherwe must all help in our way to pull the coach thats what i mean by worry and if you dont have any so much the better for you for me its in the days work your father and i have most to think about always at this time as you perfectly knowwhen we have to turn things round and manage somehow or other to get out of town have to provide and pinch to meet all the necessities with money money money at every turn running away like water the children this year seem to fit into nothing into nowhere and harolds more dreadful than he has ever been doing nothing at all for himself and requiring everything to be done for him he talks about his american girl with millions whos so awfully taken with him but i cant find out anything about her the only one just now that people seem to have heard of is the one booby mangers engaged to the mangers literally snap up everything mrs brook quite wailingly now continued the jew man so gigantically richwho is he baron schack or schmackwho has just taken cumberland house and who has the awful stammeror what is it no roof to his mouthis to give that horrid little algie to do his conversation for him four hundred a year which harold pretended to me that of all the rush of young mendozenshe was most in the running for your fathers settled gloom is terrible and i bear all the brunt of it we get literally nothing this year for the hovel yet have to spend on it heaven knows what and everybody for the next three months in scotland and everywhere has asked us for the wrong time and nobody for the right so that i assure you i dont know where to turnwhich doesnt however in the least prevent every one coming to me with their own selfish troubles it was as if mrs brook had found the cup of her secret sorrows suddenly jostled by some touch of which the perversity though not completely noted at the moment proved as she a little let herself go sufficient to make it flow over but she drew the next thing from her daughters stillness a reflexion of the vanity of such heat and speedily recovered herself as if in order with more dignity to point the moral i can carry my burden and shall do so to the end but we must each remember that we shall fall to pieces if we dont manage to keep hold of some little idea of responsibility i positively cant arrange without knowing when it is you go to him  to mr longdon oh whenever i like nanda replied very gently and simply  and when shall you be so good as to like  well he goes himself on saturday and if i want i can go a few days later  and what day can you go if i want mrs brook spoke as with a small sharpnessjust softened indeed in timeproduced by the sight of a freedom in her daughters life that suddenly loomed larger than any freedom of her own it was still a part of the unsteadiness of the vessel of her anxieties but she never after all remained publicly long subject to the influence she often comprehensively designated to others as well as to herself as nastiness what i mean is that you might go the same day mightnt you  with himin the train i should think so if you wish it  but would he wish it i mean would he hate it  i dont think so at all but i can easily ask him  mrs brooks head inclined to the chimney and her eyes to the window easily  nanda looked for a moment mystified by her mothers insistence i can at any rate perfectly try it  remembering even that mamma would never have pushed so  nandas face seemed to concede even that condition well she at all events serenely replied i really think were good friends enough for anything  it might have been for the light it quickly produced exactly what her mother had been working to make her say what do you call that then i should like to know but his adopting you  ah i dont know that it matters much what its called  so long as it brings with it you mean mrs brook asked all the advantages  well yes said nanda who had now begun dimly to smilecall them advantages  mrs brook had a pause one would be quite ready to do that if one only knew a little more exactly what theyre to consist of  oh the great advantage i feel is doing something for him  nandas companion at this hesitated afresh but doesnt that my dear put the extravagance of your surrender to him on rather an odd footing charity love begins at home and if its a question of merely giving youve objects enough for your bounty without going so far  the girl as her stare showed was held a moment by her surprise which presently broke out why i thought you wanted me so to be nice to him  well i hope you wont think me very vulgar said mrs brook if i tell you that i want you still more to have some idea of what youll get by it ive no wish she added to keep on boring you with mitchy  dont dont nanda pleaded  her mother stopped as short as if there had been something in her tone to set the limit the more utterly for being unstudied yet poor mrs brook couldnt leave it there then what do you get instead  instead of mitchy oh said nanda i shall never marry  mrs brook at this turned away moving over to the window with quickened weariness nanda on her side as if their talk had ended went across to the sofa to take up her parasol before leaving the room an impulse rather favoured than arrested by the arrival of her brother harold who came in at the moment both his relatives had turned a back to the door and who gave his sister as she faced him a greeting that made their mother look round hallo nanyou are lovely aint she lovely mother  no mrs brook answered not however otherwise noticing him her domestic despair centred at this instant all in her daughter well then we shall consideryour father and ithat he must take the consequence  nanda had now her hand on the door while harold had dropped on the sofa he she just sounded  i mean mr longdon  and what do you mean by the consequence  well it will do for the beginning of it that youll please go down with him  on saturday then thanks mamma the girl returned  she was instantly gone on which mrs brook had more attention for her son this after an instant as she approached the sofa and raised her eyes from the little table beside it came straight out where in the world is that fivepound note  harold looked vacantly about him what fivepound note     book seventh mitchy  mr longdons garden took in three acres and full of charming features had for its greatest wonder the extent and colour of its old brick wall in which the pink and purple surface was the fruit of the mild ages and the protective function for a visitor strolling sitting talking reading that of a nurse of reverie the air of the place in the august time thrilled all the while with the bliss of birds the hum of little lives unseen and the flicker of white butterflies it was on the large flat enclosed lawn that nanda spoke to vanderbank of the three weeks she would have completed there on the morrowweeks that had beenshe made no secret of itthe happiest she had yet spent anywhere the greyish day was soft and still and the sky faintly marbled while the more newly arrived of the visitors from london who had come late on the friday afternoon lounged away the morning in an attitude every relaxed line of which referred to the holiday he had as it wereat first merely looking about and victuallingsat down in front of as a captain before a city there were sittingplaces just there out of the full light cushioned benches in the thick wide spread of old mulberryboughs a large book of facts lay in the young mans lap and nanda had come out to him half an hour before luncheon somewhat as beatrice came out to benedick not to call him immediately indeed to the meal but mentioning promptly that she had come at a bidding mr longdon had rebuked her it appeared for her want of attention to their guest showing her in this way to her pleasure how far he had gone toward taking her as he called it into the house  youve been thinking of yourself vanderbank asked as a mere clerk at a salary and you now find that youre a partner and have a share in the concern  it seems to be something like that but doesnt a partner put in something what have i put in  wellme for one thing isnt it your being here that has brought me down  do you mean you wouldnt have come for him alone then dont you make anything of his attraction you ought to said nanda when he likes you so  vanderbank longing for a river was in white flannels and he took her question with a happy laugh a handsome face of good humour that completed the effect of his long cool fairness do you mind my just sitting still do you mind letting me smoke and staying with me a while perhaps after a little well walk aboutshant we but face to face with this dear old house in this jolly old nook ones too contented to move lest raising a finger even should break the spell what will be perfect will be your just sitting downdo sit downand scolding me a little that my dear nanda will deepen the peace some minutes later while near him but in another chair she fingered the impossible book as she pronounced it that she had taken from him he came back to what she had last said has he talked to you much about his liking me  nanda waited a minute turning over the book no  then how are you just now so struck with it  im not struck only with what im talked to about i dont know she went on only what people tell me  ah noyoure too much your mothers daughter for that vanderbank leaned back and smoked and though all his air seemed to say that when one was so at ease for gossip almost any subject would do he kept jogging his foot with the same small nervous motion as during the halfhour at mertle that this record has commemorated youre too much one of us all he continued weve tremendous perceptions he laughed of course i should have come for him but after all he added as if all sorts of nonsense would equally serve he mightnt except for you you know have asked me  nanda so far accepted this view as to reply thats awfully weak hes so modest that he might have been afraid of your boring yourself  thats just what i mean  well if you do nanda returned the explanations a little conceited  oh i only made it vanderbank said in reference to his modesty beyond the lawn the house was before him old square redroofed well assured of its right to the place it took up in the world this was a considerable spacein the little world at least of suffolkand the look of possession had everywhere mixed with it in the form of old windows and doors the tone of old red surfaces the style of old white facings the age of old high creepers the long confirmation of time suggestive of panelled rooms of precious mahogany of portraits of women dead of coloured china glimmering through glass doors and delicate silver reflected on bared tables the thing was one of those impressions of a particular period that it takes two centuries to produce fancy the young man incoherently exclaimed his caring to leave anything so loveable as all this to come up and live with us  the girl also for a little lost herself oh you dont know what it isthe charm comes out so as one stays little by little it grows and grows there are old things everywhere that are too delightful he lets me explore sohe lets me rummage and rifle every day i make discoveries  vanderbank wondered as he smoked you mean he lets you take things  oh yesup to my room to study or to copy there are old patterns that are too dear for anything its when you live with them you see that you know everything in the place is such good company  your mother ought to be here vanderbank presently suggested shes so fond of good company then as nanda answered nothing he went on was your grandmother ever  never the girl promptly said never she repeated in a tone quite different after which she added im the only one  oh and i me and you as they say her companion amended  yes and mr mitchy whos to come downplease dont forgetthis afternoon  vanderbank had another of his contemplative pauses thank you for reminding me i shall spread myself as much as possible before he comestry to produce so much of my effect that i shall be safe but what did mr longdon ask him for  ah said nanda gaily what did he ask you for  why for the reason you just now mentionedthat his interest in me is so uncontrollable  then isnt his interest in mitchy  of the same general order vanderbank broke in not in the least he seemed to look for a way to express the distinctionwhich suddenly occurred to him he wasnt in love with mitchys mother  nonanda turned it over mitchys mother it appears was awful mr cashmore knew her  vanderbanks smokepuffs were profuse and his pauses frequent awful to mr cashmore im glad to hear ithe must have deserved it but i believe in her all the same mitchys often awful himself the young man rambled on just so i believe in him  so do i said nandaand thats why i asked him  you asked him my dear child have you the inviting  oh yes  the eyes he turned on her seemed really to try if she jested or were serious so you arranged for me too  she turned over again a few leaves of his book and closing it with something of a clap transferred it to the bench beside hima movement in which as if through a drop into thought he rendered her no assistance what i mean is that i proposed it to mr longdon i suggested he should be asked ive a reason for seeing himi want to talk to him and do you know the girl went on what mr longdon said  something splendid of course  he asked if you wouldnt perhaps dislike his being here with you  vanderbank throwing back his head laughed smoked jogged his foot more than ever awfully nice dear old mitch how little afraid of him you are  nanda wondered of mitch  yes of the tremendous pull he really has its all very well to talkhe has it but of course i dont mean i dont knowand as with the effect of his nervous sociability he shifted his position i perfectly see that youre not afraid i perfectly know what you have in your head i should never in the least dream of accusing youas far as he is concernedof the least disposition to flirt any more indeed vanderbank pleasantly pursued than even of any general tendency of that sort no my dear nandahe kindly kept it upi will say for you that though a girl thank heaven and awfully much a girl youre really not on the whole more of a flirt than a respectable social ideal prescribes  thank you most tremendously his companion quietly replied  something in the tone of it made him laugh out and the particular sound went well with all the rest with the august day and the charming spot and the young mans lounging figure and nandas own little hovering hospitality of course i strike you as patronising you with unconscious sublimity well thats all right for whats the most natural thing to do in these conditions but the most luxurious wont mitchy be wonderful for feeling and enjoying them i assure you im delighted hes coming then in a different tone a moment later do you expect to be here long he asked  it took nanda some time to say as long as mr longdon will keep me i supposeif that doesnt sound very horrible  oh hell keep you only wont he himself vanderbank went on be coming up to town in the course of the autumn  well in that case id perfectly stay here without him  and leave him in london without you ah thats not what we want he wouldnt be at all the same thing without you least of all for himself vanderbank declared  nanda again thought yes thats what makes him funny i supposehis curious infatuation i set him offwhat do you call itshow him off by his going round and round me as the acrobat on the horse in the circus goes round the clown he has said a great deal to me of your mother she irrelevantly added  ok everything thats kind of course or you wouldnt mention it  thats what i mean said nanda  i see i seemost charming of him vanderbank kept his high head thrown back as for the view with a bright equal general interest of everything that was before them whether talked of or seen who do you think i yesterday had a letter from an extraordinary funny one from harold he gave me all the family news  and what is the family news the girl after a minute enquired  well the first great item is that he himself  wanted nanda broke in to borrow five pounds of you i say that she added because if he wrote to you  it couldnt have been in such a case for the simple pleasure of the intercourse vanderbank hesitated but continued not to look at her what do you know pray of poor harolds borrowings  oh i know as i know other things dont i know everything  do you i should rather ask the young man gaily enough replied  why should i not how should i not you know what i know then as to explain herself and attenuate a little the sudden emphasis with which she had spoken i remember your once telling me that i must take in things at my pores  her companion stared but with his laugh again changed his posture that you must  that i doand you were quite right  and when did i make this extraordinary charge  ah then said nanda you admit it is a charge it was a long time agowhen i was a little girl which made it worse she dropped  it made it at all events now for vanderbank more amusing ah not worsebetter  she thought a moment because in that case i mightnt have understood but that i do understand is just what youve always meant  always my dear nanda i feel somehow he rejoined very kindly as if you overwhelmed me  you feel as if i didbut the reality is just that i dont the day i overwhelm you mr van she let that pass however there was too much to say about it and there was something else much simpler girls understand now it has got to be faced as tishy says  oh well vanderbank laughed we dont require tishy to point that out to us what are we all doing most of the time but trying to face it  doing arent you doing rather something very different youre just trying to dodge it youre trying to make believenot perhaps to yourselves but to usthat it isnt so  but surely you dont want us to be any worse  she shook her head with brisk gravity we dont care really what you are  his amusement now dropped to her straighter your we is awfully beautiful its charming to hear you speak for the whole lovely lot only you speak you know as if you were just the class apart that you yet complain of ourby our scruplesimplying you to be  she considered this objection with her eyes on his face well then we do care only  only its a big subject  oh yesno doubt its a big subject she appeared to wish to meet him on everything reasonable even mr longdon admits that  vanderbank wondered you mean you talk over with him  the subject of girls why we scarcely discuss anything else  oh no wonder then youre not bored but you mean he asked that he recognises the inevitable change  he cant shut his eyes to the facts he sees were quite a different thing  i dare sayher friend was fully appreciative yet the old thingwhat do you know of it  i personally well ive seen some change even in my short life and arent the old books full of us then mr longdon himself has told me  vanderbank smoked and smoked youve gone into it with him  as far as a man and a woman can together  as he took her in at this with a turn of his eye he might have had in his ears the echo of all the times it had been dropped in buckingham crescent that nanda was wonderful she was indeed oh hes of course on certain sides shy  awfullytoo beautifully and then theres aggie the girl pursued i mean for the real old thing  yes no doubtif she be the real old thing but what the deuce really is aggie  well said nanda with the frankest interest shes a miracle if one could be her exactly absolutely without the least little mite of change one would probably be wise to close with it otherwiseexcept for anything but thatid rather brazen it out as myself  there fell between them on this a silence of some minutes after which it would probably not have been possible for either to say if their eyes had met while it lasted this was at any rate not the case as vanderbank at last remarked your brass my dear young lady is pure gold  then its of me i think that harold ought to borrow  you mean therefore that mine isnt vanderbank went on  well you really havent any natural cheeknot like some of them youre in yourself as uneasy if anythings said and every one giggles or makes some face as mr longdon and if lord petherton hadnt once told me that a man hates almost as much to be called modest as a woman does id say that very often in london now you must pass some bad moments  the present might precisely have been one of them we should doubtless have gathered had we seen fully recorded in vanderbanks face the degree to which this prompt response embarrassed or at least stupefied him but he could always provisionally laugh i like your in london now  its the tone and the current and the effect of all the others that push you along she went on as if she hadnt heard him if such things are contagious as every one says you prove it perhaps as much as any one but you dont beginshe continued blandly enough to work it out for him or you cant at least originally have begun any one would know that nowfrom the terrific effect i see i produce on youby talking this way there it isits all out before one knows it isnt it and i cant help it any more than you can can i so she appeared to put it to him with something in her lucidity that would have been infinitely touching a strange grave calm consciousness of their common doom and of what in especial in it would be worst for herself he sprang up indeed after an instant as if he had been infinitely touched he turned away taking just near her a few steps to and fro gazed about the place again but this time without the air of particularly seeing it and then came back to her as if from a greater distance an observer at all initiated would at the juncture fairly have hung on his lips and there was in fact on vanderbanks part quite the look of the manthough it lasted but just while we seize itin suspense about himself the most initiated observer of all would have been poor mr longdon in that case destined however to be also the most defeated with the sign of his tension a smothered ah if he doesnt do it now well vanderbank didnt do it now and the odd slow irrelevant sigh he gave out might have sufficed as the record of his recovery from a peril lasting just long enough to be measured had there been any measure of it meanwhile for nanda there was nothing at least to show either the presence or the relief of anxiety in the way in which by a prompt transition she left her last appeal to him simply to take care of itself you havent denied that harold does borrow  he gave a sound as of cheer for this luckily firmer ground my dear child i never lent the silly boy five pounds in my life in fact i like the way you talk of that i dont know quite for what you take me but the number of persons to whom i have lent five pounds  is so awfully smallshe took him up on itas not to look so very well for you she held him an instant as with the fine intelligence of his meaning in this and then though not with sharpness broke out why are you trying to make out that youre nasty and stingy why do you misrepresent  my natural generosity i dont misrepresent anything but i take i think rather markedly good care of money she had remained in her place and he was before her on the grass his hands in his pockets and his manner perhaps a little awkward the way you young things talk of it  harold talks of itbut i dont think i do im not a bit expensiveask mother or even ask father i do with awfully littlefor clothes and things and i could easily do with still less harolds a born consumer as mitchy says he says also hes one of those people who will never really want  ah for that mitchy himself will never let him  well then with every one helping us all round arent we a lovely family i dont speak of it to tell tales but when you mention hearing from harold all sorts of things immediately come over me we seem to be all living more or less on other people all immensely beholden you can easily say of course that im worst of all the children and their people at bognor are in borrowed quartersmother got them lent heras to which no doubt im perfectly aware that i ought to be there sharing them taking care of my little brother and sister instead of sitting here at mr longdons expense to expose everything and criticise father and mother in scotland are on a grand campaign wellshe pulled herself upim not in that at any rate say youve lent harold only five shillings she went on  vanderbank stood smiling well say i have i never lend any one whatever more  it only adds to my conviction nanda explained that he writes to mr longdon  but if mr longdon doesnt say so vanderbank objected  oh that proves nothing she got up as she spoke harold also works granny he only laughed out at first for this while she went on youll think i make myself out fearfully deepi mean in the way of knowing everything without having to be told that is as you say mammas great accomplishment so it must be hereditary besides there seem to me only too many things one is told only mr longdon has in fact said nothing  she had looked about responsiblynot to leave in disorder the gardennook they had occupied picking up a newspaper and changing the place of a cushion i do think that with him youre remarkable vanderbank observedputting on one side all you seem to know and on the other all he holds his tongue about what then does he say the young man asked after a slight pause and perhaps even with a slight irritation  nanda glanced round againshe was folding rather carefully her paper presently her glance met their friend who having come out of one of the long windows that opened to the lawn had stopped there to watch them he says just now that luncheons ready   ii  ive made him she said in the drawingroom to mitchy make mr van go with him  mr longdon in the rain which had come on since the morning had betaken himself to church and his other guest with sufficiently marked good humour had borne him company the windows of the drawingroom looked at the wet garden all vivid and rich in the summer shower and mitchy after seeing vanderbank turn up his trousers and fling back a last answer to the not quite sincere chaff his submission had engendered adopted freely and familiarly the prospect not only of a grateful freshened lawn but of a good hour in the very pick as he called it of his actual happy conditions the favouring rain the dear old place the charming serious house the large inimitable room the absence of the others the present vision of what his young friend had given him to count onthe sense of these delights was expressed in his fixed generous glare he was at first too pleased even to sit down he measured the great space from end to end admiring again everything he had admired before and protesting afresh that no modern ingenuitynot even his own to which he did justicecould create effects of such purity the final touch in the picture before them was just the composers ignorance mr longdon had not made his house he had simply lived it and the taste of the placemitchy in certain connexions abominated the wordwas just nothing more than the beauty of his life everything on every side had dropped straight from heaven with nowhere a bargaining thumbmark a single sign of the shop all this would have been a wonderful theme for discourse in buckingham crescentso happy an exercise for the votaries of that temple of analysis that he repeatedly spoke of their experience of it as crying aloud for mrs brook the questions it set in motion for the perceptive mind were exactly those that as he said most made them feel themselves vanderbanks plea for his morning had been a pile of letters to work off and mitchythen coming down as he announced from the first ready for anythinghad gone to church with mr longdon and nanda in the finest spirit of curiosity he nowafter the girls remarkturned away from his view of the rain which he found different somehow from other rain as everything else was different and replied that he knew well enough what she could make mr longdon do but only wondered at mr longdons secret for acting on their friend he was there before her with his hands in his pockets and appreciation winking from every yellow spot in his red necktie afternoon service of a wet sunday in a small country town is a large order does van do everything the governor wants  he may perhaps have had a suspicion of what i want nanda explained if i want particularly to talk to you  he has got out of the way to give me a chance well then hes as usual simply magnificent how can i express the bliss of finding myself enclosed with you in this sweet old security this really unimagined sanctity nothings more charming than suddenly to come across something sharp and fresh after weve thought there was nothing more that could draw from us a groan weve supposed weve had it all have squeezed the last impression out of the last disappointment penetrated to the last familiarity in the last surprise then some fine day we find that we havent done justice to life there are little things that pop up and make us feel again what may happen is after all incalculable theres just a little chuck of the dice and for three minutes we win these my dear young lady are my three minutes you wouldnt believe the amusement i get from them and how can i possibly tell you theres a faint divine old fragrance here in the roomor doesnt it perhaps reach you i shant have lived without it but i see now i had been afraid i should you on your side wont have lived without some touch of greatness this moments great and youve produced it you were great when you felt all you could produce therefore mitchy went on pausing once more as he walked before a picture i wont pull the whole thing down by the vulgarity of wishing i too only had a firstrate cotman  have you given up some very big thing to come nanda replied to this  what in the world is very big my child but the beauty of this hour i havent the least idea what when i got mr longdons note i gave up dont ask me for an account of anything everything wentbecame imperceptible i will say that for myself i shed my badness i do forget people with a facility that makes me for bits for little patches so far as theyre concerned cease to be so that my life is spotted all over with momentary states in which im as the dead of whom nothings said but good he had strolled toward her again while she smiled at him ive died for this nanda  the only difficulty i see she presently replied is that you ought to marry a woman really clever and that im not quite sure what there may be of that in aggie  in aggie her friend echoed very gently is that what youve sent for me forto talk about aggie  didnt it occur to you it might be  that it couldnt possibly you mean be anything else he looked about for the place in which it would express the deepest surrender to the scene to sitthen sank down with a beautiful prompt submission ive no idea of what occurred to menothing at least but the sense that i had occurred to you the occurrence is clay in the hands of the potter do with me what you will  you appreciate everything so wonderfully nanda said that it oughtnt to be hard for you to appreciate her i do dream so you may save her thats why i havent waited  the only thing that remains to me in life he answered is a certain accessibility to the thought of what i may still do to figure a little in your eye but thats precisely a thought you may assist to become clearer you may for instance give me some pledge or sign that if i do figureprance and caracole and sufficiently kick up the dustyour eye wont suffer itself to be distracted from me i think theres no adventure im not ready to undertake for you yet my passionchastened through all this purified austereis still enough of this world not wholly to have renounced the fancy of some small reward  how small the girl asked  she spoke as if feeling she must take from him in common kindness at least as much as she would make him take and the serious anxious patience such a consciousness gave her tone was met by mitchy with a charmed reasonableness that his habit of hyperbole did nothing to misrepresent he glowed at her with the fullest recognition that there was something he was there to discuss with her but with the assurance in every soft sound of him that no height to which she might lift the discussion would be too great for him to reach his every cadence and every motion was an implication as from one to the other of the exquisite oh he could sustain it well i mean the establishment of something between us i mean your arranging somehow that we shall be drawn more togetherknow together something nobody else knows i should like so terrifically to have a relation that is a secret with you  oh if thats all you want you can be easily gratified rien de plus facile as mamma says im full of secretsi think im really most secretive ill share almost any one of them with youif its only a good one  mitchy debated you mean youll choose it yourself you wont let it be one of mine  nanda wondered but whats the difference  her companion jumped up again and for a moment pervaded the place when you say such things as that youre of a beauty may it he asked as he stopped before her be one of minea perfectly awful one  she showed her clearest interest as i suppose the most awful secrets are the bestyes certainly  im hideously tempted but he hung fire then dropping into his chair again it would be too bad im afraid i cant  then why wont this do just as it is  this he looked over the big bland room which  why what youre here for  my dear child im heremost of allto love you more than ever and theres an absence of favouring mystery about that she looked at him as if seeing what he meant and only asking to remedy it theres a certain amount of mystery we can now makethat it strikes me in fact we must make dear mitchy she continued almost with eagerness i dont think we can really tell  he had fallen back in his chair not looking at her now and with his hands from his supported elbows clasped to keep himself more quiet are you still talking about aggie  why ive scarcely begun  oh it was not irritation he appeared to express but the slight strain of an effort to get into relation with the subject better to focus the image he closed his eyes a while  you speak of something that may draw us together and i simply reply that if you dont feel how near together we arein this i shouldnt imagine you ever would you must have wonderful notions she presently went on of the ideal state of union i pack every one off for youi banish everything that can interfere and i dont in the least mind your knowing that i find the consequence delightful you may talk if you like of what will have passed between us but i shall never mention it to a soul literally not to a living creature what do you want more than that he opened his eyes in deference to the question but replied only with a gaze as unassisted as if it had come through a hole in a curtain you say youre ready for an adventure and its just an adventure that i propose if i can make you feel for yourself as i feel for you the beauty of your chance to go in and save her  well if you can mitchy at last broke in i dont think you know he said after a moment youll find it easy to make your two ends meet  she thought a little longer one of the ends is yours so that youll act with me if i wind you up so that you go  youll just happily sit and watch me spin thank you that will be my reward  nanda rose on this from her chair as with the impulse of protest shant you care for my gratitude my admiration  oh yesmitchy seemed to muse i shall care for them yet i dont quite see you know what you owe to aggie it isnt as if but with this he faltered  as if she cared particularly for me ah that has nothing to do with it thats a thing without which surely its but too possible to be exquisite there are beautiful quite beautiful people who dont care for me the thing thats important to one is the thing one sees ones self and its quite enough if i see what can be made of that child marry her mitchy and youll see who shell care for  mitchy kept his position he was for the momenthis image of shortly before reversedthe one who appeared to sit happily and watch its too awfully pleasant your asking of me anything whatever  well then as i say beautifully grandly save her  as you say yeshe sympathetically inclined his head but without making me feel exactly what you mean by it  keep her nanda returned from becoming like the duchess  but she isnt a bit like the duchess in any of her elements shes a totally different thing  it was only for an instant however that this objection seemed to tell thats exactly why shell be so perfect for you youll get her awaytake her out of her aunts life  mitchy met it all now in a sort of spellbound stillness what do you know about her aunts life  oh i know everything she spoke with her first faint shade of impatience  it produced for a little a hush between them at the end of which her companion said with extraordinary gentleness and tenderness dear old nanda her own silence appeared consciously to continue and the suggestion of it might have been that for intelligent ears there was nothing to add to the declaration she had just made and which mitchy sat there taking in as with a new light what he drew from it indeed he presently went on to show youre too awfully interesting of courseyou know a lot how shouldnt youand why  why oh thats another affair but you dont imagine what i know im sure its much more than youve a notion of thats the kind of thing now one isjust except the little marvel of aggie what on earth the girl pursued do you take us for  oh its all right breathed mitchy divinely pacific  im sure i dont know whether it is i shouldnt wonder if it were in fact all wrong but what at least is certainly right is for one not to pretend anything else there i am for you at any rate now the beauty of aggie is that she knows nothingbut absolutely utterly not the least little tittle of anything  it was barely visible that mitchy hesitated and he spoke quite gravely have you tried her  oh yes and tishy has his gravity had been less than nandas nothing nothing the memory of some scene or some passage might have come back to her with a charm ah say what you willit is the way we ought to be  mitchy after a minute of much intensity had stopped watching her changing his posture and with his elbows on his knees he dropped for a while his face into his hands then he jerked himself to his feet theres something i wish awfully i could say to you but i cant  nanda after a slow headshake covered him with one of the dimmest of her smiles you neednt say it i know perfectly which it is she held him an instant after which she went on its simply that you wish me fully to understand that youre one who in perfect sincerity doesnt mind one straw how awful  yes how awful he had kindled as he paused with his new eagerness  well ones knowledge may be it doesnt shock in you a single hereditary prejudice  oh hereditary mitchy ecstatically murmured  you even rather like me the better for it so that one of the reasons why you couldnt have told methough not of course i know the only oneis that you would have been literally almost ashamed because you know she went on it is strange  my lack of hereditary  yes discomfort in presence of the fact i speak of theres a kind of sense you dont possess  his appreciation again fairly goggled at her oh you do know everything  youre so good that nothing shocks you she lucidly persisted theres a kind of delicacy you havent got  he was more and more struck ive only thatas it wereof the skin and the fingers he appealed  oh and that of the mind and that of the soul and some other kinds certainly but not the kind  yeshe wonderedi suppose thats the only way one can name it it appeared to rise there before him the kind  the kind that would make me painful to you or rather not me perhaps she added as if to create between them the fullest possible light but my situation my exposureall the results of them i show doesnt one become a sort of a little drainpipe with everything flowing through  why dont you call it more gracefully mitchy asked freshly struck a little aeolianharp set in the drawingroom window and vibrating in the breeze of conversation  oh because the harp gives out a sound and weat least we try togive out none  what you take you mean you keep  well it sticks to us and thats what you dont mind  their eyes met long on it yesi see i dont mind ive the most extraordinary lacunae  oh i dont know about others nanda replied i havent noticed them but youve that one and its enough  he continued to face her with his queer mixture of assent and speculation enough for what my dear to have made me impossible for you because the only man you could as they say have respected would be a man who would have minded then as under the cool soft pressure of the question she looked at last away from him the man with the kind as you call it happens to be just the type you can love but whats the use he persisted as she answered nothing in loving a person with the prejudicehereditary or otherto which youre precisely obnoxious do you positively like to love in vain  it was a question the way she turned back to him seemed to say that deserved a responsible answer yes  but she had moved off after speaking and mitchys eyes followed her to different parts of the room as with small pretexts of present attention to it small bestowed touches for symmetry she slowly measured it whats extraordinary then is your idea of my finding any charm in aggies ignorance  she immediately put down an old snuffbox whyits the one sort of thing you dont know you cant imagine she said as she returned to him the effect it will produce on you you must get really near it and see it all come out to feel all its beauty youll like it mitchyand nandas gravity was wonderfulbetter than anything you have known  the clear sincerity of this even had there been nothing else imposed a consideration that mitchy now flagrantly could give and the deference of his suggestion of difficulty only grew more deep im to do then with this happy condition of hers what you say youve doneto try it and then as her assent so directly challenged failed an instant but wont my approach to it however cautious be just what will break it up and spoil it  nanda thought why soif mine wasnt  oh youre not me  but im just as bad  thank you my dear mitchy rang out  without nanda pursued being as good she had on this in a different key her own sudden explosion dont you see mitchy dearfor the very heart of it allhow good i believe you  she had spoken as with a flare of impatience at some justice he failed to do her and this brought him after a startled instant close enough to her to take up her hand she let him have it and in mute solemn reassurance he raised it to his lips saying to her thus more things than he could say in any other way which yet just after when he had released it and a motionless pause had ensued didnt prevent his adding three words oh nanda nanda  the tone of them made her again extraordinarily gentle dont try anything then take everything for granted  he had turned away from her and walked mechanically with his air of blind emotion to the window where for a minute he looked out it has stopped raining he said at last its going to brighten  the place had three windows and nanda went to the next not quite yetbut i think it will  mitchy soon faced back into the room where after a brief hesitation he moved as quietly almost as cautiously as if on tiptoe to the seat occupied by his companion at the beginning of their talk here he sank down watching the girl who stood a while longer with her eyes on the garden you want me you say to take her out of the duchesss life but where am i myself if we come to that but even more in the duchesss life than aggie is im in it by my contacts my associations my indifferencesall my acceptances knowledges amusements im in it by my cynicismsthose that circumstances somehow from the first when i began for myself to look at life and the world committed me to and steeped me in im in it by a kind of desperation that i shouldnt have felt perhaps if you had got hold of me sooner with just this touch with which youve got hold of me today and im in it more than allyoull yourself admitby the very fact that her aunt desires as you know much more even than you do to bring the thing about then we should bethe duchess and ishoulder to shoulder  nanda heard him motionless to the end taking also another minute to turn over what he had said what is it you like so in lord petherton she asked as she came to him  my dear child if you only could tell me it would be wouldnt itit must have beenthe subject of some fairytale if fairytales were made now or better still of some christmas pantomime the gnome and the giant  nanda appeared to trynot with much successto see it do you find lord petherton a gnome  mitchy at first for all reward only glared at her charming nandacharming  a mans giant enough for lord petherton she went on when his fortunes gigantic he preys upon you  his hands in his pockets and his legs much apart mitchy sat there as in a posture adapted to her simplicity youre adorable you dont but it is rather horrid isnt it he presently went on  her momentary silence would have been by itself enough of an answer nothingof all you speak of she nevertheless returned will matter then shell so simplify your life he remained just as he was only with his eyes on her and meanwhile she had turned again to her window through which a faint sunstreak began to glimmer and play at sight of it she opened the casement to let in the warm freshness the rain has stopped  you say you want me to save her but what you really mean mitchy resumed from the sofa isnt at all exactly that  nanda without heeding the remark took in the sunshine it will be charming now in the garden  her friend got up found his wonderful crossbarred cap after a glance on a neighbouring chair and with it came toward her your hope is thatas im good enough to be worth itshell save me  nanda looked at him now she will mitchyshe will  they stood a moment in the recovered brightness after which he mechanicallyas with the pressure of quite another consciousnessput on his cap well then shall that hope between us be the thing  the thingshe just wondered  why that will have drawn us togetherto hold us so you knowthis afternoon i mean the secret we spoke of  she put out to him on this the hand he had taken a few minutes before and he clasped it now only with the firmness it seemed to give and to ask for oh it will do for that she said as they went out together    iii  it had been understood that he was to take his leave on the morrow though vanderbank was to stay another day mr longdon had for the sunday dinner invited three or four of his neighbours to meet the two gentlemen from town so that it was not till the company had departed or in other words till near bedtime that our four friends could again have become aware as between themselves of that directness of mutual relation which forms the subject of our picture it had not however prevented nandas slipping upstairs as soon as the doctor and his wife had gone and the manner indeed in which on the stroke of eleven mr longdon conformed to his tradition of appropriating a particular candle was as positive an expression of it as any other nothing in him was more amiable than the terms maintained between the rigour of his personal habits and his free imagination of the habits of others he deprecated as regards the former it might have been seen most signs of likeness and no one had ever dared to learn how he would have handled a show of imitation the way to flatter him mitchy threw off five minutes later is not to make him think you resemble or agree with him but to let him see how different you perceive he can bear to think you i mean of course without hating you  but what interest have you vanderbank asked in the way to flatter him  my dear fellow more interest than you i havent been here all day without arriving at conclusions on the credit he has opened to you  do you mean the amount hell settle  you have it in your power said mitchy to make it anything you like  and is he thenso bloated  mitchy was on his feet in the apartment in which their host had left them and he had at first for this question but an expressive motion of the shoulders in respect to everything in the room see judge guess feel  but it was as if vanderbank before the fire consciously controlled his own attention oh i dont care a hang  this passage took place in the library and as a consequence of their having confessed as their friend faced them with his bedroom light that a brief discreet vigil and a box of cigars would fix better than anything else the fine impression of the day mitchy might at that moment on the evidence of the eyes mr longdon turned to them and of which his innocent candleflame betrayed the secret have found matter for a measure of the almost extreme allowances he wanted them to want of him they had only to see that the greater window was fast and to turn out the library lamp it might really have amused them to stand a moment at the open door that apart from this was to testify to his conception of those who were not in the smaller hours as he was he had in fact by his retreatand but too sensiblyleft them there with a deal of midnight company if one of these presences was the mystery he had himself mixed the manner of our young men showed a due expectation of the others mitchy on hearing how little vanderbank cared only kept up a while longer that observant revolution in which he had spent much of his day to which any fresh sense of any exhibition always promptly committed him and which had it not been controlled by infinite tact might have affected the nerves of those in whom enjoyment was less rotary he was silent long enough to suggest his fearing that almost anything he might say would appear too allusive then at last once more he took his risk awfully jolly old place  it is indeed van only said but his posture in the large chair he had pushed toward the open window was of itself almost an opinion the august night was hot and the air that came in charged and sweet vanderbank smoked with his face to the dusky garden and the dim stars at the end of a few moments more of which he glanced round dont you think it rather stuffy with that big lamp as those candles on the chimney are going we might put it out  like this the amiable mitchy had straightway obliged his companion and he as promptly took in the effect of the diminished light on the character of the room which he commended as if the depth of shadow produced were all this companion had sought he might freshly have brought home to vanderbank that a man sensitive to so many different things and thereby always sure of something or other could never really be incommoded though that personage presently indeed showed himself occupied with another thought  i think i ought to mention to you that ive told him how you and mrs brook now both know i did so this afternoon on our way back from churchi hadnt done it before he took me a walk round to show me more of the place and that gave me my chance but he doesnt mind vanderbank continued the only thing is that ive thought it may possibly make him speak to you so that its better you should know he knows but he told me definitely nanda doesnt  mitchy took this in with an attention that spoke of his already recognising how the less tempered darkness favoured talk and is that all that passed between you  well practically except of course that i made him understand i think how it happened that i havent kept my own counsel  oh but you havedidnt he at least feelor perhaps even have done better when youve two such excellent persons to keep it for you cant he easily believe how we feel with you  vanderbank appeared for a minute to leave this appeal unheeded he continued to stare into the garden while he smoked and swung the long leg he had thrown over the arm of the chair when he at last spoke however it was with some emphasisperhaps even with some vulgarity oh rot  mitchy hovered without an arrest you mean he cant feel  i mean it isnt true ive no illusions about you i know how youre both affected though i of course perfectly trust you  mitchy had a short silence trust us not to speak  not to speak to nanda herselfthough of course too if you spoke to others vanderbank went on theyd immediately rush and tell her  ive spoken to no one said mitchy im sure of it and neither has mrs brook  im glad youre sure of that also mitchy returned for its only doing her justice  oh im quite confident of it said vanderbank and without asking her  perfectly  and youre equally sure without asking that i havent betrayed you after which while as if to let the question lie there in its folly vanderbank said nothing his friend pursued i came i must tell you terribly near it today  why must you tell me your coming near doesnt concern me and i take it you dont suppose im watching or sounding you mrs brook will have come terribly near vanderbank continued as if to make the matter free but she wont have done it either shell have been distinctly tempted  but she wont have fallen mitchy broke in exactlythere we are i was distinctly tempted and i didnt fall i think your certainty about mrs brook he added shows you do know her shes incapable of anything deliberately nasty  oh of anything nasty in any way vanderbank said musingly and kindly  yes one knows on the whole what she wont do after which for a period mitchy roamed and reflected but in spite of the assurance given you by mr longdonor perhaps indeed just because of your having taken iti think i ought to mention to you my belief that nanda does know of his offer to you i mean by having guessed it  oh said vanderbank  theres in fact more still his companion pursuedthat i feel i should like to mention to you  oh vanderbank at first only repeated but after a moment he said my dear fellow im much obliged  the thing i speak of is something i should at any rate have said and i should have looked out for some chance if we had not had this one mitchy spoke as if his friends last words were not of consequence and he continued as vanderbank got up and moving rather aimlessly came and stood with his back to the chimney my only hesitation would have been caused by its entailing our going down into things in a way that face to facegiven the private nature of the thingsi dare say most men dont particularly enjoy but if you dont mind  oh i dont mind in fact as i tell you i recognise an obligation to you vanderbank with his shoulders against the high mantel uttered this without a direct look he smoked and smoked then considered the tip of his cigar you feel convinced she knows he threw out  well its my impression  ah any impression of yoursof that sortis sure to be right if you think i ought to have it from you im really grateful is thatawhat you wanted to say to me vanderbank after a slight pause demanded  mitchy watching him more than he watched mitchy shook a mildly decisive head no  vanderbank his eyes on his smokepuffs seemed to wonder what you wanted issomething else  something else  oh said vanderbank for the third time  the ejaculation had been vague but the movement that followed it was definite the young man turning away found himself again near the chair he had quitted and resumed possession of it as a sign of being at his friends service this friend however not only hung fire but finally went back to take a shot from a quarter they might have been supposed to have left it strikes me as odd his imaginingawfully acute as he isthat she has not guessed one wouldnt have thought he could live with her here in such an intimacyseeing her every day and pretty much all dayand make such a mistake  vanderbank his great length all of a lounge again turned it over and yet i do thoroughly feel the mistakes not yours  mitchy had a new serenity of affirmation oh its not mine  perhaps thenit occurred to his friendhe doesnt really believe it  and only says so to make you feel more easy  so that one mayin fairness to ones selfkeep ones head as it were and decide quite on ones own grounds  then you have still to decide  vanderbank took time to answer ive still to decide mitchy became again on this in the sociable dusk a slowcircling vaguelyagitated element and his companion continued is your idea very generously and handsomely to help that by letting me know  that i do definitely renouncemitchy took him upany pretension and any hope well im ready with a proof of it ive passed my word that ill apply elsewhere  vanderbank turned more round to him apply to the duchess for her niece  its practically settled  but since when  mitchy barely faltered since this afternoon  ah then not with the duchess herself  with nandawhose plan from the first you wont have forgotten the thing has so charmingly been  vanderbank could show that his not having in the least forgotten was yet not a bar to his being now mystified but my dear man what can nanda settle  my fate mitchy said pausing well before him  vanderbank sat now a minute with raised eyes catching the indistinctness of the others strange expression youre both beyond me he exclaimed at last i dont see what you in particular gain  i didnt either till she made it all out to me one sees then in such a matter for ones self and as everythings gain that isnt loss there was nothing i could lose it gets me mitchy further explained out of the way  out of the way of what  this mitchy frankly showed was more difficult to say but he in time brought it out well of appearing to suggest to you that my existence in a prolonged state of singleness may ever represent for her any real alternative  but alternative to what  why to being your wife damn you mitchy on these words turned away again and his companion in the presence of his renewed dim gyrations sat for a minute dumb before van had spoken indeed he was back again excuse my violence but of course you really see  im not pretending anything vanderbank saidbut a man must understand what i catch hold of is that you offer mein the fact that youre thus at any rate disposed ofa proof that i by the same token shant if i hesitate to go in have a pretext for saying to myself that i may deprive her  yes precisely mitchy now urbanely assented of somethingin the shape of a man with my amount of moneythat she may live to regret and to languish for my amount of money dont you see he very simply added is nothing to her  and you want me to be sure thatso far as i may ever have had a scrupleshe has had her chance and got rid of it  completely mitchy smiled  becausevanderbank with the aid of his cigar thoughtfully pieced it outthat may possibly bring me to the point  possibly mitchy laughed  he had stood a moment longer almost as if to see the possibility develop before his eyes and had even started at the next sound of his friends voice what vanderbank in fact brought out however only made him turn his back do you like so very much little aggie  well said mitchy nanda does and i like nanda  youre too amazing vanderbank mused his musing had presently the effect of making him rise meditation indeed beset him after he was on his feet i cant help its coming over me then that on such an extraordinary system you must also rather like me  what will you have my dear van mitchy frankly asked its the sort of thing you must be most used to for at the present momentlookarent we all at you at once  it was as if his dear van had managed to appear to wonder all  nanda mrs brook mr longdon  and you i see  names of distinction and all the others mitchy pursued that i dont count  oh youre the best  i  youre the best vanderbank simply repeated its at all events most extraordinary he declared but i make you out on the whole better than i do mr longdon  ah arent we very much the samesimple lovers of life that is of that finer essence of it which appeals to the consciousness  the consciousnesshis companion took up his hesitation  well enlarged and improved  the words had made on mitchys lips an image by which his friend appeared for a moment held one doesnt really know quite what to say or to do  oh you must take it all quietly youre of a special class one of those who as we said the other daydont you rememberare a source of the sacred terror people made in such a way must take the consequences just as people must take them mitchy went on who are made as i am so cheer up  mitchy uttering this incitement had moved to the empty chair by the window in which he presently was sunk and it might have been in emulation of his previous strolling and straying that vanderbank himself now began to revolve the meditation he next threw out however showed a certain resistance to mitchys advice im glad at any rate i dont deprive her of a fortune  you dont deprive her of mine of course mitchy answered from the chair but isnt her enjoyment of mr longdons at least a good deal staked after all on your action  vanderbank stopped short its his idea to settle it all  mitchy gave out his glare i thought you didnt care a hang i havent been here so long he went on as his companion at first retorted nothing without making up my mind for myself about his means he is distinctly bloated  it sent vanderbank off again oh well shell no more get all in the one event than shell get nothing in the other shell only get a sort of provision but shell get that whatever happens  oh if youre sure mitchy simply commented  im not sure confound it thenfor his voice had been irritatedvan spoke more quietly only i see her herethough on his wish of coursehandling things quite as if they were her own and paying him a visit without apparently any calculable end whats that on his part but a pledge  oh mitchy could show offhand that he knew what it was its a pledge quite as much to you he shows you the whole thing he likes you not a whit less than he likes her  oh thunder van impatiently sighed  its as rum as you please but there it is said the inexorable mitchy  then does he think ill do it for this  for this  for the place the whole thing as you call it that he shows me  mitchy had a short silence that might have represented a change of colour it isnt good enough but he instantly took himself up of course he wantsas i doto treat you with tact  oh its all right vanderbank immediately said your tactyours and hisis marvellous and nandas greatest of all  mitchys momentary renewal of stillness was addressed he somehow managed not obscurely to convey to the last clause of his friends speech if youre not sure he presently resumed why cant you frankly ask him  vanderbank again as the phrase is mooned about a little because i dont know that it would do  what do you mean by do  well that it would be exactlywhat do you call itsquare or even quite delicate or decent to take from him in the way of an assurance so handsomely offered so much and then to ask for more i dont feel i can do it besides ive my little conviction to the question itself he might easily reply that its none of my business  i see mitchy dropped such pressure might suggest to him moreover that youre hesitating more than you perhaps really are  oh as to that said vanderbank i think he practically knows how much  and how little he met this however with no more form than if it had been a poor joke so that mitchy also smoked for a moment in silence its your coming down here you mean for these three or four days that will have fixed it  the question this time was one to which the speaker might have expected an answer but vanderbanks only immediate answer was to walk and walk i want so awfully to be kind to her he at last said  i should think so then with irrelevance mitchy harked back shall i find out  but vanderbank with another thought had lost the thread find out what  why if she does get anything  if im not kind enoughvan had caught up again dear no id rather you shouldnt speak unless first spoken to  well he may speaksince he knows we know  it isnt likely for he cant make out why i told you  you didnt tell me you know said mitchy you told mrs brook  well she told you and her talking about it is the unpleasant idea he cant get her down anyhow  poor mrs brook mitchy meditated  poor mrs brook his companion echoed  but i thought you said he went on that he doesnt mind  your knowing well i dare say he doesnt but he doesnt want a lot of gossip and chatter  oh said mitchy with meekness  i may absolutely take it from you then vanderbank presently resumed that nanda has her idea  oh she didnt tell me so but its none the less my belief  well vanderbank at last threw off i feel it for myself if only because she always knows everything he pursued without looking at mitchy she always knows everything everything  everything everything mitchy got up  she told me so herself yesterday said van  and she told me so today  vanderbanks hesitation might have shown he was struck with this well i dont think its information that either of us required but of course shecant help it he added everything literally everything in london in the world she lives in is in the air she breathesso that the longer shes in it the more shell know  the more shell know certainly mitchy acknowledged but she isnt in it you see down here  no only she appears to have come down with such accumulations and she wont be here for ever vanderbank hastened to mention certainly not if you marry her  but isnt that at the same time vanderbank asked just the difficulty  mitchy looked vague the difficulty  why as a married woman shell be steeped in it again  surelyoh mitchy could be candid but the difference will be that for a married woman it wont matter it only matters for girls he plausibly continuedand then only for those on whom no one takes pity  the trouble is said vanderbankbut quite as if uttering only a general truththat its just a thing that may sometimes operate as a bar to pity isnt it for the nonmarrying girls that it doesnt particularly matter for the others its such an odd preparation  oh i dont mind it mitchy declared  vanderbank visibly demurred ah but your choice  is such a different sort of thing mitchy for the halfhour in the ambiguous dusk had never looked more droll the young lady i named isnt my choice  well then thats only a sign the more that you do these things more easily  oh easily mitchy murmured  we oughtnt at any rate to keep it up said vanderbank who had looked at his watch twelve twentyfivegoodnight shall i blow out the candles  do please ill close the windowand mitchy went to it ill follow yougoodnight the candles after a minute were out and his friend had gone but mitchy left in darkness face to face with the vague quiet garden still stood there     book eighth tishy grendon    i  the footman opening the door mumbled his name without sincerity and vanderbank passing in found in factfor he had caught the symptomthe chairs and tables the lighted lamps and the flowers alone in possession he looked at his watch which exactly marked eight then turned to speak again to the servant who had however without another sound and as if blushing for the house already closed him in there was nothing indeed but mrs grendons want of promptness that failed of a welcome her drawingroom on the january night showed its elegance through a suffusion of pink electricity which melted at the end of the vista into the faintly golden glow of a retreat still more sacred vanderbank walked after a moment into the second room which also proved empty and which had its little globes of white firediscreetly limited in numbercoated with lemoncoloured silk the walls covered with delicate french mouldings were so fair that they seemed vaguely silvered the low french chimney had a french fire there was a lemoncoloured stuff on the sofa and chairs a wonderful polish on the floor that was largely exposed and a copy of a french novel in blue paper on one of the spindlelegged tables vanderbank looked about him an instant as if generally struck then gave himself to something that had particularly caught his eye this was simply his own name written rather large on the cover of the french book and endowed after he had taken the volume up with the power to hold his attention the more closely the longer he looked at it he uttered for a private satisfaction before letting the matter pass a low confused sound after which flinging the book down with some emphasis in another place he moved to the chimneypiece where his eyes for a little intently fixed the small ashy woodfire when he raised them again it was on the observation that the beautiful clock on the mantel was wrong to consult once more his watch and then give a glance in the chimneyglass at the state of his moustache the ends of which he twisted for a moment with due care while so engaged he became aware of something else and quickly facing about recognised in the doorway of the room the other figure the glass had just reflected  oh you he said with a quick handshake mrs grendons down but he had already passed with nanda on their greeting back into the first room which contained only themselves and she had mentioned that she believed tishy to have said 815 which meant of course anything people liked  oh then therell be nobody till nine i didnt i suppose sufficiently study my note which didnt mention to me by the way vanderbank added that you were to be here  ah but why should it nanda spoke again however before he could reply i dare say that when she wrote to you she didnt know  know youd come bang up to meet me vanderbank laughed jolly at any rate thanks to my mistake to have in this way a quiet moment with you you came on ahead of your mother  oh noim staying here  oh said vanderbank  mr longdon came up with mei came here friday last straight  you parted at the door he asked with marked gaiety  she thought a momentshe was more serious yesbut only for a day or two hes coming tonight  good how delightful  hell be glad to see you nanda said looking at the flowers  awfully kind of him when ive been such a brute  howa brute  well i mean not writingnor going back  oh i see nanda simply returned  it was a simplicity that clearly enough made her friend a little awkward has heaminded hut he cant have complained he quickly added  oh he never complains  no noit isnt in him but its just that said vanderbank that makes one feel so base ive been ferociously busy  he knows thathe likes it nanda returned he delights in your work and ive done what i can for him  ah said her companion youve evidently brought him round i mean to this lady  to tishy oh of course i cant leave herwith nobody  novanderbank became jocose againthats a london necessity you cant leave anybody with nobodyexposed to everybody  mild as it was however nanda missed the pleasantry mr grendons not here  where is he then  yachtingbut she doesnt know  then she and you are just doing this together  well said nanda shes dreadfully frightened  oh she mustnt allow herself he returned to be too much carried away by it but were to have your mother  yes and papa its really for mitchy and aggie the girl went onbefore they go abroad  ah then i see what youve come up for tishy and i arent in it its all for mitchy  if you mean theres nothing i wouldnt do for him youre quite right he has always been of a kindness to me  that culminated in marrying your friend vanderbank asked it was charming certainly and i dont mean to diminish the merit of it but aggie herself i gather is of a charm now  isnt shenanda was eager hasnt she come out  with a boundinto the arena but when a young persons out with mitchy  oh you mustnt say anything against that ive been out with him myself  ah but my dear child van frankly argued  it was not however a thing to notice i knew it would be just so it always is when theyve been like that  do you mean as she apparently was but doesnt it make one wonder a little if she was  oh she wasi know she was and were also to have harold nanda continuedanother of mitchys beneficiaries it would be a banquet wouldnt it if we were to have them all  vanderbank hesitated and the look he fixed on the door might have suggested a certain open attention to the arrival of their hostess or the announcement of other guests if you havent got them all the beneficiaries youve got in having me i should suppose about the biggest  ah what has he done for you nanda asked  again her friend hung fire do you remember something you said to me down there in august  she looked vague but quite unembarrassed i remember but too well that i chattered  you declared to me that you knew everything  oh yesand i said so to mitchy too  well my dear child you dont  because i dont know  yes what makes me the victim of his insatiable benevolence  ah well if youve no doubt of it yourself thats all thats required im quite glad to hear of something i dont know nanda pursued and were to have harold too she repeated  as a beneficiary then we shall fill up harold will give us a stamp  wont he i hear of nothing but his success mother wrote me that people are frantic for him and said the girl after an instant do you know what cousin jane wrote me  what would she now im trying to think  nanda relieved him of this effort why that mother has transferred to him all the scruples she felteven to excessin my time about what we might pick up among you all that wouldnt be good for us  thats a neat one for me vanderbank declared and i like your talk about your antediluvian time  oh its all over  what exactly is it vanderbank presently demanded that you describe in that manner  well my little hour and the danger of picking up  theres none of it here  nanda appeared frankly to judge nobecause really tishy dont you see is natural we just talk  vanderbank showed his interest whereas at your mothers  well you were all afraid  vanderbank laughed straight out do you mind my telling her that  oh she knows it ive heard her say herself you were  ah i was he concurred you know weve spoken of that before  im speaking now of all of you said nanda but it was she who was most so for she triedi know she did she told me soto control you and it was when you were most controlled  vans amusement took it up that we were most detrimental  yes because of course whats so awfully unutterable is just what we most notice tishy knows that nanda wonderfully observed  as the reflexion of her tone might have been caught by an observer in vanderbanks face it was in all probability caught by his interlocutress who superficially however need have recognised therewhat was all she showedbut the right manner of waiting for dinner the better way then is to dash right in thats what our friend here does  oh you know what she does the girl replied as with a sudden drop of interest in the question she turned at the moment to the opening of the door  it was tishy who at last appeared and her guest had his greeting ready were talking of the delicate matters as to which you think its better to dash right in but im bound to say your inviting a hungry man to dinner doesnt appear to be one of them  the sign of tishy grendonas it had been often called in a society in which variety of reference had brought to high perfection for usual safety the sense of signswas a retarded facial glimmer that in respect to any subject closed up the rear of the procession it had been said of her indeed that when processions were at all rapid she was usually to be found on a false impression of her whereabouts mixed up with the next so that now for instance by the time she had reached the point of saying to vanderbank are you really hungry nanda had begun to appeal to him for some praise of their hostesss appearance this was of course with soft looks up and down at her clothes isnt she too nice did you ever see anything so lovely  im so faint with inanition van replied to mrs grendon thatlike the traveller in the desert isnt iti only make out as an oasis or a mirage a sweet green rustling blur i dont trust you  i dont trust you nanda said on her friends behalf she isnt greenmen are amazing they dont know the dearest old blue that ever was seen  is it your old blue vanderbank monocular very earnestly asked i can imagine it was dear but i should have thought  it was yellownanda helped him outif i hadnt kindly told you tishys figure showed the confidence of objects consecrated by publicity bodily speaking a beautiful human plant it might have taken the last november gale to account for the completeness with which in some quarters she had shed her leaves her companions could only emphasise by the direction of their eyes the nature of the responsibility with which a spectator would have seen them saddleda choice as to consciousness between the effect of her being and the effect of her not being dressed oh im hideousof course i know it said tishy im only just clean heres nanda now whos beautiful she vaguely continued and nanda  oh but darling nandas clean too the young lady in question interrupted on which her fellow guest could only laugh with her as in relief from the antithesis of which her presence of mind had averted the completion little indeed as in mrs grendons talk that element of style was usually involved  theres nothing in such a matter vanderbank observed as if it were the least he could decently say like challenging enquiry and heres harold precisely he went on in the next breath as clear and crisp and undefiled as a fresh fivepound note  a fresh oneharold had passed in a flash from his hostess a man who like me hasnt seen one for six months could perfectly do i assure you with one that has lost its whatdoyoucall it he kissed nanda with a friendly peck then more completely aware had a straighter apprehension for tishy my dear child you seem to have lost something though ill say for you that one doesnt miss it  mrs grendon looked from him to nanda does he mean anything very nasty i can only understand you when nanda explains she returned to harold in fact theres scarcely anything i understand except when nanda explains its too dreadful her being away so much now with strange people whom im sure she cant begin to do for what she does for me it makes me miss her all round and the only thing ive come across that she cant explain tishy bunched straight at her friend is what on earth shes doing there  why shes working mr longdon like a good fine girl harold said like a good true daughter and even though she doesnt love me nearly so much as i love her i will say like a good true sister im bound to tell you my dear tishy he went on that i think it awfully happy with the trend of manners for any really nice young thing to be a bit lost to sight london upon my honour is quite too awful for girls and any big house in the country is as much worsewith the promiscuities and opportunities and all thatas you know for yourselves i know some places harold declared where if i had any girls id see em shot before id take em  oh you know too much my dear boy vanderbank remarked with commiseration  ah my brave old van the youth returned dont speak as if you had illusions i know he pursued to the ladies just where some of vans must have perished and some of the places ive in mind are just where he has left his tracks a man must be wedded to sweet superstitions not nowadays to have to open his eyes nanda love he benevolently concluded stay where you are so at least i shant blush for you that youve the good fortune to have reached your time of life with so little injury to your innocence makes you a case by yourself of which we must recognise the claims if tishy cant make you gasp thats nothing against you nor against hertishy comes of one of the few innocent english families that are left yes you may all cry ohobut i defy you to name me say five or at most seven in which some awful thing or other hasnt happened of course ours is one and tishys is one and vans is one and mr longdons is one and that makes you bang off four so there you are harold gaily wound up  i see now why hes the rage vanderbank observed to nanda  but mrs grendon expressed to their young friend a lingering wonder do you mean you go in for the adoption  oh tishy nanda mildly murmured  harold however had his own tact the dear mans taking her quite over not altogether unreservedly im with the governor i think we ought to get something oh yes dear man but what do you give us for herthats what i should say to him i mean dont you know that i dont think shes making quite the bargain she might if he were to want me i dont say he mightnt have me but i should have it on my conscience to make it in one way or another a good thing for my parents you are nice old womanhe turned to his sisterand one can still feel for the flower of your youth something of the wonderful reverence that we were all brought up on for gods sake thereforeall the moredont really close with him till youve had another word or two with me ill be hangedhe appealed to the company againif he shall have her for nothing  see rather vanderbank said to mrs grendon how little its like your really losing her that she should be able this evening fairly to bring the dear man to you at this rate we dont lose herwe simply get him as well  ah but is it quite the dear mans company we wantand harold looked anxious and acute if thats the best arrangement nanda can make  if he hears us talking in this way which strikes me as very horrible nanda interposed very simply and gravely i dont think were likely to get anything  oh harolds talk vanderbank protested offers i think an extraordinary interest only im bound to say it crushes me to the earth ive to make at least as i listen to him a big effort to bear up it doesnt seem long ago he pursued to his young friend that i used to feel i was in it but the way you bring home to me dreadful youth that im already not  harold looked earnest to understand the hungry generations tread you downis that it  vanderbank gave a pleasant tragic headshake we speak a different language  ah but i think i perfectly understand yours  thats just my anguishand your advantage its awfully curious vanderbank went on to nanda but i feel as if i must figure to him you know very much as mr longdon figures to me mr longdon doesnt somehow get into me yet i do i think into him but we dont matter  wenanda with her eyes on him echoed it  mr longdon and i it cant be helped i suppose he went on for tishy with sociable sadness but it is short innings  mrs grendon who was clearly credulous looked positively frightened ah but my dear thank you i havent begun to live  well i havethats just where it is said harold thank you all the more old van for the tip  there was an announcement just now at the door and tishy turned to meet the duchess with harold almost as if he had been master of the house figuring but a step behind her dont mind her vanderbank immediately said to the companion with whom he was left but tell me while i still have hold of you who wrote my name on the french novel that i noticed a few minutes since in the other room  nanda at first only wondered if its theredidnt you  he just hesitated if it were here youd see if its my hand  nanda faltered and for somewhat longer how should i see what do i know of your hand  he looked at her hard you have seen it  ohso little she replied with a faint smile  do you mean ive not written to you for so long surely i did inwhen was it  yes when but why should you she asked in quite a different tone  he was not prepared on this with the right statement and what he did after a moment bring out had for the occasion a little the sound of the wrong the beauty of you is that youre too good which for me is but another way of saying youre too clever you make no demands you let things go you dont allow in particular for the human weakness that enjoys an occasional glimpse of the weakness of others  she had deeply attended to him you mean perhaps one doesnt show enough what one wants  i think that must be it youre so fiendishly proud  she appeared again to wonder not too much so at any rate only to want from you  well what  why whats pleasant for yourself she simply said  oh dear thats poor bliss he returned how does it come then he next said that with this barrenness of our intercourse i know so well your hand  a series of announcements had meanwhile been made with guests arriving to match them and nandas eyes at this moment engaged themselves with mr longdon and her mother who entered the room together when she looked back to her companion she had had time to drop a consciousness of his question if im proud to you im not good she said and if im goodalways to youim not proud i know at all events perfectly how immensely youre occupied what a quantity of work you get through and how every minute counts for you dont make it a crime to me that im reasonable  no that would show wouldnt it that there isnt much else but how it all comes back  well to what she asked  to the old story you know how im occupied you know how i work you know how i manage my time  oh i see said nanda it is my knowing after all everything  everything the book i just mentioned is one that months agoi remember nowi lent your mother  oh a thing in a blue cover i remember then too nandas face cleared up i had forgotten it was lying about here but i must have brought itin fact i remember i didfor tishy and i wrote your name on it so that we might know  that i hadnt lent it to either of you it didnt occur to you to write your own vanderbank went on  well but if it isnt mine it isnt mine im sure  therefore also if it cant be tishys  the things simple enoughits mothers  simple vanderbank laughed i like you and may i ask if youve read the remarkable work  oh yes then she wonderfully said for tishy  to see if it would do  ive often done that the girl returned  and she takes your word  generally i think i remember she did that time  and read the confounded thing  oh no said nanda  he looked at her a moment longer youre too particular he rather oddly sounded turning away with it to meet mr longdon    ii  when after dinner the company was restored to the upper rooms the duchess was on her feet as soon as the door opened for the entrance of the gentlemen then it might have been seen that she had a purpose for as soon as the elements had again with a due amount of the usual shuffling and mismatching been mixed her case proved the first to have been settled she had got mr longdon beside her on a sofa that was just right for two ive seized you without a scruple she frankly said for there are things i want to say to you as well as very particularly to ask more than anything else of course i want again to thank you  no collapse of mr longdons was ever incompatible with his sitting well forward again  do you look so blank she demanded because youve really forgotten the gratitude i expressed to you when you were so good as to bring nanda up for aggies marriageor because you dont think it a matter i should trouble myself to return to how can i help it she went on without waiting for his answer if i see your hand in everything that has happened since the so interesting talk i had with you last summer at mertle there have been times when ive really thought of writing to you ive even had a bold bad idea of proposing myself to you for a sunday then the crisis my momentary alarm has struck me as blowing over and ive felt i could wait for some luck like this which would sooner or later come her companion however appeared to leave the luck so on her hands that she could only snatch up to cover its nudity the next handsomest assumption i see you cleverly guess that what ive been worried about is the effect on mrs brook of the loss of her dear mitchy if youve not at all events had your own impression of this effect isnt that only because these last months youve seen so little of her ive seen said the duchess enough and to spare she waited as if for her vision on this to be flashed back at her but the only result of her speech was that her friend looked hard at somebody else it was just this symptom indeed that perhaps sufficed her for in a minute she was again afloat things have turned out so much as i desire them that i should really feel wicked not to have a humble heart theres a quarter indeed she added with a noble unction to which i dont fear to say for myself that no day and no night pass without my showing it however you english i know dont like one to speak of ones religion im just as simply thankful for minei mean with as little sense of indecency or agony about itas i am for my health or my carriage my point is at any rate that i say in no cruel spirit of triumph yet do none the less very distinctly say that the person mr mitchetts marriage has inevitably pleased least may be now rather to be feared these words had the sound of a climax and she had brought them out as if with her duty done to leave them but something that took place for her eye in the face mr longdon had halfaverted gave her after an instant what he might have called her second wind oh i know you think she always has been but youve exaggeratedas to that and i dont say that even at present its anything we shant get the better of only we must keep our heads we must remember that from her own point of view she has her grievance and we must at least look as if we trusted her that you know is what youve never quite done  he gave out a murmur of discomfort which produced in him a change of position and the sequel to the change was that he presently accepted from his cushioned angle of the sofa the definite support it could offer if his eyes moreover had not met his companions they had been brought by the hand he repeatedly and somewhat distressfully passed over them closer to the question of which of the alien objects presented to his choice it would cost him least to profess to handle what he had already paid a spectator would easily have gathered from the long the suppressed wriggle that had ended in his falling back was some sacrifice of his habit of not privately depreciating those to whom he was publicly civil it was plain however that when he presently spoke his thought had taken a stretch im sure ive fully intended to be everything thats proper but i dont think mr vanderbank cares for her  it kindled in the duchess an immediate light vous avez bien de lesprit you put one at ones ease ive been vaguely groping while youre already there its really only for nanda he cares  yesreally  the duchess debated and yet exactly how much  i havent asked him  she had another a briefer pause dont you think it about time you should once more she waited then seemed to feel her opportunity wouldnt weve worked a bit together but you dont take me into your confidence i dare say you dont believe im quite straight dont you really see how i must be she had a pleading note which made him at last more consentingly face her dont you see she went on with the advantage of it that having got all i want for myself i havent a motive in the world for spoiling the fun of another i dont want in the least i assure you to spoil even mrs brooks for how will she get a bit less out of himi mean than she does nowif what you desire should take place honestly my dear man thats quite what i desire and i only want over and above to help you what i feel for nanda believe me is pure pity i wont say im frantically grateful to her because in the long runone way or anothershell have found her account it nevertheless worries me to see her and all the more because of this very certitude which youve so kindly just settled for me that our young man hasnt really with her mother  whatever the certitude mr longdon had kindly settled it was in another interest that he at this moment broke in is he your young man too  she was not too much amused to cast about her  arent such marked ornaments of life a little the property of all who admire and enjoy them  you enjoy him mr longdon asked in the same straightforward way  immensely  his silence for a little seemed the sign of a plan what is it he hasnt done with mrs brook  well the thing that would be the complication he hasnt gone beyond a certain point you may ask how one knows such matters but im afraid ive not quite a receipt for it a woman knows but she cant tell they havent done as its called anything wrong  mr longdon frowned it would be extremely horrid if they had  ah but for you and me who know life it isnt that thatif other things had made for itwould have prevented as it happens however weve got off easily she doesnt speak to him  she had forms he could only take up speak to him  why as much as she would have liked to be able to believe  then wheres the danger of which you appear to wish to warn me  just in her feeling in the case as most women would feel you see she did what she could for her daughter she did im bound to say as that sort of thing goes among you people a good deal she treasured up she nursed along mitchy whom she would also though of course not so much have liked herself nanda could have kept him on with a word becoming thereby so much the less accessible for your plan that would have thoroughly obliged her mother but your little english girls in these altered timesoh i know how you feel themdont stand on such trifles andeven if you think it odd of mei cant defend myself though ive so directly profited against a certain compassion also for mrs brooks upset as a goodnatured woman i feel in short for both of them i deplore all round whats after all a rather sad relation only as i tell you nandas the one i naturally say to myself for me now most to think of if i dont assume too much that is that you dont suffer by my freedom  mr longdon put by with a mere drop of his eyes the question of his suffering there was so clearly for him an issue more relevant what do you know of my plan  why my dear man havent i told you that ever since mertle ive made out your hand what on earth for other people can your action look like but an adoption  ofahim  youre delightful ofaher if it does come to the same thing for you so much the better that at any rate is what were all taking it for and mrs brook herself en tete she seesthrough your generositynandas life more or less at the worst arranged for and thats just what gives her a good conscience  if mr longdon breathed rather hard it seemed to show at least that he followed what does she want of a good conscience  from under her high tiara an instant she almost looked down at him ah you do hate her  he coloured but held his ground dont you tell me yourself shes to be feared  yes and watched butif possiblewith amusement  amusement mr longdon faintly gasped  look at her now his friend went on with an indication that was indeed easy to embrace separated from them by the width of the room mrs brook was though placed in profile fully presented the satisfaction with which she had lately sunk upon a light gilt chair marked itself as superficial and was moreover visibly not confirmed by the fact that vanderbanks highperched head arrested before her in a general survey of opportunity kept her eyes too far above the level of talk their companions were dispersed some in the other room and for the occupants of the duchesss sofa they made as a couple in communion a picture framed and detached vaguely reduplicated in the high polish of the french floor she is tremendously pretty the duchess appeared to drop this as a plea for indulgence and to be impelled in fact by the interlocutors silence to carry it further ive never at all thought you know that nanda touches her  mr longdon demurred do you mean for beauty  his friend for his simplicity discriminated ah theyve neither of them beauty thats not a word to make free with but the mother has grace  and the daughter hasnt  not a line you answer me of course when i say that you answer me with your adored lady julia and will want to know what then becomes of the lucky resemblance i quite grant you that lady julia must have had the thing we speak of but that dear sweet blessed thing is very much the same lost secret as the dear sweet blessed other thing that went away with itthe decent leisure that for the most part weve also seen the last of its the thing at any rate that poor nanda and all her kind have most effectually got rid of oh if youd trust me a little more youd see that im quite at one with you on all the changes for the worse i bear up but im old enough to have known all the same mrs brook has somethingsay what you likewhen she bends that little brown head dieu sait comme elle se coiffe but what she gets out of it only look  mr longdon conveyed in an indescribable manner that he had retired to a great distance yet even from this position he must have launched a glance that arrived at a middle way they both know youre watching them  and dont they know you are poor mr van has a consciousness  so should i if two terrible women  were admiring you both at once the duchess folded the big feathered fan that had partly protected their vision well she poor dear cant help it she wants him herself  at the drop of the duchesss fan he restored his nippers and he doesntnot a bitwant her  there it is she has put down her money as it were without a return she has given mitchy up and got nothing instead  there was delicacy yet there was distinctness in mr longdons reserve do you call me nothing  the duchess at this fairly swelled with her happy stare then it is an adoption she forbore to press however she only went on it isnt a question my dear man of what i call it you dont make love to her  dear me said mr longdon what would she have had  that could be more charming you mean than your famous loyalty oh caro mio she wants it straighter but i shock you his companion quickly added  the manner in which he firmly rose was scarce a denial yet he stood for a moment in place what after all can she do  she can keep mr van  mr longdon wondered where  i mean till its too late she can work on him  but how  covertly again the duchess had followed the effect of her friends perceived movement on mrs brook who also got up she gave a rap with her fan on his leg sit downyoull see    iii  he mechanically obeyed her although it happened to lend him the air of taking mrs brooks approach for a signal to resume his seat she came over to them vanderbank followed and it was without again moving with a vague upward gape in fact from his place that mr longdon received as she stood before him a challenge of a sort to flash a point into what the duchess had just said why do you hate me so  vanderbank who beside mrs brook looked at him with attention might have suspected him of turning a trifle pale though even vanderbank with reasons of his own for an observation of the sharpest could scarce have read into the matter the particular dim vision that would have accounted for itthe flicker of fear of what mrs brook whether as daughter or as mother was at last so strangely and differently to show herself  i should warn you sir the young man threw off how little we consider thatin buckingham crescent certainlya fair question it isnt playing the gameits hitting below the belt we hate and we lovethe latter especially but to tell each other why is to break that little tacit rule of finding out for ourselves which is the delight of our lives and the source of our triumphs you can say you know if you like but youre not obliged  mr longdon transferred to him something of the same colder apprehension looking at him manifestly harder than ever before and finding in his eyes also no doubt a consciousness more charged he presently got up but without answering vanderbank fixed again mrs brook to whom he echoed without expression hate you  the next moment while he remained in presence with vanderbank mrs brook was pointing out her meaning to him from the cushioned corner he had quitted why when you come back to town you come straight as it were here  ah whats that the duchess asked in his interest but to follow nanda as closely as possible or at any rate to keep well with her  mrs brook however had no ear for this plea and when i coming here too and thinking only of my chance to meet you do my very sweetest to catch your eye youre entirely given up  to trying of course the duchess broke in afresh to keep well with me  mrs brook now had a smile for her ah that takes precautions then that i shall perhaps fail of if i too much interrupt your conversation  isnt she nice to me the duchess asked of mr longdon when i was in the very act of praising her to the skies  their interlocutors reply was not too rapid to anticipate mrs brook herself my dear jane that only proves his having reached some extravagance in the other sense that you had in mere decency to match the truth is probably in the meanisnt that what they call itbetween you dont you now take him away she went on to vanderbank who had glanced about for some better accommodation  he immediately pushed forward the nearest chair which happened to be by the duchesss side of the sofa will you sit here sir  if youll stay to protect me  that was really what i brought him over to you for mrs brook said while mr longdon took his place and vanderbank looked out for another seat but i didnt know she observed with her sweet free curiosity that he called you sir she often made discoveries that were fairly childlike he has done it twice  isnt that only your inevitable english surprise the duchess demanded at the civility quite the commonest in other societiesso that one has to come here to find it regarded in the way of ceremony as the very end of the world  oh mr longdon remarked its a word i rather like myself even to employ to others  i always ask here the duchess continued to him what word theyve got instead and do you know what they tell me  mrs brook wondered then again before he was ready charmingly suggested our pretty manner quickly too she appealed to mr longdon is that what you miss from me  he wondered however more than mrs brook your pretty manner  well these grand old forms that the duchess is such a mistress of mrs brook had with this one of her eagerest visions did mamma say sir to you ought i do you really get it in private out of nanda she has such depths of discretion she explained to the duchess and to vanderbank who had come back with his chair that its just the kind of racy anecdote she never in the world gives me  mr longdon looked across at van placed now after a moments talk with tishy in sight of them all by mrs brooks arm of the sofa you havent protectedyouve only exposed me  oh theres no joy without dangermrs brook took it up with spirit perhaps one should even say theres no danger without joy  vanderbanks eyes had followed mrs grendon after his brief passage with her terminated by some need of her listless presence on the other side of the room what do you say then on that theory to the extraordinary gloom of our hostess her safety by such a rule must be deep  the duchess was this time the first to know what they said the expression of tishys face comes precisely from our comparing it so unfavourably with that of her poor sister carrie who though she isnt here tonight with the cashmoresamazing enough even as coming without thathas so often shown us that an ame en peine constantly tottering but as nanda guarantees us usually recovering may look after all as beatific as a dutch doll  mrs brooks eyes had on tishys passing away taken the same course as vanderbanks whom she had visibly not neglected moreover while the pair stood there i give you carrie as you know and i throw mr cashmore in but im lost in admiration tonight as i always have been of the way tishy makes her ugliness serve i should call it if the word werent so for ladiesmaids the most elegant thing i know  my dear child the duchess objected what you describe as making her ugliness serve is what i should describe as concealing none of her beauty theres nothing the matter surely with elegant as applied to tishy save that as commonly used it refers rather to a charm thats artificial than to a state of pure nature there should be for elegance a basis of clothing nanda rather stints her  mrs brook perhaps more than usually thoughtful just discriminated there is i think one little place ill speak to her  to tishy vanderbank asked  oh that would do no good to nanda all the same she continued its an awfully superficial thing of you not to see that her drearinesson which moreover ive set you right beforeis a mere facial accident and doesnt correspond or as they say rhyme to anything within her that might make it a little interesting what i like it for is just that its so funny in itself her low spirits are nothing more than her features her gloom as you call it is merely her broken nose  has she a broken nose mr longdon demanded with an accent that for some reason touched in the others the spring of laughter  has nanda never mentioned it mrs brook profited by this gaiety to ask  thats the discretion you just spoke of said the duchess only i should have expected from the cause you refer to rather the comic effect  mrs grendons broken nose sir vanderbank explained to mr longdon is only the kinder way taken by these ladies to speak of mrs grendons broken heart you must know all about that  oh yesall mr longdon spoke very simply with the consequence this time on the part of his companions of a silence of some minutes which he himself had at last to break mr grendon doesnt like her the addition of these words apparently made the differenceas if they constituted a fresh link with the irresistible comedy of things that he was unexpectedly diverting was however no check to mr longdons delivering his full thought very horrid of two sisters to be both in their marriages so wretched  ah but tishy i maintain mrs brook returned isnt wretched at all if i were satisfied that shes really so id never let nanda come to her  thats the most extraordinary doctrine love the duchess interposed when youre satisfied a womans really poor you never give her a crust  do you call nanda a crust duchess vanderbank amusedly asked  shes all at any rate apparently just now that poor tishy has to live on  youre severe then the young man said on our dinner of tonight  oh jane mrs brook declared is never severe shes only uncontrollably witty its only tishy moreover who gives out that her husband doesnt like her he poor man doesnt say anything of the sort  yes but after all you knowvanderbank just put it to herwhere the deuce all the while is he  heaven forbid the duchess remarked that we should too rashly ascertain  there it isexactly mr longdon subjoined  he had once more his success of hilarity though not indeed to the injury of the duchesss next word its nanda you know who speaks and loud enough for harry grendons dislikes  thats easy for her mrs brook declared when she herself isnt one of them  she isnt surely one of anybodys mr longdon gravely observed  mrs brook gazed across at him you are too dear but ive none the less a crow to pick with you  mr longdon returned her look but returned it somehow to van you frighten me you know out of my wits  i do said vanderbank  mr longdon just hesitated yes  it must be the sacred terror mrs brook suggested to van that mitchy so often speaks of im not trying with you she went on to mr longdon for anything of that kind but only for the short halfhour in private that i think you wont for the world grant me nothing will induce you to find yourself alone with me  why what on earth vanderbank asked do you suspect him of supposing you want to do  oh it isnt that mrs brook sadly said  it isnt what laughed the duchess  that he fears i may want in any way towhat do you call itmake up to him she spoke as if she only wished it had been he has a deeper thought  well then what in goodness is it the duchess pressed  mr longdon had said nothing more but mrs brook preferred none the less to treat the question as between themselves she was as the others said wonderful you cant help thinking meshe spoke to him straightrather tortuous the pause she thus momentarily produced was so intense as to give a sharpness that was almost vulgar to the little oh by which it was presently broken and the source of which neither of her three companions could afterwards in the least have named neither would have endeavoured to fix an infelicity of which each doubtless had been but too capable its only as a mother she added that i want my chance  but the duchess was at this again in the breach take it for mercys sake then my dear over harold whos an example to nanda herself in the way that behind the piano there hes keeping it up with lady fanny  if this had been a herring that in the interest of peace the duchess had wished to draw across the scent it could scarce have been more effective mrs brook whose position had made just the difference that she lost the view of the other side of the piano took a slight but immediate stretch is harold with lady fanny  you ask it my dear child said the duchess as if it were too grand to be believed its the note of eagerness she went on for mr longdons benefitits almost the note of hope one of those that ces messieurs that we all in fact delight in and find so matchless she desires for harold the highest advantages  well then declared vanderbank who had achieved a glimpse hes clearly having them it brings home to one his success  his success is true mrs brook insisted how he does it i dont know  oh dont you trumpeted the duchess  hes amazing mrs brook pursued i watchi hold my breath but im bound to say also i rather admire he somehow amuses them  shes as pleased as punch said the duchess  those great calm womenthey like slighter creatures  the great calm whales the duchess laughed swallow the little fishes  oh my dear mrs brook returned harold can be tasted if you like  if i like the duchess parenthetically jeered thank you love  but he cant i think be eaten it all works out mrs brook expounded to the highest end if lady fannys amused shell be quiet  bless me cried the duchess of all the immoral speeches i put it to you longdon does she meanshe appealed to their friendthat if she commits murder she wont commit anything else  oh it wont be murder said mrs brook i mean that if harold in one way and another keeps her along she wont get off  off where mr longdon risked  vanderbank immediately informed him to one of the smaller italian towns dont you know  oh yes likewho is it i forget  anna karenine you know about anna  nanda said the duchess has told him but i thought she went on to mrs brook that lady fanny by this time must have gone  petherton then mrs brook returned doesnt keep you au courant  the duchess blandly wondered i seem to remember he had positively said so and that she had come back  because this looks so like a fresh start no we know you assume besides mrs brook asked that mr cashmore would have received her again  the duchess fixed a little that gentleman and his actual companion what will you have he mightnt have noticed  oh youre out of step duchess vanderbank said we used all to march abreast but were falling to pieces its all saving your presence mitchys marriage  ah mrs brook concurred how thoroughly i feel that oh i knew the spells broken the harp has lost a string were not the same thing hes not the same thing  frankly my dear the duchess answered i dont think that you personally are either  oh as for thatwhich is what matters leastwe shall perhaps see with which mrs brook turned again to mr longdon i havent explained to you what i meant just now we want nanda  mr longdon stared at home again  in her little old nook you must give her back  do you mean altogether  ah that will be for you in a manner to arrange but youve had her practically these five months and with no desire to be unreasonable we yet have our natural feelings  this interchange to which circumstances somehow gave a high effect of suddenness and strangeness was listened to by the others in a quick silence that was like the sense of a blast of cold air though with the difference between the spectators that vanderbank attached his eyes hard to mrs brook and that the duchess looked as straight at mr longdon to whom clearly she wished to convey that if he had wondered a short time before how mrs brook would do it he must now be quite at his ease he indulged in fact after this ladys last words in a pause that might have signified some of the fulness of a new light he only said very quietly i thought you liked it  at this his neighbour broke in the care you take of the child they do the duchess as she spoke became aware of the nearer presence of edward brookenham who within a minute had come in from the other room and her decision of character leaped forth in her quick signal to him edward will tell you he was already before their semicircle do you dear she appealed want nanda back from mr longdon  edward plainly could be trusted to feel in his quiet way that the oracle must be a match for the priestess want her jane we wouldnt take her and as if knowing quite what he was about he looked at his wife only after he had spoken    iv  his reply had complete success to which there could scarce have afterwards been a positive denial that some sound of amusement even from mr longdon himself had in its degree contributed certain it was that mrs brook found as she exclaimed that her husband was always so awfully civil just the right note of resigned understanding whereupon he for a minute presented to them blankly enough his fine dead face civil is just what i was afraid i wasnt i mean you know he continued to mr longdon that you really mustnt look to us to let you off  from a week or a daymr longdon took him upof the time to which you consider ive pledged myself my dear sir please dont imagine its for me the duchess appeals  its from your wife you delicious dull man that lady elucidated if you wished to be stiff with our friend here youve really been so with her which comes no doubt from the absence between you of proper preconcerted action you spoke without your cue  oh said edward brookenham  thats it janemrs brook continued to take it beautifully we dressed today in a hurry and hadnt time for our usual rehearsal edward when we dine out generally brings three pockethandkerchiefs and six jokes i leave the management of the handkerchiefs to his own taste but we mostly try together in advance to arrange a career for the other things its some charming light thing of my own thats supposed to give him the sign  only sometimes he confoundsvanderbank helped her outyour light and your heavy he had got up to make room for his host of so many occasions and having forced him into the empty chair now moved vaguely off to the quarter of the room occupied by nanda and mr cashmore  thats very well the duchess resumed but it doesnt at all clear you cara mia of the misdemeanour of setting up as a felt domestic need something of which edward proves deeply unconscious he has put his finger on nandas true interest he doesnt care a bit how it would look for you to want her  dont you mean rather jane how it looks for us not to want her mrs brook amended with a detachment now complete of course dear old friend she continued to mr longdon she quite puts me with my back to the wall when she helps you to seewhat you otherwise mightnt guessthat edward and i work it out between us to show off as tender parents and yet to get from you everything youll give i do the sentimental and he the practical so that we after one fashion and another deck ourselves in the glory of our sacrifice without forfeiting the keep of our daughter this must appeal to you as another useful illustration of what london manners have come to unless indeed mrs brook prattled on it only strikes you still moreand to a degree that blinds you to its other possible bearingsas the last proof that im too tortuous for you to know what id be at  mr longdon faced her across his interval with his original terror represented now only by such a lingering flush as might have formed a natural tribute to a brilliant scene i havent the glimmering of an idea of what youd be at but please understand he added that i dont at all refuse you the private halfhour you referred to a while since  are you really willing to put the child up for the rest of the year edward placidly demanded speaking as if quite unaware that anything else had taken place  his wife fixed her eyes on him the ingenuity of your companions love plays in the air like the lightning but flashes round your head only by good fortune to leave it unscathed still you have after all your own strange wit and im not sure that any of ours ever compares with it only confronted also with ours how can poor mr longdon really choose which of the two hell meet  poor mr longdon now looked hard at edward oh mr brookenhams i feel any day its even with you i confess he said to him that id rather have that private halfhour  done mrs brook declared ill send him to you but we have you know as van says gone to pieces she went on twisting her pretty head and tossing it back over her shoulder to an auditor of whose approach to her from behind though it was impossible she should have seen him she had visibly within a minute become aware its your marriage mitchy that has darkened our old bright air changed us more than we even yet know and most grossly and horribly my dear man changed you you steal up in a way that gives one the creeps whereas in the good time thats gone you always burst in with music and song go round where i can see you i maynt love you now but at least i suppose i may look at you direct your energies she pursued while mitchy obeyed her as much as possible please against our uncanny chill pile on the fire and close up the ranks this was our best hour you knowand all the more that tishy i see is getting rid of her superfluities here comes back old van she wound up vanquished i judge in the attempt to divert nanda from her prey wont nanda sit with poor us she asked of vanderbank who now meeting mitchy in range of the others remained standing with him and as at her commands  i didnt of course ask her the young man replied  then what did you do  i only took a little walk  mrs brook on this was woeful at mitchy see then what weve come to when did we ever walk in your time save as a distinct part of the effect of our good things please return to nanda she said to vanderbank and tell her i particularly wish her to come in for this delightful evenings end  shes joining us of herself now the duchess noted and sos mr cashmore and sos tishyvoyezwho has kept onbless her little bare backno one she oughtnt to keep as nobody else will now arrive it would be quite cosey if she locked the door  but what on earth my dear jane mrs brook plaintively wondered are you proposing we should do  mrs brook in her apprehension had looked expressively at their friends but the eye of the duchess wandered no further than harold and lady fanny it would perhaps serve to keep that pair a little longer from escaping together  mrs brook took a pause no greater but wouldnt it be as regards another pair locking the stabledoor afterwhat do you call it dont petherton and aggie appear already to have escaped together mitchy man where in the worlds your wife  i quite grant you said the duchess gaily that my niece is wherever petherton is this im sure of for theres a friendship if you please that has not been interrupted pethertons not gone is he she asked in her turn of mitchy  but again before he could speak it was taken up mitchys silent mitchys altered mitchys queer mrs brook proclaimed while the new recruits to the circle tishy and nanda and mr cashmore lady fanny and harold too after a minute and on perceiving the movement of the others ended by enlarging it with mutual accommodation and aid to a pleasant talkative ring in which the subject of their companions demonstration on a low ottoman and glaring in his odd way in almost all directions at once formed the conspicuous attractive centre tishy was nearest mr longdon and nanda still flanked by mr cashmore between that gentleman and his wife who had harold on her other side edward brookenham was neighboured by his son and by vanderbank who might easily have felt himself in spite of their separation and given as it happened their places in the group rather publicly confronted with mr longdon is his wife in the other room mrs brook now put to tishy  tishy after a stare about recovered the acuter consciousness to account for this guest oh yesshes playing with him  but with whom dear  why with petherton i thought you knew  knew theyre playing mrs brook was almost socratic  the missus is regularly wound up her husband meanwhile without resonance observed to vanderbank  brilliant indeed vanderbank replied  but shes rather naughty you know edward after a pause continued  oh fiendish his interlocutor said with a short smothered laugh that might have represented for a spectator a sudden start at such a flash of analysis from such a quarter  when vanderbanks attention at any rate was free again their hostess assisted to the transition was describing the play as she had called it of the absentees she has hidden a book and hes trying to find it  hide and seek why isnt it innocent mitch mrs brook exclaimed  mitchy speaking for the first time faced her with extravagant gloom do you really think so  thats her innocence the duchess laughed to him  and dont you suppose he has found it yet mrs brook pursued earnestly to tishy isnt it something we might all play at if on which however abruptly checking herself she changed her note nanda love please go and invite them to join us  mitchy at this on his ottoman wheeled straight round to the girl who looked at him before speaking ill go if mitchy tells me  but if he does fear said her mother that there may be something in it  mitchy jerked back to mrs brook well you see i dont want to give way to my fear suppose there should be something let me not know  she dealt with him tenderly i see you couldntso soonbear it  ah but savezvous the duchess interposed with some majesty youre horrid  let them alone mitchy continued we dont want at all events a general romp  oh i thought just that said mrs brook was what the duchess wished the door locked for perhaps moreovershe returned to tishyhe hasnt yet found the book  he cant tishy said with simplicity  but why in the world  you see shes sitting on ittishy felt it was plain the responsibility of explanation so that unless he pulls her off  he cant compass his desperate end ah i hope he wont pull her off mrs brook wonderfully murmured it was said in a manner that stirred the circle and unanimous laughter seemed already to have crowned her invocation lately uttered to the social spirit but what in the world she pursued is the book selected for such a position i hope its not a very big one  oh arent the books that are sat upon mr cashmore freely speculated as a matter of course the bad ones  not a bit as a matter of course harold as freely replied to him they sit all round nowadaysi mean in the papers and placeson some awfully good stuff why i myself read books that i couldntupon my honour i wouldnt risk itread out to you here  what a pity his father dropped with the special shade of dryness that was all edwards own what a pity you havent got one of your favourites to try on us  harold looked about as if it might have been after all a happy thought well nandas the only girl  and ones sister doesnt count said the duchess  its just because the things bad tishy resumed for mrs brooks more particular benefit that lord pethertons trying to wrest it  mrs brooks pale interest deepened then its a real handtohand struggle  he says she shant read itshe says she will  ah thats becauseisnt it jane mrs brook appealedhe so long overlooked and advised her in those matters doesnt he feel by this timeso awfully clever as he isthe extraordinary way she has come out  by this time harold echoed dearest mummy youre too sweet its only about ten weeksisnt it mitch you dont mind my saying that i hope he solicitously added  mitchy had his back to him and bending it a little sat with head dropped and knees pressing his hands together i dont mind any ones saying anything  lord are you already past that harold sociably laughed  he used to vibrate to everything my dear man what is the matter mrs brook demanded does it all move too fast for you  mercy on us what are you talking about thats what i want to know mr cashmore vivaciously declared  well she has gone at a paceif mitchy doesnt mind harold interposed in the tone of tact and taste but then dont they alwaysi mean when theyre like aggie and they once get loosego at a pace thats what i want to know i dont suppose mother did nor tishy nor the duchess he communicated to the rest but mother and tishy and the duchess it strikes me must either have been of the school that knew dont you know a deuce of a deal before or of the type that takes it all more quietly after  i think a woman can only speak for herself i took it all quietly enough both before and after said mrs brook then she addressed to mr cashmore with a small formal nod one of her lovely wan smiles what im talking about sil vous plait is marriage  i wonder if you know the duchess broke out on this how silly you all sound when did it ever in any society that could call itself decently good not make a difference that an innocent young creature a flower tended and guarded should find from one day to the other her whole consciousness changed people pull long faces and look wonderful looks and punch each other in your english fashion in the sides and say to each other in corners that my poor darling has come out je crois bien she has come out i married heri dont mind saying it nowexactly that she should come out and i should be mightily ashamed of every one concerned if she hadnt i didnt marry her i give you to believe that she should stay in and if any of you think to frighten mitchy with it i imagine youll do so as little as you frighten me if it has taken her a very short timeas harold so vividly puts itto which of you did i ever pretend i should like to know that it would take her a very long one i dare say there are girls it would have taken longer just as there are certainly others who wouldnt have required so much as an hour it surely isnt news to you that if some young persons among us all are very stupid and others very wise my dear child was never either but only perfectly bred and deliciously clever ah thatrather if shes so clever that you dont know what to do with her its scarcely her fault but add to it that mitchys very kind and you have the whole thing what more do you want  mrs brook who looked immensely struck replied with the promptest sympathy yet as if there might have been an alternative i dont thinkand her eyes appealed to the othersthat we want any more do we than the whole thing  gracious i should hope not her husband remarked as privately as before to vanderbank janefor a mixed companydoes go into it  vanderbank for a minute and with a special short arrest took in the circle should you call us mixed theres only one girl  edward brookenham glanced at his daughter yes but i wish there were more  do you and vanderbanks laugh at this odd view covered for a little the rest of the talk but when he again began to follow no victory had yet been snatched  it was mrs brook naturally who rattled the standard when you say dearest that we dont know what to do with aggies cleverness do you quite allow for the way we bow down before it and worship it i dont quite see what else wein herecan do with it even though we have gathered that just over there pethertons finding for it a different application we can only each in our way do our best dont therefore succumb jane to the delusive harm of a grievance there would be nothing in it you havent got one the beauty of the life that so many of us have so long led togetherand she showed that it was for mr longdon she more particularly brought this outis precisely that nobody has ever had one nobody has dreamed of itit would have been such a rough false note a note of violence out of all keeping did you ever hear of one van did you my poor mitchy but you see for yourselves she wound up with a sigh and before either could answer how inferior weve become when we have even in our defence to assert such things  mitchy who for a while past had sat gazing at the floor now raised his good natural goggles and stretched his closed mouth to its widest oh i think were pretty good still he then replied  mrs brook indeed appeared after a pause and addressing herself again to tishy to give a reluctant illustration of it coming back as from an excursion of the shortest to the question momentarily dropped im bound to sayall the more you knowthat i dont quite see what aggie maynt now read suddenly however her look at their informant took on an anxiety is the book you speak of something very awful  mrs grendon with so much these past minutes to have made her so was at last visibly more present thats what lord petherton says of it from what he knows of the author  so that he wants to keep her  well from trying it first i think he wants to see if its good for her  thats one of the most charming soins i think the duchess said that a gentleman may render a young woman to whom he desires to be useful i wont say that petherton always knows how good a book may be but id trust him any day to say how bad  mr longdon who had sat throughout silent and still quitted his seat at this and evidently in so doing gave mrs brook as much occasion as she required she also got up and her movement brought to her view at the door of the further room something that drew from her a quick exclamation he can tell us now thenfor here they come lord petherton arriving with animation and followed so swiftly by his young companion that she presented herself as pursuing him shook triumphantly over his head a small volume in blue paper there was a general movement at the sight of them and by the time they had rejoined their friends the company pushing back seats and causing a variety of mute expression smoothly to circulate was pretty well on its feet seehe has pulled her off said mrs brook little aggie to whom plenty of pearls were singularly becoming met it as pleasant sympathy yes and it was a real pull but of course she continued with the prettiest humour and as if mrs brook would quite understand from the moment one has a persons nails and almost his teeth in ones flesh  mrs brooks sympathy passed however with no great ease from aggies pearls to her other charms fixing the former indeed so markedly that harold had a quick word about it for lady fanny when poor mummy thinks you know that nanda might have had them  lady fannys attention for that matter had resisted them as little well i dare say that if i had wanted i might  lordcould you have stood him the young man returned but i believe women can stand anything he profoundly concluded his mother meanwhile recovering herself had begun to ejaculate on the prints in aggies arms and he was then diverted from the sense of what he personally as he would have said couldnt have stood by a glance at lord pethertons trophy for which he made a prompt grab the bone of contention lord petherton had let it go and harold remained arrested by the cover why blest if it hasnt vans name  vanshis mother was near enough to effect her own snatch after which she swiftly faced the proprietor of the volume dear man its the last thing you lent me but i dont think she added turning to tishy that i ever passed such a production on to you  it was just seeing mr vans hand aggie conscientiously explained that made me think one was free  but it isnt mr vans handmrs brook quite smiled at the error she thrust the book straight at mr longdon is that mr vans hand  holding the disputed object which he had put on his nippers to glance at he presently without speaking looked over these aids straight at nanda who looked as straight back at him it was i who wrote mr vans name the girls eyes were on mr longdon but her words as for the company i brought the book here from buckingham crescent and left it by accident in the other room  by accident my dear her mother replied i do quite hope but what on earth did you bring it for its too hideous  nanda seemed to wonder is it she murmured  then you havent read it  she just hesitated one hardly knows now i think what is and what isnt  she brought it only for me to read tishy gravely interposed  mrs brook looked strange nanda recommended it  oh nothe contrary tishy as if scared by so much publicity floundered a little she only told me  the awful subject mrs brook wailed  there was so deepening an echo of the drollery of this last passage that it was a minute before vanderbank could be heard saying the responsibilitys wholly mine for setting the beastly thing in motion still he added goodhumouredly and as to minimise if not the cause at least the consequence i think i agree with nanda that its no worse than anything else  mrs brook had recovered the volume from mr longdons relaxed hand and now without another glance at it held it behind her with an unusual air of firmness oh how can you say that my dear man of anything so revolting  the discussion kept them for the instant well face to face then did you read it  she debated jerking the book into the nearest empty chair where mr cashmore quickly pounced on it wasnt it for that you brought it me she demanded yet before he could answer she again challenged her child have you read this work nanda  yes mamma  oh i say cried mr cashmore hilarious and turning the leaves  mr longdon had by this time ceremoniously approached tishy goodnight     book ninth vanderbank    i  i think you had better wait mrs brook said till i see if he has gone and on the arrival the next moment of the servants with the tea she was able to put her question is mr cashmore still with miss brookenham  no maam the footman replied i let mr cashmore out five minutes ago  vanderbank showed for the next short time by his behaviour what he felt at not yet being free to act on this moving pointlessly about the room while the servants arranged the teatable and taking no trouble to make for appearance any other talk mrs brook on her side took so little that the silencewhich their temporary companions had all the effect of keeping up by conscious dawdlingbecame precisely one of those precious lights for the circle belowstairs which people fondly fancy they have not kindled when they have not spoken but vanderbank spoke again as soon as the door was closed does he run in and out that way without even speaking to you  mrs brook turned away from the fire that late in may was the only charm of the crude cold afternoon one would like to draw the curtains wouldnt one and gossip in the glow of the hearth  oh gossip vanderbank wearily said as he came to her pretty table  in the act of serving him she checked herself you wouldnt rather have it with her  he balanced a moment does she have a tea of her own  do you mean to say you dont knowmrs brook asked it with surprise such ignorance of what i do for her does tell i think the tale of how youve lately treated us  in not coming for so long  for more weeks for more months than i can count scarcely sincewhen was itthe end of january that night of tishys dinner  yes that awful night  awful you call it  awful  well the time without you mrs brook returned has been so bad that im afraid ive lost the impression of anything before then she offered the tea to his choice will you have it upstairs  he received the cup yes and here too after which he said nothing again till first pouring in milk to cool it he had drunk his tea down thats not literally true you know i have been in  yes but always with other peopleyou managed it somehow the wrong ones it hasnt counted  ah in one way and another i think everything counts and you forget ive dined  ohfor once  the once you asked me so dont spoil the beauty of your own behaviour by mistimed reflexions youve been as usual superior  ah but there has been no beauty in it there has been nothing mrs brook went on but bare bleak recognition the curse of my hideous intelligence weve fallen to pieces and at least im not such a fool as not to have felt it in time from the moment one did feel it why should one insist on vain forms if you felt it and were so ready to drop them my part was what it has always beento accept the inevitable we shall never grow together again the smash was too great  vanderbank for a little said nothing then at last you ought to know how great  whatever had happened her lovely look here survived it i  the smash he replied was indeed as complete i think as your intention each of the pieces testifies to your success five minutes did it  she appeared to wonder where he was going but surely not my minutes where have you discovered that i made mitchys marriage  mitchys marriage has nothing to do with it  i see she had the old interest at least still at their service you think we might have survived that a new thought of it seemed to glimmer im bound to say mitchys marriage promises elements  you did it that night at mrs grendons he spoke as if he had not heard her it was a wonderful performance you pulled us downjust closing with each of the great columns in its turnas samson pulled down the temple i was at the time more or less bruised and buried and didnt in the agitation and confusion fully understand what had happened but i understand now  are you very sure mrs brook earnestly asked  well im stupid compared with you but you see ive taken my time ive puzzled it out ive lain awake on it all the more that ive had to do it all myselfwith the mitchys in italy and greece ive missed his aid  youll have it now mrs brook kindly said theyre coming back  and when do they arrive  any day i believe  has he written you  no said mrs brookthere it is thats just the way weve fallen to pieces but youll of course have heard something  never a word  ah then its complete  vanderbank thought a moment not quite is iti mean it wont be altogether unless he hasnt written to nanda  then has heshe was keen again  oh im assuming dont you know  how should i  this too he turned over just as a consequence of your having at tishys so abruptly and wonderfully tackled the question that a few days later as i afterwards gathered was to be crowned with a measure of success not yet exhausted why in other wordsif it was to know so little about her and to get no nearer to herdid you bring about nandas return  there was a clear reason her face said if she could only remember it why did i then as catching a light fancy your asking meat this time of day  ah you have noticed that i havent asked before however van promptly added i know well enough what you notice nanda hasnt mentioned to you whether or no she has heard  absolutely not but you dont suppose i take it that it was to pry into her affairs i called her in  vanderbank on this lighted for the first time with a laugh called her in how i like your expressions  i do then in spite of all she eagerly asked remind you a little of the bon temps ah she sighed i dont say anything good now but of course i see janethough not so often either its from jane ive heard of what she calls her young things it seems so odd to think of mitchy as a young thing hes as old as all time and his wife who the other day was about six is now practically about forty and i also saw petherton mrs brook added on his return  his return from where  why he was with them at corfu malta cyprusi dont know where yachting spending mitchys money larking he called iti dont know what he was with them for weeks  till jane you mean called him in  i think it must have been that  well thats better said van than if mitchy had had to call him out  oh mitchy mrs brook comprehensively sounded  her visitor quite assented isnt he amazing  unique  he had a short pause but whats she up to  it was apparently for mrs brook a question of such variety of application that she brought out experimentally jane  dear no i think weve fathomed jane havent we  well mused mrs brook im by no means sure i have just of late ive had a new sense  yes of what now van amusedly put it as she held the note  oh of depths below depths but poor janeof course after all shes human shes beside herself with one thing and another but she cant in any consistency show it she took her stand so on having with pethertons aid formed aggie for a femme charmante  that its too late to cry out that pethertons aid can now be dispensed with do you mean then that he is such a brute that after all mitchy has done for him vanderbank at the rising image pulled up in easy disgust  i think him quite capable of considering with a magnificent insolence of selfishness that what mitchy has most done will have been to make aggie accessible in a way thatfor decency and delicacy of course things on which petherton highly prides himselfshe could naturally not be as a girl her marriage has simplified it  vanderbank took it all in accessible is good  thenwhich was what i intended just nowaggie has already become so  mrs brook however could as yet in fairness only wonder thats just what im dying to see  her companion smiled at it even in our ashes live their wonted fires but what do you make in such a box of poor mitchy himself his marriage can scarcely to such an extent have simplified him  it was something none the less that mrs brook had to weigh i dont know i give it up the thing was of a strangeness  her friend also paused and it was as if for a little on either side of a gate on which they might have had their elbows they remained looking at each other over it and over what was unsaid between them it was rum he at last merely dropped  it was scarce for mrs brook all the sameshe seemed to feel after a momentto surround the matter with an excess of silence  he did what a man doesespecially in that businesswhen he doesnt do what he wants  do you mean what somebody else wanted  well what he himself didnt and if hes unhappy she went on hell know whom to pitch into  ah said vanderbank even if he is he wont be the man to what you might call vent it on her hell seek compensations elsewhere and wont mind any ridicule  whom are you speaking of as her mrs brook asked as on feeling that something in her face had made him stop i wasnt referring she explained to his wife  oh said vanderbank  aggie doesnt matter she went on  oh he repeated you meant the duchess he then threw off  dont be silly she rejoined he may not become unhappygod grant not she developed but if he does hell take it out of nanda  van appeared to challenge this take it out of her  well want to know as some american asked me the other day of somebody what shes going to do about it  vanderbank who had remained on his feet stood still at this for a longer time than at anything yet but what can she do  thats again just what im curious to see mrs brook then spoke with a glance at the clock but if you dont go up to her  my notion of seeing her alone may be defeated by her coming down on learning that im here he had taken out his watch ill go in a moment but as a light on that danger would you in the circumstances come down  mrs brook however could for light only look darkness oh you dont love me  vanderbank still with his watch stared then as an alternative at the fire you havent yet told me you know if mr cashmore now comes every day  my dear man how can i say youve just your occasion to find out  from her you mean  mrs brook hesitated unless you prefer the footman must i again remind you that with her own sittingroom and one of the men in addition to her maid wholly at her orders her independence is ideal  vanderbank who appeared to have been timing himself put up his watch im bound to say then that with separations so established i understand less than ever your unforgettable explosion  ah you come back to that she wearily asked and you find it with all youve to think about unforgettable  oh but there was a wild light in your eye  well mrs brook said you see it now quite gone out she had spoken more sadly than sharply but her impatience had the next moment a flicker i called nanda in because i wanted to  precisely but what i dont make out you see is what youve since gained by it  you mean she only hates me the more  vans impatience in the movement with which he turned from her had a flare still sharper you know im incapable of meaning anything of the sort  she waited a minute while his back was presented i sometimes think in effect that youre incapable of anything straightforward  vanderbanks movement had not been to the door but he almost reached it after giving her on this a hard look he then stopped short however to stare an instant still more fixedly into the hat he held in his hand the consequence of which in turn was that he the next minute stood again before her chair dont you call it straightforward of me just not to have come for so long  she had again to take time to say is that an allusion to whatby the loss of your beautiful presenceive failed to gain i dare say at any rateshe gave him no time to replythat you feel youre quite as straightforward as i and that were neither of us creatures of mere rash impulse there was a time in fact wasnt there when we rather enjoyed each others dim depths if i wanted to fawn on you she went on i might say that with such a comrade in obliquity to wind and double about with id risk losing myself in the mine but why retort or recriminate let us not for gods sake be vulgarwe havent yet bad as it is come to that i can be no doubti some day must be i feel it looming at me out of the awful future as an inevitable fate but let it be for when im old and horrible not an hour before i do want to live a little even yet so you ought to let me off easilyeven as i let you  oh i know said vanderbank handsomely that there are things you dont put to me you show a tact  there it is and i like much better mrs brook went on our speaking of it as delicacy than as duplicity if you understand its so much saved  what i always understand more than anything else he returned is the general truth that youre prodigious  it was perhaps a little as relapse from tension that she had nothing against that as for instance when it would be so easy  yes to take up what lies there you yet so splendidly abstain  you literally press upon me my opportunity its you who are splendid she rather strangely laughed  dont you at least want to say he went on with a slight flush what you most obviously and naturally might  appealed to on the question of underlying desire mrs brook went through the decent form of appearing to try to give it the benefit of any doubt dont i want you mean to find out before you go up what you want shall you be too disappointed she asked if i say that since i shall probably learn as we used to be told as children all in good time i can wait till the light comes out of itself  vanderbank still lingered you are deep  youve only to be deeper  thats easy to say im afraid at any rate you wont think i am he pursued after a pause if i ask you what in the worldsince harold does keep lady fanny so quietcashmore still requires nandas direction for  ah find out said mrs brook  isnt mrs donner quite shelved  find out she repeated  vanderbank had reached the door and had his hand on the latch but there was still something else you scarce suppose i imagine that she has come to like him for himself  find out and mrs brook who was now on her feet turned away he watched her a moment more then checked himself and left her    ii  she remained alone ten minutes at the end of which her reflexions would have been seen to be deepwere interrupted by the entrance of her husband the interruption was indeed not so great as if the couple had not met as they almost invariably met in silence she took at all events to begin with no more account of his presence than to hand him a cup of tea accompanied with nothing but cream and sugar her having no word for him however committed her no more to implying that he had come in only for his refreshment than it would have committed her to say here it is edward dearjust as you like it so take it and sit down and be quiet no spectator worth his salt could have seen them more than a little together without feeling how everything that under his eyes or not she either did or omitted rested on a profound acquaintance with his ways they formed edwards ways a chapter by themselves of which mrs brook was completely mistress and in respect to which the only drawback was that a part of her credit was by the nature of the case predestined to remain obscure so many of them were so queer that no one but she could know them and know thereby into what crannies her reckoning had to penetrate it was one of them for instance that if he was often most silent when most primed with matter so when he had nothing to say he was always silent tooa peculiarity misleading until mastered for a lady who could have allowed in the latter case for almost any variety of remark what do you think he said at last of his turning up today  of old vans  oh has he turned up  half an hour ago and asking almost in his first breath for nanda i sent him up to her and hes with her now if edward had his ways she had also some of her own one of which in talk with him if talk it could be called was never to produce anything till the need was marked she had thus a card or two always in reserve for it was her theory that she never knew what might happen it nevertheless did occur that he sometimes went as she would have called it one better  hes not with her now ive just been with her  then he didnt go up mrs brook was immensely interested he left me you know to do so  knowhow should i know i left her five minutes ago  then he went out without seeing her mrs brook took it in he changed his mind out there on the stairs  well said edward it wont be the first mind that has been changed there its about the only thing a man can change  do you refer particularly to my stairs she asked with her whimsical woe but meanwhile she had taken it in then whom were you speaking of  mr longdons coming to tea with her she has had a note  but when did he come to town  last night i believe the note an hour or two ago announced himbrought by hand and hoping shed be at home  mrs brook thought again im glad she is hes too sweet by handit must have been so he sent them to mamma he wouldnt for the world wire  oh nanda has often wired to him her father returned  then she ought to be ashamed of herself but how said mrs brook do you know  oh i know when were in a thing like this  yet you complain of her want of intimacy with you it turns out that youre as thick as thieves  edward looked at this charge as he looked at all old friends without a signto call a signof recognition i dont know of whose want of intimacy with me ive ever complained there isnt much more of it that i can see that any of them could put on what do you suppose id have them do if i on my side dont get very far i may have alluded to that  oh but you do mrs brook declared you think you dont but you get very far indeed youre always as i said just now bringing out something that youve got somewhere  yes and seeing you flare up at it what i bring out is only what they tell me  this limitation offered however for mrs brook no difficulty ah but it seems to me that with the things people nowadays tell one what more do you want  welland edward from his chair regarded the fire a whilethe difference must be in what they tell you  things that are better  yesworse i dare say he went on what i give them  isnt as bad as what i do oh we must each do our best but when i hear from you mrs brook pursued that nanda had ever permitted herself anything so dreadful as to wire to him it comes over me afresh that i would have been the perfect one to deal with him if his detestation of me hadnt prevented she was by this time alsobut on her feetbefore the fire into which like her husband she gazed i would never have wired id have gone in for little delicacies and odd things she has never thought of  oh she doesnt go in for what you do edward assented  shes as bleak as a chimneytop when the fires out and if it hadnt been after all for mamma and she lost herself again in the reasons of things  her husbands silence seemed to mark for an instant a deference to her allusion but there was a limit even to this combination you make your mother i think keep it up pretty well but if she hadnt as you say done so  why we shouldnt have been anywhere  well where are we now thats what i want to know  following her own train she had at first no heed for his question without his hatred he would have liked me but she came back with a sigh to the actual no matter we must deal with what weve got  what have we got edward continued  again with no ear for his question his wife turned away only however after taking a few vague steps to approach him with new decision if mr longdons due will you do me a favour will you go back to nandabefore he arrivesand let her know though not of course as from me that van has been here half an hour has had it put well before him that shes up there and at liberty and has left the house without seeing her  edward brookenham made no motion you dont like better to do it yourself  if i liked better said mrs brook id have already done it the way to make it not come from me is surely not for me to give it to her besides i want to be here to receive him first  then cant she know it afterwards  after mr longdon has gone the whole point is that she should know it in time to let him know it  edward still communed with the fire and whats the point of that her impatience which visibly increased carried her away again and by the time she reached the window he had launched another question are you in such a hurry she should know that van doesnt want her  what do you call a hurry when ive waited nearly a year nanda may know or not as she likesmay know whenever if she doesnt know pretty well by this time shes too stupid for it to matter my only pressures for mr longdon shell have it there for him when he arrives  you mean shell make haste to tell him  mrs brook raised her eyes a moment to some upper immensity shell mention it  her husband on the other hand his legs outstretched looked straight at the toes of his boots are you very sure then as he remained without an answer why should she if he hasnt told her  of the way i so long ago let you know that he had put the matter to van its not out between them in words no doubt but i fancy that for things to pass theyve not to dot their is quite so much my dear as we two without a syllable said to her shes yet aware in every fibre of her little being of what has taken place  edward gave a still longer space to taking this in poor little thing  does she strike you as so poor mrs brook asked with so awfully much done for her  done by whom  it was as if she had not heard the question that she spoke again she has got what every woman young or old wants  really  edwards tone was of wonder but she simply went on she has got a man of her own  well but if hes the wrong one  do you call mr longdon so very wrong i wish she declared with a strange sigh that i had had a mr longdon  i wish very much you had i wouldnt have taken it like van  oh it took van mrs brook replied to put them where they are  but where are they thats exactly it in these three months for instance edward demanded how has their connexion profited  mrs brook turned it over profited which  well one cares most for ones child  then she has become for him what weve most hoped her to bean object of compassion still more marked  is that what youve hoped her to be mrs brook was obviously so lucid for herself that her renewed expression of impatience had plenty of point how can you ask after seeing what i did  that night at mrs grendons well its the first time i have asked it  mrs brook had a silence more pregnant its for being with us that he pities her  edward thought with me too  not so muchbut still you help  i thought you thought i didntthat night  at tishys oh you didnt matter said mrs brook everything every one helps harold distinctlyshe seemed to figure it all outand even the poor children i dare say a little oh but every oneshe warmed to the visionits perfect jane immensely par example almost all the others who come to the house cashmore carrie tishy fannybless their hearts alleach in their degree  edward brookenham had under the influence of this demonstration gradually risen from his seat and as his wife approached that part of her process which might be expected to furnish the proof he placed himself before her with his back to the fire and mitchy i suppose  but he was out no mitchys different  he wondered different  not a help quite a drawback then as his face told how these were involutions you neednt understand but you can believe me she added the one who does most is of course van himself it was a statement by which his failure to apprehend was not diminished and she completed her operation by not liking her  edwards gloom on this was not quite blankness yet it was dense do you like his not liking her  dear no no better than he does  and he doesnt  oh he hates it  of course i havent asked him edward appeared to say more to himself than to his wife  and of course i havent she returnednot at all in this case plainly for herself but i know it hed like her if he could but he cant that mrs brook wound up is what makes it sure  there was at last in edwards gravity a positive pathos sure he wont propose  sure mr longdon wont now throw her over  of course if it is sure  well  why it is but of course if it isnt  well  why she wont have anything anything but us he continued to reflect unless you know youre working it on a certainty  thats just what i am working it on i did nothing till i knew i was safe  safe he ambiguously echoed while on this their eyes met longer  safe i knew hed stick  but how did you know van wouldnt  no matter howbut better still he hasnt stuck she said it very simply but she turned away from him  his eyes for a little followed her we dont know after all the old boys means  i dont know what you mean by we dont nanda does  but wheres the support if she doesnt tell us  mrs brook who had faced about again turned from him i hope you dont forget she remarked with superiority that we dont ask her  you dont edward gloomed  never but i trust her  yes he mused afresh one must trust ones child does van he then enquired  does he trust her  does he know anything of the general figure  she hesitated everything its high  he has told you so  mrs brook supremely impatient now seemed to demur even to the question we ask him even less  then how do we know  she was weary of explaining because thats just why he hates it  there was no end however apparently to what edward could take but hates what  why not liking her  edward kept his back to the fire and his dead eyes on the cornice and the ceiling i shouldnt think it would be so difficult  well you see it isnt mr longdon can manage it  i dont see what the devils the matter with her he coldly continued  ah that may not prevent its fortunately the source at any rate of half mr longdons interest  but what the hell is it he drearily demanded  she faltered a little but she brought it out its me  and whats the matter with you  she made at this a movement that drew his eyes to her own and for a moment she dimly smiled at him thats the nicest thing you ever said to me but ever ever you know  is it she had her hand on his sleeve and he looked almost awkward  quite the very nicest consider that fact well and even if you only said it by accident dont be funnyas you know you sometimes can beand take it back its all right its charming isnt it when our troubles bring us more together now go up to her  edward kept a queer face into which this succession of remarks introduced no light but he finally moved and it was only when he had almost reached the door that he stopped again of course you know he has sent her no end of books  mr longdonof late oh yes a deluge so that her room looks like a booksellers back shop and all in the loveliest bindings the most standard english works i not only know it naturally but i knowwhat you dontwhy  why edward echoed why but thatunless he should send her moneyits about the only kindness he can show her at a distance  mrs brook hesitated then with a little suppressed sigh thats it  but it still held him and perhaps he does send her money  no not now  edward lingered then is he taking it out  in books only it was wonderfulwith its effect on him now visiblehow she possessed her subject yes thats his delicacyfor the present  and youre not afraid for the future  of his considering that the books will have worked it off no theyre thrown in  just perceptibly cheered he reached the door where however he had another pause you dont think i had better see van  she stared what for  why to ask what the devil he means  if you should do anything so hideously vulgar she instantly replied id leave your house the next hour do you expect she asked to be able to force your child down his throat  he was clearly not prepared with an account of his expectations but he had a general memory that imposed itself then why in the world did he make up to us  he didnt we made up to him  but why in the world  well said mrs brook really to finish we were in love with him  oh edward jerked he had by this time opened the door and the sound was partly the effect of the disclosure of a servant preceding a visitor his greeting of the visitor before edging past and away was however of the briefest it might have implied that they had met but yesterday how dye do mitchyat home oh rather    iii  very different was mrs brooks welcome of the restored wanderer to whom in a brief space she addressed every expression of surprise and delight though marking indeed at last as a qualification of these things her regret that he declined to partake of her tea or to allow her to make him what she called snug for a talk in his customary corner of her sofa he pleaded frankly agitation and embarrassment reminded her even that he was awfully shy and that after separations complications whatever might at any time happen he was conscious of the dust that had settled on intercourse and that he couldnt blow away in a single breath she was only according to her nature to indulge him if while he walked about and changed his place he came to the surface but in patches and pieces there was so much he wanted to know thatwell as they had arrived only the night before she could judge there was knowledge it became clear that mrs brook almost equally craved so that it even looked at first as if on either side confidence might be choked by curiosity this disaster was finally barred by the fact that the spirit of enquiry found for mitchy material that was comparatively plastic that was after all apparent enough when at the end of a few vain passes he brought out sociably well has he done it  still indeed there was something in mrs brooks face that seemed to reply oh comedont rush it you know and something in the movement with which she turned away that described the state of their question as by no means so simple as that on his refusal of tea she had rung for the removal of the table and the bell was at this moment answered by the two men little ensued then for some minutes while the servants were present she spoke only as the butler was about to close the door if mr longdon presently comes show him into mr brookenhams room if mr brookenham isnt there if he is show him into the diningroom and in either case let me immediately know  the man waited expressionless and in case of his asking for miss brookenham  he wont she replied with a sharpness before which her interlocutor retired he will she then added in quite another tone to mitchy that is you know he perfectly may but oh the subtlety of servants she sighed  mitchy was now all there mr longdons in town then  for the first time since you went away hes to call this afternoon  and you want to see him alone  mrs brook thought i dont think i want to see him at all  then your keeping him below  is so that he shant burst in till i know its you my dear i want to see  mitchy glared about well dont take it ill if in return for that i say i myself want to see every one i could have done even just now with a little more of edward  mrs brook in her own manner and with a slow headshake looked lovely i couldnt then she puzzled it out with a pause it even does come over me that if you dont mind  what my dear woman said mitchy encouragingly did i ever mind i assure you he laughed i havent come back to begin  at this suddenly dropping everything else she laid her hand on him mitchy love are you happy  so for a moment they stood confronted not perhaps as you would have tried to make me  well youve still got me you know  oh said mitchy ive got a great deal how if i really look at it can a man of my peculiar natureit is you know awfully peculiarnot be happy think if one is driven to it for instance of the breadth of my sympathies  mrs brook as a result of thinking appeared for a little to demur yesbut one mustnt be too much driven to it its by ones sympathies that one suffers if you should do that i couldnt bear it  she clearly evoked for mitchy a definite image it would be funny wouldnt it but you wouldnt have to id go off and do it alone somewherein a dark room i think or on a desert island at any rate where nobody should see wheres the harm moreover he went on of any suffering that doesnt bore one as im sure however much its outer aspect might amuse some others mine wouldnt bore me what i should do in my desert island or my dark room i feel would be just to dance about with the thrill of itwhich is exactly the exhibition of ludicrous gambols that i would fain have arranged to spare you i assure you dear mrs brook he wound up that im not in the least bored now everythings so interesting  youre beautiful she vaguely interposed  but he pursued without heeding was perhaps what you had in your head that i should see him  she came back but slowly however to the moment mr longdon well yes you know he cant bear me  yes yesmitchy was almost eager  it had already sent her off again youre too lovely you have come back the same it seemed to me she after an instant explained that i wanted him to be seen  without inconvenience as it were either to himself or to you then said mitchy who visibly felt that he had taken her up successfully it strikes me that im absolutely your man its delicious to come back to a use  but she was much more dim about it oh what youve come back to  its just what im trying to get at van is still then where i left him  she was just silent did you really believe he would move  mitchy took a few turns speaking almost with his back presented well with all the reasons after which while she watched him he was before her again with a question its utterly off  when was it ever really on  oh i know your view and that i think said mitchy is the most extraordinary part of it i can tell you it would have put me on  my view mrs brook thought have you forgotten that i had for you too a view that didnt  ah but we didnt differ you and i it wasnt a defiance and a prophecy you wanted me  i did indeed mrs brook said simply  and you didnt want him for her i mean so you risked showing it  she looked surprised did i  again they were face to face your candours divine  she wondered do you mean it was even then  mitchy smiled at her till he was red its exquisite now  well she presently returned i knew my van  i thought i knew yours too mitchy said their eyes met a minute and he added but i didnt then he exclaimed how youve worked it  she looked barely conscious worked it after which with a slightly sharper note how do you knowwhile youve been amusing yourself in places that id give my head to see again but never shallwhat ive been doing  well i saw you know that night at tishys just before we left england your wonderful start i got a look at your attitude as it were and your system  her eyes were now far away and she spoke after an instant without moving them and didnt i by the same token get a look at yours  mine mitchy thought but seemed to doubt my dear child i hadnt any then  you mean that it has formed itselfyour systemsince  he shook his head with decision i assure you im quite at sea ive never had and i have as little as ever now anything but my general philosophy which i wont attempt at present to go into and of which moreover i think youve had first and last your glimpses what i made out in you that night was a perfect policy  mrs brook had another of her infantine stares every one that night seems to have made out something all i can say is at any rate she went on that in that case you were all far deeper than i was  it was just a blind instinct without a programme or a scheme perhaps then since it has so perfectly succeeded the name doesnt matter im lost as i tell you mitchy declared in admiration of its success  she looked as before so young yet so grave what do you call its success  let me ask you rathermaynt iwhat you call its failure  mrs brook who had been standing for some minutes seated herself at this as if to respond to his idea but the next moment she had fallen back into thought have you often heard from him  never once  and have you written  not a word either i left it you see mitchy smiled all to you after which he continued has he been with you much  she just hesitated as little as possible but as it happens he was here just now  her visitor fairly flushed and ive only missed him  her pause again was of the briefest you wouldnt if he had gone up  gone up  to nanda who has now her own sittingroom as you know for whom he immediately asked and for whose benefit whatever you may think i was at the end of a quarter of an hour i assure you perfectly ready to release him he changed his mind however and went away without seeing her  mitchy showed the deepest interest and what made him change his mind  well im thinking it out  he appeared to watch this labour but with no light yet  when it comes ill tell you  he hung fire once more but an instant you didnt yourself work the thing again  she rose at this in strange sincerity i think you know you go very far  why didnt we just now settle he promptly replied that its all instinctive and unconscious if it was so that night at tishys  ah voyons voyons she broke in what did i do even then he laughed out at something in her tone youd like it again all pictured  im not afraid  why you just simplypubliclytook her back  and where was the monstrosity of that  in the one little right place in your removal of every doubt  well of what he had appeared not quite to know how to put it but he saw at last why of what we may still hope to do for her thanks to your care there were specimens then as she had the look of trying vainly to focus a few i cant recover them one by one he pursued but the whole thing was quite lurid enough to do us all credit  she met him after a little but at such an odd point pardon me if i scarcely see how much of the credit was yours for the first time since ive known you you went in for decency  mitchys surprise showed as real it struck you as decency  since he wished she thought it over oh your behaviour  my behaviour wasmy condition do you call that decent no youre quite out he spoke in his good nature with an approach to reproof how can i ever  but it had already brought her quite round and to a firmer earth that she clearly preferred to tread are things really bad with you mitch  well ill tell you how they are but not now  some other timeon your honour  you shall have it all dont be afraid  she dimly smiled it will be like old times  he rather demurred for you perhaps but not for me  in spite of what he said it did hold her and her hand again almost caressed him buttill you do tell meis it very very dreadful  thats just perhaps what i may have to get you to decide  then shall i help you she eagerly asked  i think it will be quite in your line  at the thought of her lineit sounded somehow so generalshe released him a little with a sigh yet still looking round as it were for possibilities jane you know is in a state  yes janes in a state thats a comfort  she continued in a manner to cling to him but is it your only one  he was very kind and patient not perhaps quite  im a little of one  my dear child as you see  yes she saw but was still on the wing and shall you have recourse  to what he asked as she appeared to falter  i dont mean to anything violent but shall you tell nanda  mitchy wondered tell her  well everything i think you know mrs brook musingly observed that it would really serve her right  mitchys silence which lasted a minute seemed to take the idea but not perhaps quite to know what to do with it ah im afraid i shall never really serve her right  just as he spoke the butler reappeared at sight of whom mrs brook immediately guessed mr longdon  in mr brookenhams room maam mr brookenham has gone out  and where has he gone  i think maam only for some evening papers  she had an intense look for mitchy then she said to the man ask him to wait three minutesill ring turning again to her visitor as soon as they were alone you dont know how im trusting you  trusting me  why if he comes up to you  mitchy thought hadnt i better go down  noyou may have edward back if you see him you must see him here if i dont myself its for a reason  mitchy again just sounded her his not as you a while ago hinted  yes caring for what i say she had a pause but she brought it out he doesnt believe a word  of what you tell him mitchy was splendid i see and you want something said to him  yes that hell take from you only its for you mrs brook went on really and honestly and as i trust you to give it but the comfort of you is that youll do so if you promise  mitchy was infinitely struck but i havent promised eh of course i cant till i know what it is  its to put before him  oh i see the situation  what has happened here today vans marked retreat and how with the time that has passed it makes us at last know where we are you of course for yourself mrs brook wound up see that  where we are mitchy took a turn and came back but what then did van come for if you speak of a retreat there must have been an advance  oh said mrs brook he simply wanted not to look too brutal after so much absence he could come  well if he established that he isnt brutal where was the retreat  in his not going up to nanda he camefranklyto do that but made up his mind on second thoughts that he couldnt risk even being civil to her  mitchy had visibly warmed to his work well and what made the difference  she wondered what difference  why of the effect as you say of his second thoughts thoughts of what  oh said mrs brook suddenly and as if it were quite simplei know that suspicions  and of whom  why of you you goose of your not having done  well what he persisted as she paused  how shall i say it the best thing for yourself and of nandas feeling that dont you see  in the effort of seeing or perhaps indeed in the full act of it poor mitchy glared as never before do you mean vans jealous of me  pressed as she was there was something in his face that momentarily hushed her there it is she achieved however at last  of me mitchy went on  what was in his face so suddenly and strangelywas the look of rising tearsat sight of which as from a compunction as prompt she showed a lovely flush there it is there it is she repeated you ask me for a reason and its the only one i see of course if you dont care she added he neednt come up he can go straight to nanda  mitchy had turned away again as with the impulse of hiding the tears that had risen and that had not wholly disappeared even by the time he faced about did nanda know he was to come  mr longdon  no no was she expecting van  my dear man mrs brook mildly wailed when can she have not been  mitchy looked hard for an instant at the floor i mean does she know he has been and gone  mrs brook from where she stood and through the window looked rather at the sky her father will have told her  her father mitchy frankly wondered is he in it  mrs brook had at this a longer pause you assume i suppose mitchy dear she then quavered that i put him up  put edward up he broke in  nothat of course put van up to ideas  he caught it again about mewhat you call his suspicions he seemed to weigh the charge but it ended while he passed his hand hard over his eyes in weariness and in the nearest approach to coldness he had ever shown mrs brook it doesnt matter its every ones fate to be in one way or another the subject of ideas do then he continued let mr longdon come up  she instantly rang the bell then ill go to nanda but dont look frightened she added as she came back as to what we mayedward or ido next its only to tell her that hell be with her  good ill tell tatton mitchy replied  still however she lingered shall you ever care for me more  he had almost the air as he waited for her to go of the master of the house for she had made herself before him as he stood with his back to the fire as humble as a tolerated visitor oh just as much wheres the difference arent our ties in fact rather multiplied  thats the way i want to feel it and from the moment you recognise with me  yes  well that he never you know really would  he took her mercifully up theres no harm done mitchy thought of it  it made her still hover nanda will be rich toward that you can help and its really i may now tell you what it came into my head you should see our friend here for  he maintained his waiting attitude thanks thanks  youre our guardian angel she exclaimed  at this he laughed out wait till you see what mr longdon does  but she took no notice i want you to see before i go that ive done nothing for myself van after all she mused  well  only hates me it isnt as with you she said ive really lost him  mitchy for an instant with the eyes that had shown his tears glared away into space he cant very positively you know now like any of us he misses a fortune  there it is mrs brook once more observed then she had a comparative brightness im so glad you dont he gave another laugh but she was already facing mr tatton who had again answered the bell show mr longdon up  im to tell him then its at your request mitchy asked when the butler had gone  that you receive him oh yes hell be the last to quarrel with that but theres one more thing  it was something over which of a sudden she had one of her returns of anxiety ive been trying for months and months to remember to find out from you  well what he enquired as she looked odd  why if harold ever gave back to you as he swore to me on his honour he would that fivepound note  but which dear lady the sense of other incongruities than those they had been dealing with seemed to arrive now for mitchys aid  the one that ages ago one day when you and van were here we had the joke about you produced it in sport as a fine for something and put it on that table after which before i knew what you were about before i could run after you you had gone off and ridiculously left it of course the next minuteand again before i could turn roundharold had pounced on it and i tried in vain to recover it from him but all i could get him to do  was to promise to restore it straight to its owner mitchy had listened so much less in surprise than in amusement that he had apparently after a moment reestablished the scene oh i recollecthe did settle with me thats all right  she fixed him from the door of the next room you got every penny  every penny but fancy your bringing it up  ah i always do you knowsome day  yes youre of a rigour but be at peace harolds quite square he went on and i quite meant to have asked you about him  mrs brook promptly was all for this oh its all right  mitchy came nearer lady fanny  yeshas stayed for him  ah said mitchy i knew youd do it but hushtheyre coming on which while she whisked away he went back to the fire    iv  ten minutes of talk with mr longdon by mrs brookenhams hearth elapsed for him without his arriving at the right moment to take up the business so richly put before him in his previous interview no less time indeed could have sufficed to bring him into closer relation with this affair and nothing at first could have been more marked than the earnestness of his care not to show impatience of appeals that were for a person of his old friends general style simple recognitions and decencies there was a limit to the mere allusiveness with which in mr longdons school of manners a foreign tour might be treated and mitchy no doubt plentifully showed that none of his frequent returns had encountered a curiosity at once so explicit and so discreet to belong to a circle in which most of the members might be at any moment on the other side of the globe was inevitably to fall into the habit of few questions as well as into that of making up for their fewness by their freedom this interlocutor in short while mrs brooks representative privately thought over all he had in hand went at some length and very charminglysince it was but a tribute to common courtesyinto the virgilian associations of the bay of naples finally however he started his eye having turned to the clock im afraid that though our hostess doesnt appear i mustnt forget myself i too came back but yesterday and ive an engagementfor which im already latewith miss brookenham who has been so good as to ask me to tea  the divided mind the express civility the decent miss brookenham the escape from their hostessthese were all things mitchy could quickly take in and they gave him in a moment his light for not missing his occasion i see i seei shall make you keep nanda waiting but theres something i shall ask you to take from me quite as a sufficient basis for that which is simply that after all you knowfor i think you do know dont youim nearly as much attached to her as you are  mr longdon had looked suddenly apprehensive and even a trifle embarrassed but he spoke with due presence of mind of course i understand that perfectly if you hadnt liked her so much  well said mitchy as he checked himself  i would never last year have gone to stay with you  thank you mitchy laughed  though i like you alsoand extremely mr longdon gravely pursued for yourself  mitchy made a sign of acknowledgement you like me better for her than you do for anybody else but myself  you put it i think correctly of course ive not seen so much of nandaif between my age and hers that is any real contact is possiblewithout knowing that she now regards you as one of the very best of her friends treating you i find myself suspecting with a degree of confidence  mitchy gave a laugh of interruption that she doesnt show even to you  mr longdons poised glasses faced him even i dont mind as the opportunity has come up telling you franklyand as from my time of life to your ownall the comfort i take in the sense that in any case of need or trouble she might look to you for whatever advice or support the crisis should demand  she has told you she feels id be there mitchy after an instant asked  im not sure his friend replied that i ought quite to mention anything she has told me i speak of what ive made out myself  then i thank you more than i can say for your penetration her mother i should let you know mitchy continued is with her just now  mr longdon took off his glasses with a jerk has anything happened to her  to account for the fact i refer to mitchy said in amusement at his start shes not ill that i know of thank goodness and she hasnt broken her leg but something none the less has happened to herthat i think i may say to tell you all in a word its the reason such as it is of my being here to meet you mrs brook asked me to wait shell see you herself some other time  mr longdon wondered and nanda too  oh that must be between yourselves only while i keep you here  she understands my delay  mitchy thought mrs brook must have explained then as his companion took this in silence but you dont like it he asked  it only comes to me that mrs brooks explanations  are often so odd oh yes but nanda you know allows for that oddity and mrs brook by the same token mitchy developed knows herselfno one betterwhat may frequently be thought of it thats precisely the reason of her desire that you should have on this occasion explanations from a source that shes so good as to pronounce for the immediate purpose superior as for nanda he wound up to be aware that were here together wont strike her as so bad a sign  no mr longdon attentively assented shell hardly fear were plotting her ruin but what then has happened to her  well said mitchy its you i think who will have to give it a name i know you know what ive known  mr longdon his nippers again in place hesitated yes i know  and youve accepted it  how could i help it to reckon with such cleverness  was beyond you ah it wasnt my cleverness mitchy said theres a greater than mine theres a greater even than vans thats the whole point he went on while his friend looked at him hard you dont even like it just a little  mr longdon wondered the existence of such an element  no the existence simply of my knowledge of your idea  i suppose im bound to keep in mind in fairness the existence of my own knowledge of yours  but mitchy gave that the goby oh ive so many ideas im always getting hold of some new one and for the most part trying itgenerally to let it go as a failure yes i had one six months ago i tried that im trying it still  then i hope said mr longdon with a gaiety slightly strained that contrary to your usual rule its a success  it was a gaiety for that matter that mitchys could match it does promise well but ive another idea even now and its just what im again trying  on me mr longdon still somewhat extravagantly smiled  mitchy thought well on two or three persons of whom you are the first for me to tackle but what i must begin with is having from you that you recognise she trusts us  mitchys idea after an instant had visibly gone further both of themthe two women up there at present so strangely together mrs brook must too immensely but for that you wont care  mr longdon had relapsed into an anxiety more natural than his expression of a moment before its about time but if nanda didnt trust us he went on her case would indeed be a sorry one she has nobody else to trust  yes mitchys concurrence was grave only you and me  only you and me  the eyes of the two men met over it in a pause terminated at last by mitchys saying we must make it all up to her  is that your idea  ah said mitchy gently dont laugh at it  his friends grey gloom again covered him but what can then as mitchy showed a face that seemed to wince with a silent what could the old man completed his objection think of the magnitude of the loss  oh i dont for a moment suggest mitchy hastened to reply that it isnt immense  she does care for him you know said mr longdon  mitchy at this gave a wide prolonged glare know he ever so delicately murmured  his irony had quite touched but of course you know you know everythingnanda and you  there was a tone in it that moved a spring and mitchy laughed out i like your putting me with her but were all together with nanda he next added it is deep  his companion took it from him deep  and yet somehow it isnt abject  the old man wondered abject  i mean it isnt pitiful in its way mitchy developed its happy  this too though rather ruefully mr longdon could take from him yesin its way  any passion so great so complete mitchy went on issatisfied or unsatisfieda life mr longdon looked so interested that his fellow visitor evidently stirred by what was now an appeal and a dependence grew still more bland or at least more assured for affirmation shes not too sorry for herself  ah shes so proud  yes but thats a help  ohnot for us  it arrested mitchy but his ingenuity could only rebound in one way that of reducing us to feel that the desire to make up to her iswell mainly for our relief if she trusts us as i said just now it isnt for that she does so as his friend appeared to wait then to hear it was presently with positive joy that he showed he could meet the last difficulty what she trusts us to dooh mitchy had worked it outis to let him off  let him off it still left mr longdon dim  easily thats all  but what would letting him off hard be it seems to me heson any termsalready beyond us he is off  mr longdon had given it a sound that suddenly made mitchy appear to collapse under a sharper sense of the matter he is off he moodily echoed  his companion again a little bewildered watched him then with impatience do please tell me what has happened  he quickly pulled himself round well he was after a long absence here a while since as if expressly to see her but after spending half an hour he went away without it  mr longdons watch continued he spent the halfhour with her mother instead  oh insteadit was hardly that he at all events dropped his idea  and what had it been his idea  you speak as if he had as many as i mitchy replied in a manner indeed he has he continued as if for himself but theyre of a different kind he said to mr longdon  what had it been his idea the old man however simply repeated  mitchys confession at this seemed to explain his previous evasion we shall never know  mr longdon hesitated he wont tell you  me mitchy had a pause less than any one  many things they had not spoken had already passed between them and something evidently to the sense of each passed during the moment that followed this while you were abroad mr longdon presently asked did you hear from him  never and i wrote nothing  like me said mr longdon ive neither written nor heard  ah but with you it will be different mr longdon as if with the outbreak of an agitation hitherto controlled had turned abruptly away and with the usual swing of his glass begun almost wildly to wander you will hear  i shall be curious  oh but what nanda wants you know is that you shouldnt be too much so  mr longdon thoughtfully rambled too much  to let him off as we were saying easily  the elder man for a while said nothing more but he at last came back shed like me actually to give him something  i dare say  money  mitchy smiled a handsome present they were face to face again with more mute interchange she doesnt want him to have lost mr longdon however on this once more broke off while mitchys eyes followed him doesnt it give a sort of measure of what she may feel  he had paused working it out again with the effect of his friends returning afresh to be fed with his light doesnt what give it  why the fact that we still like him  mr longdon stared do you still like him  if i didnt how should i mind but on the utterance of it mitchy fairly pulled up  his companion after another look laid a mild hand on his shoulder what is it you mind  from him oh nothing he could trust himself again there are people like thatgreat cases of privilege  he is one mr longdon mused  there it is they go through life somehow guaranteed they cant help pleasing  ah mr longdon murmured if it hadnt been for that  they hold they keep every one mitchy went on its the sacred terror  the companions for a little seemed to stand together in this element after which the elder turned once more away and appeared to continue to walk in it poor nanda then in a faroff sigh came across from him to mitchy mitchy on this turned vaguely round to the fire into which he remained gazing till he heard again mr longdons voice i knew it of course after all it was what i came up to town for that night before you went abroad at mrs grendons  yesmitchy was with him again  well made me see the future it was then already too late  mitchy assented with emphasis too late she was spoiled for him  if mr longdon had to take it he took it at least quietly only saying after a time and her mother isnt  oh yes quite  and does mrs brook know it  yes but doesnt mind she resembles you and me she still likes him  but what good will that do her  mitchy sketched a shrug what good does it do us  mr longdon thought we can at least respect ourselves  can we mitchy smiled  and he can respect us his friend as if not hearing him went on  mitchy seemed almost to demur he must think were rum  well mrs brooks worse than rum he cant respect her  oh that will be perhaps mitchy laughed what shell get just most out of it was the first time of mr longdons showing that even after a minute he had not understood him so that as quickly as possible he passed to another point if you do anything may i be in it  but what can i do if its over its over  for him yes but not for her or for you or for me  oh im not for long the old man wearily said turning the next moment to the door at which one of the footmen had appeared  mrs brookenhams compliments please sir this messenger articulated and miss brookenham is now alone  thanksill come up  the servant withdrew and the eyes of the two visitors again met for a minute after which mitchy looked about for his hat goodbye ill go  mr longdon watched him while having found his hat he looked about for his stick you want to be in everything  mitchy without answering smoothed his hat down then he replied you say youre not for long but you wont abandon her  oh i mean i shant last for ever  well since you so expressed it yourself thats what i mean too i assure you i shant desert her and if i can help you  help me mr longdon interrupted looking at him hard  it made him a little awkward help you to help her you know  youre very wonderful mr longdon presently returned a year and a half ago you wanted to help me to help mr vanderbank  well said mitchy you cant quite say i havent  but your ideas of help are of a splendour  oh ive told you about my ideas mitchy was almost apologetic mr longdon had a pause i suppose im not indiscreet then in recognising your marriage as one of them and that with a responsibility so great already assumed you appear fairly eager for another  makes me out a kind of monster of benevolence mitchy looked at it with a flushed face the two responsibilities are very much one and the same my marriage has brought me as it were only nearer to nanda my wife and she dont you see are particular friends  mr longdon on his side turned a trifle pale he looked rather hard at the floor i seei see then he raised his eyes butto an old fellow like meits all so strange  it is strange mitchy spoke very kindly but its all right  mr longdon gave a headshake that was both sad and sharp its all wrong but youre all right he added in a different tone as he walked hastily away     book tenth nanda    i  nanda brookenham for a fortnight after mr longdons return had found much to think of but the bustle of business became visibly for us particularly great with her on a certain friday afternoon in june she was in unusual possession of that chamber of comfort in which so much of her life had lately been passed the redecorated and rededicated room upstairs in which she had enjoyed a due measure both of solitude and of society passing the objects about her in review she gave especial attention to her rather marked wealth of books changed repeatedly for five minutes the position of various volumes transferred to tables those that were on shelves and rearranged shelves with an eye to the effect of backs she was flagrantly engaged throughout indeed in the study of effect which moreover had the law of an extreme freshness not inveterately prevailed there might have been observed to be traceable in the very detail of her own appearance company in short was in the air and expectation in the picture the flowers on the little tables bloomed with a consciousness sharply taken up by the glitter of nicknacks and reproduced in turn in the light exuberance of cushions on sofas and the measured drop of blinds in windows the numerous photographed friends in particular were highly prepared with small intense faces each that happened in every case to be turned to the door the pair of eyes most dilated perhaps was that of old van present under a polished glass and in a frame of giltedged morocco that spoke out across the room of piccadilly and christmas and visibly widening his gaze at the opening of the door at the announcement of a name by a footman and at the entrance of a gentleman remarkably like him save as the resemblance was on the gentlemans part flattered vanderbank had not been in the room ten seconds before he showed ever so markedly that he had arrived to be kind kindness therefore becomes for us by a quick turn of the glass that reflects the whole scene the high pitch of the concerta kindness that almost immediately filled the place to the exclusion of everything else with a familiar friendly voice a brightness of good looks and good intentions a constant though perhaps sometimes misapplied laugh a superabundance almost of interest inattention and movement  the first thing the young man said was that he was tremendously glad she had written i think it was most particularly nice of you and this thought precisely seemed as he spoke a flower of the general bloomas if the niceness he had brought in was so great that it straightway converted everything to its image the only thing that upset me a little he went on was your saying that before writing it you had so hesitated and waited i hope very much you know that youll never do anything of that kind again if youve ever the slightest desire to see mefor no matter what reason if theres ever the smallest thing of any sort that i can do for you i promise you i shant easily forgive you if you stand on ceremony it seems to me that when people have known each other as long as you and i theres one comfort at least they may treat themselves to i mean of course van developed that of being easy and frank and natural there are such a lot of relations in which one isnt in which it doesnt pay in which ease in fact would be the greatest of troubles and nature the greatest of falsities however he continued while he suddenly got up to change the place in which he had put his hat i dont really know why im preaching at such a rate for ive a perfect consciousness of not myself requiring it one does half the time preach more or less for ones self eh im not mistaken at all events i think about the right thing with you and a hints enough for you im sure on the right thing with me he had been looking all round while he talked and had twice shifted his seat so that it was quite in consonance with his general admiring notice that the next impression he broke out with should have achieved some air of relevance what extraordinarily lovely flowers you have and how charming youve made everything youre always doing somethingwomen are always changing the position of their furniture if one happens to come in in the dark no matter how well one knows the place one sits down on a hat or a puppydog but of course youll say one doesnt come in in the dark or at least if one does deserves what one gets only you know the way some women keep their rooms im bound to say you dont do youyou dont go in for flowerpots in the windows and half a dozen blinds why should you you have got a lot to show he rose with this for the third time as the better to command the scene what i mean is that sofawhich by the way is awfully good you do my dear nanda go it it certainly was here the last time wasnt it and this thing was there the last timei mean the last time i was up herewas fearfully long ago when by the way was it but you see i have been and that i remember it and youve a lot more things now youre laying up treasure really the increase of luxury what an awfully jolly lot of bookshave you read them all where did you learn so much about bindings  he continued to talk he took things up and put them down nanda sat in her place where her stillness fixed and colourless contrasted with his rather flushed freedom and appeared only to wait half in surprise half in surrender for the flow of his suggestiveness to run its course so that having herself provoked the occasion she might do a little more to meet it it was by no means however that his presence in any degree ceased to prevail for there were minutes during which her face the only thing in her that moved turning with his turns and following his glances actually had a look inconsistent with anything but submission to almost any accident it might have expressed a desire for his talk to last and last an acceptance of any treatment of the hour or any version or want of version of her act that would best suit his ease even in fact a resigned prevision of the occurrence of something that would leave her quenched and blank with the appearance of having made him come simply that she might look at him she might indeed well have been aware of an inability to look at him little enough to make it flagrant that she had appealed to him for something quite different keeping the situation meanwhile thus in his hands he recognised over the chimney a new alteration there used to be a big printwasnt there a thing of the fiftieswe had lots of them at home some place or other in the olden time and now theres that lovely french glass so you see he spoke as if she had in some way gainsaid him whereas he had not left her time even to answer a question but he broke out anew on the beauty of her flowers you have awfully good oneswhere do you get them flowers and pictures andwhat are the other things people have when theyre happy and superiorbooks and birds you ought to have a bird or two though i dare say you think that by the noise i make im as good myself as a dozen isnt there some girl in some storyit isnt scott what is itwho had domestic difficulties and a cage in her window and whom one associates with chickweed and virtue it isnt esmeraldaesmeralda had a poodle hadnt sheor have i got my heroines mixed youre up here yourself like a heroine youre perched in your tower or what do you call ityour bower you quite hang over the place you knowthe great wicked city the wonderful london sky and the monuments looming through or am i again only muddling up my zola you must have the sunsetshavent you nowhat am i talking about of course you look north well they strike me as about the only thing you havent at the same time its not only because i envy you that i feel humiliated i ought to have sent you some flowers he smote himself with horror throwing back his head with a sudden thought why in goodness when i got your note didnt i for once in my life do something really graceful i simply liked it and answered it here i am but ive brought nothing i havent even brought a box of sweets im not a man of the world  most of the flowers here nanda at last said come from mr longdon dont you remember his garden  vanderbank in quick response called it up dear yeswasnt it charming and that morning you and i spent therehe was so careful to be easy about ittalking under the trees  you had gone out to be quiet and read  and you came out to look after me well i remember van went on that we had some good talk  the talk nandas face implied had become dim to her but there were other things you know hes a great gardeneri mean really one of the greatest his gardens like a dinner in a house where the personthe person of the housethoroughly knows and cares  i see and he sends you dishes from the table  oftenevery week it comes to the same thingnow that hes in town his gardener does it  charming of them both vanderbank exclaimed but his gardenerthat extraordinarily tall fellow with the long red beardwas almost as nice as himself i had talks with him too and remember every word he said i remember he told me you asked questions that showed a deal of study but i thought i had never seen all round such a charming lot of peoplei mean as those down there that our friend has got about him its an awfully good note for a man pleasant servants i always think dont you mr longdonsand quite without their saying anything just from the sort of type and manner they hadstruck me as a kind of chorus of praise the same with mitchys at mertle i remember van rambled on mitchys the sort of chap who might have awful ones but i recollect telling him that one quite felt as if it were with them one had come to stay good note good note he cheerfully repeated im bound to say you know he continued in this key that youve a jolly sense for getting in with people who make you comfortable then by the way hes still in town  nanda waited do you mean mr mitchy  oh he is i knowi met them two nights ago and by the way againdont let me forgeti want to speak to you about his wife but ive not seen do you know mr longdonwhich is really too awful twice thrice i think have i at moments like this one snatched myself from pressure but theres no finding the old demon at any earthly hour when do you goor does he only come here of course i see youve got the place arranged for him when i asked at his hotel at what hour he ever is in blest if the fellow didnt say very often sir about ten and when i said ten p m he quite laughed at my innocence over a person of such habits what are his habits then now and what are you putting him up to seriously vanderbank pursued i am awfully sorry and i wonder if the first time youve a chance youd kindly tell him youve heard me say so and that i mean yet to run him to earth the same really with the dear mitchys i didnt somehow the other night in such a lot of people get at them but i sat opposite to aggie all through dinner and that puts me in mind i should like volumes from you about aggie please its too revolting of me not to go to see her but every one knows im busy were up to our necks  i cant tell you said nanda how kind i think it of you to have found with all you have to do a moment for this but please without delay let me tell you  practically however he would let her tell him nothing his almost aggressive friendly optimism clung so to references of short range dont mention it please its too charming of you to squeeze me in to see you moreover does me good quite distinct good and your writing me touched meoh but really there were all sorts of old things in it then he broke out once more on her books one of which for some minutes past he had held in his hand i see you go in for setsand my dear child upon my word i see big sets whats thisvol 23 the british poets vol 23 is delightfuldo tell me about vol 23 are you doing much in the british poets but when the deuce you wonderful being do you find time to read i dont find anyits too hideous one relapses in london into such illiteracy and barbarism i have to keep up a false glitter to hide in conversation my rapidly increasing ignorance i should be so ashamed after all to see other people not shocked by it but teach me teach me he gaily went on  the british poets nanda immediately answered were given me by mr longdon who has given me all the good books i have except a fewthose in that top rowthat have been given me at different times by mr mitchy mr mitchy has sent me flowers too as well as mr longdon and theyre bothsince weve spoken of my seeing themcoming by appointment this afternoon not together but mr mitchy at 530 and mr longdon at 630  she had spoken as with conscious promptitude making up for what she had not yet succeeded in saying by a quick complete statement of her case she was evidently also going on with more but her actual visitor had already taken her up with a laugh you are making a day of it and you run us like railwaytrains he looked at his watch have i then time  it seems to me i should say have i but its not halfpast four nanda went on and though ive something very particular of course to say to you it wont take long they dont bring tea till five and you must surely stay till that i had already written to you when they each for the same reason proposed this afternoon they go out of town tomorrow for sunday  oh i seeand they have to see you first what an influence you exert you know on peoples behaviour  she continued as literal as her friend was facetious well it just happened so and it didnt matter since on my asking you dont you know to choose your time you had taken as suiting you best this comparatively early hour  oh perfectly but he again had his watch out ive a job perverselythat was my reasonon the other side of the world which by the way im afraid wont permit me to wait for tea my tea doesnt matter the watch went back to his pocket im sorry to say i must be off before five it has been delightful at all events to see you again  he was on his feet as he spoke and though he had been half the time on his feet his last words gave the effect of his moving almost immediately to the door it appeared to come out with them rather clearer than before that he was embarrassed enough really to need help and it was doubtless the measure she after an instant took of this that enabled nanda with a quietness all her own to draw to herself a little more of the situation the quietness was plainly determined for her by a quick vision of its being the best assistance she could show had he an inward terror that explained his superficial nervousness the incoherence of a loquacity designed it would seem to check in each direction her advance he only fed it in that case by allowing his precautionary benevolence to put him in so much deeper where indeed could he have supposed she wanted to come out and what that she could ever do for him would really be so beautiful as this present chance to smooth his confusion and add as much as possible to that refined satisfaction with himself which would proceed from his having dealt with a difficult hour in a gallant and delicate way to force upon him an awkwardness was like forcing a disfigurement or a hurt so that at the end of a minute during which the expression of her face became a kind of uplifted view of her opportunity she arrived at the appearance of having changed places with him and of their being together precisely in order that henot sheshould be let down easily    ii  but surely youre not going already she asked why in the world then do you suppose i appealed to you  bless me no ive lots of time he dropped laughing for very eagerness straight into another chair youre too awfully interesting is it really an appeal putting the question indeed he could scarce even yet allow her a chance to answer it its only that you make me a little nervous with your account of all the people who are going to tumble in and theres one thing more he quickly went on i just want to make the point in case we should be interrupted the whole fun is in seeing you this way alone  is that the point nanda as he took breath gravely asked  thats a part of iti feel it i assure you to be charming but what i meantif youd only give me time you know to put in a wordis what for that matter ive already told you that it almost spoils my pleasure for you to keep reminding me that a bit of luck like thisluck for me i see you comingis after all for you but a question of business hang business gooddont stab me with that paperknife i listen what is the great affair then as it looked for an instant as if the words she had prepared were just in the supreme pinch of her need falling apart he once more tried his advantage oh if theres any difficulty about it let it gowell take it for granted theres one thing at any ratedo let me say thisthat i should like you to keep before me i want before i go to make you light up for me the question of little aggie oh there are other questions too as to which i regard you as a perfect fountain of curious knowledge however well take them one by onethe next some other time you always seem to me to hold the strings of such a lot of queer little dramas have something on the shelf for me when we meet again the thing just now is the outlook for mitchys affair one cares enough for old mitch to fancy one may feel safer for a lead or two in fact i want regularly to turn you on  ah but the thing i happen to have taken it into my head to say to you nanda now securely enough replied hasnt the least bit to do i assure you either with aggie or with old mitch if you dont want to hear itwant some way of getting offplease believe they wont help you a bit it was quite in fact that she felt herself at last to have found the right tone nothing less than a conviction of this could have made her after an instant add what in the world mr van are you afraid of  well that it was the right tone a single little minute was sufficient to provea minute i must yet haste to say big enough in spite of its smallness to contain the longest look on any occasion exchanged between these friends it was one of those looksnot so frequent it must be admitted as the muse of history dealing at best in short cuts is often by the conditions of her trade reduced to representing themwhich after they have come and gone are felt not only to have changed relations but absolutely to have cleared the air it certainly helped vanderbank to find his answer im only afraid i think of your conscience  he had been indeed for the space more helped than she my conscience  think it overquite at your leisureand some day youll understand theres no hurry he continuedno hurry and when you do understand it neednt make your existence a burden to you to fancy you must tell me oh he was so kindkinder than ever now the thing is you see that i havent a conscience i only want my fun  they had on this a second look also decidedly comfortable though discounted as the phrase is by the other which had really in its way exhausted the possibilities of looks oh i want my fun too said nanda and little as it may strike you in some ways as looking like it just this i beg you to believe is the real thing whats at the bottom of it she went on is a talk i had not long ago with mother  oh yes van returned with brightly blushing interest the fun he laughed thats to be got out of mother  oh im not thinking so much of that im thinking of any that she herself may be still in a position to pick up mine now dont you see is in making out how i can manage for this of course its rather difficult the girl pursued for me to tell you exactly what i mean  oh but it isnt a bit difficult for me to understand you vanderbank spoke in his geniality as if this were in fact the veriest trifle youve got your mother on your mind thats very much what i mean by your conscience  nanda had a fresh hesitation but evidently unaccompanied at present by any pain dont you still like mamma she at any rate quite successfully brought out i must tell you she quickly subjoined that though ive mentioned my talk with her as having finally led to my writing to you it isnt in the least that she then suggested my putting you the question i put it she explained quite off my own bat  the explanation as an effect immediately produced did proportionately much for the visitor who sat back in his chair with a pleaseda distinctly exhilaratedsense both of what he himself and what nanda had done youre an adorable family  well then if mothers adorable why give her up this i dont mind admitting she did the day i speak of let me see that she feels youve done but without suggesting eithernot a scrap please believethat i should make you any sort of scene about it of course in the first place she knows perfectly that anything like a scene would be no use you couldnt make out even if you wanted nanda went on that this is one she wont hear uswill shesmashing the furniture i didnt think for a while that i could do anything at all and i worried myself with that idea half to death then suddenly it came to me that i could do just what im doing now you said a while ago that we must never beyou and ianything but frank and natural thats what i said to myself alsowhy not here i am for you therefore as natural as a cold in your head i just ask youi even press you its because as she said youve practically ceased coming of course i know everything changes its the lawwhat is itthe great law of something or other all sorts of things happenthings come to an end she has more or lessby his marriagelost mitchy i dont want her to lose everything do stick to her what i really wanted to say to youto bring it straight outis that i dont believe you thoroughly know how awfully she likes you i hope my saying such a thing doesnt affect you as immodest one never knowsbut i dont much care if it does i suppose it would be immodest if i were to say that i verily believe shes in love with you not for that matter that father would mindhe wouldnt mind as he says a tuppenny rap soshe extraordinarily kept it upyoure welcome to any good the information may have for you though that i dare say does sound hideous no matterif i produce any effect on you thats the only thing i want when i think of her downstairs there so often nowadays practically alone i feel as if i could scarcely bear it shes so fearfully young  this time at least her speech while she went from point to point completely hushed him though after a full glimpse of the direction it was taking he ceased to meet her eyes and only sat staring hard at the pattern of the rug even when at last he spoke it was without looking up youre indeed as she herself used to say the modern daughter it takes that type to wish to make a career for her parents  oh said nanda very simply it isnt a career exactly is itkeeping hold of an old friend but it may console a little maynt it for the absence of one at all events i didnt want not to have spoken before its too late of course i dont know whats the matter between you or if anythings really the matter at all i dont care at any rate what isit cant be anything very bad make it up make it upforget it i dont pretend thats a career for you any more than for her but there it is i know how i soundmost patronising and pushing but nothing venture nothing have you cant know how much you are to her youre more to her i verily believe than any one ever was i hate to have the appearance of plotting anything about her behind her back so ill just say it once for all she said once in speaking of it to a person who repeated it to me that you had done more for her than any one because it was you who had really brought her out it was you did i saw it at the time myself i was very small but i could see it youll say i must have been a most uncanny little wretch and i dare say i was and am keeping now the pleasant promise that doesnt prevent ones feeling that when a person has brought a person out  a person should take the consequences vanderbank broke in and see a person through he could meet her now perfectly and proceeded admirably to do it theres an immense deal in that i admiti admit im bound to say i dont know quite what i didone does those things no doubt with a fine unconsciousness i should have thought indeed it was the other way round but i assure you i accept all consequences and all responsibilities if you dont know whats the matter between us im sure i dont either it cant be muchwell look into it i dont mean you and iyou mustnt be any more worried but she and her so unwittingly faithless one i havent been as often i knowvan pleasantly kept his course but theres a tide in the affairs of menand of women too and of girls and of every one you know what i meanyou know it for yourself the great thing is thatbless both your heartsone doesnt one simply cant if one would give your mother up its absurd to talk about it nobody ever did such a thing in his life there she is like the moon or the marble arch i dont say mind you he candidly explained that every one likes her equally thats another affair but no one who ever has liked her can afford ever again for any long period to do without her there are too many stupid peopletheres too much dull company that in london is to be had by the ton your mothers intelligence on the other hand will always have its price one can talk with her for a change shes fine fine fine so my dear child be quiet shes a fixed star  oh i know she is nanda said its you  who may be only the flashing meteor he sat and smiled at her i promise you then that your words have stayed me in my course youve made me stand as still as joshua made the sun with which he got straight up young you say she isfor as if to make up for it he all the more sociably continued its not like anything else shes youth shes my youthshe was mine and if you ever have a chance he wound up do put in for me that if she wants really to know shes booked for my old age shes clever enough you knowand vanderbank laughing went over for his hatto understand what you tell her  nanda took this in with due attention she was also now on her feet and then shes so lovely  awfully pretty  i dont say it as they say you know the girl continued because shes mother but i often think when were out that wherever she is  theres no one that all round really touches her vanderbank took it up with zeal oh so every one thinks and in fact ones appreciation of the charming things in that way so intensely her own can scarcely breathe on them all lightly enough and then hang it she has perceptionswhich are not things that run about the streets she has surprises he almost broke down for vividness she has little ways  well im glad you do like her nanda gravely replied  at this again he fairly faced her his momentary silence making it still more direct i like you know about as well as i ever liked anything this wonderful idea of yours of putting in a plea for her solitude and her youth dont think i do it injustice if i saywhich is saying muchthat its quite as charming as its amusing and now goodbye  he had put out his hand but nanda hesitated you wont wait for tea  my dear child i cant he seemed to feel however that something more must be said we shall meet again but its getting on isnt it toward the general scatter  yes and i hope that this year she answered youll have a good holiday  oh we shall meet before that i shall do what i can but upon my word i feel you know he laughed that such a tuningup as youve given me will last me a long time its like the high alps then with his hand out again he added have you any plans yourself  so many it might have seemed that she had no time to take for thinking of them i dare say i shall be away a good deal  he candidly wondered with mr longdon  yeswith him most  he had another pause really for a long time  a long long one i hope  your mothers willing again  oh perfectly and you see thats why  why she had said nothing more and he failed to understand  why you mustnt too much leave her alone dont nanda brought out  i wont but he presently added there are one or two things  well what are they  he produced in some seriousness the first wont she after all see the mitchys  not so much either that of course is now very different  vanderbank demurred but not for you i gatheris it dont you expect to see them  oh yesi hope theyll come down  he moved away a littlenot straight to the door to beccles funny place for them a little though isnt it  he had put the question as if for amusement but nanda took it literally ah not when theyre invited so very very charmingly not when he wants them so  mr longdon then that keeps up  thatshe was at a loss  i mean his intimacywith mitchy  so far as it is an intimacy  but didnt you by the wayand he looked again at his watchtell me theyre just about to turn up together  oh not so very particularly together  mitchy first alone vanderbank asked  she had a smile that was dim that was slightly strange unless youll stay for company  thanksimpossible and then mr longdon alone  unless mitchy stays  he had another pause you havent after all told me about the evolutionor the evolutionsof his wife  how can i if you dont give me time  i seeof course not he seemed to feel for an instant the return of his curiosity yet it wont do will it to have her out before him no i must go he came back to her and at present she gave him a hand but if you do see mr longdon alone will you do me a service i mean indeed not simply today but with all other good chances  she waited any service whatever but which first  well he returned in a moment let us call it a bargain i look after your mother  and i she had had to wait again  look after my good name i mean for common decency to him he has been of a kindness to me that when i think of my failure to return it makes me blush from head to foot ive odiously neglected himby a complication of accidents there are things i ought to have done that i havent theres one in particularbut it doesnt matter and i havent even explained about that ive been a brute and i didnt mean it and i couldnt help it but there it is say a good word for me make out somehow or other that im not a beast in short the young man said quite flushed once more with the intensity of his thought let us have it that you may quite trust me if youll let me a littlejust for my character as a gentlemantrust you  ah you may trust me nanda replied with her handshake  goodbye then he called from the door  goodbye she said after he had closed it    iii  it was halfpast five when mitchy turned up and her relapse had in the mean time known no arrest but the arrival of tea which however she had left unnoticed he expressed on entering the fear that he failed of exactitude to which she replied by the assurance that he was on the contrary remarkably near it and by the mention of all the aid to patience she had drawn from the pleasure of half an hour with mr vanan allusion that of course immediately provoked on mitchys part the liveliest interest  he has risked it at last then how tremendously exciting and your mother he went on after which as she said nothing did she see him i mean and is he perhaps with her now  no she wont have come inunless you asked  i didnt ask i asked only for you  nanda thought an instant but youll still sometimes come to see her wont you i mean you wont ever give her up  mitchy at this laughed out my dear child youre an adorable family  she took it placidly enough thats what mr van said he said im trying to make a career for her  did he her visitor though without prejudice to his amusement appeared struck you must have got in with him rather deep  she again considered well i think i did rather he was awfully beautiful and kind  oh mitchy concurred trust him always for that  he wrote me on my note nanda pursued a tremendously good answer  mitchy was struck afresh your note what note  to ask him to come i wrote at the beginning of the week  ohi see mitchy observed as if this were rather different he couldnt then of course have done less than come  yet his companion again thought i dont know  oh comei say you do know mitchy laughed i should like to see himor you either there would have been for a continuous spectator of these episodes an odd resemblance between the manner and all the movements that had followed his entrance and those that had accompanied the installation of his predecessor he laid his hat as vanderbank had done in three places in succession and appeared to question scarcely less the safety somewhere of his umbrella and the grace of retaining in his hand his gloves he postponed the final selection of a seat and he looked at the objects about him while he spoke of other matters quite in the same fashion indeed at last these objects impressed him how charming youve made your room and what a lot of nice things youve got  thats just what mr van said too he seemed immensely struck  but mitchy hereupon once more had a drop to extravagance can i do nothing then but repeat him i came you know to be original  it would be original for you nanda promptly returned to be at all like him but you wont she went back not sometimes come for mother only youll have plenty of chances  this he took up with more gravity what do you mean by chances that youre going away that will add to the attraction he exclaimed as she kept silence  i shall have to wait she answered at last to tell you definitely what im to do its all in the airyet i think i shall know today im to see mr longdon  mitchy wondered today  hes coming at halfpast six  and then youll know  wellhe will  mr longdon  i meant mr longdon she said after a moment  mitchy had his watch out then shall i interfere  there are quantities of time you must have your tea you see at any rate the girl continued what i mean by your chances  she had made him his tea which he had taken you do squeeze us in  well its an accident your coming togetherexcept of course that youre not together i simply took the time that you each independently proposed but it would have been all right even if you had met  that is i mean she explained even if you and mr longdon do mr van i confess i did want alone  mitchy had been glaring at her over his tea youre more and more remarkable  well then if i improve so give me your promise  mitchy as he partook of refreshment kept up his thoughtful gaze i shall presently want some more please but do you mind my asking if van knew  that mr longdons to come oh yes i told him and he left with me a message for him  a message how awfully interesting  nanda thought it will be awfullyto mr longdon  some more now please said mitchy while she took his cup and to mr longdon only eh is that a way of saying that its none of my business  the fact of her attendingand with a happy show of particular careto his immediate material want added somehow as she replied to her effect of sincerity ah mr mitchy the business of mine that has not by this time ever so naturally become a business of yourswell i cant think of any just now and i wouldnt you know if i could  i can promise you then that theres none of mine mitchy declared that hasnt made by the same token quite the same shift keep it well before you please that if ever a young woman had a grave lookout  what do you mean she interrupted by a grave lookout  well the certainty of finding herself saddled for all time to come with the affairs of a gentleman whom she can never get rid of on the specious plea that hes only her husband or her lover or her father or her son or her brother or her uncle or her cousin there as none of these characters he just stands  yes nanda kindly mused hes simply her mitchy  precisely and a mitchy you see iswhat do you call itsimply indissoluble hes moreover inordinately inquisitive he goes to the length of wondering whether van also learned that you were expecting me  oh yesi told him everything  mitchy smiled everything  i told himi told him she replied with impatience  mitchy hesitated and did he then leave me also a message  no nothing what im to do for him with mr longdon she immediately explained is to make practically a kind of apology  ah and for memitchy quickly took it upthere can be no question of anything of that kind i see he has done me no wrong  nanda with her eyes now on the window turned it over i dont much think he would know even if he had  i see i see and we wouldnt tell him  she turned with some abruptness from the outer view we wouldnt tell him but he was beautiful all round she went on no one could have been nicer about having for so long for instance come so little to the house as if he hadnt only too many other things to do he didnt even make them out nearly the good reasons he might but fancy with his important dutiesall the great affairs on his handsour making vulgar little rows about being neglected he actually made so little of what he might easily pleadspeaking so i mean as if he were all in the wrongthat one had almost positively to show him his excuses as ifshe really kept it uphe hasnt plenty  its only people like me mitchy threw out who have none  yespeople like you people of no use of no occupation and no importance like you you know she pursued there are so many then it was with no transition of tone that she added if youre bad mitchy i wont tell you anything  and if im good what will you tell me what i want really most to know is why he should be as you said just now apologetic to mr longdon whats the wrong he allows he has done him  oh he has neglected himif thats any comfort to usquite as much  hasnt looked him up and that sort of thing  yesand he mentioned some other matter  mitchy wondered mentioned it  in which said nanda he hasnt pleased him  mitchy after an instant risked it but what other matter  oh he says that when i speak to him mr longdon will know  mitchy gravely took this in and shall you speak to him  for mr van how she seemed to ask could he doubt it why the very first thing  and then will mr longdon tell you  what mr van means nanda thought welli hope not  mitchy followed it up you hope  why if its anything that could possibly make any one like him any less i mean i shant in that case in the least want to hear it  mitchy looked as if he could understand that and yet could also imagine something of a conflict but if mr longdon insists  on making me know i shant let him insist would you she put to him  oh im not in question  yes you are she quite rang out  ah mitchy laughed after which he added well then i might overbear you  no you mightnt she as positively declared again and you wouldnt at any rate desire to  this he finally showed he could take from hershowed it in the silence in which for a minute their eyes met then showed it perhaps even more in his deep exclamation youre complete  for such a proposition as well she had the same detached sense i dont think i am in anything but the wish to keep you so  wellkeep me keep me it strikes me that im not at all now on a footing you know of keeping myself i quite give you notice in fact mitchy went on that im going to come to you henceforth for everything but youre too wonderful he wound up as she at first said nothing to this i dont even frighten you  yesfortunately for you  ah but i distinctly warn you that i mean to do my very best for it  nanda viewed it all with as near an approach to gaiety as she often achieved well if you should ever succeed it would be a dark day for you  you bristle with your own guns he pursued but the ingenuity of a lifetime shall be devoted to my taking you on some quarter on which youre not prepared  and what quarter pray will that be  ah im not such a fool as to begin by giving you a tip mitchy on this turned off with an ambiguous but unmistakeably natural sigh he looked at photographs he took up a book or two as vanderbank had done and for a couple of minutes there was silence between them what does stretch before me he resumed after an interval during which clearly in spite of his movements he had looked at nothingwhat does stretch before me is the happy prospect of my feeling that ive found in you a friend with whom so utterly and unreservedly i can always go to the bottom of things this luxury you see now of our freedom to look facts in the face is one of which i promise you i mean fully to avail myself he stopped before her again and again she was silent its so awfully jolly isnt it that theres not at last a single thing that we cant take our ease about i mean that we cant intelligibly name and comfortably tackle weve worked through the long tunnel of artificial reserves and superstitious mysteries and i at least shall have only to feel that in showing every confidence and dotting every i i follow the example you so admirably set you go down to the roots good its all i ask  he had dropped into a chair as he talked and so long as she remained in her own they were confronted but she presently got up and the next moment while he kept his place was busy restoring order to the objects both her visitors had disarranged if you werent delightful youd be dreadful  there we are i could easily in other words frighten you if i would  she took no notice of the remark only after a few more scattered touches producing an observation of her own hes going all the same mr van to be charming to mother weve settled that  ah then he can make time  she judged it for as much as that yes for as much i mean as may sufficiently show her that he hasnt given her up so dont you recognise how much more time you can make  ahsee preciselythere we are again mitchy promptly ejaculated  yet he had gone it seemed further than she followed but where  why as i say at the roots and in the depths of things  oh she dropped to an indifference that was but part of her general patience for all his irony  its needless to go into the question of not giving your mother up one simply doesnt give her up one cant there she is  thats exactly what he says there she is  ah but i dont want to say nothing but what he says mitchy laughed he cant at all events have mentioned to you any such link as the one that in my case is now almost the most palpable ive got a wife you know  oh mitchy the girl protestingly though vaguely murmured  and my wifedid you know it mitchy went on is positively getting thick with your mother of course it isnt new to you that shes wonderful for wives now that our marriage is an accomplished fact she takes the greatest interest in itor bids fair to if her attention can only be thoroughly securedand more particularly in what i believe is generally called our peculiar situation for it appears you know that were to the most conspicuous degree possible in a peculiar situation aggies therefore already and is likely to be still more in whats universally recognised as your mothers regular line your mother will attract her study her finally understand her in fact shell help her as she has helped so many before and will help so many still to come with aggie thus as a satellite and a frequenterin a degree in which she never yet has been he continued what will the whole thing be but a practical multiplication of our points of contact you may remind me of mrs brooks contention that if she did in her time keep something of a saloon the saloon is now in consequence of events but a collection of fortuitous atoms but that my dear nanda will become none the less to your clearer sense but a pious echo of her momentary modesty orcall it at the worsther momentary despair the generations will come and go and the personnel as the newspapers say of the saloon will shift and change but the institution itself as resting on a deep human need has a long course yet to run and a good work yet to do we shant last but your mother will and as aggie is happily very young shes therefore provided for in the time to come on a scale sufficiently considerable to leave us just now at peace meanwhile as youre almost as good for husbands as mrs brook is for wives why arent we as a couple we mitchys quite ideally arranged for and why maynt i speak to you of my future as sufficiently guaranteed the only appreciable shadow i make out comes for me from the question of what may today be between you and mr longdon do i understand mitchy asked that hes presently to arrive for an answer to something he has put to you nanda looked at him a while with a sort of solemnity of tenderness and her voice when she at last spoke trembled with a feeling that clearly had grown in her as she listened to the string of whimsicalities bitter and sweet that he had just unrolled youre wild she said simplyyoure wild  he wonderfully glared am i then already frightening you he shook his head rather sadly im not in the least trying yet theres something he added after an instant that i do want too awfully to ask you  well then if she had not eagerness she had at least charity  oh but you see i reflect that though you show all the courage to go to the roots and depths with me im noti never have beenfully conscious of the nerve for doing as much with you its a question mitchy explained of how muchof a particular matteryou know  she continued ever so kindly to face him hasnt it come out all round now that i know everything  her reply in this form took a minute or two to operate but when it began to do so it fairly diffused a light mitchys face turned of a colour that might have been produced by her holding close to it some lantern wonderfully glazed you know you know he then rang out  of course i know  you know you know mitchy repeated  everything she imperturbably went on but what youre talking about  he was silent a little his eyes on her may i kiss your hand  no she answered thats what i call wild  he had risen with his question and after her reply he remained a moment on the spot seeive frightened you it proves as easy as that but i only wanted to show you and to be sure for myself now that ive the mental certitude i shall never wish otherwise to use it he turned away to begin again one of his absorbed revolutions mr longdon has asked you this time for a grand public adhesion and what he turns up for now is to receive your ultimatum a final irrevocable flight with him is the line he advises so that hell be ready for it on the spot with the postchaise and the pistols  the image appeared really to have for nanda a certain vividness and she looked at it a space without a hint of a smile we shant need any pistols whatever may be decided about the postchaise and any flight we may undertake together will need no cover of secrecy or night mother as ive told you  wont fling herself across your reckless path i remember said mitchyyou alluded to her magnificent resignation but father he oddly demanded  nanda thought for this a moment longer well mr longdon hasoff in the countrya good deal of shooting  so that edward can sometimes come down with his old gun good then tooif it isnt as he takes you by the way to shoot you youve got it all shipshape and arranged in other words and have only if the fancy does move you to clear out you clear outyou make all sorts of room it is interesting mitchy exclaimed arriving thus with you at the depths i look all round and see every one squared and every one but one or two suited why then reflexion and delay  you dont dear mr mitchy nanda took her time to return know nearly as much as you think  but isnt my question absolutely a confession of ignorance and a renunciation of thought i put myself from this moment forth with you mitchy declared on the footing of knowing nothing whatever and of receiving literally from your hands all information and all life let my continued attitude of dependence my dear nanda show it any hesitation you may yet feel you imply proceeds from a sense of duties in london not to be lightly renounced oh he thoughtfully said i do at least know you have them  she watched him with the same mildness while he vaguely circled about youre wild youre wild she insisted but it doesnt in the least matter i shant abandon you  he stopped short ah thats what i wanted from you in so many clearcut golden wordsthough i wont in the least of course pretend that ive felt i literally need it i dont literally need the big turquoise in my necktie which incidentally means by the way that if you should admire it youre quite welcome to it such wordsthats my pointare like such jewels the pride you see of ones heart theyre mere vanity but they help along youve got of course always poor tishy he continued  will you leave it all to me nanda said as if she had not heard him  and then youve got poor carrie he went on though her of course you rather divide with your mother  will you leave it all to me the girl repeated  to say nothing of poor cashmore he pursued whom you take all i believe yourself  will you leave it all to me she once more repeated  this time he pulled up suddenly and expressively wondering are you going to do anything about it at presenti mean with our friend  she appeared to have a scruple of saying but at last she produced it yeshe doesnt mind now  mitchy again laughed out you are as a family but he had already checked himself mr longdon will at any rate you imply be somehow interested  in my interests of coursesince he has gone so far you expressed surprise at my wanting to wait and think but how can i not wait and not think when so much depends on the questionnow so definiteof how much further he will go  i see said mitchy profoundly impressed and how much does that depend on  she had to reflect on how much further i for my part must  mitchys grasp was already complete and hes coming then to learn from you how far this is  yesvery much  mitchy looked about for his hat so that of course i see my times about up as youll want to be quite alone together  nanda glanced at the clock oh youve a margin yet  but you dont want an interval for your thinking  now that ive seen you nanda was already very obviously thoughtful  i mean if youve an important decision to take  well she returned seeing you has helped me  ah but at the same time worried you therefore and he picked up his umbrella  her eyes rested on its curious handle if you cling to your idea that im frightened youll be disappointed it will never be given you to reassure me  you mean by that that im primarily so solid  yes that till i see you yourself afraid  well  well i wont admit that anything isnt exactly what i was prepared for  mitchy looked with interest into his hat then what is it im to leave to you after which as she turned away from him with a suppressed sound and said while he watched her nothing else its no doubt natural for you to talk he went on but i do make you nervous goodbyegoodbye  she had stayed him by a fresh movement however as he reached the door aggies only trying to find out  yeswhat he asked waiting  why what sort of a person she is how can she ever have known it was carefully elaborately hidden from herkept so obscure that she could make out nothing she isnt now like me  he wonderingly attended like you  why i get the benefit of the fact that there was never a time when i didnt know something or other and that i became more and more aware as i grew older of a hundred little chinks of daylight  mitchy stared youre stupendous my dear he murmured  ah but she kept it up i had my idea about aggie  oh dont i know you had and how you were positive about the sort of person  that she didnt even suspect herself nanda broke in to be im equally positive now its quite what i believed only theres ever so much more of it more has comeand more will yet you see when there has been nothing before it all has to come with a rush so that if even im surprised of course she is  and of course i am mitchys interest though even now not wholly unqualified with amusement had visibly deepened you admit then he continued that youre surprised  nanda just hesitated at the mere scale of it i think its splendid the only person whose astonishment i dont quite understand she added is cousin jane  oh cousin janes astonishment serves her right  if she held so nanda pursued that marriage should do everything  she shouldnt be in such a funk at finding what it is doing oh no shes the last one mitchy declared i vow i enjoy her scare  but its very bad you know said nanda  oh too awful  well of course the girl appeared assentingly to muse she couldnt after all have dreamed but she took herself up the great thing is to be helpful  and in what way mitchy asked with his wonderful air of inviting competitive suggestions  toward aggies finding herself do you think she immediately continued that lord petherton really is  mitchy frankly considered helpful oh he does his best i gather yes he presently addedpethertons all right  its you yourself naturally his companion threw off who can help most  certainly and im doing my best too so that with such good assistancehe seemed at last to have taken it all from herwhat is it i again ask that as you request im to leave to you  nanda required while he still waited some time to reply to keep my promise  your promise  not to abandon you  ah cried mitchy thats better  then goodbye she said  goodbye but he came a few steps forward i maynt kiss your hand  never  never  never  oh he oddly sounded as he quickly went out    iv  the interval he had represented as likely to be useful to her was in fact however not a little abbreviated by a punctuality of arrival on mr longdons part so extreme as to lead the first thing to a word almost of apology you cant say her new visitor immediately began that i havent left you alone these many days as much as i promised on coming up to you that afternoon when after my return to town i found mr mitchett instead of your mother awaiting me in the drawingroom  yes said nanda youve really done quite as i asked you  well he returned i felt half an hour ago that near as i was to relief i could keep it up no longer so that though i knew it would bring me much too soon i started at six sharp for our trystingplace  and ive no tea after all to reward you it was but now clearly that she noticed it they must have removed the things without my heeding  her old friend looked at her with some intensity were you in the room  yesbut i didnt see the man come in  what then were you doing  nanda thought her smile was as usual the faintest discernible outward sign thinking of you  so tremendously hard  well of other things too and of other persons of everything really that in our last talk i told you i felt i must have out with myself before meeting you for what i suppose youve now in mind  mr longdon had kept his eyes on her but at this he turned away not however for an alternative embracing her material situation with the embarrassed optimism of vanderbank or the mitigated gloom of mitchy ahhe took her up with some drynessyouve been having things out with yourself but he went on before she answered i dont want any tea thank you i found myself after five in such a fidget that i went three times in the course of the hour to my club where ive the impression i each time had it i dare say it wasnt there though i did have it he after an instant pursued for ive somehow a confused image of a shop in oxford streetor was it rather in regentinto which i gloomily wandered to beguile the moments with a mixture that if i strike you as upset i beg you to set it all down to do you know in fact what ive been doing for the last ten minutes roaming hither and thither in your beautiful crescent till i could venture to come in  then did you see mitchy go out but no you wouldntnanda corrected herself he has been gone longer than that  her visitor had dropped on a sofa where propped by the back he sat rather upright his glasses on his nose his hands in his pockets and his elbows much turned out mitchy left you more than ten minutes ago and yet your state on his departure remains such that there could be a bustle of servants in the room without your being aware kindly give me a lead then as to what it is he has done to you  she hovered before him with her obscure smile you see it for yourself  he shook his head with decision i dont see anything for myself and i beg you to understand that its not what ive come here today to do anything i may yet see which i dont already see will be only i warn you so far as you shall make it very clear thereyouve work cut out and is it with mr mitchett may i ask that youve been as you mention cutting it  nanda looked about her as if weighing many things after which her eyes came back to him do you mind if i dont sit down  i dont mind if you stand on your headat the pass weve come to  i shall not try your patience the girl goodhumouredly replied so far as that i only want you not to be worried if i walk about a little  mr longdon without a movement kept his posture oh i cant oblige you there i shall be worried ive come on purpose to be worried and the more i surrender myself to the rack the more i seem to feel we shall have threshed our business out so you may dance you may stamp if you like on the absolutely passive thing youve made of me  well what i have had from mitchy she cheerfully responded is practically a lesson in dancing by which i perhaps mean rather a lesson in sitting myself as i want you to do while i talk as still as a mouse they take she declared while they talk an amount of exercise  they mr longdon wondered was his wife with him  dear nohe and mr van  was mr van with him  oh nobefore alone all over the place  mr longdon had a pause so rich in appeal that when he at last spoke his question was itself like an answer mr van has been to see you  yes i wrote and asked him  oh said mr longdon  but dont get up she raised her hand dont  why should i he had never budged  he was most kind stayed half an hour and when i told him you were coming left a good message for you  mr longdon appeared to wait for this tribute which was not immediately produced what do you call a good message  im to make it all right with you  to make what  why that he has not for so long been to see you or written to you that he has seemed to neglect you  nandas visitor looked so far about as to take the neighbourhood in general into the confidence of his surprise to neglect me  well others too i believewith whom were not concerned he has been so taken up but you above all  mr longdon showed on this a coldness that somehow spoke for itself as the greatest with which he had ever in his life met an act of reparation and that was infinitely confirmed by his sustained immobility but of what have i complained  oh i dont think he fancies youve complained  and how could he have come to see me he continued when for so many months past ive been so little in town  he was not more ready with objections however than his companion had by this time become with answers he must have been thinking of the time of your present stay he evidently has you much on his mindhe spoke of not having seen you  he has quite sufficiently triedhe has left cards mr longdon returned what more does he want  nanda looked at him with her long grave straightness which had often a play of light beyond any smile oh you know he does want more  then it was open to him  so he so strongly feelsshe quickly took him upthat you must have felt and therefore it is i speak for him  dont said mr longdon  but i promised him i would  dont her friend repeated as in stifled pain  she had kept for the time all her fine clearness turned to him but she might on this have been taken as giving him up with a movement of obedience and a strange soft sigh the smothered sound might even have represented to a listener at all initiated a consenting retreat before an effort greater than her reckoninga retreat that was in so far the snap of a sharp tension the next minute none the less she evidently found a fresh provocation in the sight of the pale and positively excessive rigour she had imposed so that though her friend was only accommodating himself to her wish she had a sudden impulse of criticism youre proud about ittoo proud  well what if i am he looked at her with a complexity of communication that no words could have meddled with prides all right when it helps one to bear things  ah said nanda but thats only when one wants to take the least from them when one wants to take the most  wellhe spoke as she faltered with a certain small hardness of interest  she faltered however indeed oh i dont know how to say it she fairly coloured with the attempt one must let the sense of all that i speak ofwell all come one must rather like it i dont knowbut i suppose one must rather grovel  mr longdon though with visible reluctance turned it over thats very finebut youre a woman  yesthat must make a difference but being a woman in such a case has then nanda went on its advantages  on this point perhaps her friend might presently have been taken as relaxing it strikes me that even at that the advantages are mainly for others im glad god knows that youre not also a young man  then were suited all round  she had spoken with a promptitude that appeared again to act on him slightly as an irritant for he met itwith more delayby a long and derisive murmur oh my pride but this she in no manner took up so that he was left for a little to his thoughts thats what you were plotting when you told me the other day that you wanted time  ah i wasnt plottingthough i was i confess trying to work things out that particular idea of simply asking mr van by letter to present himselfthat particular flight of fancy hadnt in fact then at all occurred to me  it never occurred im bound to say to me said mr longdon ive never thought of writing to him  very good but you havent the reasons i wanted to attack him  not about me i hope to god mr longdon distinctly a little paler rejoined  dont be afraid i think i had an instinct of how you would have taken that it was about mother  oh said her visitor  he has been worse to her than to you she continued but hell make it all right  mr longdons attention retained its grimness if he has such a remedy for the more then what has he for the less  nanda however was but for an instant checked  oh its i who make it up to you to mother you see theres no one otherwise to make it up  this at first unmistakeably sounded to him too complicated for acceptance but his face changed as light dawned that puts it then that you will come  ill come if youll take me as i amwhich is what i must previously explain to you i mean more than ive ever done before but what he means by what you call his remedy is my making you feel better about himself  the old man gazed at her your doing it is too beautiful and he could really come to you for the purpose of asking you  oh no said the girl briskly he came simply for the purpose of doing what he had to do after my letter how could he not come then he met most kindly what i said to him for mother and what he quite understood to be all my business with him so that his appeal to me to plead with you forwell for his creditwas only thrown in because he had so good a chance  this speech brought mr longdon abruptly to his feet but before she could warn him again of the patience she continued to need he had already as if what she evoked for him left him too stupefied dropped back into submission the man stood there for you to render him a servicefor you to help him and praise him  ah but it wasnt to go out of my way dont you see he knew you were presently to be here her anxiety that he should understand gave her a rare strained smile i mustnt makeas a request from himtoo much of it and ive not a doubt that rather than that you should think any ill of him for wishing me to say a word he would gladly be left with whatever bad appearance he may actually happen to have she pulled up on these words as with a quick sense of their really by their mere sound putting her in deeper and could only give her friend one of the looks that expressed if i could trust you not to assent even more than i want i should say you know what i mean she allowed him at all eventsor tried to allow himno time for uttered irony before going on he was everything you could have wished quite as beautiful about you  as about youmr longdon took her up  she demurred as about mother with which she turned away as if it handsomely settled the question  but it only left him as she went to the window sitting there sombre i like you know he brought out as his eyes followed her your saying youre not proud thank god you are my dear yesits better for us  at this after a moment in her place she turned round to him im glad im anythingwhatever you may call it and though i cant call it the samethats good for you  he said nothing more for a little as if by such a speech something in him were simplified and softened it would be good for meby which i mean it would be easier for meif you didnt quite so immensely care for him  oh came from nanda with an accent of attenuation at once so precipitate and so vague that it only made her attitude at first rather awkward oh she immediately repeated but with an increase of the same effect after which conscious she made as if to save herself a quick addition dear mr longdon isnt it rather yourself most  it would be easier for me he went on heedless if you didnt my poor child so wonderfully love him  ah but i dontplease believe me when i assure you i dont she broke out it burst from her flaring up in a queer quaver that ended in something queerer stillin her abrupt collapse on the spot into the nearest chair where she choked with a torrent of tears her buried face could only after a moment give way to the flood and she sobbed in a passion as sharp and brief as the flurry of a wild thing for an instant uncaged her old friend meantime keeping his place in the silence broken by her sound and distantlyacross the roomclosing his eyes to his helplessness and her shame thus they sat together while their trouble both conjoined and divided them she recovered herself however with an effort worthy of her fall and was on her feet again as she stammeringly spoke and angrily brushed at her eyes what difference in the world does it makewhat difference ever then clearly even with the words her checked tears suffered her to see how it made the difference that he too had been crying so that i dont know why you mind she thereupon wailed with extravagance  you dont know what i would have done for him you dont know you dont know he repeatedwhile she looked as if she naturally couldntas with a renewal of his dream of beneficence and of the soreness of his personal wound  well but he does you justicehe knows so it shows so it shows  but in this direction too unable to say what it showed she had again broken down and again could only hold herself and let her companion sit there ah nanda nanda he deeply murmured and the depth of the pity was vainly and blindly as the depth of a reproach  its iits i therefore she said as if she must then so look at it with him its i who am the horrible impossible and who have covered everything else with my own impossibility for some different person you could have done what you speak of and for some different person you can do it still  he stared at her with his barren sorrow a person different from him  a person different from me  and what interest have i in any such person  but your interest in meyou see well enough where that lands us  mr longdon now got to his feet and somewhat stiffly remained after which for all answer you say you will come then he asked then asseemingly with her last thoughtshe kept silent you understand clearly i take it that this time its never again to leave meor to be left  i understand she presently replied never again that she continued is why i asked you for these days  well then since youve taken them  ah but have you said nanda they were close to each other now and with a tenderness of warning that was helped by their almost equal stature she laid her hand on his shoulder what i did more than anything else write to him for she had now regained her clearness enough to explain was thatwith whatever idea you hadyou should see for yourself how he could come and go  and what good was that to do me hadnt i seen for myself  wellyouve seen once more here he was i didnt care what he thought here i brought him and his reasons remain  she kept her eyes on her companions face but his own now and afterwards seemed to wander far what do i care for his reasons so long as theyre not mine  she thought an instant still holding him gently and as if for successful argument but perhaps you dont altogether understand them  and why the devil altogether should i  ah because you distinctly want to said nanda ever so kindly youve admitted as much when weve talked  oh but when have we talked he sharply interrupted  this time he had challenged her so straight that it was her own look that strayed when  when  she hesitated when havent we  well you may have if thats what you call talkingnever saying a word but i havent ive only to do at any rate in the way of reasons with my own  and yours too then remain because you know the girl pursued i am like that  like what  like what he thinks then so gravely that it was almost a supplication dont tell me she added that you dont know what he thinks you do know  their eyes on that strange ground could meet at last and the effect of it was presently for mr longdon i do know  well  well he raised his hands and took her face which he drew so close to his own that as she gently let him he could kiss her with solemnity on the forehead come he then very firmly saidquite indeed as if it were a question of their moving on the spot  it literally made her smile which with a certain compunction she immediately corrected by doing for him in the pressure of her lips to his cheek what he had just done for herself today she more seriously asked  he looked at his watch tomorrow  she paused but clearly for assent thats what i mean by your taking me as i am it is you know for a girlextraordinary  oh i know what it is he exclaimed with an odd fatigue in his tenderness  but she continued with the shadow of her scruple to explain were many of us were most of usas you long ago saw and showed you feltextraordinary now we cant help it it isnt really our fault theres so much else thats extraordinary that if were in it all so much we must naturally be it was all obviously clearer to her than ever yet and her sense of it found renewed expression so that she might have been as she wound up a very much older person than her friend everythings different from what it used to be  yes everything he returned with an air of final indoctrination thats what he ought to have recognised  as you have nanda was once moreand completely nowenthroned in high justice oh hes more oldfashioned than you  much more said mr longdon with a queer face  he tried the girl went onhe did his best but he couldnt and hes so rightfor himself  her visitor before meeting this gathered in his hat and stick which for a minute occupied his attention he ought to have married  little aggie yes said nanda  they had gained the door where mr longdon again met her eyes and then mitchy  but she checked him with a quick gesture nonot even then  so again before he went they were for a minute confronted are you anxious about mitchy  she faltered but at last brought it out yes do you see there i am  i see there we are well said mr longdontomorrow
