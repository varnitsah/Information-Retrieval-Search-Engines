poetry of the revolution    a song of swords  a drove of cattle came into a village called swords and was stopped by the riotersdaily paper  in the place called swords on the irish road it is told for a new renown how we held the horns of the cattle and how we will hold the horns of the devils now ere the lord of hell with the horn on his brow is crowned in dublin town  light in the east and light in the west and light on the cruel lords on the souls that suddenly all men knew and the green flag flew and the red flag flew and many a wheel of the world stopped too when the cattle were stopped at swords  be they sinners or less than saints that smite in the street for rage we know where the shame shines bright we know you that they smite at you their foe lords of the lawless wage and low this is your lawful wage  you pinched a child to a torture price that you dared not name in words so black a jest was the silver bit that your own speech shook for the shame of it and the coward was plain as a cow they hit when the cattle have strayed at swords  the wheel of the torrent of wives went round to break mens brotherhood you gave the good irish blood to grease the clubs of your countrys enemies you saw the brave man beat to the knees and you saw that it was good  the rope of the rich is long and long the longest of hangmens cords but the kings and crowds are holding their breath in a giant shadow oer all beneath where god stands holding the scales of death between the cattle and swords  haply the lords that hire and lend the lowest of all mens lords who sell their kind like kine at a fair will find no head of their cattle there but faces of men where cattle were faces of menand swords    utopia of usurers   i art and advertisement  i propose subject to the patience of the reader to devote two or three articles to prophecy  like all healthyminded prophets sacred and profane i can only prophesy when i am in a rage and think things look ugly for everybody  and like all healthyminded prophets i prophesy in the hope that my prophecy may not come true  for the prediction made by the true soothsayer is like the warning given by a good doctor  and the doctor has really triumphed when the patient he condemned to death has revived to life  the threat is justified at the very moment when it is falsified  now i have said again and again and i shall continue to say again and again on all the most inappropriate occasions that we must hit capitalism and hit it hard for the plain and definite reason that it is growing stronger  most of the excuses which serve the capitalists as masks are of course the excuses of hypocrites  they lie when they claim philanthropy they no more feel any particular love of men than albu felt an affection for chinamen  they lie when they say they have reached their position through their own organising ability  they generally have to pay men to organise the mine exactly as they pay men to go down it  they often lie about the present wealth as they generally lie about their past poverty  but when they say that they are going in for a constructive social policy they do not lie  they really are going in for a constructive social policy  and we must go in for an equally destructive social policy and destroy while it is still halfconstructed the accursed thing which they construct   the example of the arts  now i propose to take one after another certain aspects and departments of modern life and describe what i think they will be like in this paradise of plutocrats this utopia of gold and brass in which the great story of england seems so likely to end  i propose to say what i think our new masters the mere millionaires will do with certain human interests and institutions such as art science jurisprudence or religionunless we strike soon enough to prevent them  and for the sake of argument i will take in this article the example of the arts  most people have seen a picture called bubbles which is used for the advertisement of a celebrated soap a small cake of which is introduced into the pictorial design  and anybody with an instinct for design the caricaturist of the daily herald for instance will guess that it was not originally a part of the design  he will see that the cake of soap destroys the picture as a picture as much as if the cake of soap had been used to scrub off the paint  small as it is it breaks and confuses the whole balance of objects in the composition  i offer no judgment here upon millaiss action in the matter in fact i do not know what it was the important point for me at the moment is that the picture was not painted for the soap but the soap added to the picture  and the spirit of the corrupting change which has separated us from that victorian epoch can be best seen in this that the victorian atmosphere with all its faults did not permit such a style of patronage to pass as a matter of course  michael angelo may have been proud to have helped an emperor or a pope though indeed i think he was prouder than they were on his own account  i do not believe sir john millais was proud of having helped a soapboiler  i do not say he thought it wrong but he was not proud of it and that marks precisely the change from his time to our own  our merchants have really adopted the style of merchant princes  they have begun openly to dominate the civilisation of the state as the emperors and popes openly dominated in italy  in millaiss time broadly speaking art was supposed to mean good art advertisement was supposed to mean inferior art  the head of a black man painted to advertise somebodys blacking could be a rough symbol like an inn sign  the black man had only to be black enough  an artist exhibiting the picture of a negro was expected to know that a black man is not so black as he is painted  he was expected to render a thousand tints of grey and brown and violet for there is no such thing as a black man just as there is no such thing as a white man  a fairly clear line separated advertisement from art   the first effect  i should say the first effect of the triumph of the capitalist if we allow him to triumph will be that that line of demarcation will entirely disappear  there will be no art that might not just as well be advertisement  i do not necessarily mean that there will be no good art much of it might be much of it already is very good art  you may put it if you please in the form that there has been a vast improvement in advertisements  certainly there would be nothing surprising if the head of a negro advertising somebodys blacking now adays were finished with as careful and subtle colours as one of the old and superstitious painters would have wasted on the negro king who brought gifts to christ  but the improvement of advertisements is the degradation of artists  it is their degradation for this clear and vital reason that the artist will work not only to please the rich but only to increase their riches which is a considerable step lower  after all it was as a human being that a pope took pleasure in a cartoon of raphael or a prince took pleasure in a statuette of cellini  the prince paid for the statuette but he did not expect the statuette to pay him  it is my impression that no cake of soap can be found anywhere in the cartoons which the pope ordered of raphael and no one who knows the smallminded cynicism of our plutocracy its secrecy its gambling spirit its contempt of conscience can doubt that the artistadvertiser will often be assisting enterprises over which he will have no moral control and of which he could feel no moral approval he will be working to spread quack medicines queer investments and will work for marconi instead of medici  and to this base ingenuity he will have to bend the proudest and purest of the virtues of the intellect the power to attract his brethren and the noble duty of praise  for that picture by millais is a very allegorical picture  it is almost a prophecy of what uses are awaiting the beauty of the child unborn  the praise will be of a kind that may correctly be called soap and the enterprises of a kind that may truly be described as bubbles   ii letters and the new laureates  in these articles i only take two or three examples of the first and fundamental fact of our time  i mean the fact that the capitalists of our community are becoming quite openly the kings of it  in my last and first article i took the case of art and advertisement  i pointed out that art must be growing worsemerely because advertisement is growing better  in those days millais condescended to pears soap  in these days i really think it would be pears who condescended to millais  but here i turn to an art i know more about that of journalism  only in my ease the art verges on artlessness  the great difficulty with the english lies in the absence of something one may call democratic imagination  we find it easy to realise an individual but very hard to realise that the great masses consist of individuals our system has been aristocratic in the special sense of there being only a few actors on the stage  and the back scene is kept quite dark though it is really a throng of faces  home rule tended to be not so much the irish as the grand old man  the boer war tended not to be so much south africa as simply joe  and it is the amusing but distressing fact that every class of political leadership as it comes to the front in its turn catches the rays of this isolating limelight and becomes a small aristocracy  certainly no one has the aristocratic complaint so badly as the labour party  at the recent congress the real difference between larkin and the english labour leaders was not so much in anything right or wrong in what he said as in something elemental and even mystical in the way he suggested a mob  but it must be plain even to those who agree with the more official policy that for mr havelock wilson the principal question was mr havelock wilson and that mr sexton was mainly considering the dignity and fine feelings of mr sexton  you may say they were as sensitive as aristocrats or as sulky as babies the point is that the feeling was personal  but larkin like danton not only talks like ten thousand men talking but he also has some of the carelessness of the colossus of arcis que mon nom soit fletri que la france soit libre   a dance of degradation  it is needless to say that this respecting of persons has led all the other parties a dance of degradation  we ruin south africa because it would be a slight on lord gladstone to save south africa  we have a bad army because it would be a snub to lord haldane to have a good army and no tory is allowed to say marconi for fear mr george should say kynoch  but this curious personal element with its appalling lack of patriotism has appeared in a new and curious form in another department of life the department of literature especially periodical literature and the form it takes is the next example i shall give of the way in which the capitalists are now appearing more and more openly as the masters and princes of the community  i will take a victorian instance to mark the change as i did in the case of the advertisement of bubbles  it was said in my childhood by the more apoplectic and elderly sort of tory that w e gladstone was only a free trader because he had a partnership in gilbeys foreign wines  this was no doubt nonsense but it had a dim symbolic or mainly prophetic truth in it  it was true to some extent even then and it has been increasingly true since that the statesman was often an ally of the salesman and represented not only a nation of shopkeepers but one particular shop  but in gladstones time even if this was true it was never the whole truth and no one would have endured it being the admitted truth  the politician was not solely an eloquent and persuasive bagman travelling for certain business men he was bound to mix even his corruption with some intelligible ideals and rules of policy  and the proof of it is this that at least it was the statesman who bulked large in the public eye and his financial backer was entirely in the background old gentlemen might choke over their port with the moral certainty that the prime minister had shares in a wine merchants  but the old gentleman would have died on the spot if the wine merchant had really been made as important as the prime minister  if it had been sir walter gilbey whom disraeli denounced or punch caricatured if sir walter gilbeys favourite collars with the design of which i am unacquainted had grown as large as the wings of an archangel if sir walter gilbey had been credited with successfully eliminating the british oak with his little hatchet if near the temple and the courts of justice our sight was struck by a majestic statue of a wine merchant or if the earnest conservative lady who threw a gingerbreadnut at the premier had directed it towards the wine merchant instead the shock to victorian england would have been very great indeed   haloes for employers  now something very like that is happening the mere wealthy employer is beginning to have not only the power but some of the glory  i have seen in several magazines lately and magazines of a high class the appearance of a new kind of article  literary men are being employed to praise a big business man personally as men used to praise a king  they not only find political reasons for the commercial schemesthat they have done for some time pastthey also find moral defences for the commercial schemers they describe the capitalists brain of steel and heart of gold in a way that englishmen hitherto have been at least in the habit of reserving for romantic figures like garibaldi or gordon  in one excellent magazine mr t p oconnor who when he likes can write on letters like a man of letters has some purple pages of praise of sir joseph lyonsthe man who runs those teashop places  he incidentally brought in a delightful passage about the beautiful souls possessed by some people called salmon and gluckstein  i think i like best the passage where he said that lyonss charming social acaccomplishments included a talent for imitating a jew  the article is accompanied with a large and somewhat leering portrait of that shopkeeper which makes the parlourtrick in question particularly astonishing  another literary man who certainly ought to know better wrote in another paper a piece of heroworship about mr selfridge  no doubt the fashion will spread and the art of words as polished and pointed by ruskin or meredith will be perfected yet further to explore the labyrinthine heart of harrod or compare the simple stoicism of marshall with the saintly charm of snelgrove  any man can be praisedand rightly praised  if he only stands on two legs he does something a cow cannot do  if a rich man can manage to stand on two legs for a reasonable time it is called selfcontrol  if he has only one leg it is called with some truth selfsacrifice  i could say something nice and true about every man i have ever met  therefore i do not doubt i could find something nice about lyons or selfridge if i searched for it  but i shall not  the nearest postman or cabman will provide me with just the same brain of steel and heart of gold as these unlucky lucky men  but i do resent the whole age of patronage being revived under such absurd patrons and all poets becoming court poets under kings that have taken no oath nor led us into any battle    iii unbusinesslike business  the fairy tales we were all taught did not like the history we were all taught consist entirely of lies  parts of the tale of puss in boots or jack and the beanstalk may strike the realistic eye as a little unlikely and out of the common way so to speak but they contain some very solid and very practical truths  for instance it may be noted that both in puss in boots and jack and the beanstalk if i remember aright the ogre was not only an ogre but also a magician  and it will generally be found that in all such popular narratives the king if he is a wicked king is generally also a wizard  now there is a very vital human truth enshrined in this  bad government like good government is a spiritual thing  even the tyrant never rules by force alone but mostly by fairy tales  and so it is with the modern tyrant the great employer  the sight of a millionaire is seldom in the ordinary sense an enchanting sight nevertheless he is in his way an enchanter  as they say in the gushing articles about him in the magazines he is a fascinating personality  so is a snake  at least he is fascinating to rabbits and so is the millionaire to the rabbitwitted sort of people that ladies and gentlemen have allowed themselves to become  he does in a manner cast a spell such as that which imprisoned princes and princesses under the shapes of falcons or stags  he has truly turned men into sheep as circe turned them into swine  now the chief of the fairy tales by which he gains this glory and glamour is a certain hazy association he has managed to create between the idea of bigness and the idea of practicality  numbers of the rabbitwitted ladies and gentlemen do really think in spite of themselves and their experience that so long as a shop has hundreds of different doors and a great many hot and unhealthy underground departments they must be hot this is very important and more people than would be needed for a manofwar or crowded cathedral to say this way madam and the next article sir it follows that the goods are good  in short they hold that the big businesses are businesslike  they are not  any housekeeper in a truthful mood that is to say any housekeeper in a bad temper will tell you that they are not  but housekeepers too are human and therefore inconsistent and complex and they do not always stick to truth and bad temper  they are also affected by this queer idolatry of the enormous and elaborate and cannot help feeling that anything so complicated must go like clockwork  but complexity is no guarantee of accuracyin clockwork or in anything else  a clock can be as wrong as the human head and a clock can stop as suddenly as the human heart  but this strange poetry of plutocracy prevails over people against their very senses  you write to one of the great london stores or emporia asking let us say for an umbrella  a month or two afterwards you receive a very elaborately constructed parcel containing a broken parasol you are very pleased  you are gratified to reflect on what a vast number of assistants and employees had combined to break that parasol you luxuriate in the memory of all those long rooms and departments and wonder in which of them the parasol that you never ordered was broken  or you want a toy elephant for your child on christmas day as children like all nice and healthy people are very ritualistic  some week or so after twelfth night let us say you have the pleasure of removing three layers of pasteboards five layers of brown paper and fifteen layers of tissue paper and discovering the fragments of an artificial crocodile  you smile in an expansive spirit  you feel that your soul has been broadened by the vision of incompetence conducted on so large a scale  you admire all the more the colossal and omnipresent brain of the organiser of industry who amid all his multitudinous cares did not disdain to remember his duty of smashing even the smallest toy of the smallest child  or supposing you have asked him to send you some two rolls of cocoanut matting and supposing after a due interval for reflection he duly delivers to you the five rolls of wire netting  you take pleasure in the consideration of a mystery which coarse minds might have called a mistake  it consoles you to know how big the business is and what an enormous number of people were needed to make such a mistake  that is the romance that has been told about the big shops in the literature and art which they have bought and which as i said in my recent articles will soon be quite indistinguishable from their ordinary advertisements  the literature is commercial and it is only fair to say that the commerce is often really literary  it is no romance but only rubbish  the big commercial concerns of today are quite exceptionally incompetent they will be even more incompetent when they are omnipotent  indeed that is and always has been the whole point of a monopoly the old and sound argument against a monopoly  it is only because it is incompetent that it has to be omnipotent  when one large shop occupies the whole of one side of a street or sometimes both sides it does so in order that men may be unable to get what they want and may be forced to buy what they dont want  that the rapidly approaching kingdom of the capitalists will ruin art and letters i have already said  i say here that in the only sense that can be called human it will ruin trade too  i will not let christmas go by even when writing for a revolutionary paper necessarily appealing to many with none of my religious sympathies without appealing to those sympathies  i knew a man who sent to a great rich shop for a figure for a group of bethlehem  it arrived broken  i think that is exactly all that business men have now the sense to do    iv the war on holidays  the general proposition not always easy to define exhaustively that the reign of the capitalist will be the reign of the cadthat is of the unlicked type that is neither the citizen nor the gentlemancan be excellently studied in its attitude towards holidays  the special emblematic employer of today especially the model employer who is the worst sort has in his starved and evil heart a sincere hatred of holidays i do not mean that he necessarily wants all his workmen to work until they drop that only occurs when he happens to be stupid as well as wicked i do not mean to say that he is necessarily unwilling to grant what he would call decent hours of labour he may treat men like dirt but if you want to make money even out of dirt you must let it lie fallow by some rotation of rest  he may treat men as dogs but unless he is a lunatic he will for certain periods let sleeping dogs lie  but humane and reasonable hours for labour have nothing whatever to do with the idea of holidays  it is not even a question of tenhours day and eighthours day it is not a question of cutting down leisure to the space necessary for food sleep and exercise  if the modern employer came to the conclusion for some reason or other that he could get most out of his men by working them hard for only two hours a day his whole mental attitude would still be foreign and hostile to holidays  for his whole mental attitude is that the passive time and the active time are alike useful for him and his business  all is indeed grist that comes to his mill including the millers  his slaves still serve him in unconsciousness as dogs still hunt in slumber  his grist is ground not only by the sounding wheels of iron but by the soundless wheel of blood and brain  his sacks are still filling silently when the doors are shut on the streets and the sound of the grinding is low   the great holiday  now a holiday has no connection with using a man either by beating or feeding him  when you give a man a holiday you give him back his body and soul  it is quite possible you may be doing him an injury though he seldom thinks so but that does not affect the question for those to whom a holiday is holy  immortality is the great holiday and a holiday like the immortality in the old theologies is a doubleedged privilege  but wherever it is genuine it is simply the restoration and completion of the man  if people ever looked at the printed word under their eye the word recreation would be like the word resurrection the blast of a trumpet   a man being merely useful is necessarily incomplete especially if he be a modern man and means by being useful being utilitarian a man going into a modern club gives up his hat a man going into a modern factory gives up his head  he then goes in and works loyally for the old firm to build up the great fabric of commerce which can be done without a head but when he has done work he goes to the cloakroom like the man at the club and gets his head back again that is the germ of the holiday  it may be urged that the club man who leaves his hat often goes away with another hat and perhaps it may be the same with the factory hand who has left his head  a hand that has lost its head may affect the fastidious as a mixed metaphor but god pardon us all what an unmixed truth  we could almost prove the whole ease from the habit of calling human beings merely hands while they are working as if the hand were horribly cut off like the hand that has offended as if while the sinner entered heaven maimed his unhappy hand still laboured laying up riches for the lords of hell but to return to the man whom we found waiting for his head in the cloakroom  it may be urged we say that he might take the wrong head like the wrong hat but here the similarity ceases  for it has been observed by benevolent onlookers at lifes drama that the hat taken away by mistake is frequently better than the real hat whereas the head taken away after the hours of toil is certainly worse stained with the cobwebs and dust of this dustbin of all the centuries   the supreme adventure  all the words dedicated to places of eating and drinking are pure and poetic words  even the word hotel is the word hospital  and st julien whose claret i drank this christmas was the patron saint of innkeepers because as far as i can make out he was hospitable to lepers  now i do not say that the ordinary hotelkeeper in piccadilly or the avenue de lopera would embrace a leper slap him on the back and ask him to order what he liked but i do say that hospitality is his trade virtue  and i do also say it is well to keep before our eyes the supreme adventure of a virtue  if you are brave think of the man who was braver than you  if you are kind think of the man who was kinder than you  that is what was meant by having a patron saint  that is the link between the poor saint who received bodily lepers and the great hotel proprietor who as a rule receives spiritual lepers  but a word yet weaker than hotel illustrates the same pointthe word restaurant  there again you have the admission that there is a definite building or statue to restore that ineffaceable image of man that some call the image of god and that is the holiday it is the restaurant or restoring thing that by a blast of magic turns a man into himself  this complete and reconstructed man is the nightmare of the modern capitalist  his whole scheme would crack across like a mirror of shallot if once a plain man were ready for his two plain dutiesready to live and ready to die  and that horror of holidays which marks the modern capitalist is very largely a horror of the vision of a whole human being something that is not a hand or a head for figutes  but an awful creature who has met himself in the wilderness  the employers will give time to eat time to sleep they are in terror of a time to think  to anyone who knows any history it is wholly needless to say that holidays have been destroyed  as mr belloc who knows much more history than you or i recently pointed out in the pall mall magazine shakespeares title of twelfth night or what you will simply meant that a winter carnival for everybody went on wildly till the twelfth night after christmas  those of my readers who work for modern offices or factories might ask their employers for twelve days holidays after christmas  and they might let me know the reply    v the church of the servile state  i confess i cannot see why mere blasphemy by itself should be an excuse for tyranny and treason or how the mere isolated fact of a man not believing in god should be a reason for my believing in him  but the rather spinsterish flutter among some of the old freethinkers has put one tiny ripple of truth in it and that affects the idea which i wish to emphasise even to monotony in these pages  i mean the idea that the new community which the capitalists are now constructing will be a very complete and absolute community and one which will tolerate nothing really independent of itself  now it is true that any positive creed true or false would tend to be independent of itself  it might be roman catholicism or mahomedanism or materialism but if strongly held it would be a thorn in the side of the servile state  the moslem thinks all men immortal the materialist thinks all men mortal  but the moslem does not think the rich sinbad will live forever but the poor sinbad will die on his deathbed  the materialist does not think that mr haeckel will go to heaven while all the peasants will go to pot like their chickens in every serious doctrine of the destiny of men there is some trace of the doctrine of the equality of men  but the capitalist really depends on some religion of inequality  the capitalist must somehow distinguish himself from human kind he must be obviously above itor he would be obviously below it  take even the least attractive and popular side of the larger religions today take the mere vetoes imposed by islam on atheism or catholicism  the moslem veto upon intoxicants cuts across all classes  but it is absolutely necessary for the capitalist who presides at a licensing committee and also at a large dinner it is absolutely necessary for him to make a distinction between gin and champagne  the atheist veto upon all miracles cuts across all classes  but it is absolutely necessary for the capitalist to make a distinction between his wife who is an aristocrat and consults crystal gazers and star gazers in the west end and vulgar miracles claimed by gipsies or travelling showmen  the catholic veto upon usury as defined in dogmatic councils cuts across all classes  but it is absolutely necessary to the capitalist to distinguish more delicately between two kinds of usury the kind he finds useful and the kind he does not find useful  the religion of the servile state must have no dogmas or definitions  it cannot afford to have any definitions  for definitions are very dreadful things they do the two things that most men especially comfortable men cannot endure they fight and they fight fair  every religion apart from open devil worship must appeal to a virtue or the pretence of a virtue  but a virtue generally speaking does some good to everybody  it is therefore necessary to distinguish among the people it was meant to benefit those whom it does benefit  modern broadmindedness benefits the rich and benefits nobody else  it was meant to benefit the rich and meant to benefit nobody else  and if you think this unwarranted i will put before you one plain question  there are some pleasures of the poor that may also mean profits for the rich there are other pleasures of the poor which cannot mean profits for the rich  watch this one contrast and you will watch the whole creation of a careful slavery  in the last resort the two things called beer and soap end only in a froth they are both below the high notice of a real religion  but there is just this difference that the soap makes the factory more satisfactory while the beer only makes the workman more satisfied  wait and see if the soap does not increase and the beer decrease  wait and see whether the religion of the servile state is not in every case what i say the encouragement of small virtues supporting capitalism the discouragement of the huge virtues that defy it  many great religions pagan and christian have insisted on wine  only one i think has insisted on soap you will find it in the new testament attributed to the pharisees    vi science and the eugenists  the key fact in the new development of plutocracy is that it will use its own blunder as an excuse for further crimes  everywhere the very completeness of the impoverishment will be made a reason for the enslavement though the men who impoverished were the same who enslaved it is as if a highwayman not only took away a gentlemans horse and all his money but then handed him over to the police for tramping without visible means of subsistence  and the most monstrous feature in this enormous meanness may be noted in the plutocratic appeal to science or rather to the pseudoscience that they call eugenics  the eugenists get the ear of the humane but rather hazy cliques by saying that the present conditions under which people work and breed are bad for the race but the modern mind will not generally stretch beyond one step of reasoning and the consequence which appears to follow on the consideration of these conditions is by no means what would originally have been expected  if somebody says a rickety cradle may mean a rickety baby the natural deduction one would think would be to give the people a good cradle or give them money enough to buy one  but that means higher wages and greater equalisation of wealth and the plutocratic scientist with a slightly troubled expression turns his eyes and pincenez in another direction  reduced to brutal terms of truth his difficulty is this and simply this more food leisure and money for the workman would mean a better workman better even from the point of view of anyone for whom he worked  but more food leisure and money would also mean a more independent workman  a house with a decent fire and a full pantry would be a better house to make a chair or mend a clock in even from the customers point of view than a hovel with a leaky roof and a cold hearth  but a house with a decent fire and a full pantry would also be a better house in which to refuse to make a chair or mend a clocka much better house to do nothing inand doing nothing is sometimes one of the highest of the duties of man  all but the hardhearted must be torn with pity for this pathetic dilemma of the rich man who has to keep the poor man just stout enough to do the work and just thin enough to have to do it  as he stood gazing at the leaky roof and the rickety cradle in a pensive manner there one day came into his mind a new and curious ideaone of the most strange simple and horrible ideas that have ever risen from the deep pit of original sin  the roof could not be mended or at least it could not be mended much without upsetting the capitalist balance or rather disproportion in society for a man with a roof is a man with a house and to that extent his house is his castle  the cradle could not be made to rock easier or at least not much easier without strengthening the hands of the poor household for the hand that rocks the cradle rules the worldto that extent  but it occurred to the capitalist that there was one sort of furniture in the house that could be altered  the husband and wife could be altered  birth costs nothing except in pain and valour and such oldfashioned things and the merchant need pay no more for mating a strong miner to a healthy fishwife than he pays when the miner mates himself with a less robust female whom he has the sentimentality to prefer thus it might be possible by keeping on certain broad lines of heredity to have some physical improvement without any moral political or social improvement  it might be possible to keep a supply of strong and healthy slaves without coddling them with decent conditions  as the millowners use the wind and the water to drive their mills they would use this natural force as something even cheaper and turn their wheels by diverting from its channel the blood of a man in his youth  that is what eugenics means and that is all that it means  of the moral state of those who think of such things it does not become us to speak  the practical question is rather the intellectual one of whether their calculations are well founded and whether the men of science can or will guarantee them any such physical certainties fortunately it becomes clearer every day that they are scientifically speaking building on the shifting sand  the theory of breeding slaves breaks down through what a democrat calls the equality of men but which even an oligarchist will find himself forced to call the similarity of men that is that though it is not true that all men are normal it is overwhelmingly certain that most men are normal  all the common eugenic arguments are drawn from extreme cases which even if human honour and laughter allowed of their being eliminated would not by their elimination greatly affect the mass  for the rest there remains the enormous weakness in eugenics that if ordinary mens judgment or liberty is to be discounted in relation to heredity the judgment of the judges must be discounted in relation to their heredity  the eugenic professor may or may not succeed in choosing a babys parents it is quite certain that he cannot succeed in choosing his own parents  all his thoughts including his eugenic thoughts are by the very principle of those thoughts flowing from a doubtful or tainted source  in short we should need a perfectly wise man to do the thing at all  and if he were a wise man he would not do it    vii the evolution of the prison  i have never understood why it is that those who talk most about evolution and talk it in the very age of fashionable evolutionism do not see the one way in which evolution really does apply to our modern difficulty there is of course an element of evolutionism in the universe and i know no religion or philosophy that ever entirely ignored it  evolution popularly speaking is that which happens to unconscious things  they grow unconsciously or fade unconsciously or rather some parts of them grow and some parts of them fade and at any given moment there is almost always some presence of thc fading thing and some incompleteness in the growing one  thus if i went to sleep for a hundred years like the sleeping beauty i wish i could i should grow a beardunlike the sleeping beauty  and just as i should grow hair if i were asleep i should grow grass if i were dead  those whose religion it was that god was asleep were perpetually impressed and affected by the fact that he had a long beard  and those whose philosophy it is that the universe is dead from the beginning being the grave of nobody in particular think that is the way that grass can grow  in any case these developments only occur with dead or dreaming things  what happens when everyone is asleep is called evolution  what happens when everyone is awake is called revolution  there was once an honest man whose name i never knew but whose face i can almost see it is framed in victorian whiskers and fixed in a victorian neckcloth who was balancing the achievements of france and england in civilisation and social efficiencies  and when he came to the religious aspect he said that there were more stone and brick churches used in france but on the other hand there are more sects in england whether such a lively disintegration is a proof of vitality in any valuable sense i have always doubted  the sun may breed maggots in a dead dog but it is essential for such a liberation of life that the dog should be unconscious or to say the least of it absentminded  broadly speaking you may call the thing corruption if you happen to like dogs you may call it evolution if you happen to like maggots  in either case it is what happens to things if you leave them alone   the evolutionists error  now the modern evolutionists have made no real use of the idea of evolution especially in the matter of social prediction  they always fall into what is from their logical point of view the error of supposing that evolution knows what it is doing  they predict the state of the future as a fruit rounded and polished  but the whole point of evolution the only point there is in it is that no state will ever be rounded and polished because it will always contain some organs that outlived their use and some that have not yet fully found theirs  if we wish to prophesy what will happen we must imagine things now moderate grown enormous things now local grown universal things now promising grown triumphant primroses bigger than sunflowers and sparrows stalking about like flamingoes  in other words we must ask what modern institution has a future before it  what modern institution may have swollen to six times its present size in the social heat and growth of the future  i do not think the garden city will grow but of that i may speak in my next and last article of this series  i do not think even the ordinary elementary school with its compulsory education will grow  too many unlettered people hate the teacher for teaching and too many lettered people hate the teacher for not teaching  the garden city will not bear much blossom the young idea will not shoot unless it shoots the teacher  but the one flowering tree on the estate the one natural expansion which i think will expand is the institution we call the prison   prisons for all  if the capitalists are allowed to erect their constructive capitalist community i speak quite seriously when i say that i think prison will become an almost universal experience  it will not necessarily be a cruel or shameful experience on these points i concede certainly for the present purpose of debate it may be a vastly improved experience  the conditions in the prison very possibly will be made more humane  but the prison will be made more humane only in order to contain more of humanity  i think little of the judgment and sense of humour of any man who can have watched recent police trials without realising that it is no longer a question of whether the law has been broken by a crime but now solely a question of whether the situation could be mended by an imprisonment  it was so with tom mann it was so with larkin it was so with the poor atheist who was kept in gaol for saying something he had been acquitted of saying it is so in such cases day by day  we no longer lock a man up for doing something we lock him up in the hope of his doing nothing  given this principle it is evidently possible to make the mere conditions of punishment more moderate ormore probably more secret there may really be more mercy in the prison on condition that there is less justice in the court  i should not be surprised if before we are done with all this a man was allowed to smoke in prison on condition of course that he had been put in prison for smoking  now that is the process which in the absence of democratic protest will certainly proceed will increase and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it  prison may even lose its disgrace for a little time it will be difficult to make it disgraceful when men like larkin can be imprisoned for no reason at all just as his celebrated ancestor was hanged for no reason at all  but capitalist society which naturally does not know the meaning of honour cannot know the meaning of disgrace and it will still go on imprisoning for no reason at all  or rather for that rather simple reason that makes a cat spring or a rat run away  it matters little whether our masters stoop to state the matter in the form that every prison should be a school or in the more candid form that every school should be a prison  they have already fulfilled their servile principle in the case of the schools  everyone goes to the elementary schools except the few people who tell them to go there  i prophesy that unless our revolt succeeds nearly everyone will be going to prison with a precisely similar patience    viii the lash for labour  if i were to prophesy that two hundred years hence a grocer would have the right and habit of beating the grocers assistant with a stick or that shop girls might be flogged as they already can be fined many would regard it as rather a rash remark  it would be a rash remark  prophecy is always unreliable unless we except the kind which is avowedly irrational mystical and supernatural prophecy  but relatively to nearly all the other prophecies that are being made around me today i should say my prediction stood an exceptionally good chance  in short i think the grocer with the stick is a figure we are far more likely to see than the superman or the samurai or the true model employer or the perfect fabian official or the citizen of the collectivist state  and it is best for us to see the full ugliness of the transformation which is passing over our society in some such abrupt and even grotesque image at the end of it  the beginnings of a decline in every age of history have always had the appearance of being reforms  nero not only fiddled while rome was burning but he probably really paid more attention to the fiddle than to the fire  the roi soleil like many other soleils was most splendid to all appearance a little before sunset  and if i ask myself what will be the ultimate and final fruit of all our social reforms garden cities model employers insurances exchanges arbitration courts and so on then i say quite seriously i think it will be labour under the lash   the sultan and the sack  let us arrange in some order a number of converging considerations that all point in this direction  1 it is broadly true no doubt that the weapon of the employer has hitherto been the threat of dismissal that is the threat of enforced starvation  he is a sultan who need not order the bastinado so long as he can order the sack  but there are not a few signs that this weapon is not quite so convenient and flexible a one as his increasing rapacities require  the fact of the introduction of fines secretly or openly in many shops and factories proves that it is convenient for the capitalists to have some temporary and adjustable form of punishment besides the final punishment of pure ruin  nor is it difficult to see the commonsense of this from their wholly inhuman point of view  the act of sacking a man is attended with the same disadvantages as the act of shooting a man one of which is that you can get no more out of him  it is i am told distinctly annoying to blow a fellow creatures brains out with a revolver and then suddenly remember that he was the only person who knew where to get the best russian cigarettes  so our sultan who is the orderer of the sack is also the bearer of the bowstring  a school in which there was no punishment except expulsion would be a school in which it would be very difficult to keep proper discipline and the sort of discipline on which the reformed capitalism will insist will be all of the type which in free nations is imposed only on children such a school would probably be in a chronic condition of breaking up for the holidays  and the reasons for the insufficiency of this extreme instrument are also varied and evident  the materialistic sociologists who talk about the survival of the fittest and the weakest going to the wall and whose way of looking at the world is to put on the latest and most powerful scientific spectacles and then shut their eyes frequently talk as if a workman were simply efficient or nonefficient as if a criminal were reclaimable or irreclaimable  the employers have sense enough at least to know better than that  they can see that a servant may be useful in one way and exasperating in another that he may be bad in one part of his work and good in another that he may be occasionally drunk and yet generally indispensable  just as a practical schoolmaster would know that a schoolboy can be at once the plague and the pride of the school  under these circumstances small and varying penalties are obviously the most convenient things for the person keeping order an underling can be punished for coming late and yet do useful work when he comes  it will be possible to give a rap over the knuckles without wholly cutting off the right hand that has offended  under these circumstances the employers have naturally resorted to fines  but there is a further ground for believing that the process will go beyond fines before it is completed  2 the fine is based on the old european idea that everybody possesses private property in some reasonable degree but not only is this not true today but it is not being made any truer even by those who honestly believe that they are mending matters  the great employers will often do something towards improving what they call the conditions of their workers but a worker might have his conditions as carefully arranged as a racehorse has and still have no more personal property than a racehorse if you take an average poor seamstress or factory girl you will find that the power of chastising her through her property has very considerable limits it is almost as hard for the employer of labour to tax her for punishment as it is for the chancellor of the exchequer to tax her for revenue  the next most obvious thing to think of of course would be imprisonment and that might be effective enough under simpler conditions an oldfashioned shopkeeper might have locked up his apprentice in his coalcellar but his coalcellar would be a real pitch dark coalcellar and the rest of his house would be a real human house  everybody especially the apprentice would see a most perceptible difference between the two  but as i pointed out in the article before this the whole tendency of the capitalist legislation and experiment is to make imprisonment much more general and automatic while making it or professing to make it more humane  in other words the hygienic prison and the servile factory will become so uncommonly like each other that the poor man will hardly know or care whether he is at the moment expiating an offence or merely swelling a dividend  in both places there will be the same sort of shiny tiles  in neither place will there be any cell so unwholesome as a coalcellar or so wholesome as a home  the weapon of the prison therefore like the weapon of the fine will be found to have considerable limitations to its effectiveness when employed against the wretched reduced citizen of our day  whether it be property or liberty you cannot take from him what he has not got  you cannot imprison a slave because you cannot enslave a slave   the barbarous revival  3 most people on hearing the suggestion that it may come to corporal punishment at last as it did in every slave system i ever heard of including some that were generally kindly and even successful will merely be struck with horror and incredulity and feel that such a barbarous revival is unthinkable in the modern atmosphere  how far it will be or need be a revival of the actual images and methods of ruder times i will discuss in a moment  but first as another of the converging lines tending to corporal punishment consider this that for some reason or other the old fullblooded and masculine humanitarianism in this matter has weakened and fallen silent it has weakened and fallen silent in a very curious manner the precise reason for which i do not altogether understand  i knew the average liberal the average nonconformist minister the average labour member the average middleclass socialist were with all their good qualities very deficient in what i consider a respect for the human soul  but i did imagine that they had the ordinary modern respect for the human body  the fact however is clear and incontrovertible  in spite of the horror of all humane people in spite of the hesitation even of our corrupt and panicstricken parliament measures can now be triumphantly passed for spreading or increasing the use of physical torture and for applying it to the newest and vaguest categories of crime  thirty or forty years ago nay twenty years ago when mr f hugh odonnell and others forced a liberal government to drop the catoninetails like a scorpion we could have counted on a mass of honest hatred of such things  we cannot count on it now  4 but lastly it is not necessary that in the factories of the future the institution of physical punishment should actually remind people of the jambok or the knout  it could easily be developed out of the many forms of physical discipline which are already used by employers on the excuses of education or hygiene  already in some factories girls are obliged to swim whether they like it or not or do gymnastics whether they like it or not  by a simple extension of hours or complication of exercises a pair of swedish clubs could easily be so used as to leave their victim as exhausted as one who had come off the rack  i think it extremely likely that they will be   ix the mask of socialism  the chief aim of all honest socialists just now is to prevent the coming of socialism  i do not say it as a sneer but on the contrary as a compliment a compliment to their political instinct and public spirit  i admit it may be called an exaggeration but there really is a sort of sham socialism that the modern politicians may quite possibly agree to set up if they do succeed in setting it up the battle for the poor is lost  we must note first of all a general truth about the curious time we live in  it will not be so difficult as some people may suppose to make the servile state look rather like socialism especially to the more pedantic kind of socialist  the reason is this  the old lucid and trenchant expounder of socialism such as blatchford or fred henderson always describes the economic power of the plutocrats as consisting in private property  of course in a sense this is quite true though they too often miss the point that private property as such is not the same as property confined to the few  but the truth is that the situation has grown much more subtle perhaps too subtle not to say too insane for straightthinking theorists like blatchford  the rich man today does not only rule by using private property he also rules by treating public property as if it were private property  a man like lord murray pulled the strings especially the pursestrings but the whole point of his position was that all sorts of strings had got entangled  the secret strength of the money he held did not lie merely in the fact that it was his money  it lay precisely in the fact that nobody had any clear idea of whether it was his money or his successors money or his brothers money or the marconi companys money or the liberal partys money or the english nations money  it was buried treasure but it was not private property  it was the acme of plutocracy because it was not private property  now by following this precedent this unprincipled vagueness about official and unofficial moneys by the cheerful habit of always mixing up the money in the pocket with the money in the till it would be quite possible to keep the rich as rich as ever in practice though they might have suffered confiscation in theory  mr lloyd george has four hundred a year as an m p but he not only gets much more as a minister but he might at any time get immeasurably more by speculating on state secrets that are necessarily known to him  some say that he has even attempted something of the kind  now it would be quite possible to cut mr george down not to four hundred a year but to fourpence a day and still leave him all these other and enormous financial superiorities  it must be remembered that a socialist state in any way resembling a modern state must however egalitarian it may be have the handling of huge sums and the enjoyment of large conveniences it is not improbable that the same men will handle and enjoy in much the same manner though in theory they are doing it as instruments and not as individuals  for instance the prime minister has a private house which is also i grieve to inform that eminent puritan a public house  it is supposed to be a sort of government office though people do not generally give childrens parties or go to bed in a government office  i do not know where mr  herbert samuel lives but i have no doubt he does himself well in the matter of decoration and furniture  on the existing official parallel there is no need to move any of these things in order to socialise them  there is no need to withdraw one diamondheaded nail from the carpet or one golden teaspoon from the tray  it is only necessary to call it an official residence like 10 downingstreet  i think it is not at all improbable that this plutocracy pretending to be a bureaucracy will be attempted or achieved  our wealthy rulers will be in the position which grumblers in the world of sport sometimes attribute to some of the gentlemen players they assert that some of these are paid like any professional only their pay is called their expenses  this system might run side by side with a theory of equal wages as absolute as that once laid down by mr bernard shaw  by the theory of the state mr  herbert samuel and mr lloyd george might be humble citizens drudging for their fourpence a day and no better off than porters and coalheavers  if there were presented to our mere senses what appeared to be the form of mr herbert samuel in an astrakhan coat and a motorcar we should find the record of the expenditure if we could find it at all under the heading of speed limit extension enquiry commission  if it fell to our lot to behold with the eye of flesh what seemed to be mr lloyd george lying in a hammock and smoking a costly cigar we should know that the expenditure would be divided between the condition of rope and netting investigation department and the state of cuban tobacco trade imperial inspectors report  such is the society i think they will build unless we can knock it down as fast as they build it  everything in it tolerable or intolerable will have but one use and that use what our ancestors used to call usance or usury  its art may be good or bad but it will be an advertisement for usurers its literature may be good or bad but it will appeal to the patronage of usurers its scientific selection will select according to the needs of usurers its religion will be just charitable enough to pardon usurers its penal system will be just cruel enough to crush all the critics of usurers the truth of it will be slavery and the title of it may quite possibly be socialism    the escape  we watched you building stone by stone the wellwashed cells and wellwashed graves we shall inhabit but not own when britons ever shall be slaves the waters waiting in the trough the tame oats sown are portioned free there is enough and just enough and all is ready now but we   but you have not caught us yet my lords you have us still to get a sorry army youd have got its flags are rags that float and rot its drums are empty pan and pot its baggage isan empty cot but you have not caught us yet   a little and we might have slipped when came your rumours and your sales and the foiled rich men feeblelipped said and unsaid their sorry tales great god  it needs a bolder brow to keep ten sheep inside a pen and we are sheep no longer now you are but masters  we are men   we give you all good thanks my lords we buy at easy price thanks for the thousands that you stole the bribes by wire the bets on coal the knowledge of that naked whole that hath delivered our flesh and soul out of your paradise   we had held safe your parks but when men taunted you with bribe and fee we only saw the lord of men grin like an ape and climb a tree and humbly had we stood without your princely barns did we not see in pointed faces peering out what rats now own the granary   it is too late too late my lords we give you back your grace you cannot with all cajoling make the wet ditch or winds that sting lost pride or the pawned wedding rings or drink or death a blacker thing than a smile upon your face     the new raid  the two kinds of social reform one of which might conceivably free us at last while the other would certainly enslave us forever are exhibited in an easy working model in the two efforts that have been made for the soldiers wivesi mean the effort to increase their allowance and the effort to curtail their alleged drinking  in the preliminary consideration at any rate we must see the second question as quite detached from our own sympathies on the special subject of fermented liquor  it could be applied to any other pleasure or ornament of life it will be applied to every other pleasure and ornament of life if the capitalist campaign can succeed  the argument we know but it cannot be too often made clear  an employer let us say pays a seamstress twopence a day and she does not seem to thrive on it  so little perhaps does she thrive on it that the employer has even some difficulty in thriving upon her  there are only two things that he can do and the distinction between them cuts the whole social and political world in two  it is a touchstone by which we cannot sometimes but alwaysdistinguish economic equality from servile social reform  he can give the girl some magnificent sum such as sixpence a day to do as she likes with and trust that her improved health and temper will work for the benefit of his business  or he may keep her to the original sum of a shilling a week but earmark each of the pennies to be used or not to be used for a particular purpose  if she must not spend this penny on a bunch of violets or that penny on a novelette or the other penny on a toy for some baby it is possible that she will concentrate her expenditure more upon physical necessities and so become from the employers point of view a more efficient person  without the trouble of adding twopence to her wages he has added twopennyworth to her food  in short she has the holy satisfaction of being worth more without being paid more  this capitalist is an ingenious person and has many polished characteristics but i think the most singular thing about him is his staggering lack of shame  neither the hour of death nor the day of reckoning neither the tent of exile nor the house of mourning neither chivalry nor patriotism neither womanhood nor widowhood is safe at this supreme moment from his dirty little expedient of dieting the slave  as similar bullies when they collect the slum rents put a foot in the open door these are always ready to push in a muddy wedge wherever there is a slit in a sundered household or a crack in a broken heart  to a man of any manhood nothing can be conceived more loathsome and sacrilegious than even so much as asking whether a woman who has given up all she loved to death and the fatherland has or has not shown some weakness in her seeking for selfcomfort  i know not in which of the two cases i should count myself the baser for inquiringa case where the charge was false or a case where it was true  but the philanthropic employer of the sort i describe is not a man of any manhood in a sense he is not a man at all he shows some consciousness of the fact when he calls his workers men as distinct from masters  he cannot comprehend the gallantry of costermongers or the delicacy that is quite common among cabmen  he finds this social reform by halfrations on the whole to his mercantile profit and it will be hard to get him to think of anything else  but there are people assisting him people like the duchess of marlborough who know not their right hand from their left and to these we may legitimately address our remonstrance and a resume of some of the facts they do not know  the duchess of marlborough is i believe an american and this separates her from the problem in a special way because the drink question in america is entirely different from the drink question in england  but i wish the duchess of marlborough would pin up in her private study side by side with the declaration of independence a document recording the following simple truths 1 beer which is largely drunk in publichouses is not a spirit or a grog or a cocktail or a drug it is the common english liquid for quenching the thirst it is so still among innumerable gentlemen and until very lately was so among innumerable ladies  most of us remember dames of the last generation whose manners were fit for versailles and who drank ale or stout as a matter of course  schoolboys drank ale as a matter of course and their schoolmasters gave it to them as a matter of course  to tell a poor woman that she must not have any until half the day is over is simply cracked like telling a dog or a child that he must not have water  2 the publichouse is not a secret rendezvous of bad characters  it is the open and obvious place for a certain purpose which all men used for that purpose until the rich began to be snobs and the poor to become slaves one might as well warn people against willesden junction  3 many poor people live in houses where they cannot without great preparation offer hospitality  4 the climate of these picturesque islands does not favour conducting long conversations with ones oldest friends on an iron seat in the park  5 halfpast eleven am is not early in the day for a woman who gets up before six  6 the bodies and minds of these women belong to god and to themselves    the new name  something has come into our community which is strong enough to save our community but which has not yet got a name  let no one fancy i confess any unreality when i confess the namelessness  the morality called puritanism the tendency called liberalism the reaction called tory democracy had not only long been powerful but had practically done most of their work before these actual names were attached to them nevertheless i think it would be a good thing to have some portable and practicable way of referring to those who think as we do in our main concern  which is that men in england are ruled at this minute by the clock by brutes who refuse them bread by liars who refuse them news and by fools who cannot govern and therefore wish to enslave  let me explain first why i am not satisfied with the word commonly used which i have often used myself and which in some contexts is quite the right word to use  i mean the word rebel  passing over the fact that many who understand the justice of our cause as a great many at the universities would still use the word rebel in its old and strict sense as meaning only a disturber of just rule  i pass to a much more practical point  the word rebel understates our cause  it is much too mild it lets our enemies off much too easily  there is a tradition in all western life and letters of prometheus defying the stars of man at war with the universe and dreaming what nature had never dared to dream  all this is valuable in its place and proportion  but it has nothing whatever to do with our ease or rather it very much weakens it  the plutocrats will be only too pleased if we profess to preach a new morality for they know jolly well that they have broken the old one  they will be only too pleased to be able to say that we by our own confession are merely restless and negative that we are only what we call rebels and they call cranks  but it is not true and we must not concede it to them for a moment  the model millionaire is more of a crank than the socialists just as nero was more of a crank than the christians  and avarice has gone mad in the governing class today just as lust went mad in the circle of nero  by all the working and orthodox standards of sanity capitalism is insane  i should not say to mr  rockefeller i am a rebel i should say i am a respectable man and you are not   our lawless enemies  but the vital point is that the confession of mere rebellion softens the startling lawlessness of our enemies  suppose a publishers clerk politely asked his employer for a rise in his salary and on being refused said he must leave the employment  suppose the employer knocked him down with a ruler tied him up as a brown paper parcel addressed him in a fine business hand to the governor of rio janeiro and then asked the policeman to promise never to arrest him for what he had done  that is a precise copy in every legal and moral principle of the deportation of the strikers they were assaulted and kidnapped for not accepting a contract and for nothing else and the act was so avowedly criminal that the law had to be altered afterwards to cover the crime  now suppose some postal official between here and rio janeiro had noticed a faint kicking inside the brown paper parcel and had attempted to ascertain the cause  and suppose the clerk could only explain in a muffled voice through the brown paper that he was by constitution and temperament a rebel  dont you see that he would be rather understating his case dont you see he would be bearing his injuries much too meekly  they might take him out of the parcel but they would very possibly put him into a madhouse instead  symbolically speaking that is what they would like to do with us  symbolically speaking the dirty misers who rule us will put us in a madhouseunless we can put them there  or suppose a bank cashier were admittedly allowed to take the money out of the till and put it loose in his pocket more or less mixed up with his own money afterwards laying some of both at different odds on blue murder for the derby  suppose when some depositor asked mildly what day the accountants came he smote that astonished inquirer on the nose crying slanderer  mudslinger and suppose he then resigned his position  suppose no books were shown  suppose when the new cashier came to be initiated into his duties the old cashier did not tell him about the money but confided it to the honour and delicacy of his own maiden aunt at cricklewood  suppose he then went off in a yacht to visit the whale fisheries of the north sea  well in every moral and legal principle that is a precise account of the dealings with the party funds but what would the banker say what would the clients say  one thing i think i can venture to promise the banker would not march up and down the office exclaiming in rapture im a rebel  thats what i am a rebel and if he said to the first indignant depositor you are a rebel i fear the depositor might answer you are a robber we have no need to elaborate arguments for breaking the law  the capitalists have broken the law  we have no need of further moralities  they have broken their own morality  it is as if you were to run down the street shouting communism  communism share  share  after a man who had run away with your watch  we want a term that will tell everybody that there is by the common standard frank fraud and cruelty pushed to their fierce extreme and that we are fighting them we are not in a state of divine discontent we are in an entirely human and entirely reasonable rage  we say we have been swindled and oppressed and we are quite ready and able to prove it before any tribunal that allows us to call a swindler a swindler  it is the protection of the present system that most of its tribunals do not  i cannot at the moment think of any party name that would particularly distinguish us from our more powerful and prosperous opponents unless it were the name the old jacobites gave themselves the honest party   captured our standards  i think it is plain that for the purpose of facing these new and infamous modern facts we cannot with any safety depend on any of the old nineteenth century names socialist or communist or radical or liberal or labour  they are all honourable names they all stand or stood for things in which we may still believe we can still apply them to other problems but not to this one  we have no longer a monopoly of these names  let it be understood that i am not speaking here of the philosophical problem of their meaning but of the practical problem of their use  when i called myself a radical i knew mr balfour would not call himself a radical therefore there was some use in the word  when i called myself a socialist i knew lord penrhyn would not call himself a socialist therefore there was some use in the word  but the capitalists in that aggressive march which is the main fact of our time have captured our standards both in the military and philosophic sense of the word and it is useless for us to march under colours which they can carry as well as we  do you believe in democracy  the devils also believe and tremble  do you believe in trades unionism  the labour members also believe and tremble like a falling teetotum  do you believe in the state  the samuels also believe and grin  do you believe in the centralisation of empire  so did beit  do you believe in the decentralisation of empire  so does albu do you believe in the brotherhood of men and do you dear brethren believe that brother arthur henderson does not  do you cry the world for the workers  and do you imagine philip snowden would not  what we need is a name that shall declare not that the modern treason and tyranny are bad but that they are quite literally intolerable and that we mean to act accordingly  i really think the limits would be as good a name as any  but anyhow something is born among us that is as strong as an infant hercules and it is part of my prejudices to want it christened  i advertise for godfathers and godmothers    a workmans history of england  a thing which does not exist and which is very much wanted is a workingmans history of england  i do not mean a history written for working men there are whole dustbins of them i mean a history written by working men or from the working mens standpoint  i wish five generations of a fishers or a miners family could incarnate themselves in one man and tell the story  it is impossible to ignore altogether any comment coming from so eminent a literary artist as mr laurence housman but i do not deal here so specially with his well known conviction about votes for women as with another idea which is i think rather at the back of it if not with him at least with others and which concerns this matter of the true story of england  for the true story is so entirely different from the false official story that the official classes tell that by this time the working class itself has largely forgotten its own experience  either story can be quite logically linked up with female suffrage which therefore i leave where it is for the moment merely confessing that so long as we get hold of the right story and not the wrong story it seems to me a matter of secondary importance whether we link it up with female suffrage or not  now the ordinary version of recent english history that most moderately educated people have absorbed from childhood is something like this  that we emerged slowly from a semibarbarism in which all the power and wealth were in the hands of kings and a few nobles that the kings power was broken first and then in due time that of the nobles that this piecemeal improvement was brought about by one class after another waking up to a sense of citizenship and demanding a place in the national councils frequently by riot or violence and that in consequence of such menacing popular action the franchise was granted to one class after another and used more and more to improve the social conditions of those classes until we practically became a democracy save for such exceptions as that of the women  i do not think anyone will deny that something like that is the general idea of the educated man who reads a newspaper and of the newspaper that he reads  that is the view current at public schools and colleges it is part of the culture of all the classes that count for much in government and there is not one word of truth in it from beginning to end   that great reform bill  wealth and political power were very much more popularly distributed in the middle ages than they are now but we will pass all that and consider recent history  the franchise has never been largely and liberally granted in england half the males have no vote and are not likely to get one  it was never granted in reply to pressure from awakened sections of the democracy in every case there was a perfectly clear motive for granting it solely for the convenience of the aristocrats  the great reform bill was not passed in response to such riots as that which destroyed a castle nor did the men who destroyed the castle get any advantage whatever out of the great reform bill  the great reform bill was passed in order to seal an alliance between the landed aristocrats and the rich manufacturers of the north an alliance that rules us still and the chief object of that alliance was to prevent the english populace getting any political power in the general excitement after the french revolution  no one can read macaulays speech on the chartists for instance and not see that this is so  disraelis further extension of the suffrage was not effected by the intellectual vivacity and pure republican theory of the midvictorian agricultural labourer it was effected by a politician who saw an opportunity to dish the whigs and guessed that certain orthodoxies in the more prosperous artisan might yet give him a balance against the commercial radicals  and while this very thin game of wirepulling with the mere abstraction of the vote was being worked entirely by the oligarchs and entirely in their interests the solid and real thing that was going on was the steady despoiling of the poor of all power or wealth until they find themselves today upon the threshold of slavery  that is the working mans history of england  now as i have said i care comparatively little what is done with the mere voting part of the matter so long as it is not claimed in such a way as to allow the plutocrat to escape his responsibility for his crimes by pretending to be much more progressive or much more susceptible to popular protest than he ever has been  and there is this danger in many of those who have answered me  one of them for instance says that women have been forced into their present industrial situations by the same iron economic laws that have compelled men  i say that men have not been compelled by iron economic laws but in the main by the coarse and christless cynicism of other men  but of course this way of talking is exactly in accordance with the fashionable and official version of english history  thus you will read that the monasteries places where men of the poorest origin could be powerful grew corrupt and gradually decayed or you will read that the mediaeval guilds of free workmen yielded at last to an inevitable economic law  you will read this and you will be reading lies  they might as well say that julius caesar gradually decayed at the foot of pompeys statue  you might as well say that abraham lincoln yielded at last to an inevitable economic law  the free mediaeval guilds did not decay they were murdered  solid men with solid guns and halberds armed with lawful warrants from living statesmen broke up their corporations and took away their hard cash from them  in the same way the people in cradley heath are no more victims of a necessary economic law than the people in putumayo  they are victims of a very terrible creature of whose sins much has been said since the beginning of the world and of whom it was said of old let us fall into the hands of god for his mercies are great but let us not fall into the hands of man   the capitalist is in the dock  now it is this offering of a false economic excuse for the sweater that is the danger in perpetually saying that the poor woman will use the vote and that the poor man has not used it  the poor man is prevented from using it prevented by the rich man and the poor woman would be prevented in exactly the same gross and stringent style  i do not deny of course that there is something in the english temperament and in the heritage of the last few centuries that makes the english workman more tolerant of wrong than most foreign workmen would be  but this only slightly modifies the main fact of the moral responsibility  to take an imperfect parallel if we said that negro slaves would have rebelled if negroes had been more intelligent we should be saying what is reasonable  but if we were to say that it could by any possibility be represented as being the negros fault that he was at that moment in america and not in africa we should be saying what is frankly unreasonable  it is every bit as unreasonable to say the mere supineness of the english workmen has put them in the capitalist slaveyard  the capitalist has put them in the capitalist slaveyard and very cunning smiths have hammered the chains  it is just this creative criminality in the authors of the system that we must not allow to be slurred over  the capitalist is in the dock today and so far as i at least can prevent him he shall not get out of it    the french revolution and the irish  it will be long before the poison of the party system is worked out of the body politic  some of its most indirect effects are the most dangerous one that is very dangerous just now is this that for most englishmen the party system falsifies history and especially the history of revolutions it falsifies history because it simplifies history  it paints everything either blue or buff in the style of its own silly circus politics while a real revolution has as many colours as the sunriseor the end of the world  and if we do not get rid of this error we shall make very bad blunders about the real revolution which seems to grow more and more probable especially among the irish  and any human familiarity with history will teach a man this first of all that party practically does not exist in a real revolution  it is a game for quiet times  if you take a boy who has been to one of those big private schools which are falsely called the public schools and another boy who has been to one of those large public schools which are falsely called the board schools you will find some differences between the two chiefly a difference in the management of the voice  but you will find they are both english in a special way and that their education has been essentially the same  they are ignorant on the same subjects  they have never heard of the same plain facts  they have been taught the wrong answer to the same confusing question  there is one fundamental element in the attitude of the eton master talking about playing the game and the elementary teacher training guttersnipes to sing what is the meaning of empire day  and the name of that element is unhistoric  it knows nothing really about england still less about ireland or france and least of all of course about anything like the french revolution   revolution by snap division  now what general notion does the ordinary english boy thus taught to utter one ignorance in one of two accents get and keep through life about the french revolution  it is the notion of the english house of commons with an enormous radical majority on one side of the table and a small tory minority on the other the majority voting solid for a republic the minority voting solid for a monarchy two teams tramping through two lobbies with no difference between their methods and ours except that owing to some habit peculiar to gaul the brief intervals were brightened by a riot or a massacre instead of by a whisky and soda and a marconi tip novels are much more reliable than histories in such matters  for though an english novel about france does not tell the truth about france it does tell the truth about england and more than half the histories never tell the truth about anything  and popular fiction i think bears witness to the general english impression  the french revolution is a snap division with an unusual turnover of votes  on the one side stand a king and queen who are good but weak surrounded by nobles with rapiers drawn some of whom are good many of whom are wicked all of whom are goodlooking  against these there is a formless mob of human beings wearing red caps and seemingly insane who all blindly follow ruffians who are also rhetoricians some of whom die repentant and others unrepentant towards the end of the fourth act  the leaders of this boiling mass of all men melted into one are called mirabeau robespierre danton marat and so on  and it is conceded that their united frenzy may have been forced on them by the evils of the old regime  that i think is the commonest english view of the french revolution and it will not survive the reading of two pages of any real speech or letter of the period  these human beings were human varied complex and inconsistent  but the rich englishman ignorant of revolutions would hardly believe you if you told him some of the common human subtleties of the case  tell him that robespierre threw the red cap in the dirt in disgust while the king had worn it with a broad grin so to speak tell him that danton the fierce founder of the republic of the terror said quite sincerely to a noble i am more monarchist than you tell him that the terror really seems to have been brought to an end chiefly by the efforts of people who particularly wanted to go on with itand he will not believe these things  he will not believe them because he has no humility and therefore no realism  he has never been inside himself and so could never be inside another man  the truth is that in the french affair everybody occupied an individual position  every man talked sincerely if not because he was sincere then because he was angry robespierre talked even more about god than about the republic because he cared even more about god than about the republic  danton talked even more about france than about the republic because he cared even more about france than about the republic  marat talked more about humanity than either because that physician though himself somewhat needing a physician really cared about it  the nobles were divided each man from the next  the attitude of the king was quite different from the attitude of the queen certainly much more different than any differences between our liberals and tories for the last twenty years  and it will sadden some of my friends to remember that it was the king who was the liberal and the queen who was the tory  there were not two people i think in that most practical crisis who stood in precisely the same attitude towards the situation  and that is why between them they saved europe it is when you really perceive the unity of mankind that you really perceive its variety  it is not a flippancy it is a very sacred truth to say that when men really understand that they are brothers they instantly begin to fight   the revival of reality  now these things are repeating themselves with an enormous reality in the irish revolution  you will not be able to make a party system out of the matter  everybody is in revolt therefore everybody is telling the truth the nationalists will go on caring most for the nation as danton and the defenders of the frontier went on caring most for the nation  the priests will go on caring most for religion as robespierre went on caring most for religion  the socialists will go on caring most for the cure of physical suffering as marat went on caring most for it  it is out of these real differences that real things can be made such as the modern french democracy  for by such tenacity everyone sees at last that there is something in the other persons position  and those drilled in party discipline see nothing either past or present  and where there is nothing there is satan  for a long time past in our politics there has not only been no real battle but no real bargain  no two men have bargained as gladstone and parnell bargainedeach knowing the other to be a power  but in real revolutions men discover that no one man can really agree with another man until he has disagreed with him    liberalism a sample  there is a certain daily paper in england towards which i feel very much as tom pinch felt towards mr pecksniff immediately after he had found him out  the war upon dickens was part of the general war on all democrats about the eighties and nineties which ushered in the brazen plutocracy of today  and one of the things that it was fashionable to say of dickens in drawingrooms was that he had no subtlety and could not describe a complex frame of mind  like most other things that are said in drawingrooms it was a lie  dickens was a very unequal writer and his successes alternate with his failures but his successes are subtle quite as often as they are simple  thus to take martin chuzzlewit alone i should call the joke about the lord nozoo a simple joke but i should call the joke about mrs todgerss vision of a wooden leg a subtle joke and no frame of mind was ever so selfcontradictory and yet so realistic as that which dickens describes when he says in effect that though pinch knew now that there had never been such a person as pecksniff in his ideal sense he could not bring himself to insult the very face and form that had contained the legend  the parallel with liberal journalism is not perfect because it was once honest and pecksniff presumably never was  and even when i come to feel a final incompatibility of temper pecksniff was not so pecksniffian as he has since become  but the comparison is complete in so far as i share all the reluctance of mr pinch  some old heathen king was advised by one of the celtic saints i think to burn what he had adored and adore what he had burnt  i am quite ready if anyone will prove i was wrong to adore what i have burnt but i do really feel an unwillingness verging upon weakness to burning what i have adored  i think it is a weakness to be overcome in times as bad as these when as mr orage wrote with something like splendid common sense the other day there is such a lot to do and so few people who will do it so i will devote this article to considering one case of the astounding baseness to which liberal journalism has sunk   mental breakdown in fleet street  one of the two or three streaks of light on our horizon can be perceived in this that the moral breakdown of these papers has been accompanied by a mental breakdown also  the contemporary official paper like the daily news or the daily chronicle i mean in so far as it deals with politics simply cannot argue and simply does not pretend to argue  it considers the solution which it imagines that wealthy people want and it signifies the same in the usual manner which is not by holding up its hand but by falling on its face  but there is no more curious quality in its degradation than a sort of carelessness at once of hurry and fatigue with which it flings down its argumentor rather its refusal to argue it does not even write sophistry it writes anything  it does not so much poison the readers mind as simply assume that the reader hasnt got one for instance one of these papers printed an article on sir stuart samuel who having broken the great liberal statute against corruption will actually perhaps be asked to pay his own finein spite of the fact that he can well afford to do so  the article says if i remember aright that the decision will cause general surprise and some indignation  that any modern government making a very rich capitalist obey the law will cause general surprise may be true  whether it will cause general indignation rather depends on whether our social intercourse is entirely confined to park lane or any such pigsties built of gold  but the journalist proceeds to say his neck rising higher and higher out of his collar and his hair rising higher and higher on his head in short his resemblance to the dickens original increasing every instant that he does not mean that the law against corruption should be less stringent but that the burden should be borne by the whole community  this may mean that whenever a rich man breaks the law all the poor men ought to be made to pay his fine  but i will suppose a slightly less insane meaning  i will suppose it means that the whole power of the commonwealth should be used to prosecute an offender of this kind  that of course can only mean that the matter will be decided by that instrument which still pretends to represent the whole power of the commonwealth  in other words the government will judge the government  now this is a perfectly plain piece of brute logic  we need not go into the other delicious things in the article as when it says that in old times parliament had to be protected against royal invasion by the man in the street  parliament has to be protected now against the man in the street  parliament is simply the most detested and the most detestable of all our national institutions all that is evident enough  what is interesting is the blank and staring fallacy of the attempted reply   when the journalist is ruined  a long while ago before all the liberals died a liberal introduced a bill to prevent parliament being merely packed with the slaves of financial interests  for that purpose he established the excellent democratic principle that the private citizen as such might protest against public corruption  he was called the common informer  i believe the miserable party papers are really reduced to playing on the degradation of the two words in modern language  now the word comnon in common informer means exactly what it means in common sense or book of common prayer or above all in house of commons  it does not mean anything low or vulgar any more than they do  the only difference is that the house of commons really is low and vulgar and the common informer isnt  it is just the same with the word informer  it does not mean spy or sneak  it means one who gives information  it means what journalist ought to mean  the only difference is that the common informer may be paid if he tells the truth  the common journalist will be ruined if he does  now the quite plain point before the party journalist is this if he really means that a corrupt bargain between a government and a contractor ought to be judged by public opinion he must nowadays mean parliament that is the caucus that controls parliament  and he must decide between one of two views  either he means that there can be no such thing as a corrupt government  or he means that it is one of the characteristic qualities of a corrupt government to denounce its own corruption  i laugh and i leave him his choice    the fatigue of fleet street  why is the modern party political journalism so bad  it is worse even than it intends to be  it praises its preposterous party leaders through thick and thin but it somehow succeeds in making them look greater fools than they are  this clumsiness clings even to the photographs of public men as they are snapshotted at public meetings  a sensitive politician if there is such a thing would i should think want to murder the man who snapshots him at those moments  for our general impression of a mans gesture or play of feature is made up of a series of vanishing instants at any one of which he may look worse than our general impression records mr augustine birrell may have made quite a sensible and amusing speech in the course of which his audience would hardly have noticed that he resettled his necktie  snapshot him and he appears as convulsively clutching his throat in the agonies of strangulation and with his head twisted on one side as if he had been hanged  sir edward carson might make a perfectly good speech which no one thought wearisome but might himself be just tired enough to shift from one leg to the other  snapshot him and he appears as holding one leg stiffly in the air and yawning enough to swallow the audience  but it is in the prose narratives of the press that we find most manifestations of this strange ineptitude this knack of exhibiting your own favourites in an unlucky light  it is not so much that the party journalists do not tell the truth as that they tell just enough of it to make it clear that they are telling lies  one of their favourite blunders is an amazing sort of bathos  they begin by telling you that some statesman said something brilliant in style or biting in wit at which his hearers thrilled with terror or thundered with applause  and then they tell you what it was that he said  silly asses   insane exaggeration  here is an example from a leading liberal paper touching the debates on home rule  i am a home ruler so my sympathies would be if anything on the side of the liberal paper upon that point  i merely quote it as an example of this ridiculous way of writing which by insane exaggeration actually makes its hero look smaller than he is  this was strange language to use about the hypocritical sham and mr asquith knowing that the biggest battle of his career was upon him hit back without mercy  i should like first to know said he with a glance at his supporters whether my proposals are accepted  thats all  and i really do not see why poor mr asquith should be represented as having violated the christian virtue of mercy by saying that  i myself could compose a great many paragraphs upon the same model each containing its stinging and perhaps unscrupulous epigram  as for examplethe archbishop of canterbury realising that his choice now lay between denying god and earning the crown of martyrdom by dying in torments spoke with a frenzy of religious passion that might have seemed fanatical under circumstances less intense  the childrens service he said firmly with his face to the congregation will be held at halfpast four this afternoon as usual  or we might havelord roberts recognising that he had now to face armageddon and that if he lost this last battle against overwhelming odds the independence of england would be extinguished forever addressed to his soldiers looking at them and not falling off his horse a speech which brought their national passions to boiling point and might well have seemed bloodthirsty in quieter times  it ended with the celebrated declaration that it was a fine day  or we might have the much greater excitement of reading something like thisthe astronomer royal having realised that the earth would certainly be smashed to pieces by a comet unless his requests in connection with wireless telegraphy were seriously considered gave an address at the royal society which under other circumstances would have seemed unduly dogmatic and emotional and deficient in scientific agnosticism  this address which he delivered without any attempt to stand on his head included a fierce and even ferocious declaration that it is generally easier to see the stars by night than by day  now i cannot see on my conscience and reason that any one of my imaginary paragraphs is more ridiculous than the real one  nobody can believe that mr asquith regards these belated and careful compromises about home rule as the biggest battle of his career  it is only justice to him to say that he has had bigger battles than that  nobody can believe that any body of men bodily present either thundered or thrilled at a man merely saying that he would like to know whether his proposals were accepted  no it would be far better for parliament if its doors were shut again and reporters were excluded  in that case the outer public did hear genuine rumours of almost gigantic eloquence such as that which has perpetuated pitts reply against the charge of youth or foxs bludgeoning of the idea of war as a compromise  it would be much better to follow the old fashion and let in no reporters at all than to follow the new fashion and select the stupidest reporters you can find   their load of lies  now why do people in fleetstreet talk such tosh  people in fleetstreet are not fools  most of them have realised reality through work some through starvation some through damnation or something damnably like it i think it is simply and seriously true that they are tired of their job as the general said in m rostands play la fatigue  i do really believe that this is one of the ways in which god dont get flurried nature if you like is unexpectedly avenged on things infamous and unreasonable  and this method is that mens moral and even physical tenacity actually give out under such a load of lies  they go on writing their leading articles and their parliamentary reports  they go on doing it as a convict goes on picking oakum  but the point is not that we are bored with their articles the point is that they are  the work is done worse because it is done weakly and without human enthusiasm  and it is done weakly because of the truth we have told so many times in this book that it is not done for monarchy for which men will die or for democracy for which men will die or even for aristocracy for which many men have died  it is done for a thing called capitalism which stands out quite clearly in history in many curious ways  but the most curious thing about it is that no man has loved it and no man died for it    the amnesty for aggression  if there is to rise out of all this red ruin something like a republic of justice it is essential that our views should be real views that is glimpses of lives and landscapes outside ourselves  it is essential that they should not be mere opium visions that begin and end in smokeand so often in cannon smoke  i make no apology therefore for returning to the purely practical and realistic point i urged last week the fact that we shall lose everything we might have gained if we lose the idea that the responsible person is responsible  for instance it is almost specially so with the one or two things in which the british government or the british public really are behaving badly  the first and worst of them is the nonextension of the moratorium or truce of debtor and creditor to the very world where there are the poorest debtors and thc cruellest creditors  this is infamous and should be if possible more infamous to those who think the war right than to those who think it wrong  everyone knows that the people who can least pay their debts are the people who are always trying to  among the poor a payment may be as rash as a speculation  among the rich a bankruptcy may be as safe as a bank  considering the class from which private soldiers are taken there is an atrocious meanness in the idea of buying their blood abroad while we sell their sticks at home  the english language by the way is full of delicate paradoxes  we talk of the private soldiers because they are really public soldiers and we talk of the public schools because they are really private schools  anyhow the wrong is of the sort that ought to be resisted as much in war as in peace   ought to be hammered  but as long as we speak of it as a cloudy conclusion come to by an anonymous club called parliament or a masked tribunal called the cabinet we shall never get such a wrong righted  somebody is officially responsible for the unfairness and that somebody ought to be hammered the other example less important but more ludicrous is the silly boycott of germans in england extending even to german music  i do not believe for a moment that the english people feel any such insane fastidiousness are the english artists who practise the particularly english art of watercolour to be forbidden to use prussian blue  are all old ladies to shoot their pomeranian dogs  but though england would laugh at this she will get the credit of it and will continue until we ask who the actual persons are who feel sure that we should shudder at a ballad of the rhine it is certain that we should find they are capitalists  it is very probable that we should find they are foreigners  some days ago the official council of the independent labour party or the independent council of the official labour party or the independent and official council of the labour party i have got quite nervous about these names and distinctions but they all seem to say the same thing began their manifesto by saying it would be difficult to assign the degrees of responsibility which each nation had for the outbreak of the war afterwards a writer in the christian commonwealth lamenting war in the name of labour but in the language of my own romantic middleclass said that all the nations must share the responsibility for this great calamity of war  now exactly as long as we go on talking like that we shall have war after war and calamity after calamity until the crack of doom  it simply amounts to a promise of pardon to any person who will start a quarrel  it is an amnesty for assassins  the moment any man assaults any other man he makes all the other men as bad as himself  he has only to stab and to vanish in a fog of forgetfulness  the real eagles of iron the predatory empires will be delighted with this doctrine  they will applaud the labour concert or committee or whatever it is called  they will willingly take all the crime with only a quarter of the conscience they will be as ready to share the memory as they are to share the spoil the powers will divide responsibility as calmly as they divided poland   the whole loathsome load  but i still stubbornly and meekly submit my point that you cannot end war without asking who began it  if you think somebody else not germany began it then blame that somebody else do not blame everybody and nobody perhaps you think that a small sovereign people fresh from two triumphant wars ought to discrown itself before sunrise because the nephew of a neighbouring emperor has been shot by his own subjects  very well  then blame servia and to the extent of your influence you may be preventing small kingdoms being obstinate or even princes being shot perhaps you think the whole thing was a huge conspiracy of russia with france as a dupe and servia as a pretext  very well  then blame russia and to the extent of your influence you may be preventing great empires from making racial excuses for a raid  perhaps you think france wrong for feeling what you call revenge and i should call recovery of stolen goods  perhaps you blame belgium for being sentimental about her frontier or england for being sentimental about her word  if so blame them or whichever of them you think is to blame  or again it is barely possible that you may think as i do that the whole loathsome load has been laid upon us by the monarchy which i have not named still less wasted time in abusing  but if there be in europe a military state which has not the religion of russia yet has helped russia to tyrannise over the poles that state cares not for religion but for tyranny  if there be a state in europe which has not the religion of the austrians but has helped austria to bully the servians that state cares not for belief but for bullying  if there be in europe any people or principality which respects neither republics nor religions to which the political ideal of paris is as much a myth as the mystical ideal of moscow then blame that and do more than blame  in the healthy and highly theological words of robert blatchford drive it back to the hell from which it came   crying over spilt blood  but whatever you do do not blame everybody for what was certainly done by somebody  it may be it is no good crying over spilt blood any more than over spilt milk  but we do not find the culprit any more by spilling the milk over everybody or by daubing everybody with blood  still less do we improve matters by watering the milk with our tears nor the blood either to say that everybody is responsible means that nobody is responsible if in the future we see russia annexing rutland as part of the old kingdom of muscovy if we see bavaria taking a sudden fancy to the bank of england or the king of the cannibal islands suddenly demanding a tribute of edible boys and girls from england and america we may be quite certain also that the leader of the labour party will rise with a slight cough and say it would be a difficult task to apportion the blame between the various claims which    revive the court jester  i hope the government will not think just now about appointing a poet laureate  i hardly think they can be altogether in the right mood  the business just now before the country makes a very good detective story but as a national epic it is a little depressing  jingo literature always weakens a nation but even healthy patriotic literature has its proper time and occasion  for instance mr newbolt who has been suggested for the post is a very fine poet but i think his patriotic lyrics would just now rather jar upon a patriot  we are rather too much concerned about our practical seamanship to feel quite confident that drake will return and drum them up the channel as he drummed them long ago  on the contrary we have an uncomfortable feeling that drakes ship might suddenly go to the bottom because the capitalists have made lloyd george abolish the plimsoll line  one could not without being understood ironically adjure the two party teams today to play up play up and play the game or to love the game more than the prize  and there is no national hero at this moment in the soldiering lineunless perhaps it is major archersheeof whom anyone would be likely to say sed miles sed pro patria  there is indeed one beautiful poem of mr newbolts which may mingle faintly with ones thoughts in such times but that alas is to a very different tune  i mean that one in which he echoes turners conception of the old wooden ship vanishing with all the valiant memories of the english   theres a far bell ringing at the setting of the sun and a phantom voice is singing of the great days done theres a far bell ringing and a phantom voice is singing of a fame forever clinging to the great days done for the sunset breezes shiver temeraire temeraire and shes fading down the river   well well neither you nor i know whether she is fading down the river or not  it is quite enough for us to know as king alfred did that a great many pirates have landed on both banks of the thames   praise and prophecy impossible  at this moment that is the only kind of patriotic poem that could satisfy the emotions of a patriotic person  but it certainly is not the sort of poem that is expected from a poet laureate either on the highest or the lowest theory of his office  he is either a great minstrel singing the victories of a great king or he is a common court official like the groom of the powder closet  in the first case his praises should be true in the second case they will nearly always be false but in either case he must praise  and what there is for him to praise just now it would be precious hard to say  and if there is no great hope of a real poet there is still less hope of a real prophet  what newman called i think the prophetical office that is the institution of an inspired protest even against an inspired religion certainly would not do in modern england the court is not likely to keep a tame prophet in order to encourage him to be wild  it is not likely to pay a man to say that wolves shall howl in downingstreet and vultures build their nests in buckingham palace  so vast has been the progress of humanity that these two things are quite impossible  we cannot have a great poet praising kings  we cannot have a great prophet denouncing kings  so i have to fall back on a third suggestion   the field for a fool  instead of reviving the court poet why not revive the court fool  he is the only person who could do any good at this moment either to the royal or the judicial courts  the present political situation is utterly unsuitable for the purposes of a great poet  but it is particularly suitable for the purposes of a great buffoon  the old jester was under certain privileges you could not resent the jokes of a fool just as you cannot resent the sermons of a curate  now what the present government of england wants is neither serious praise nor serious denunciation what it wants is satire  what it wants in other words is realism given with gusto  when king louis the eleventh unexpectedly visited his enemy the duke of burgundy with a small escort the dukes jester said he would give the king his fools cap for he was the fool now  and when the duke replied with dignity and suppose i treat him with all proper respect the fool answered then i will give it to you  that is the kind of thing that somebody ought to be free to say now  but if you say it now you will be fined a hundred pounds at the least   carsons dilemma  for the things that have been happening lately are not merely things that one could joke about  they are themselves truly and intrinsically jokes i mean that there is a sort of epigram of unreason in the situation itself as there was in the situation where there was jam yesterday and jam tomorrow but never jam today  take for instance the extraordinary case of sir edward carson  the point is not whether we regard his attitude in belfast as the defiance of a sincere and dogmatic rebel or as the bluff of a party hack and mountebank  the point is not whether we regard his defence of the government at the old bailey as a chivalrous and reluctant duty done as an advocate or a friend or as a mere case of a lawyer selling his soul for a fat brief  the point is that whichever of the two actions we approve and whichever of the four explanations we adopt sir edwards position is still raving nonsense  on any argument he cannot escape from his dilemma  it may be argued that laws and customs should be obeyed whatever our private feelings and that it is an established custom to accept a brief in such a case  but then it is a somewhat more established custom to obey an act of parliament and to keep the peace  it may be argued that extreme misgovernment justifies men in ulster or elsewhere in refusing to obey the law  but then it would justify them even more in refusing to appear professionally in a law court etiquette cannot be at once so unimportant that carson may shoot at the kings uniform and yet so important that he must always be ready to put on his own  the government cannot be so disreputable that carson need not lay down his gun and yet so respectable that he is bound to put on his wig  carson cannot at once be so fierce that he can kill in what he considers a good cause and yet so meek that he must argue in what he considers a bad cause  obedience or disobedience conventional or unconventional a solicitors letter cannot be more sacred than the kings writ a blue bag cannot be more rational than the british flag  the thing is rubbish read anyway and the only difficulty is to get a joke good enough to express it  it is a case for the court jester  the phantasy of it could only be expressed by some huge ceremonial hoax  carson ought to be crowned with the shamrocks and emeralds and followed by greenclad minstrels of the clannagael playing the wearing of the green   belated chattiness by wireless  but all the recent events are like that  they are practical jokes  the jokes do not need to be made they only need to be pointed out  you and i do not talk and act as the isaacs brothers talked and acted by their own most favourable account of themselves and even their account of themselves was by no means favourable  you and i do not talk of meeting our own born brother at a family function as if he were some infinitely distant cousin whom we only met at christmas  you and i when we suddenly feel inclined for a chat with the same brother about his dinner and the coal strike do not generally select either wireless telegraphy or the atlantic cable as the most obvious and economical channel for that outburst of belated chattiness  you and i do not talk if it is proposed to start a railway between catsville and dogtown as if the putting up of a station at dogtown could have no kind of economic effect on the putting up of a station at catsville  you and i do not think it candid to say that when we are at one end of a telephone we have no sort of connection with the other end  these things have got into the region of farce and should be dealt with farcically not even ferociously   a fool who shall be free  in the roman republic there was a tribune of the people whose person was inviolable like an ambassadors  there was much the same idea in beckets attempt to remove the priest who was then the popular champion from the ordinary courts  we shall have no tribune for we have no republic  we shall have no priest for we have no religion  the best we deserve or can expect is a fool who shall be free and who shall deliver us with laughter     the art of missing the point  missing the point is a very fine art and has been carried to something like perfection by politicians and pressmen today  for the point is generally a very sharp point and is moreover sharp at both ends  that is to say that both parties would probably impale themselves in an uncomfortable manner if they did not manage to avoid it altogether  i have just been looking at the election address of the official liberal candidate for the part of the country in which i live and though it is if anything rather more logical and free from cant than most other documents of the sort it is an excellent example of missing the point the candidate has to go boring on about free trade and land reform and education and nobody reading it could possibly imagine that in the town of wycombe where the poll will be declared the capital of the wycombe division of bucks which the candidate is contesting centre of the important and vital trade on which it has thriven a savage struggle about justice has been raging for months past between the poor and rich as real as the french revolution  the man offering himself at wycombe as representative of the wycombe division simply says nothing about it at all it is as if a man at the crisis of the french terror had offered himself as a deputy for the town of paris and had said nothing about the monarchy nothing about the republic nothing about the massacres nothing about the war but had explained with great clearness his views on the suppression of the jansenists the literary style of racine the suitability of turenae for the post of commanderinchief and the religious reflections of madame de maintenon  for at their best the candidates topics are not topical  home rule is a very good thing and modern education is a very bad thing but neither of them are things that anybody is talking about in high wycombe  this is the first and simplest way of missing the point deliberately to avoid and ignore it   the candid candidate  it would be an amusing experiment by the way to go to the point instead of avoiding it  what fun it would be to stand as a strict party candidate but issue a perfectly frank and cynical election address  mr mosleys address begins gentlemensir alfred cripps having been chosen for a high judicial position and a seat in the house of lords a byelection now becomes necessary and the electors of south bucks are charged with the responsible duty of electing etc etc  but suppose there were another candidate whose election address opened in a plain manly style like this gentlemenin the sincere hope of being myself chosen for a high judicial position or a seat in the house of lords or considerably increasing my private fortune by some government appointment or at least inside information about the financial prospects i have decided that it is worth my while to disburse large sums of money to you on various pretexts and with even more reluctance to endure the bad speaking and bad ventilation of the commons house of parliament so help me god  i have very pronounced convictions on various political questions but i will not trouble my fellowcitizens with them since i have quite made up my mind to abandon any or all of them if requested to do so by the upper classes  the electors are therefore charged with the entirely irresponsible duty of electing a member or in other words i ask my neighbours round about this part who know i am not a bad chap in many ways to do me a good turn in my business just as i might ask them to change a sovereign  my election will have no conceivable kind of effect on anything or anybody except myself so i ask as man to man the electors of the southern or wycombe division of the county of buckingham to accept a ride in one of my motorcars and poll early to please a palgod save the king  i do not know whether you or i would be elected if we presented ourselves with an election address of that kind but we should have had our fun and comparatively speaking saved our souls and i have a strong suspicion that we should be elected or rejected on a mechanical majority like anybody else nobody having dreamed of reading an election address any more than an advertisement of a hair restorer   tyranny and headdress  but there is another and more subtle way in which we may miss the point and that is not by keeping a dead silence about it but by being just witty enough to state it wrong  thus some of the liberal official papers have almost screwed up their courage to the stickingpoint about the bestial coup detat in south africa  they have screwed up their courage to the stickingpoint and it has stuck  it cannot get any further because it has missed the main point  the modern liberals make their feeble attempts to attack the introduction of slavery into south africa by the dutch and the jews by a very typical evasion of the vital fact  the vital fact is simply slavery  most of these dutchmen have always felt like slaveowners  most of these jews have always felt like slaves  now that they are on top they have a particular and curious kind of impudence which is only known among slaves  but the liberal journalists will do their best to suggest that the south african wrong consisted in what they call martial law  that is that there is something specially wicked about men doing an act of cruelty in khaki or in vermilion but not if it is done in dark blue with pewter buttons  the tyrant who wears a busby or a forage cap is abominable the tyrant who wears a horsehair wig is excusable  to be judged by soldiers is hell but to be judged by lawyers is paradise  now the point must not be missed in this way  what is wrong with the tyranny in africa is not that it is run by soldiers  it would be quite as bad or worse if it were run by policemen  what is wrong is that for the first time since pagan times private men are being forced to work for a private man  men are being punished by imprisonment or exile for refusing to accept a job  the fact that botha can ride on a horse or fire off a gun makes him better rather than worse than any man like sidney webb or philip snowden who attempt the same slavery by much less manly methods  the liberal party will try to divert the whole discussion to one about what they call militarism  but the very terms of modern politics contradict it  for when we talk of real rebels against the present system we call them militants  and there will be none in the servile state    the servile state again  i read the other day in a quotation from a german newspaper the highly characteristic remark that germany having annexed belgium would soon reestablish its commerce and prosperity and that in particular arrangements were already being made for introducing into the new province the german laws for the protection of workmen  i am quite content with that paragraph for the purpose of any controversy about what is called german atrocity  if men i know had not told me they had themselves seen the bayoneting of a baby if the most respectable refugees did not bring with them stories of burning cottagesyes and of burning cottagers as well if doctors did not report what they do report of the condition of girls in the hospitals if there were no facts if there were no photographs that one phrase i have quoted would be quite sufficient to satisfy me that the prussians are tyrants tyrants in a peculiar and almost insane sense which makes them preeminent among the evil princes of the earth  the first and most striking feature is a stupidity that rises into a sort of ghastly innocence  the protection of workmen  some workmen perhaps might have a fancy for being protected from shrapnel some might be glad to put up an umbrella that would ward off things dropping from the gentle zeppelin in heaven upon the place beneath  some of these discontented proletarians have taken the same view as vandervelde their leader and are now energetically engaged in protecting themselves along the line of the yser i am glad to say not altogether without success  it is probable that nearly all of the belgian workers would on the whole prefer to be protected against bombs sabres burning cities starvation torture and the treason of wicked kings  in short it is probableit is at least possible impious as is the ideathat they would prefer to be protected against germans and all they represent  but if a belgian workman is told that he is not to be protected against germans but actually to be protected by germans i think he may be excused for staring  his first impulse i imagine will be to ask against whom  are there any worse people to come along  but apart from the hellish irony of this humanitarian idea the question it raises is really one of solid importance for people whose politics are more or less like ours  there is a very urgent point in that question against whom would the belgian workmen be protected by the german laws and if we pursue it we shall be enabled to analyse something of that poisonvery largely a prussian poisonwhich has long been working in our own commonwealth to the enslavement of the weak and the secret strengthening of the strong  for the prussian armies are preeminently the advance guard of the servile state  i say this scientifically and quite apart from passion or even from preference  i have no illusions about either belgium or england  both have been stained with the soot of capitalism and blinded with the smoke of mere colonial ambition both have been caught at a disadvantage in such modern dirt and disorder both have come out much better than i should have expected countries so modern and so industrial to do  but in england and belgium there is capitalism mixed up with a great many other things strong things and things that pursue other aims clericalism for instance and militant socialism in belgium trades unionism and sport and the remains of real aristocracy in england  but prussia is capitalism that is a gradually solidifying slavery and that majestic unity with which she moves dragging all the dumb germanies after her is due to the fact that her servile state is complete while ours is incomplete  there are not mutinies there are not even mockeries the voice of national selfcriticism has been extinguished forever  for this people is already permanently cloven into a higher and a lower class in its industry as much as its army  its employers are in the strictest and most sinister sense captains of industry  its proletariat is in the truest and most pitiable sense an army of labour  in that atmosphere masters bear upon them the signs that they are more than men and to insult an officer is death  if anyone ask how this extreme and unmistakable subordination of the employed to the employers is brought about we all know the answer  it is brought about by hunger and hardness of heart accelerated by a certain kind of legislation of which we have had a good deal lately in england but which was almost invariably borrowed from prussia  mr  herbert samuels suggestion that the poor should be able to put their money in little boxes and not be able to get it out again is a sort of standing symbol of all the rest  i have forgotten how the poor were going to benefit eventually by what is for them indistinguishable from dropping sixpence down a drain  perhaps they were going to get it back some day perhaps when they could produce a hundred coupons out of the daily citizen perhaps when they got their hair cut perhaps when they consented to be inoculated or trepanned or circumcised or something  germany is full of this sort of legislation and if you asked an innocent german who honestly believed in it what it was he would answer that it was for the protection of workmen  and if you asked again their protection from what  you would have the whole plan and problem of the servile state plain in front of you whatever notion there is there is no notion whatever of protecting the employed person from his employer  much less is there any idea of his ever being anywhere except under an employer  whatever the capitalist wants he gets  he may have the sense to want washed and wellfed labourers rather than dirty and feeble ones and the restrictions may happen to exist in the form of laws from the kaiser or bylaws from the krupps  but the kaiser will not offend the krupps and the krupps will not offend the kaiser  laws of this kind then do not attempt to protect workmen against the injustice of the capitalist as the english trade unions did  they do not attempt to protect workmen against the injustice of the state as the mediaeval guilds did  obviously they cannot protect workmen against the foreign invaderespecially when as in the comic case of belgium they are imposed by the foreign invader  what then are such laws designed to protect workmen against  tigers rattlesnakes hyenas  oh my young friends oh my christian brethren they are designed to protect this poor person from something which to those of established rank is more horrid than many hyenas  they are designed my friends to protect a man from himselffrom something that the masters of the earth fear more than famine or war and which prussia especially fears as everything fears that which would certainly be its end  they are meant to protect a man against himselfthat is they are meant to protect a man against his manhood  and if anyone reminds me that there is a socialist party in germany i reply that there isnt    the empire of the ignorant  that anarchic future which the more timid tories professed to fear has already fallen upon us  we are ruled by ignorant people  but the most ignorant people in modern britain are to be found in the upper class the middle class and especially the upper middle class  i do not say it with the smallest petulance or even distaste these classes are often really beneficent in their breeding or their hospitality or their humanity to animals  there is still no better company than the young at the two universities or the best of the old in the army or some of the other services  also of course there are exceptions in the matter of learning real scholars like professor gilbert murray or professor phillimore are not ignorant though they are gentlemen  but when one looks up at any mass of the wealthier and more powerful classes at the grand stand at epsom at the windows of parklane at the people at a fulldress debate or a fashionable wedding we shall be safe in saying that they are for the most part the most illtaught or untaught creatures in these islands   literally illiterate  it is indeed their feeble boast that they are not literally illiterate they are always saying the ancient barons could not sign their own namesfor they know less of history perhaps than of anything else  the modern barons however can sign their own namesor someone elses for a change  they can sign their own names and that is about all they can do they cannot face a fact or follow an argument or feel a tradition but least of all can they upon any persuasion read through a plain impartial book english or foreign that is not specially written to soothe their panic or to please their pride  looking up at these seats of the mighty i can only say with something of despair what robert lowe said of the enfranchised workmen we must educate our masters  i do not mean this as paradoxical or even as symbolical it is simply tame and true  the modern english rich know nothing about things not even about the things to which they appeal  compared with them the poor are pretty sure to get some enlightenment even if they cannot get liberty they must at least be technical  an old apprentice learnt a trade even if his master came like any turk and banged him most severely  the old housewife knew which side her bread was buttered even if it were so thin as to be almost imperceptible  the old sailor knew the ropes even if he knew the ropes end  consequently when any of these revolted they were concerned with things they knew pains practical impossibilities or the personal record   but they know  the apprentice cried clubs  and cracked his neighbours heads with the precision and fineness of touch which only manual craftsmanship can give the housewives who flatly refused to cook the hot dinner knew how much or how little cold meat there was in the house  the sailor who defied discipline by mutinying at the nore did not defy discipline in the sense of falling off the rigging or letting the water into the hold  similarly the modern proletariat however little it may know knows what it is talking about  but the curious thing about the educated class is that exactly what it does not know is what it is talking about  i mean that it is startlingly ignorant of those special things which it is supposed to invoke and keep inviolate  the things that workmen invoke may be uglier more acrid more sordid but they know all about them  they know enough arithmetic to know that prices have risen the kind levantine gentleman is always there to make them fully understand the meaning of an interest sum and the landlord will define rent as rigidly as ricardo  the doctors can always tell them the latin for an empty stomach and when the poor man is treated for the time with some human respect by the coronet it almost seems a pity he is not alive to hear how legally he died  against this bitter shrewdness and bleak realism in the suffering classes it is commonly supposed that the more leisured classes stand for certain legitimate ideas which also have their place in life such as history reverence the love of the land  well it might be no bad thing to have something even if it were something narrow that testified to the truths of religion or patriotism  but such narrow things in the past have always at least known their own history the bigot knew his catechism the patriot knew his way home  the astonishing thing about the modern rich is their real and sincere ignoranceespecially of the things they like   no  take the most topical case you can find in any drawingroom belfast ulster is most assuredly a matter of history and there is a sense in which orange resistance is a matter of religion  but go and ask any of the five hundred fluttering ladies at a garden party who find carson so splendid and belfast so thrilling what it is all about when it began where it came from what it really maintains what was the history of ulster  what is the religion of belfast  do any of them know where ulstermen were in grattans time do any of them know what was the protestantism that came from scotland to that isle could any of them tell what part of the old catholic system it really denied  it was generally something that the fluttering ladies find in their own anglican churches every sunday  it were vain to ask them to state the doctrines of the calvinist creed they could not state the doctrines of their own creed  it were vain to tell them to read the history of ireland they have never read the history of england  it would matter as little that they do not know these things as that i do not know german but then german is not the only thing i am supposed to know  history and ritual are the only things aristocrats are supposed to know and they dont know them   smile and smile  i am not fed on turtle soup and tokay because of my exquisite intimacy with the style and idiom of heine and richter  the english governing class is fed on turtle soup and tokay to represent the past of which it is literally ignorant as i am of german irregular verbs and to represent the religious traditions of the state when it does not know three words of theology as i do not know three words of german  this is the last insult offered by the proud to the humble  they rule them by the smiling terror of an ancient secret  they smile and smile but they have forgotten the secret    the symbolism of krupp  the curious position of the krupp firm in the awful story developing around us is not quite sufficiently grasped  there is a kind of academic clarity of definition which does not see the proportions of things for which everything falls within a definition and nothing ever breaks beyond it  to this type of mind which is valuable when set to its special and narrow work there is no such thing as an exception that proves the rule if i vote for confiscating some usurers millions i am doing they say precisely what i should be doing if i took pennies out of a blind mans hat  they are both denials of the principle of private property and are equally right and equally wrong according to our view of that principle i should find a great many distinctions to draw in such a matter  first i should say that taking a usurers money by proper authority is not robbery but recovery of stolen goods  second i should say that even if there were no such thing as personal property there would still be such a thing as personal dignity and different modes of robbery would diminish it in very different ways  similarly there is a truth but only a halftruth in the saying that all modern powers alike rely on the capitalist and make war on the lines of capitalism  it is true and it is disgraceful  but it is not equally true and equally disgraceful  it is not true that montenegro is as much ruled by financiers as prussia just as it is not true that as many men in the kaiserstrasse in berlin wear long knives in their belts as wear them in the neighbourhood of the black mountain  it is not true that every peasant from one of the old russian communes is the immediate servant of a rich man as is every employee of mr  rockefeller  it is as false as the statement that no poor people in america can read or write  there is an element of capitalism in all modern countries as there is an element of illiteracy in all modern countries  there are some who think that the number of our fellowcitizens who can sign their names ought to comfort us for the extreme fewness of those who have anything in the bank to sign it for but i am not one of these  in any case the position of krupp has certain interesting aspects  when we talk of army contractors as among the base but active actualities of war we commonly mean that while the contractor benefits by the war the war on the whole rather suffers by the contractor  we regard this unsoldierly middleman with disgust or great anger or contemptuous acquiescence or commercial dread and silence according to our personal position and character  but we nowhere think of him as having anything to do with fighting in the final sense  those worthy and wealthy persons who employ womens labour at a few shillings a week do not do it to obtain the best clothes for the soldiers but to make a sufficient profit on the worst  the only argument is whether such clothes are just good enough for the soldiers or are too bad for anybody or anything  we tolerate the contractor or we do not tolerate him but no one admires him especially and certainly no one gives him any credit for any success in the war confessedly or unconfessedly we knock his profits not only off what goes to the taxpayer but what goes to the soldier  we know the army will not fight any better at least because the clothes they wear were stitched by wretched women who could hardly see or because their boots were made by harassed helots who never had time to think  in wartime it is very widely confessed that capitalism is not a good way of ruling a patriotic or selfrespecting people and all sorts of other things from strict state organisation to quite casual personal charity are hastily substituted for it  it is recognised that the great employer nine times out of ten is no more than the schoolboy or the page who pilfers tarts and sweets from the dishes as they go up and down  how angry one is with him depends on temperament on the stage of the dinneralso on the number of tarts  now here comes in the real and sinister significance of krupps  there are many capitalists in europe as rich as vulgar as selfish as rootedly opposed to any fellowship of the fortunate and unfortunate  but there is no other capitalist who claims or can pretend to claim that he has very appreciably helped the activities of his people in war  i will suppose that lipton did not deserve the very severe criticisms made on his firm by mr justice darling but however blameless he was nobody can suppose that british soldiers would charge better with the bayonet because they had some particular kind of groceries inside them  but krupp can make a plausible claim that the huge infernal machines to which his country owes nearly all of its successes could only have been produced under the equally infernal conditions of the modern factory and the urban and proletarian civilisation  that is why the victory of germany would be simply the victory of krupp and the victory of krupp would be simply the victory of capitalism  there and there alone capitalism would be able to point to something done successfully for a whole nationdone as it would certainly maintain better than small free states or natural democracies could have done it  i confess i think the modern germans morally secondrate and i think that even war when it is conducted most successfully by machinery is secondrate war  but this secondrate war will become not only the first but the only brand if the cannon of krupp should conquer and what is very much worse it will be the only intelligent answer that any capitalist has yet given against our case that capitalism is as wasteful and as weak as it is certainly wicked  i do not fear any such finality for i happen to believe in the kind of men who fight best with bayonets and whose fathers hammered their own pikes for the french revolution    the tower of bebel  among the cloudy and symbolic stories in the beginning of the bible there is one about a tower built with such vertical energy as to take a hold on heaven but ruined and resulting only in a confusion of tongues  the story might be interpreted in many waysreligiously as meaning that spiritual insolence starts all human separations irreligiously as meaning that the inhuman heavens grudge man his magnificent dream or merely satirically as suggesting that all attempts to reach a higher agreement always end in more disagreement than there was before  it might be taken by the partially intelligent kensitite as a judgment on latin christians for talking latin  it might be taken by the somewhat less intelligent professor harnack as a final proof that all prehistoric humanity talked german  but when all was said the symbol would remain that a plain tower as straight as a sword as simple as a lily did nevertheless produce the deepest divisions that have been known among men in any case we of the world in revoltsyndicalists socialists guild socialists or whatever we call ourselveshave no need to worry about the scripture or the allegory  we have the reality  for whatever reason what is said to have happened to the people of shinak has precisely and practically happened to us  none of us who have known socialists or rather to speak more truthfully none of us who have been socialists can entertain the faintest doubt that a fine intellectual sincerity lay behind what was called linternationale it was really felt that socialism was universal like arithmetic  it was too true for idiom or turn of phrase  in the formula of karl marx men could find that frigid fellowship which they find when they agree that two and two make four  it was almost as broadminded as a religious dogma  yet this universal language has not succeeded at a moment of crisis in imposing itself on the whole world  nay it has not at the moment of crisis succeeded in imposing itself on its own principal champions herve is not talking economic esperanto he is talking french  bebel is not talking economic esperanto he is talking german  blatchford is not talking economic esperanto he is talking english and jolly good english too  i do not know whether french or flemish was vanderveldes nursery speech but i am quite certain he will know more of it after this struggle than he knew before  in short whether or no there be a new union of hearts there has really and truly been a new division of tongues  how are we to explain this singular truth even if we deplore it  i dismiss with fitting disdain the notion that it is a mere result of military terrorism or snobbish social pressure  the socialist leaders of modern europe are among the most sincere men in history and their nationalist note in this affair has had the ring of their sincerity  i will not waste time on the speculation that vandervelde is bullied by belgian priests or that blatchford is frightened of the horseguards outside whitehall  these great men support the enthusiasm of their conventional countrymen because they share it and they share it because there is though perhaps only at certain great moments such a thing as pure democracy  timour the tartar i think celebrated some victory with a tower built entirely out of human skulls perhaps he thought that would reach to heaven  but there is no cement in such building the veins and ligaments that hold humanity together have long fallen away the skulls will roll impotently at a touch and ten thousand more such trophies could only make the tower taller and crazier  i think the modern official apparatus of votes is very like that tottering monument  i think the tartar counted heads like an electioneering agent  sometimes when i have seen from the platform of some paltry party meeting the rows and rows of grinning upturned faces i have felt inclined to say as the poet does in the the vision of sinwelcome fellowcitizens hollow hearts and empty heads   not that the people were personally hollow or empty but they had come on a hollow and empty business to help the good mr binks to strengthen the insurance act against the wicked mr jinks who would only promise to fortify the insurance act  that night it did not blow the democratic gale yet it can blow on these as on others and when it does blow men learn many things  i for one am not above learning them  the marxian dogma which simplifies all conflicts to the class war is so much nobler a thing than the nosecounting of the parliaments that one must apologise for the comparison  and yet there is a comparison  when we used to say that there were so many thousands of socialists in germany we were counting by skulls  when we said that the majority consisting of proletarians would be everywhere opposed to the minority consisting of capitalists we were counting by skulls  why yes if all mens heads had been cut off from the rest of them as they were by the good sense and foresight of timour the tartar if they had no hearts or bellies to be moved no hand that flies up to ward off a weapon no foot that can feel a familiar soilif things were so the marxian calculation would be not only complete but correct  as we know today the marxian calculation is complete but it is not correct  now this is the answer to the questions of some kind critics whose actual words i have not within reach at the moment about whether my democracy meant the rule of the majority over the minority  it means the rule of the rulethe rule of the rule over the exception  when a nation finds a soul it clothes it with a body and does verily act like one living thing  there is nothing to be said about those who are out of it except that they are out of it  after talking about it in the abstract for decades this is democracy and it is marvellous in our eyes  it is not the difference between ninetynine persons and a hundred persons it is one personthe people  i do not know or care how many or how few of the belgians like or dislike the pictures of wiertz  they could not be either justified or condemned by a mere majority of belgians  but i am very certain that the defiance to prussia did not come from a majority of belgians  it came from belgium one and indivisibleatheists priests princes of the blood frenchified shopkeepers flemish boors men women and children and the sooner we understand that this sort of thing can happen the better for us  for it is this spontaneous spiritual fellowship of communities under certain conditions to which the four or five most independent minds of europe willingly bear witness today  but is there no exception is there no one faithful among the unfaithful found  is no great socialist politician still untouched by the patriotism of the vulgar  why yes the rugged ramsay macdonald scarred with a hundred savage fights against the capitalist parties still lifts up his horny hand for peace  what further need have we of witnesses  i for my part am quite satisfied and do not doubt that mr macdonald will be as industrious in damping down democracy in this form as in every other   a real danger  heaven forbid that i should once more wade in those swamps of logomachy and tautology in which the old guard of the determinists still seem to be floundering  the question of fate and free will can never attain to a conclusion though it may attain to a conviction  the shortest philosophic summary is that both cause and choice are ultimate ideas within us and that if one man denies choice because it seems contrary to cause the other man has quite as much right to deny cause because it seems contrary to choice  the shortest ethical summary is that determinism either affects conduct or it does not  if it does not it is morally not worth preaching if it does it must affect conduct in the direction of impotence and submission  a writer in the clarion says that the reformer cannot help trying to reform nor the conservative help his conservatism  but suppose the reformer tries to reform the conservative and turn him into another reformer  either he can in which case determinism has made no difference at all or he cant in which case it can only have made reformers more hopeless and conservatives more obstinate  and the shortest practical and political summary is that working men most probably will soon be much too busy using their free will to stop to prove that they have got it  nevertheless i like to watch the determinist in the clarion cockpit every week as busy as a squirrelin a cage  but being myself a squirrel leaping lightly from bough to bough and preferring the form of activity which occasionally ends in nuts i should not intervene in the matter even indirectly except upon a practical point  and the point i have in mind is practical to the extent of deadly peril  it is another of the numerous new ways in which the restless rich now walking the world with an awful insomnia may manage to catch us napping   must be a mystery  there are two letters in the clarion this week which in various ways interest me very much  one is concerned to defend darwin against the scientific revolt against him that was led by samuel butler and among other things it calls bernard shaw a back number  well most certainly the origin of species is a back number in so far as any honest and interesting book ever can be but in pure philosophy nothing can be out of date since the universe must be a mystery even to the believer  there is however one condition of things in which i do call it relevant to describe somebody as behind the times  that is when the man in question thinking of some state of affairs that has passed away is really helping the very things he would like to hinder  the principles cannot alter but the problems can  thus i should call a man behind the times who in the year 1872 pleaded for the peaceful german peasants against the triumphant militarism of napoleon  or i should call a man out of date who in the year 1892 wished for a stronger navy to compete with the navy of holland because it had once swept the sea and sailed up the thames  and i certainly call a man or a movement out of date that in the year 1914 when we few are fighting a giant machine strengthened with all material wealth and worked with all the material sciences thinks that our chief danger is from an excess of moral and religious responsibility  he reminds me of mr snodgrass who had the presence of mind to call out fire  when mr  pickwick fell through the ice  the other letter consists of the usual wiredrawn argument for fatalism man cannot imagine the universe being created and therefore is compelled by his reason to think the universe without beginning or end which i may remark he cannot imagine either  but the letter ends with something much more ominous than bad metaphysics  here in the middle of the clarion in the centre of a clean and combative democratic sheet i meet again my deplorable old acquaintance the scientific criminologist  the socalled evildoer should not be punished for his acts but restrained in fortyeight hours i could probably get a petition to that effect signed by millionaires  a short time ago a bill was introduced to hold irresponsible and restrain a whole new class of people who were incapable of managing their affairs with prudence  read the supporters names on the back of that bill and see what sort of democrats they were  now clearing our heads of what is called popular science which means going to sleep to a lullaby of long words let us use our own brains a little and ask ourselves what is the real difference between punishing a man and restraining him  the material difference may be any or none for punishment may be very mild and restraint may be very ruthless  the man of course must dislike one as much as the other or it would not be necessary to restrain him at all  and i assure you he will get no great glow of comfort out of your calling him irresponsible after you have made him impotent  a man does not necessarily feel more free and easy in a straight waistcoat than in a stone cell  the moral difference is that a man can be punished for a crime because he is born a citizen while he can be constrained because he is born a slave  but one arresting and tremendous difference towers over all these doubtful or arguable differences  there is one respect vital to all our liberties and all our lives in which the new restraint would be different from the old punishment  it is of this that the plutocrats will take advantage   the plain difference  the perfectly plain difference is this  all punishment even the most horrible proceeds upon the assumption that the extent of the evil is known and that a certain amount of expiation goes with it  even if you hang the man you cannot hang him twice  even if you burn him you cannot burn him for a month  and in the case of all ordinary imprisonments the whole aim of free institutions from the beginning of the world has been to insist that a man shall be convicted of a definite crime and confined for a definite period  but the moment you admit this notion of medical restraint you must in fairness admit that it may go on as long as the authorities choose to think or say that it ought to go on  the mans punishment refers to the past which is supposed to have been investigated and which in some degree at least has been investigated  but his restraint refers to the future which his doctors keepers and wardens have yet to investigate  the simple result will be that in the scientific utopia of the clarion men like mann or syme or larkin will not be put in prison because of what they have done  they will be kept in prison because of what they might do  indeed the builders of the new tyranny have already come very near to avowing this scientific and futurist method  when the lawyers tried to stop the suffragette from appearing at all they practically said we do not know your next weeks crime because it isnt committed yet but we are scientifically certain you have the criminal type  and by the sublime and unalterable laws of heredity all your poor little papers will inherit it  this is a purely practical question and that is why i insist on it even in such strenuous times  the writers on the clarion have a perfect right to think christianity is the foe of freedom or even that the stupidity and tyranny of the present government is due to the monkish mysticism of lord morley and mr john m robertson  they have a right to think the theory of determinism as true as calvin thought it  but i do not like seeing them walk straight into the enormous iron trap set open by the capitalists who find it convenient to make our law even more lawless than it is  the rich men want a scientist to write them a lettre de cachet as a doctor writes a prescription  and so they wish to seal up in a public gaol the scandals of a private asylum  yes the writers on the clarion are indeed claiming irresponsibility for human beings  but it is the governments that will be irresponsible not the governed  but i will tell them one small secret in conclusion  there is nothing whatever wrong in the ancient and universal idea of punishmentexcept that we are not punishing the right people   the dregs of puritanism  one peculiarity of the genuine kind of enemy of the people is that his slightest phrase is clamorous with all his sins  pride vainglory and hypocrisy seem present in his very grammar in his very verbs or adverbs or prepositions as well as in what he says which is generally bad enough thus i see that a nonconformist pastor in bromley has been talking about the pathetic little presents of tobacco sent to the common soldiers  this is how he talks about it  he is reported as having said by the help of god they wanted this cigarette business stopped  how one could write a volume on that sentence a great thick volume called the decline of the english middle class  in taste in style in philosophy in feeling in political project the horrors of it are as unfathomable as hell  first to begin with the trifle note something slipshod and vague in the mere verbiage typical of those who prefer a catchword to a creed  this cigarette business might mean anything  it might mean messrs  salmon and glucksteins business  but the pastor at bromley will not interfere with that for the indignation of his school of thought even when it is sincere always instinctively and unconsciously swerves aside from anything that is rich and powerful like the partners in a big business and strikes instead something that is poor and nameless like the soldiers in a trench  nor does the expression make clear who they arewhether the inhabitants of britain or the inhabitants of bromley or the inhabitants of this one crazy tabernacle in bromley nor is it evident how it is going to be stopped or who is being asked to stop it  all these things are trifles compared to the more terrible offences of the phrase but they are not without their social and historical interest  about the beginning of the nineteenth century the wealthy puritan class generally the class of the employers of labour took a line of argument which was narrow but not nonsensical  they saw the relation of rich and poor quite coldly as a contract but they saw that a contract holds both ways  the puritans of the middle class in short did in some sense start talking and thinking for themselves  they are still talking  they have long ago left off thinking  they talk about the loyalty of workmen to their employers and god knows what rubbish and the first small certainty about the reverend gentleman whose sentence i have quoted is that his brain stopped working as a clock stops years and years ago  second consider the quality of the religious literature  these people are always telling us that the english translated bible is sufficient training for anyone in noble and appropriate diction and so it is  why then are they not trained  they are always telling us that bunyan the rude midland tinker is as much worth reading as chaucer or spenser and so he is  why then have they not read him  i cannot believe that anyone who had seen even in a nightmare of the nursery apollyon straddling over the whole breadth of the way could really write like that about a cigarette  by the help of god they wanted this cigarette business stopped  therefore with angels and archangels and the whole company of heaven with st michael smiter of satan and captain of the chivalry of god with all the ardour of the seraphs and the flaming patience of the saints we will have this cigarette business stopped where has all the tradition of the great religious literatures gone to that a man should come on such a bathos with such a bump  thirdly of course there is the lack of imaginative proportion which rises into a sort of towering blasphemy  an enormous number of live young men are being hurt by shells hurt by bullets hurt by fever and hunger and horror of hope deferred hurt by lance blades and sword blades and bayonet blades breaking into the bloody house of life  but mr price i think thats his name is still anxious that they should not be hurt by cigarettes  that is the sort of maniacal isolation that can be found in the deserts of bromley  that cigarettes are bad for the health is a very tenable opinion to which the minister is quite entitled  if he happens to think that the youth of bromley smoke too many cigarettes and that he has any influence in urging on them the unhealthiness of the habit i should not blame him if he gave sermons or lectures about it with magiclantern slides so long as it was in bromley and about bromley  cigarettes may be bad for the health bombs and bayonets and even barbed wire are not good for the health  i never met a doctor who recommended any of them but the trouble with this sort of man is that he cannot adjust himself to the scale of things  he would do very good service if he would go among the rich aristocratic ladies and tell them not to take drugs in a chronic sense as people take opium in china  but he would be doing very bad service if he were to go among the doctors and nurses on the field and tell them not to give drugs as they give morphia in a hospital  but it is the whole hypothesis of war it is its very nature and first principle that the man in the trench is almost as much a suffering and abnormal person as the man in the hospital  hit or unhit conqueror or conquered he is by nature of the case having less pleasure than is proper and natural to a man  fourth for i need not dwell here on the mere diabolical idiocy that can regard beer or tobacco as in some way evil and unseemly in themselves there is the most important element in this strange outbreak at least the most dangerous and the most important for us  there is that main feature in the degradation of the old middle class the utter disappearance of its old appetite for liberty  here there is no question of whether the men are to smoke cigarettes or the women choose to send cigarettes or even that the officers or doctors choose to allow cigarettes  the thing is to cease and we may note one of the most recurrent ideas of the servile state it is mentioned in the passive mood it must be stopped and we must not even ask who has stopped it    the tyranny of bad journalism  the amazing decision of the government to employ methods quite alien to england and rather belonging to the police of the continent probably arises from the appearance of papers which are lucid and fighting like the papers of the continent  the business may be put in many ways  but one way of putting it is simply to say that a monopoly of bad journalism is resisting the possibility of good journalism  journalism is not the same thing as literature but there is good and bad journalism as there is good and bad literature as there is good and bad football  for the last twenty years or so the plutocrats who govern england have allowed the english nothing but bad journalism  very bad journalism simply considered as journalism  it always takes a considerable time to see the simple and central fact about anything  all sorts of things have been said about the modern press especially the yellow press that it is jingo or philistine or sensational or wrongly inquisitive or vulgar or indecent or trivial but none of these have anything really to do with the point  the point about the press is that it is not what it is called  it is not the popular press it is not the public press  it is not an organ of public opinion  it is a conspiracy of a very few millionaires all sufficiently similar in type to agree on the limits of what this great nation to which we belong may know about itself and its friends and enemies  the ring is not quite complete there are oldfashioned and honest papers but it is sufficiently near to completion to produce on the ordinary purchaser of news the practical effects of a corner and a monopoly  he receives all his political information and all his political marching orders from what is by this time a sort of halfconscious secret society with very few members but a great deal of money  this enormous and essential fact is concealed for us by a number of legends that have passed into common speech  there is the notion that the press is flashy or trivial because it is popular  in other words an attempt is made to discredit democracy by representing journalism as the natural literature of democracy  all this is cold rubbish  the democracy has no more to do with the papers than it has with the peerages the millionaire newspapers are vulgar and silly because the millionaires are vulgar and silly  it is the proprietor not the editor not the subeditor least of all the reader who is pleased with this monotonous prairie of printed words  the same slander on democracy can be noticed in the case of advertisements  there is many a tender old tory imagination that vaguely feels that our streets would be hung with escutcheons and tapestries if only the profane vulgar had not hung them with advertisements of sapolio and sunlight soap  but advertisement does not come from the unlettered many  it comes from the refined few  did you ever hear of a mob rising to placard the town hall with proclamations in favour of sapolio  did you ever see a poor ragged man laboriously drawing and painting a picture on the wall in favour of sunlight soapsimply as a labour of love  it is nonsense those who hang our public walls with ugly pictures are the same select few who hang their private walls with exquisite and expensive pictures  the vulgarisation of modern life has come from the governing class from the highly educated class  most of the people who have posters in camberwell have peerages at westminster  but the strongest instance of all is that which has been unbroken until lately and still largely prevails the ghastly monotony of the press  then comes that other legend the notion that men like the masters of the newspaper trusts give the people what they want why it is the whole aim and definition of a trust that it gives the people what it chooses in the old days when parliaments were free in england it was discovered that one courtier was allowed to sell all the silk and another to sell all the sweet wine  a member of the house of commons humorously asked who was allowed to sell all the bread  i really tremble to think what that sarcastic legislator would have said if he had been put off with the modern nonsense about gauging the public taste suppose the first courtier had said that by his shrewd selfmade sense he had detected that people had a vague desire for silk and even a deep dim human desire to pay so much a yard for it  suppose the second courtier said that he had by his own rugged intellect discovered a general desire for wine and that people bought his wine at his pricewhen they could buy no other suppose a third courtier had jumped up and said that people always bought his bread when they could get none anywhere else  well that is a perfect parallel  after bread the need of the people is knowledge said danton  knowledge is now a monopoly and comes through to the citizens in thin and selected streams exactly as bread might come through to a besieged city  men must wish to know what is happening whoever has the privilege of telling them  they must listen to the messenger even if he is a liar  they must listen to the liar even if he is a bore  the official journalist for some time past has been both a bore and a liar but it was impossible until lately to neglect his sheets of news altogether  lately the capitalist press really has begun to be neglected because its bad journalism was overpowering and appalling lately we have really begun to find out that capitalism cannot write just as it cannot fight or pray or marry or make a joke or do any other stricken human thing  but this discovery has been quite recent  the capitalist newspaper was never actually unread until it was actually unreadable  if you retain the servile superstition that the press as run by the capitalists is popular in any sense except that in which dirty water in a desert is popular consider the case of the solemn articles in praise of the men who own newspapersmen of the type of cadbury or harmsworth men of the type of the small club of millionaires  did you ever hear a plain man in a tramcar or train talking about carnegies bright genial smile or rothschilds simple easy hospitality  did you ever hear an ordinary citizen ask what was the opinion of sir joseph lyons about the hopes and fears of this our native land  these few smallminded men publish papers to praise themselves  you could no more get an intelligent poor man to praise a millionaires soul except for hire than you could get him to sell a millionaires soap except for hire  and i repeat that though there are other aspects of the matter of the new plutocratic raid one of the most important is mere journalistic jealousy the yellow press is bad journalism and wishes to stop the appearance of good journalism  there is no average member of the public who would not prefer to have lloyd george discussed as what he is a welshman of genius and ideals strangely fascinated by bad fashion and bad finance rather than discussed as what neither he nor anyone else ever was a perfect democrat or an utterly detestable demagogue  there is no reader of a daily paper who would not feel more concernand more respectfor sir rufus isaacs as a man who has been a stockbroker than as a man who happens to be attorneygeneral  there is no man in the street who is not more interested in lloyd georges investments than in his land campaign  there is no man in the street who could not understand and like rufus isaacs as a jew better than he can possibly like him as a british statesman there is no sane journalist alive who would say that the official account of marconis would be better copy than the true account that such papers as this have dragged out  we have committed one crime against the newspaper proprietor which he will never forgive  we point out that his papers are dull  and we propose to print some papers that are interesting    the poetry of the revolution  everyone but a consistent and contented capitalist who must be something pretty near to a satanist must rejoice at the spirit and success of the battle of the buses  but one thing about it which happens to please me particularly was that it was fought in one aspect at least on a point such as the plutocratic fool calls unpractical  it was fought about a symbol a badge a thing attended with no kind of practical results like the flags for which men allow themselves to fall down dead or the shrines for which men will walk some hundreds of miles from their homes  when a man has an eye for business all that goes on on this earth in that style is simply invisible to him  but let us be charitable to the eye for business the eye has been pretty well blacked this time  but i wish to insist here that it is exactly what is called the unpractical part of the thing that is really the practical  the chief difference between men and the animals is that all men are artists though the overwhelming majority of us are bad artists  as the old fable truly says lions do not make statues even the cunning of the fox can go no further than the accomplishment of leaving an exact model of the vulpine paw and even that is an accomplishment which he wishes he hadnt got there are chryselephantine statues but no purely elephantine ones  and though we speak in a general way of an elephant trumpeting it is only by human blandishments that he can be induced to play the drum  but man savage or civilised simple or complex always desires to see his own soul outside himself in some material embodiment  he always wishes to point to a table in a temple or a cloth on a stick or a word on a scroll or a badge on a coat and say this is the best part of me  if need be it shall be the rest of me that shall perish  this is the method which seems so unbusinesslike to the men with an eye to business  this is also the method by which battles are won   the symbolism of the badge  the badge on a trade unionists coat is a piece of poetry in the genuine lucid and logical sense in which milton defined poetry and he ought to know when he said that it was simple sensuous and passionate  it is simple because many understand the word badge who might not even understand the word recognition  it is sensuous because it is visible and tangible it is incarnate as all the good gods have been and it is passionate in this perfectly practical sense which the man with an eye to business may some day learn more thoroughly than he likes that there are men who will allow you to cross a word out in a theoretical document but who will not allow you to pull a big button off their bodily clothing merely because you have more money than they have  now i think it is this sensuousness this passion and above all this simplicity that are most wanted in this promising revolt of our time  for this simplicity is perhaps the only thing in which the best type of recent revolutionists have failed  it has been our sorrow lately to salute the sunset of one of the very few clean and incorruptible careers in the most corruptible phase of christendom  the death of quelch naturally turns ones thoughts to those extreme marxian theorists who whatever we may hold about their philosophy have certainly held their honour like iron  and yet even in this instant of instinctive reverence i cannot feel that they were poetical enough that is childish enough to make a revolution  they had all the audacity needed for speaking to the despot but not the simplicity needed for speaking to the democracy  they were always accused of being too bitter against the capitalist  but it always seemed to me that they were quite unconsciously of course much too kind to him  they had a fatal habit of using long words even on occasions when he might with propriety have been described in very short words  they called him a capitalist when almost anybody in christendom would have called him a cad and cad is a word from the poetic vocabulary indicating rather a general and powerful reaction of the emotions than a status that could be defined in a work of economics  the capitalist asleep in the sun let such long words crawl all over him like so many long soft furry caterpillars  caterpillars cannot sting like wasps  and in repeating that the old marxians have been perhaps the best and bravest men of our time i say also that they would have been better and braver still if they had never used a scientific word and never read anything but fairy tales   the beastly individualist  suppose i go on to a ship and the ship sinks almost immediately but i like the people in the bab ballads by reason of my clinging to a mast upon a desert island am eventually cast  or rather suppose i am not cast on it but am kept bobbing about in the water because the only man on the island is what some call an individualist and will not throw me a rope though coils of rope of the most annoying elaboration and neatness are conspicuous beside him as he stands upon the shore  now it seems to me that if in my efforts to shout at this fellowcreature across the crashing breakers i call his position the insularistic position and my position the semiamphibian position much valuable time may be lost  i am not an amphibian  i am a drowning man  he is not an insularist or an individualist  he is a beast  or rather he is worse than any beast can be  and if instead of letting me drown he makes me promise while i am drowning that if i come on shore it shall be as his bodily slave having no human claims henceforward forever then by the whole theory and practice of capitalism he becomes a capitalist he also becomes a cad  now the language of poetry is simpler than that of prose as anyone can see who has read what the oldfashioned protestant used to call confidently his bible  and being simpler it is also truer and being truer it is also fiercer  and for most of the infamies of our time there is really nothing plain enough except the plain language of poetry take let us say the ease of the recent railway disaster and the acquittal of the capitalists interest  it is not a scientific problem for us to investigate  it is a crime committed before our eyes committed perhaps by blind men or maniacs or men hypnotised or men in some other ways unconscious but committed in broad daylight so that the corpse is bleeding on our doorstep  good lives were lost because good lives do not pay and bad coals do pay  it seems simply impossible to get any other meaning out of the matter except that  and if in human history there be anything simple and anything horrible it seems to have been present in this matter  if even after some study and understanding of the old religious passions which were the resurrection of europe we cannot endure the extreme infamy of witches and heretics literally burned alivewell the people in this affair were quite as literally burned alive  if when we have really tried to extend our charity beyond the borders of personal sympathy to all the complexities of class and creed we still feel something insolent about the triumphant and acquitted man who is in the wrong here the men who are in the wrong are triumphant and acquitted  it is no subject for science  it is a subject for poetry but for poetry of a terrible sort
