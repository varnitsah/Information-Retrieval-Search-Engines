64543199	deep waters  by ww jacobs     the convert  mr purnip took the arm of the new recruit and hung over him almost tenderly as they walked along mr billing with a look of conscious virtue on his jolly face listened with much satisfaction to his friends compliments  its such an example said the latter  now weve got you the others will follow like sheep  you will be a bright lamp in the darkness  wots good enough for me ought to be good enough for them said mr billing modestly  theyd better not let me catch  hsh  hsh  breathed mr purnip tilting his hat and wiping his bald benevolent head  i forgot said the other with something like a sigh  no more fighting but suppose somebody hits me  turn the other cheek replied mr purnip  they wont hit that and when they see you standing there smiling at them  after being hit  interrupted mr billing  after being hit assented the other theyll be ashamed of themselves and itll hurt them more than if you struck them  lets ope so said the convert but it dont sound reasonable  i can hit a man pretty ard  not that im badtempered mind you a bit quick praps  and after all a good smack in the jaw saves any amount of argufying  mr purnip smiled and as they walked along painted a glowing picture of the influence to be wielded by a firstclass fightingman who refused to fight  it was a rough neighbourhood and he recognized with sorrow that more respect was paid to a heavy fist than to a noble intellect or a loving heart  and you combine them all he said patting his companions arm  mr billing smiled  you ought to know best he said modestly  youll be surprised to find how easy it is continued mr purnip  you will go from strength to strength  old habits will disappear and you will hardly know you have lost them  in a few months time you will probably be wondering what you could ever have seen in beer for example  i thought you said you didnt want me to give up beer  said the other  we dont said mr purnip  i mean that as you grow in stature you will simply lose the taste for it  mr billing came to a sudden full stop  dye mean i shall lose my liking for a drop o beer without being able to help myself  he demanded in an anxious voice  of course it doesnt happen in every case he said hastily  mr billings features relaxed  well lets ope i shall be one of the fortunate ones he said simply  i can put up with a good deal but when it comes to beer  we shall see said the other smiling  we dont want to interfere with anybodys comfort we want to make them happier thats all  a little more kindness between man and man a little more consideration for each other a little more brightness in dull lives  he paused at the corner of the street and with a hearty handshake went off  mr billing a prey to somewhat mixed emotions continued on his way home  the little knot of earnest men and women who had settled in the district to spread light and culture had been angling for him for some time  he wondered as he walked what particular bait it was that had done the mischief  theyve got me at last he remarked as he opened the housedoor and walked into his small kitchen  i couldnt say no to mr purnip  wish em joy said mrs billing briefly  did you wipe your boots  her husband turned without a word and retreating to the mat executed a prolonged doubleshuffle  you neednt wear it out said the surprised mrs billing  weve got to make people appier said her husband seriously be kinder to em and brighten up their dull lives a bit  thats wot mr purnip says  youll brighten em up all right declared mrs billing with a sniff i shant forget last tuesday weekno not if i live to be a hundred youd ha brightened up the policestation if i adnt got you home just in the nick of time  her husband who was by this time busy under the scullerytap made no reply  he came from it spluttering and seizing a small towel stood in the doorway burnishing his face and regarding his wife with a smile which mr purnip himself could not have surpassed  he sat down to supper and between bites explained in some detail the lines on which his future life was to be run  as an earnest of good faith he consented after a short struggle to a slip of oilcloth for the passage a pair of vases for the front room and a new and somewhat expensive corncure for mrs billing  and lets ope you go on as youve begun said that gratified lady theres something in old purnip after all  ive been worrying you for months for that oilcloth  are you going to help me wash up  mr purnip would  mr billing appeared not to hear and taking up his cap strolled slowly in the direction of the blue lion  it was a beautiful summer evening and his bosom swelled as he thought of the improvements that a little brotherliness might effect in elk street  engrossed in such ideas it almost hurt him to find that as he entered one door of the blue lion two gentlemen forgetting all about their beer disappeared through the other  wot ave they run away like that for  he demanded looking round i wouldnt hurt em  depends on wot you call hurting joe said a friend  mr billing shook his head  theyve no call to be afraid of me he said gravely  i wouldnt hurt a fly ive got a new art  a new wot inquired his friend staring  a new art repeated the other  ive given up fighting and swearing and drinking too much  im going to lead a new life and do all the good i can im going  glory  glory ejaculated a long thin youth and making a dash for the door disappeared  hell know me better in time said mr billing  why i wouldnt hurt a fly  i want to do good to people not to hurt em  ill have a pint he added turning to the bar  not here you wont said the landlord eyeing him coldly  why not demanded the astonished mr billing  youve had all you ought to have already was the reply  and theres one thing ill swear toyou aint had it ere  i havent ad a drop pass my lips began the outraged mr billing  yes i know said the other wearily as he shifted one or two glasses and wiped the counter ive heard it all before over and over again mind you ive been in this business thirty years and if i dont know when a mans had his whack and a drop more nobody does  you get off ome and ask your missis to make you a nice cup o good strong tea and then get up to bed and sleep it off  i dare say said mr billing with cold dignity as he paused at the doori dare say i may give up beer altogether  he stood outside pondering over the unforeseen difficulties attendant upon his new career moving a few inches to one side as mr ricketts a foe of long standing came towards the publichouse and halting a yard or two away eyed him warily  come along said mr billing speaking somewhat loudly for the benefit of the men in the bar i shant hurt you my fighting days are over  yes i dessay replied the other edging away  its all right bill said a mutual friend through the halfopen door hes got a new art  mr ricketts looked perplexed  art disease dye mean  he inquired hopefully  cant he fight no more  a new art said mr billing  its as strong as ever it was but its changedbrother  if you call me brother agin ill give you something for yourself and chance it said mr ricketts ferociously  im a pore man but ive got my pride  mr billing with a smile charged with brotherly love leaned his left cheek towards him  hit it he said gently  give it a smack and run bill said the voice of a wellwisher inside  thered be no need for im to run said mr billing  i wouldnt hit im back for anything  i should turn the other cheek  whaffor inquired the amazed mr ricketts  for another swipe said mr billing radiantly  in the fraction of a second he got the first and reeled back staggering the onlookers from the bar came out hastily  mr ricketts somewhat pale stood his ground  you see i dont hit you said mr billing with a ghastly attempt at a smile  he stood rubbing his cheek gently and remembering mr purnips statements slowly inch by inch turned the other in the direction of his adversary  the circuit was still incomplete when mr ricketts balancing himself carefully fetched it a smash that nearly burst it mr billing somewhat jarred by his contact with the pavement rose painfully and confronted him  ive only got two cheeks mind he said slowly  mr ricketts sighed  i wish youd got a blinking dozen he said wistfully  well so long  be good  he walked into the blue lion absolutely free from that sense of shame which mr purnip had predicted and accepting a pint from an admirer boasted noisily of his exploit  mr billing suffering both mentally and physically walked slowly home to his astonished wife  praps hell be ashamed of hisself when e comes to think it over he murmured as mrs billing rendered almost perfect by practice administered first aid  i spect hes crying his eyes out she said with a sniff  tell me if that urts  mr billing told her then suddenly remembering himself issued an expurgated edition  im sorry for the next man that its you said his wife as she drew back and regarded her handiwork  well you neednt be said mr billing with dignity  it would take more than a couple o props in the jaw to make me alter my mind when ive made it up  you ought to know that by this time  hurry up and finish i want you to go to the corner and fetch me a pot  what aint you going out agin  demanded his astonished wife  mr billing shook his head  somebody else might want to give me one he said resignedly and ive ad about all i want tonight  his face was still painful next morning but as he sat at breakfast in the small kitchen he was able to refer to mr ricketts in terms which were an eloquent testimony to mr purnips teaching  mrs billing unable to contain herself wandered off into the front room with a duster  are you nearly ready to go  she inquired returning after a short interval  five minutes said mr billing nodding  ill just light my pipe and then im off  cos theres two or three waiting outside for you added his wife  mr billing rose  ho is there  he said grimly as he removed his coat and proceeded to roll up his shirtsleeves  ill learn em  ill give em something to wait for  ill  his voice died away as he saw the triumph in his wifes face and drawing down his sleeves again he took up his coat and stood eyeing her in genuine perplexity  tell em ive gorn he said at last  and what about telling lies demanded his wife  what would your mr purnip say to that  you do as youre told exclaimed the harassed mr billing  im not going to tell em its you  mrs billing returned to the parlour and with mr billing lurking in the background busied herself over a china flowerpot that stood in the window and turned an anxious eye upon three men waiting outside  after a glance or two she went to the door  did you want to see my husband she inquired  the biggest of the three nodded  yus he said shortly  im sorry said mrs billing but he ad to go early this morning was it anything partikler  gorn said the other in disappointed tones  well you tell im ill see im later on  he turned away and followed by the other two walked slowly up the road  mr billing after waiting till the coast was clear went off in the other direction  he sought counsel of his friend and mentor that afternoon and stood beaming with pride at the praise lavished upon him  mr purnips coworkers were no less enthusiastic than their chief and various suggestions were made to mr billing as to his behaviour in the unlikely event of further attacks upon his noble person  he tried to remember the suggestions in the harassing days that followed baiting joe billing becoming popular as a pastime from which no evil results need be feared  it was creditable to his fellowcitizens that most of them refrained from violence with a man who declined to hit back but as a butt his success was assured  the night when a gawky lad of eighteen drank up his beer and then invited him to step outside if he didnt like it dwelt long in his memory  and elk street thrilled one evening at the sight of their erstwhile champion flying up the road hotly pursued by a foeman half his size  his explanation to his indignant wife that having turned the other cheek the night before he was in no mood for further punishment was received in chilling silence  theyll soon get tired of it he said hopefully and i aint going to be beat by a lot of chaps wot i could lick with one and tied behind me theyll get to understand in time mr purnip says so  its a pity that you dont try and do some good yourself  mrs billing received the suggestion with a sniff but the seed was sown she thought the matter over in private and came to the conclusion that if her husband wished her to participate in good works it was not for her to deny him  hitherto her efforts in that direction had been promptly suppressed mr billings idea being that if a woman looked after her home and her husband properly there should be neither time nor desire for anything else  his surprise on arriving home to tea on saturday afternoon and finding a couple of hardworking neighbours devouring his substance almost deprived him of speech  poor things said his wife after the guests had gone they did enjoy it  its cheered em up wonderful  you and mr purnip are quite right i can see that now  you can tell him that it was you what put it into my art  me  why i never dreamt o such a thing declared the surprised mr billing  and theres other ways of doing good besides asking a pack of old women in to tea  i know there is said his wife  all in good time she added with a faraway look in her eyes  mr billing cleared his throat but nothing came of it  he cleared it again  i couldnt let you do all the good said his wife hastily  it wouldnt be fair  i must help  mr billing lit his pipe noisily and then took it out into the backyard and sat down to think over the situation  the ungenerous idea that his wife was making goodness serve her own ends was the first that occurred to him  his suspicions increased with time  mrs billings good works seemed to be almost entirely connected with hospitality  true she had entertained mr purnip and one of the ladies from the settlement to tea but that only riveted his bonds more firmly  other visitors included his sister inlaw for whom he had a great distaste and some of the worstbehaved children in the street  its only high spirits said mrs billing all children are like that and i do it to help the mothers  and cos you like children said her husband preserving his good humour with an effort  there was a touch of monotony about the new life and the good deeds that accompanied it which to a man of ardent temperament was apt to pall and elk street instead of giving him the credit which was his due preferred to ascribe the change in his behaviour to what they called being a bit barmy on the crumpet  he came home one evening somewhat dejected brightening up as he stood in the passage and inhaled the ravishing odours from the kitchen  mrs billing with a trace of nervousness somewhat unaccountable in view of the excellent quality of the repast provided poured him out a glass of beer and passed flattering comment upon his appearance  wots the game  he inquired  game repeated his wife in a trembling voice  nothing  ow do you find that steakpudding  i thought of giving you one every wednesday  mr billing put down his knife and fork and sat regarding her thoughtfully  then he pushed back his chair suddenly and a picture of consternation and wrath held up his hand for silence  wwwot is it  he demanded  a cat  mrs billing made no reply and her husband sprang to his feet as a long thin wailing sounded through the house  a note of temper crept into it and strengthened it  wot is it  demanded mr billing again  itsits mrs smiths charlie stammered his wife  inin my bedroom exclaimed her husband in incredulous accents wots it doing there  i took it for the night said his wife hurriedly  poor thing what with the others being ill shes ad a dreadful time and she said if id take charlie for a fewfor a night she might be able to get some sleep  mr billing choked  and what about my sleep he shouted  chuck it outside at once  dye hear me  his words fell on empty air his wife having already sped upstairs to pacify master smith by a rhythmical and monotonous thumping on the back also she lifted up a thin and not particularly sweet voice and sang to him  mr billing finishing his supper in indignant silence told himself grimly that he was beginning to have enough of it  he spent the evening at the charlton arms and returning late went slowly and heavily up to bed  in the light of a shaded candle he saw a small objectionablelooking infant fast asleep on two chairs by the side of the bed  hsh said his wife in a thrilling whisper  hes just gone off  dye mean i mustnt open my mouth in my own bedroom  demanded the indignant man loudly  hsh said his wife again  it was too late  master smith opening first one eye and then the other finished by opening his mouth  the noise was appalling  hsh  hsh repeated mrs billing as her husband began to add to the noise  dont wake im right up  right up  repeated the astonished man  right up  why is he doing this in is sleep  he subsided into silence and undressing with stealthy care crept into bed and lay there marvelling at his selfcontrol  he was a sound sleeper but six times at least he was awakened by mrs billing slipping out of bedregardless of draughts to her liege lordand marching up and down the room with the visitor in her arms  he rose in the morning and dressed in ominous silence  i ope he didnt disturb you said his wife anxiously  youve done it replied mr billing  youve upset everything now since i joined the purnip lot everybodys took advantage of me now im going to get some of my own back  you wouldnt ha dreamt of behaving like this a few weeks ago  oh joe  said his wife entreatingly and everybodys been so happy  except me retorted joe billing  you come down and get my breakfast ready  if i start early i shall catch mr bill ricketts on is way to work  and mind if i find that steamorgin ere when i come ome tonight youll hear of it  he left the house with head erect and the light of battle in his eyes and meeting mr ricketts at the corner gave that justly aggrieved gentleman the surprise of his life  elk street thrilled to the fact that mr billing had broken out again and spoke darkly of what the evening might bring forth  curious eyes followed his progress as he returned home from work and a little later on the news was spread abroad that he was out and paying off old scores with an ardour that nothing could withstand  and wot about your change of art demanded one indignant matron as her husband reached home five seconds ahead of mr billing and hid in the scullery  its changed agin said mr billing simply  he finished the evening in the blue lion where he had one bar almost to himself and avoiding his wifes reproachful glance when he arrived home procured some warm water and began to bathe his honourable scars  mr purnip as been round with another gentleman said his wife  mr billing said oh  very much upset they was and ope youll go and see them she continued  mr billing said oh again and after thinking the matter over called next day at the settlement and explained his position  its all right for gentlemen like you he said civilly  but a man like me cant call his soul is ownor even is bedroom  everybody takes advantage of im  nobody ever gives you a punch and as for putting babies in your bedroom they wouldnt dream of it  he left amid expressions of general regret turning a deaf ear to all suggestions about making another start and went off exulting in his freedom  his one trouble was mr purnip that estimable gentleman who seemed to have a weird gift of meeting him at all sorts of times and places never making any allusion to his desertion but showing quite clearly by his manner that he still hoped for the return of the wanderer  it was awkward for a man of sensitive disposition and mr billing before entering a street got into the habit of peering round the corner first  he pulled up suddenly one evening as he saw his tenacious friend accompanied by a ladymember some little distance ahead  then he sprang forward with fists clenched as a passerby after scowling at mr purnip leaned forward and deliberately blew a mouthful of smoke into the face of his companion  mr billing stopped again and stood gaping with astonishment  the aggressor was getting up from the pavement while mr purnip in an absolutely correct attitude stood waiting for him  mr billing in a glow of delight edged forward and with a few other fortunates stood by watching one of the best fights that had ever been seen in the district mr purnips footwork was excellent and the way he timed his blows made mr billings eyes moist with admiration  it was over at last  the aggressor went limping off and mr purnip wiping his bald head picked up his battered and dusty hat from the roadway and brushed it on his sleeve  he turned with a start and a blush to meet the delighted gaze of mr billing  im ashamed of myself he murmured brokenlyashamed  ashamed  exclaimed the amazed mr billing  why a pro couldnt ha done better  such an awful example moaned the other  all my good work here thrown away  dont you believe it sir said mr billing earnestly  as soon as this gets about youll get more members than you want amost  im coming back for one  mr purnip turned and grasped his hand  i understand things now said mr billing nodding sagely  turning the other cheeks all right so long as you dont do it always  if you dont let em know whether you are going to turn the other cheek or knock their blessed heads off its all right  arf the trouble in the world is caused by letting people know too much
