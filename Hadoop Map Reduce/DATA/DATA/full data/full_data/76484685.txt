of every man of genius who has devoted a long life to the instruction and enlightenment of his fellowcreatures when he receives before his death all the honours paid by posterity thus when a great essayist or historian lives to attain a classic and worldwide fame his own biography becomes as interesting to the public as those he himself has written and by which he achieved his laurels  this is almost always the case when a man of such cosmopolitan celebrity outlives the ordinary allotted period of threescore years and ten for a younger generation has then sprung up who only hear of his great fame and are ignorant of the long and painful steps by which it was achieved these remarks are peculiarly applicable in regard to the man whose career we are now to dwell on for a short time his genius was of slow growth and development and his fame was even more tardy in coming but since the world some forty years ago fairly recognised him as a great and original thinker and teacher few men have left so indelible an impress on the public mind or have influenced to so great a degree the most thoughtful of their contemporaries  thomas carlyle was born on tuesday december 4th 1795 at ecclefechan a small village in the district of annandale dumfriesshire his father a stonemason was noted for quickness of mental perception and great energy and decision of character his mother as affectionate pious and more than ordinarily intelligenta and thus accepting his own theory that the history of a mans childhood is the description of his parents environment carlyle entered upon the mystery of life under happy and enviable circumstances after preliminary instruction first at the parish school and afterwards at annan he went in november 1809 and when he was fourteen years old to the university of edinburgh here he remained till the summer of 1814 distinguishing himself by his devotion to mathematical studies then taught there by professor leslie as a student he was irregular in his application but when he did set to work it was with his whole energy he appears to have been a great reader of general literature at this time and the stories that are told of the books that he got through are scarcely to be credited in the summer of 1814 on the resignation of mr waugh carlyle obtained by competitive examination at dumfries the post of mathematical master at annan academy although he had at his parents desire commenced his studies with a view to entering the scottish church the idea of becoming a minister was growingly distasteful to him a fellowstudent describes his habits at this time as lonely and contemplative and we know from another source that his vacations were principally spent among the hills and by the rivers of his native county in the summer of 1816 he was promoted to the post of classical and mathematical master at the old burgh or grammar school at kirkcaldy at the new school in that town edward irving whose acquaintance carlyle first made at edinburgh about christmas 1815 had been established since the year 1812 they were thus brought closely together and their intimacy soon ripened into a friendship destined to become famous at kirkcaldy carlyle remained over two years becoming more and more convinced that neither as minister nor as schoolmaster was he to successfully fight his way up in the world it had become clear to him that literature was his true vocation and he would have started in the profession at once had it been convenient for him to do so  footnote a james carlyle was born in august 1758 and died january 23 1832 his second wife whose maiden name was margaret aitken was born in september 1771 and died on christmas day 1853 there were nine children of this marriage whereof four sons and three daughters says the inscription en the tombstone in the burialground at ecclefechan survived gratefully reverent of such a father and such a mother  he had already written several articles and essays and a few of them had appeared in print but they gave little promise or indication of the power he was afterwards to exhibit during the years 18201823 he contributed a series of articles biographical and topographical to brewsters edinburgh encyclopaedia1 viz  footnote 1 vols xiv to xvi the fourteenth volume bears at the end the imprint edinburgh printed by balfour and clarke 1820 and the sixteenth volume printed by a balfour and co edinburgh 1823 most of these articles are distinguished by the initials tc but they are all attributed to carlyle in the list of the authors of the principal articles prefixed to the work on its completion     1 lady mary wortley montagu    2 montaigne    3 montesquieu    4 montfaucon    5 dr moore    6 sir john moore    7 necker    8 nelson    9 netherlands   10 newfoundland   11 norfolk   12 northamptonshire   13 northumberland   14 mungo park   15 lord chatham   16 william pitt  the following is from the article on necker  as an author necker displays much irregular force of imagination united with considerable perspicuity and compass of thought though his speculations are deformed by an undue attachment to certain leading ideas which harmonizing with his habits of mind had acquired an excessive preponderance in the course of his long and uncontroverted meditations he possessed extensive knowledge and his works bespeak a philosophical spirit but their great and characteristic excellence proceeds from that glow of fresh and youthful admiration for everything that is amiable or august in the character of man which in neckers heart survived all the blighting vicissitudes it had passed through combining in a singular union the fervour of the stripling with the experience of the sagea  footnote a in the earliest authorship of mr carlyle says mr james russell lowell alluding to these papers we find some not obscure hints of the future man the outward fashion of them is that of the period but they are distinguished by a certain security of judgment remarkable at any time remarkable especially in one so young carlyle in these first essays already shows the influence of his master goethe the most widely receptive of critics in a compact notice of montaigne there is not a word as to his religious scepticism the character is looked at purely from its human and literary sides  here is a passage from the article on newfoundland interesting as containing perhaps the earliest germ of the later style  the ships intended for the fishery on the southeast coast arrive early in june each takes her station opposite any unoccupied part of the beach where the fish may be most conveniently cured and retains it till the end of the season formerly the master who arrived first on any station was constituted fishingadmiral and had by law the power of settling disputes among the other crews but the jurisdiction of those admirals is now happily superseded by the regular functionaries who reside on shore each captain directs his whole attention to the collection of his own cargo without minding the concerns of his neighbour having taken down what part of the rigging is removable they set about their laborious calling and must pursue it zealously their mode of proceeding is thus described by mr anspach a clerical person who lived in the island several years and has since written a meagre and very confused book which he calls a history of it  to the new edinburgh review 182122 carlyle also contributed two papersone on joanna baillies metrical legends and one on goethes faust  in the year 1822 he made a translation of legendres geometry to which he prefixed an essay on proportion and the book appeared a year or two afterwards under the auspices of the late sir david brewstera the essay on proportion remains to this day the most lucid and succinct exposition of the subject hitherto published  footnote a elements of geometry and trigonometry with notes translated from the french of am legendre edited by david

which he speaks of an introduction on proportion by the translator is dated edinburgh august 1 1822  i was already says carlyle in his reminiscences getting my head a little up translating legendres geometry for brewster i still remember a happy forenoon in which i did a fifth book or complete doctrine of proportion for that work complete really and lucid and yet one of the briefest ever known it was begun and done that forenoon and i have except correcting the press next week never seen it since but still i feel as if it were right enough and felicitous in its kind i only got Â£50 for my entire trouble in that legendre but it was an honest job of work honestly donea  footnote a reminiscences by thomas carlyle edited by james anthony froude london longmans green and co 1881 vol 1 pp 198199  the late professor de morganan excellent authoritypronounced a high eulogium upon this essay on proportion  in 1822 carlyle accepted the post of tutor to charles buller of whose early death and honourable promise two touching records remain to us one in verse by thackeray and one in prose by carlyle  for the next four years carlyle devoted his attention almost exclusively to german literature  his life of schiller first appeared under the title of schillers life and writings in the london magazine    part   ioctober 1823   part  iijanuary 1824   part iiijuly 1824             august 1824             september 1824  it was enlarged and separately published by messrs taylor and hessey the proprietors of the magazine in 1825  the translation of wilhelm meister in 1824a was the first real introduction of goethe to the reading world of great britain it appeared without the name of the translator but its merits were too palpable to be overlooked though some critics objected to the strong infusion of german phraseology which had been imported into the english version this acquired idiom never left our author even in his original works although the life of schiller written but a few months before is almost entirely free from the peculiarity wilhelm meister in its english dress was better received by the english reading public than by english critics de quincey in one of his dyspeptic fits fell upon the book its author and the translatorb and lord jeffrey in the edinburgh review although admitting carlyle to be a talented person heaped condemnation

life of schiller  carlyles next work was a series of translations entitled german romance specimens of the chief authors with biographical and critical notices 4 vols edinburgh 1827 the preface and introductions are reprinted in the second volume of carlyles collected works the specimens translated from hoffmann and la motte fouquÃ© have not been reprinted  this says carlyle in 1857 was a book of translations not of my suggesting or desiring but of my executing as honest journeywork in defect of better the pieces selected were the suitablest discoverable on such terms not quite of less than no worth i considered any piece of them nor alas of a very high worth any except one only four of these lots or quotas to the adventure musÃ¦uss tiecks richters goethes will be given in the final stage of this series the rest we willingly leave afloat or stranded as waste driftwood to those whom they may farther concern  it was in 1826 that mr carlyle married miss jane welsh the only child of dr john welsh of haddingtona a lineal descendant of john knox and a lady fitted in every way to be the wife of such a man for some time after marriage he continued to reside at edinburgh but in may 1828 he took up his residence in his native county at craigenputtocha solitary farmhouse on a small estate belonging to his wifes mother about fifteen miles from dumfries and in one of the most secluded parts of the country most of his letters to goethe were written from this place  footnote a her father had been dead some seven years when carlyle and she were married and the life interest of her inheritance in the farm of craigenputtoch had been made over to her mother who survived until 1842 when it reverted to carlyle  in one of the letters sent from craigenputtoch to weimar bearing the date of 25th september 1828 we have a charming picture of our authors seclusion and retired literary life at this period  you inquire with such warm interest respecting our present abode and occupations that i feel bound to say a few words about both while there is still room left dumfries is a pleasant town containing about fifteen thousand inhabitants and may be considered the centre of the trade and judicial system of a district which possesses some importance in the sphere of scottish industry our residence is not in the town itself but fifteen miles to the northwest among the granite hills and the black morasses which stretch westward through galloway almost to the irish sea in this wilderness of heath and rock our estate stands forth a green oasis a tract of ploughed partly enclosed and planted ground where corn ripens and trees afford a shade although surrounded by seamews and roughwoolled sheep here with no small effort have we built and furnished a neat substantial dwelling here in the absence of professorial or other office we live to cultivate literature according to our strength and in our own peculiar way we wish a joyful growth to the rose and flowers of our garden we hope for health and peaceful thoughts to further our aims the roses indeed are still in part to be planted but they blossom already in anticipation two ponies which carry us everywhere and the mountain air are the best medicines for weak nerves this daily exerciseto which i am much devotedis my only recreation for this nook of ours is the loneliest in britainsix miles removed from any one likely to visit me here rousseau would have been as happy as on his island of st pierre my town friends indeed ascribe my sojourn here to a similar disposition and forbode me no good result but i came hither solely with the design to simplify my way of life and to secure the independence through which i could be enabled to remain true to myself this bit of earth is our own here we can live write and think as best pleases ourselves even though zoilus himself were to be crowned the monarch of literature nor is the solitude of such great importance for a stagecoach takes us speedily to edinburgh which we look upon as our british weimar and have i not too at this moment piled up upon the table of my little library a whole cartload of french german american and english journals and periodicalswhatever may be their worth of antiquarian studies too there is no lack from some of our heights i can descry about a days journey to the west the hill where agricola and his romans left a camp behind them at the foot of it i was born and there both father and mother still live to love me and so one must let time work  the above letter was printed by goethe himself in his preface to a german transition of carlyles life of schiller published at frankfort in 1830 other pleasant records of the intercourse between them exist in the shape of sundry graceful copies of verses addressed by goethe to mrs carlyle which will be found in the collection of his poems  carlyle had now fairly started as an original writer from the lonely farm of craigenputtoch went forth the brilliant series of essays contributed to the edinburgh westminster and foreign reviews and to frasers magazine which were not long in gaining for him a literary reputation in both hemispheres to this lonely farm came one day in august 1833 armed with a letter of introduction a visitor from the other side of the atlantic a young american then unknown to fame by name ralph waldo emerson the meeting of these two remarkable men was thus described by the younger of them many years afterwards  i came from glasgow to dumfries and being intent on delivering a letter which i had brought from rome inquired for craigenputtoch it was a farm in nithsdale in the parish of dunscore sixteen miles distant no public coach passed near it so i took a private carriage from the inn i found the house amid desolate heathery hills where the lonely scholar nourished his mighty heart carlyle was a man from his youth an author who did not need to hide from his readers and as absolute a man of the world unknown and exiled on that hillfarm as if holding on his own terms what is best in london he was tall and gaunt with a clifflike brow selfpossessed and holding his extraordinary powers of conversation in easy command clinging to his northern accent with evident relish full of lively anecdote and with a streaming humour which floated everything he looked upon his talk playfully exalting the familiar objects put the companion at once into an acquaintance with his lars and lemurs and it was very pleasant to learn what was predestined to be a pretty mythology few were the objects and lonely the man not a person to speak to within sixteen miles except the minister of dunscore so that books inevitably made his topics  he had names of his own for all the matters familiar to his discourse blackwoods was the sand magazine frasers nearer approach to possibility of life was the mud magazine a piece of road near by that marked some failed enterprise was the grave of the last sixpence when too much praise of any genius annoyed him he professed hugely to admire the talent shewn by his pig he had spent much time and contrivance in confining the poor beast to one enclosure in his pen but pig by great strokes of judgment had found out how to let a board down and had foiled him for all that he still thought man the most plastic little fellow in the planet and he liked neros death qualis artifex pereo better than most history he worships a man that will manifest any truth to him at one time he had inquired and read a good deal about america landors principle was mere rebellion and that he feared was the american principle the best thing he knew of that country was that in it a man can have meat for his labour he had read in stewarts book that when he inquired in a new york hotel for the boots he had been shown across the street and had found mungo in his own house dining on roast turkey  we talked of books plato he does not read and he disparaged socrates and when pressed persisted in making mirabeau a hero gibbon he called the splendid bridge from the old world to the new his own reading had been multifarious tristram shandy was one of his first books after robinson crusoe and robertsons america an early favourite rousseaus confessions had discovered to him that he was not a dunce and it was now ten years since he had learned german by the advice of a man who told him he would find in that language what he wanted  he took despairing or satirical views of literature at this moment recounted the incredible sums paid in one year by the great booksellers for puffing hence it comes that no newspaper is trusted now no books are bought and the booksellers are on the eve of bankruptcy  he still returned to english pauperism the crowded country the selfish abdication by public men of all that public persons should perform government should direct poor men what to do poor irish folk come wandering over these moors my dame makes it a rule to give to every son of adam bread to eat and supplies his wants to the next house but here are thousands of acres which might give them all meat and nobody to bid these poor irish go to the moor and till it they burned the stacks and so found a way to force the rich people to attend to them  we went out to walk over long hills and looked at criffel then without his cap and down into wordsworths country there we sat down and talked of the immortality of the soul it was not carlyles fault that we talked on that topic for he had the natural disinclination of every nimble spirit to bruise itself against walls and did not like to place himself where no step can be taken but he was honest and true and cognizant of the subtile links that bind ages together and saw how every event affects all the future christ died on the tree that built dunscore kirk yonder that brought you and me together time has only a relative existence  he was already turning his eyes towards london with a scholars appreciation london is the heart of the world he said wonderful only from the mass of human beings he liked the huge machine each keeps its own round the bakers boy brings muffins to the window at a fixed hour every day and that is all the londoner knows or wishes to know on the subject but it turned out good men he named certain individuals especially one man of letters his friend the best mind he knew whom london had well serveda  footnote a english traits by rw emerson first visit to england  carlyle says emerson was already turning his eyes towards london and a few months after the interview just described he did finally fix his residence there in a quiet street in chelsea leading down to the riverside here in an oldfashioned house built in the reign of queen anne he and his wife settled down in the early summer of 1834 here they continued to live together until she died and here carlyle afterwards lived on alone till the end of his life  with another man of whom he now became the neighbourleigh hunthe had already formed a slight acquaintance which soon ripened into a warm friendship and affection on both sides in spite of their singular difference of temperament and character  it was on the 8th of february 1832 says mr thornton hunt that the writer of the essays named characteristics received apparently from mr leigh hunt a volume entitled christianism for which he begged to express his thanks by the 20th of february carlyle then lodging in london was inviting leigh hunt to tea as the means of their first meeting and by the 20th of november carlyle wrote from dumfries urging leigh hunt to come hither and see us when you want to rusticate a month is that for ever impossible the philosopher afterwards came to live in the next street to his correspondent in chelsea and proved to be one of leigh hunts kindest most faithful and most considerate friendsa  footnote a from the correspondence of leigh hunt edited by his eldest son london smith elder and co 1862 vol 1 p 321  mr horne tells a story very characteristic of both men soon after the publication of heroes and hero worship they were at a small party when a conversation was started between these two concerning the heroism of man leigh hunt had said something about the islands of the blest or el dorado or the millennium and was flowing on his bright and hopeful way when carlyle dropped some heavy treetrunk across hunts pleasant stream and banked it up with philosophical doubts and objections at every interval of the speakers joyous progress but the unmitigated hunt never ceased his overflowing anticipations nor the saturnine carlyle his infinite demurs to those finite flourishings the listeners laughed and applauded by turns and had now fairly pitted them against each other as the philosopher of hopefulness and of the unhopeful the contest continued with all that ready wit and philosophy that mixture of pleasantry and profundity that extensive knowledge of books and character with their ready application in argument or illustration and that perfect ease and good nature which distinguish both of these men the opponents were so well matched that it was quite clear the contest would never come to an end but the night was far advanced and the party broke up they all sallied forth and leaving the close room the candles and the arguments behind them suddenly found themselves in presence of a most brilliant starlight night they all looked up now thought hunt carlyles done for he can have no answer to that there shouted hunt look up there look at that glorious harmony that sings with infinite voices an eternal song of hope in the soul of man carlyle looked up they all remained silent to hear what he would say they began to think he was silenced at lasthe was a mortal man but out of that silence came a few lowtoned words in a broad scotch accent and who on earth could have anticipated what the voice said eh its a sad sight hunt sat down on a stone step they all laughedthen looked very thoughtful had the finite measured itself with infinity instead of surrendering itself up to the influence again they laughedthen bade each other good night and betook themselves homeward with slow and serious pacea  footnote a a new spirit of the age by rh home london 1844 vol  p 278  in 1840 leigh hunt left chelsea and went to live at kensington but carlyle never altogether lost sight of him and on several occasions was able to do him very serviceable acts of kindness as for instance in writing certain memoranda concerning him with the view of procuring from government a small provision for leigh hunts declining years which we may as well give in this place    memoranda    concerning mr leigh hunt  1 that mr hunt is a man of the most indisputedly superior worth a man of genius in a very strict sense of that word and in all the senses which it bears or implies of brilliant varied gifts of graceful fertility of clearness lovingness truthfulness of childlike open character also of most pure and even exemplary private deportment a man who can be other than loved only by those who have not seen him or seen him from a distance through a false medium  2 that well seen into he has done much for the worldas every man possessed of such qualities and freely speaking them forth in the abundance of his heart for thirty years long must needs do how much they that could judge best would perhaps estimate highest  3 that for one thing his services in the cause of reform as founder and long as editor of the examiner newspaper as poet essayist public teacher in all ways open to him are great and evident few now living in this kingdom perhaps could boast of greater  4 that his sufferings in that same cause have also been great legal prosecution and penalty not dishonourable to him nay honourable were the whole truth known as it will one day be unlegal obloquy and calumny through the tory pressperhaps a greater quantity of baseless persevering implacable calumny than any other living writer has undergone which long course of hostility nearly the cruellest conceivable had it not been carried on in half or almost total misconception may be regarded as the beginning of his other worst distresses and a main cause of them down to this day  5 that he is heavily laden with domestic burdens more heavily than most men and his economical resources are gone from him for the last twelve years he has toiled continually with passionate diligence with the cheerfullest spirit refusing no task yet hardly able with all this to provide for the day that was passing over him and now after some two years of incessant effort in a new enterprise the london journal that seemed of good promise it also has suddenly broken down and he remains in ill health age creeping on him without employment means or outlook in a situation of the painfullest sort neither do his distresses nor did they at any time arise from wastefulness or the like on his own part he is a man of humble wishes and can live with dignity on little but from crosses of what is called fortune from injustice of other men from inexperience of his own and a guileless trustfulness of nature the thing and things that have made him unsuccessful make him in reality more loveable and plead for him in the minds of the candid  6 that such a man is rare in a nation and of high value there not to be procured for a whole nations revenue or recovered when taken from us and some Â£200 a year is the price which this one whom we now have is valued at with that sum he were lifted above his perplexities perhaps saved from nameless wretchedness it is believed that in hardly any other way could Â£200 abolish as much suffering create as much benefit to one man and through him to many and all  were these things set fitly before an english minister in whom great part of england recognises with surprise at such a novelty a man of insight fidelity and decision is it not probable or possible that he though from a quite opposite point of view might see them in somewhat of a similar light and so seeing determine to do in consequence ut fiat    tc  some years later says a writer in macmillans magazinea in the mellow evening of a life that had been so stormy mr leigh hunt himself told the story of his struggles his victories and his defeats with so singularly graceful a frankness that the most supercilious of critics could not but acknowledge that here was an autobiographer whom it was possible to like here is carlyles estimate of leigh hunts autobiography  footnote a july 1862    chelsea june 17 1850  dear hunt  i have just finished your autobiography which has been most pleasantly occupying all my leisure these three days and you must permit me to write you a word upon it out of the fulness of the heart while the impulse is still fresh to thank you this good book in every sense one of the best i have read this long while has awakened many old thoughts which never were extinct or even properly asleep but which like so much else have had to fall silent amid the tempests of an evil timeheaven mend it a word from me once more i know will not be unwelcome while the world is talking of you  well i call this an excellent good book by far the best of the autobiographic kind i remember to have read in the english language and indeed except it be boswells of johnson i do not know where we have such a picture drawn of a human life as in these three volumes  a pious ingenious altogether human and worthy book imaging with graceful honesty and free felicity many interesting objects and persons on your lifepath and imaging throughout what is best of all a gifted gentle patient and valiant human soul as it buffets its way through the billows of the time and will not drown though often in danger cannot be drowned but conquers and leaves a track of radiance behind it that i think conies out more clearly to me than in any other of your booksand that i can venture to assure you is the best of all results to realise in a book or written record in fact this book has been like an exercise of devotion to me i have not assisted at any sermon liturgy or litany this long while that has had so religious an effect on me thanks in the name of all men and believe along with me that this book will be welcome to other generations as well as to ours and long may you live to write more books for us and may the evening sun be softer on you and on me than the noon sometimes was  adieu dear hunt you must let me use this familiarity for i am an old fellow too now as well as you i have often thought of coming up to see you once more and perhaps i shall one of these days though horribly sick and lonely and beset with spectral lions go whitherward i may but whether i do or not believe for ever in my regard and so god bless you    prays heartily    t carlyle  on the other hand leigh hunt had an enthusiastic reverence for carlyle there are several incidental allusions to the latter of more or less consequence in hunts autobiography but the following is the most interesting  carlyles paramount humanityi believe that what mr carlyle loves better than his faultfinding with all its eloquence is the face of any human creature that looks suffering and loving and sincere and i believe further that if the fellowcreature were suffering only and neither loving nor sincere but had come to a pass of agony in this life which put him at the mercies of some good man for some last help and consolation towards his grave even at the risk of loss to repute and a sure amount of pain and vexation that man if the groan reached him in its forlornness would be thomas carlylea  footnote a autobiography of leigh

confessed might well have puzzled the critical gentlementhe booktasterswho decide for publishers what work to print among those submitted in manuscript it is a sort of philosophical romance in which the author undertakes to give in the form of a review of a german work on dress and in a notice of the life of the writer his own opinions upon matters and things in general the hero professor

truth and becoming in harmony with the divine idea there is much fanciful grotesque description in sartor with deep thought and beautiful imagery in this book wrote john sterling we always feel that there is a mystic influence around us bringing out into sharp homely clearness what is noblest in the remote and infinite exalting into wonder what is commonest in the dust and toil of every day  sartor found but few admirers those readers however were firm and enthusiastic in their applause in 1838 the sartor resartus papers already republished in the united states were issued in a collected form here and in 18391840 his various scattered articles in periodicals after having similarly received the honour of republication in america were published here first in four and afterwards in five volumes under the title of miscellanies  it was in the spring of 1837 that carlyles first great historical work appeared the french revolutionvol i the bastile vol ii the constitution vol iii the guillotine the publication of this book produced a profound impression on the public mind a history abounding in vivid and graphic descriptions it was at the same time a gorgeous prose epic it is perhaps the most readable of all carlyles works and indeed is one of the most remarkable books of the age there is no other account of the french revolution that can be compared with it for intensity of feeling and profoundness of thought  a great deal of information respecting carlyles manner of living and personal history during these earlier years in london may be gleaned incidentally from his life of john sterling a book which from the nature of it is necessarily partly autobiographical  thomas moore and others met him sometimes in london society at this time moore thus briefly chronicles

ignorancea  footnote a diary of thomas moore lond 1856 vol vii p 224  in 1835 after the publication of sartor resartus carlyle received an invitation from some american admirers of his writings to visit their country and he contemplated doing so but his labours in examining and collecting materials for his great work on the french revolution then hastening towards completion prevented him  we may say that for many reasons it is to be regretted that this design was never carried into execution had carlyle witnessed with his own eyes the admirable working of democratic institutions in the united states he might have done more justice to our transatlantic brethren who were always his first and foremost admirers and he might also have acquired more faith in the future destinies of his own countrymen  in december 1837 carlyle wrote a very remarkable letter to a correspondent in india which has never been printed in his works and which we are enabled to give here entire it is addressed to major david lester richardson in acknowledgment of his literary leaves or prose and verse published at calcutta in 1836 these literary leaves contain among other things an article on the italian opera taking much the same view of it as carlyle does and a sketch of edward irving these papers no doubt pleased carlyle and perhaps led him to entertain a rather exaggeratedly high opinion of the rest of the book    thomas carlyle to david lester richardson    5 cheyne row chelsea london   19th december 1837  my dear sir  your courteous gift with the letter accompanying it reached me only about a week ago though dated 20th of june almost at the opposite point of the year whether there has been undue delay or not is unknown to me but at any rate on my side there ought to be no delay  i have read your volumewhat little of it was known to me before and the much that was not knowni can say with true pleasure it is written as few volumes in these days are with fidelity with successful care with insight and conviction as to matter with clearness and graceful precision as to manner in a word it is the impress of a mind stored with elegant accomplishments gifted with an eye to see and a heart to understand a welcome altogether recommendable book more than once i have said to myself and others how many parlour firesides are there this winter in england at which this volume could one give credible announcement of its quality would be right pleasant company there are very many could one give the announcement but no such announcement can be given therefore the parlour firesides must even put up with  or what other stuff chance shovels in their way and read though with malediction all the time it is a great pity but no man can help it we are now arrived seemingly pretty near the point when all criticism and proclamation in matters literary has degenerated into an inane jargon incredible unintelligible inarticulate as the cawing of choughs and rooks and many things in that as in other provinces are in a state of painful and rapid transition a good book has no way of recommending itself except slowly and as it were accidentally from hand to hand the man that wrote it must abide his time he needs as indeed all men do the faith that this world is built not on falsehood and jargon but on truth and reason that no good thing done by any creature of god was is or ever can be lost but will verily do the service appointed for it and be found among the general sumtotal and all of things after long times nay after all time and through eternity itself let him cast his bread upon the waters therefore cheerful of heart he will find it after many days  i know not why i write all this to you it comes very spontaneously from me let it be your satisfaction the highest a man can have in this world that the talent entrusted to you did not lie useless but was turned to account and proved itself to be a talent and the publishing world can receive it altogether according to their own pleasure raise it high on the housetops or trample it low into the streetkennels that is not the question at all the thing remains precisely what it was after never such raising and never such depressing and trampling there is no change whatever in it i bid you go on and prosper  one thing grieves me the tone of sadness i might say of settled melancholy that runs through all your utterances of yourself it is not right it is wrong and yet how shall i reprove you if you knew me you would triumphantlya for any spiritual endowment bestowed on a man that it is accompanied or one might say preceded as the first origin of it always by a delicacy of organisation which in a world like ours is sure to have itself manifoldly afflicted tormented darkened down into sorrow and disease you feel yourself an exile in the east but in the west too it is exile i know not where under the sun it is not exile here in the fog babylon amid mud and smoke in the infinite din of vociferous platitude and quack outbellowing quack with truth and pity on all hands ground under the wheels can one call it a home or a world it is a waste chaos where we have to swim painfully for our life the utmost a man can do is to swim there like a man and hold his peace for this seems to me a great truth in any exile or chaos whatsoever that sorrow was not given us for sorrows sake but always and infallibly as a lesson to us from which we are to learn somewhat and which the somewhat once learned ceases to be sorrow i do believe this and study in general to consume my own smoke not indeed without very ugly outpuffs at times allan cunningham is the best he tells me that always as one grows older one grows happier a thing also which i really can believe but as for you my dear sir you have other work to do in the east than grieve are there not beautiful things there glorious things wanting only an eye to note them a hand to record them if i had the command over you i would say read paul et virginie then read the chaumiÃ¨re indienne gird yourself together for a right effort and go and do likewise or better i mean what i say the east has its own phases there are things there which the west yet knows not of and one heaven covers both he that has an eye let him look  footnote a there seems to be some omission or slip of the pen here  i hope you forgive me this style i have got into it seems to me on reading your book as if we had been long acquainted in some measure as if one might speak to you right from the heart i hope we shall meet some day or other i send you my constant respect and good wishes and am and remain    yours very truly always    t carlyle  carlyle first appeared as a lecturer in 1837 his first course was on german literature at williss rooms a series of six lectures of which the first was thus noticed in the spectator of saturday may 6 1837a  footnote a facsimiled in the autographic mirror july 1865  mr thomas carlyles lectures  mr carlyle delivered the first of a course of lectures on german literature at williss rooms on tuesday to a very crowded and yet a select audience of both sexes mr carlyle may be deficient in the mere mechanism of oratory but this minor defect is far more than counterbalanced by his perfect mastery of his subject the originality of his manner the perspicuity of his language his simple but genuine eloquence and his vigorous grasp of a large and difficult question no person of taste or judgment could hear him without feeling that the lecturer is a man of genius deeply imbued with his great argument  this course of lectures says a writer already quoted was well attended by the fashionables of the west end and though they saw in his manner something exceedingly awkward they could not fail to discern in his matter the impress of a mind of great originality and superior giftsa  footnote a james grant portraits of public characters lond 1841 vol ii p 152  the following year he delivered a second course on the history of literature or the successive periods of european culture at the literary institution in edwardsstreet portmansquare the revolutions of modern europe was the title given to the third course delivered twelve months later the fourth and last series of six lectures is the best remembered heroes and heroworship this course alone was published and it became more immediately popular than any of the works which had preceded it concerning these lectures leigh hunt remarked that it seemed as if some puritan had come to life again liberalized by german philosophy and his own intense reflections and experience another critic a scotch writer could see nothing but wild impracticability in them and exclaimed can any living man point to a single practical passage in any of these lectures if not what is the real value of mr carlyles teachings what is mr carlyle himself but a phantasm  the vein of puritanism running through his writings composed upon the model of the german school impressed many critics with the belief that their author although full of fire and energy was perplexed and embarrassed with his own speculations concerning this puritan element in his reflections mr james hannay remarks that earnestness that grim humourthat queer halfsarcastic halfsympathetic funis quite scotch it appears in knox and buchanan and it appears in burns i was not surprised when a schoolfellow of carlyles told me that his favourite poem was when a boy death and doctor hornbook and if i were asked to explain this originality i should say that he was a covenanter coming in the wake of the eighteenth century and the transcendental philosophy he has gone into the hills against shams as they did against prelacy erastianism and so forth but he lives in a quieter age and in a literary position so he can give play to the humour which existed in them as well and he overflows with a range of reading and speculation to which they were necessarily strangers  chartism published in 1839 and which to use the words of a critic of the time was the publication in which he first broke ground on the condition of england question appeared a short time before the lectures on heroes and heroworship were delivered if we remember rightly mr carlyle gave forth those grand utterances extemporaneously and without an abstract notes or a reminder of any kindutterances not beautiful to the flunkeymind or valetsoul occupied mainly with the fold of the heros necktie and the cut of his coat flunkeydom by one of its mouthpieces thus speaks of them  perhaps his course for the present year which was on heroworship was better attended than any previous one some of those who were present estimated the average attendance at three hundred they chiefly consisted of persons of rank and wealth as the number of carriages which each day waited the conclusion of the lecture to receive mr carlyles auditors and to carry them to their homes conclusively testified the locality of mr carlyles lectures has i believe varied every year the hanover rooms williss rooms and a place in the north of london the name of which i forget have severally been chosen as the place whence to give utterance to his profound and original trains of thought  a few words will be expected here as to mr carlyles manner as a lecturer in so far as his mere manner is concerned i can scarcely bestow on him a word of commendation there is something in his manner which if i may use a rather quaint term must seem very uncouth to london audiences of the most respectable class accustomed as they are to the polished deportmenta which is usually exhibited in williss or the hanover rooms when he enters the room and proceeds to the sort of rostrum whence he delivers his lectures he is according to the usual practice in such cases generally received with applause but he very rarely takes any more notice of the mark of approbation thus bestowed upon him than if he were altogether unconscious of it and the same seeming want of respect for his audience or at any rate the same disregard for what i believe he considers the troublesome forms of politeness is visible at the commencement of his lecture having ascended his desk he gives a hearty rub to his hands and plunges at once into his subject he reads very closely which indeed must be expected considering the nature of the topics which he undertakes to discuss he is not prodigal of gesture with his arms or body but there is something in his eye and countenance which indicates great earnestness of purpose and the most intense interest in his subject you can almost fancy in some of his more enthusiastic and energetic moments that you see his inmost soul in his face at times indeed very often he so unnaturally distorts his features as to give to his countenance a very unpleasant expression on such occasions you would imagine that he was suddenly seized with some violent paroxysms of pain he is one of the most ungraceful speakers i have ever heard address a public assemblage of persons in addition to the awkwardness of his general manner he makes mouths which would of themselves be sufficient to mar the agreeableness of his delivery and his manner of speaking and the ungracefulness of his gesticulation are greatly aggravated by his strong scotch accent even to the generality of scotchmen his pronunciation is harsh in no ordinary degree need i say then what it must be to an english ear  footnote a shade of mr turveydrop senior hear this man  i was present some months ago during the delivery of a speech by mr carlyle at a meeting held in the freemasons tavern for the purpose of forming a metropolitan library and though that speech did not occupy in its delivery more than five minutes he made use of some of the most extraordinary phraseology i ever heard employed by a human being he made use of the expression this london which he pronounced this loondun four or five timesa phrase which grated grievously on the ears even of those of mr carlyles own countrymen who were present and which must have sounded doubly harsh in the ears of an englishman considering the singularly broad scotch accent with which he spoke  a good deal of uncertainty exists as to mr carlyles religious opinions i have heard him represented as a firm and entire believer in revelation and i have heard it affirmed with equal confidence that he is a decided deist my own impression is ca  footnote a portraits of public characters by the author of random recollections of the lords and commons vol ii pp 152158  in 1841 carlyle superintended the publication of the english edition of his friend emersons essaysb to which he prefixed a characteristic preface of some length  footnote b essays by rw emerson of concord massachusetts with preface by thomas carlyle london james fraser 1841  the name of ralph waldo emerson he writes is not entirely new in england distinguished travellers bring us tidings of such a man fractions of his writings have found their way into the hands of the curious here fitful hints that there is in new england some spiritual notability called emerson glide through reviews and magazines whether these hints were true or not true readers are now to judge for themselves a little better  emersons writings and speakings amount to something and yet hitherto as seems to me this emerson is perhaps far less notable for what he has spoken or done than for the many things he has not spoken and has forborne to do with uncommon interest i have learned that this and in such a neverresting locomotive country too is one of those rare men who have withal the invaluable talent of sitting still that an educated man of good gifts and opportunities after looking at the public arena and even trying not with ill success what its tasks and its prizes might amount to should retire for long years into rustic obscurity and amid the allpervading jingle of dollars and loud chaffering of ambitions and promotions should quietly with cheerful deliberateness sit down to spend his life not in mammonworship or the hunt for reputation influence place or any outward advantage whatsoever this when we get a notice of it is a thing really worth noting  in 1843 past and present appeareda work without the wild power which sartor resartus possessed over the feelings of the reader but containing passages which look the same way and breathe the same spirit the book contrasts in a historicophilosophical spirit english society in the middle ages with english society in our own day in both this and the preceding work the great measures advised for the amelioration of the people are education and emigration  another very admirable letter addressed by mr carlyle in 1843 to a young man who had written to him desiring his advice as to a proper choice of reading and it would appear also as to his conduct in general we shall here bring forth from its hidingplace in an old scottish newspaper of a quarter of a century ago  dear sir  some time ago your letter was delivered me i take literally the first free halfhour i have had since to write you a word of answer  it would give me true satisfaction could any advice of mine contribute to forward you in your honourable course of selfimprovement but a long experience has taught me that advice can profit but little that there is a good reason why advice is so seldom followed this reason namely that it is so seldom and can almost never be rightly given no man knows the state of another it is always to some more or less imaginary man that the wisest and most honest adviser is speaking  as to the books which youwhom i know so little ofshould read there is hardly anything definite that can be said for one thing you may be strenuously advised to keep reading any good book any book that is wiser than yourself will teach you somethinga great many things indirectly and directly if your mind be open to learn this old counsel of johnsons is also good and universally applicableread the book you do honestly feel a wish and curiosity to read the very wish and curiosity indicates that you then and there are the person likely to get good of it our wishes are presentiments of our capabilities that is a noble saying of deep encouragement to all true men applicable to our wishes and efforts in regard to reading as to other things among all the objects that look wonderful or beautiful to you follow with fresh hope the one which looks wonderfullest beautifullest you will gradually find by various trials which trials see that you make honest manful ones not silly short fitful ones what is for you the wonderfullest beautifullestwhat is your true element and province and be able to profit by that true desire the monition of nature is much to be attended to but here also you are to discriminate carefully between true desire and false the medical men tell us we should eat what we truly have an appetite for but what we only falsely have an appetite for we should resolutely avoid it is very true and flimsy desultory readers who fly from foolish book to foolish book and get good of none and mischief of allare not these as foolish unhealthy eaters who mistake their superficial false desire after spiceries and confectioneries for their real appetite of which even they are not destitute though it lies far deeper far quieter after solid nutritive food with these illustrations i will recommend johnsons advice to you  another thing and only one other i will say all books are properly the record of the history of past menwhat thoughts past men had in themwhat actions past men did the summary of all books whatsoever lies there it is on this ground that the class of books specifically named history can be safely recommended as the basis of all study of booksthe preliminary to all right and full understanding of anything we can expect to find in books past history and especially the past history of ones own native country everybody may be advised to begin with that let him study that faithfully innumerable inquiries will branch out from it he has a broadbeaten highway from which all the country is more or less visible there travelling let him choose where he will dwell  neither let mistakes and wrong directionsof which every man in his studies and elsewhere falls into manydiscourage you there is precious instruction to be got by finding that we are wrong let a man try faithfully manfully to be right he will grow daily more and more right it is at bottom the condition which all men have to cultivate themselves our very walking is an incessant fallinga falling and a catching of ourselves before we come actually to the pavementit is emblematic of all things a man does  in conclusion i will remind you that it is not by books alone or by books chiefly that a man becomes in all points a man study to do faithfully whatsoever thing in your actual situation there and now you find either expressly or tacitly laid to your charge that is your post stand in it like a true soldier silently devour the many chagrins of it as all human situations have many and see you aim not to quit it without doing all that it at least required of you a man perfects himself by work much more than by reading they are a growing kind of men that can wisely combine the two thingswisely valiantly can do what is laid to their hand in their present sphere and prepare themselves withal for doing other wider things if such

character  to the editor of the times  sir  in your observations in yesterdays times on the late disgraceful affair of mr mazzinis letters and the secretary of state you mention that mr mazzini is entirely unknown to you entirely indifferent to you and add very justly that if he were the most contemptible of mankind it would not affect your argument on the subjecta  footnote a mr mazzinis character and habits and society are nothing to the point unless connected with some certain or probable evidence of evil intentions or treasonable plots we know nothing and care nothing about him he may be the most worthless and the most vicious creature in the world but this is no reason of itself why his letters should be detained and openedleading article june 17 1844  it may tend to throw farther light on this matter if i now certify you which i in some sort feel called upon to do that mr mazzini is not unknown to various competent persons in this country and that he is very far indeed from being contemptiblenone farther or very few of living men i have had the honour to know mr mazzini for a series of years and whatever i may think of his practical insight and skill in worldly affairs i can with great freedom testify to all men that he if i have ever seen one such is a man of genius and virtue a man of sterling veracity humanity and nobleness of mind one of those rare men numerable unfortunately but as units in this world who are worthy to be called martyrsouls who in silence piously in their daily life understand and practise what is meant by that  of italian democracies and young italys sorrows of extraneous austrian emperors in milan or poor old chimerical popes in bologna i know nothing and desire to know nothing but this other thing i do know and can here declare publicly to be a fact which fact all of us that have occasion to comment on mr mazzini and his affairs may do well to take along with us as a thing leading towards new clearness and not towards new additional darkness regarding him and them  whether the extraneous austrian emperor and miserable old chimera of a pope shall maintain themselves in italy or be obliged to decamp from italy is not a question in the least vital to englishmen but it is a question vital to us that sealed letters in an english postoffice be as we all fancied they were respected as things sacred that opening of mens letters a practice near of kin to picking mens pockets and to other still viler and far fataler forms of scoundrelism be not resorted to in england except in cases of the very last extremity when some new gunpowder plot may be in the wind some doubledyed high treason or imminent national wreck not avoidable otherwise then let us open lettersnot till then  to all austrian kaisers and such like in their time of trouble let us answer as our fathers from of old have answerednot by such means is help here for you such means allied to picking of pockets and viler forms of scoundrelism are not permitted in this country for your behoof the right hon secretary does himself detest such and even is afraid to employ them he dare not it would be dangerous for him all british

 chelsea june 18  footnote a from the times wednesday june 19 1844  the autumn of this year was saddened for carlyle by the loss of the dear friend whose biography he afterwards wrote on the 18th of september 1844after a short career of melancholy promise only half fulfilledjohn sterling died in his thirtyninth year  the next work that appeared from carlyles pena special service to history and to the memory of one of englands greatest menwas oliver cromwells letters and speeches with elucidations and a connecting narrative two volumes published in 1845 if there were any doubt remaining after the publication of the french revolution what position our author might occupy amongst the historians of the age it was fully removed on the appearance of cromwells letters the work obtained a great and an immediate popularity and though bulky and expensive a very large impression was quickly sold these speeches and letters of cromwell the spelling and punctuation corrected and a few words added here and there for clearness sake and to accommodate them to the language and style in use now were first made intelligible and effective by mr carlyle the authentic utterances of the man oliver himself he says i have gathered them from far and near fished them up from the foul lethean quagmires where they lay buried i have washed or endeavoured to wash them clean from foreign stupiditiessuch a job of buckwashing as i do not long to repeatand the world shall now see them in their own shape the work was at once republished in america and two editions were called for here within the year  while engaged on this work carlyle went down to rugby by express invitation on friday 13th may 1842 and on the following day explored the field of naseby in company with dr arnold the meeting of two such remarkable menonly six weeks before the death of the latterhas in it something solemn and touching and unusually interesting carlyle left the schoolhouse expressing the hope that it might long continue to be what was to him one of the rarest sights in the worlda temple of industrious peace  arnold who with the deep sympathy arising from kindred nobility of soul had long cherished a high reverence for carlyle was very proud of having received such a guest under his roof and during those few last weeks of life was wont to be in high spirits talking with his several guests and describing with much interest his recent visit to naseby with carlyle its position on some of the highest tableland in englandthe streams falling on the one side into the atlantic on the other into the german oceanfar away too from any townmarket harborough the nearest into which the cavaliers were chased late in the long summer evening on the fourteenth of june  perhaps the most graphic description of carlyles manner and conversation ever published is contained in the following passage from a letter addressed to emerson by an accomplished american margaret fuller who visited england in the autumn of 1846 and whose strange beautiful history and tragical death on her homeward voyage are known to most readers  the letter is dated paris november 16 1846  of the people i saw in london you will wish me to speak first of the carlyles mr c came to see me at once and appointed an evening to be passed at their house that first time i was delighted with him he was in a very sweet humourfull of wit and pathos without being overbearing or oppressive i was quite carried away with the rich flow of his discourse and the hearty noble earnestness of his personal being brought back the charm which once was upon his writing before i wearied of it i admired his scotch his way of singing his great full sentences so that each one was like the stanza of a narrative ballad he let me talk now and then enough to free my lungs and change my position so that i did not get tired that evening he talked of the present state of things in england giving light witty sketches of the men of the day fanatics and others and some sweet homely stories he told of things he had known of the scotch peasantry  of you he spoke with hearty kindness and he told with beautiful feeling a story of some poor farmer or artisan in the country who on sunday lays aside the cark and care of that dirty english world and sits reading the essays and looking upon the sea  i left him that night intending to go out very often to their house i assure you there never was anything so witty as carlyles description of   it was enough to kill one with laughing i on my side contributed a story to his fund of anecdote on this subject and it was fully appreciated carlyle is worth a thousand of you for thathe is not ashamed to laugh when he is amused but goes on in a cordial human fashion  the second time mr c had a dinnerparty at which was a witty french flippant sort of man author of a history of philosophya and now writing a life of goethe a task for which he must be as unfit as irreligion and sparkling shallowness can make him but he told stories admirably and was allowed sometimes to interrupt carlyle a little of which one was glad for that night he was in his more acrid mood and though much more brilliant than on the former evening grew wearisome to me who disclaimed and rejected almost everything he said  footnote a george henry lewes  for a couple of hours he was talking about poetry and the whole harangue was one eloquent proclamation of the defects in his own mind tennyson wrote in verse because the schoolmasters had taught him that it was great to do so and had thus unfortunately been turned from the true path for a man burns had in like manner been turned from his vocation shakespeare had not had the good sense to see that it would have been better to write straight on in proseand such nonsense which though amusing enough at first he ran to death after a while  the most amusing part is always when he comes back to some refrain as in the french revolution of the seagreen in this instance it was petrarch and laura the last word pronounced with his ineffable sarcasm of drawl although he said this over fifty times i could not help laughing when laura would come carlyle running his chin out when he spoke it and his eyes glancing till they looked like the eyes and beak of a bird of prey  poor laura luckily for her that her poet had already got her safely canonized beyond the reach of this teufelsdrÃ¶ckh vulture  the worst of hearing carlyle is that you cannot interrupt him i understand the habit and power of haranguing have increased very much upon him so that you are a perfect prisoner when he has once got hold of you to interrupt him is a physical impossibility if you get a chance to remonstrate for a moment he raises his voice and bears you down true he does you no injustice and with his admirable penetration sees the disclaimer in your mind so that you are not morally delinquent but it is not pleasant to be unable to utter it the latter part of the evening however he paid us for this by a series of sketches in his finest style of railing and raillery of modern french literature not one of them perhaps perfectly just but all drawn with the finest boldest strokes and from his point of view masterly all were depreciating except that of bÃ©ranger of him he spoke with perfect justice because with hearty sympathy  i had afterward some talk with mrs c whom hitherto i had only seen for who can speak while her husband is there i like her very muchshe is full of grace sweetness and talent her eyes are sad and charming                                       after this they went to stay at lord ashburtons and i only saw them once more when they came to pass an evening with us unluckily mazzini was with us whose society when he was there alone i enjoyed more than any he is a beauteous and pure music also he is a dear friend of mrs c but his being there gave the conversation a turn to progress and ideal subjects and c was fluent in invectives on all our rosewater imbecilities we all felt distant from him and mazzini after some vain efforts to remonstrate became very sad mrs c said to me  these are but opinions to carlyle but to mazzini who has given his all and helped bring his friends to the scaffold in pursuit of such subjects it is a matter of life and death  all carlyles talk that evening was a defence of mere forcesuccess the test of rightif people would not behave well put collars round their necksfind a hero and let them be his slaves c it was very titanic and anticelestial i wish the last evening had been more melodious however i bid carlyle farewell with feelings of the warmest friendship and admiration we cannot feel otherwise to a great and noble nature whether it harmonise with our own or not i never appreciated the work he has done for his age till i saw england i could not you must stand in the shadow of that mountain of shams to know how hard it is to cast light across it  honour to carlyle hoch although in the wine with which we drink this health i for one must mingle the despised rosewater  and now having to your eye shown the defects of my own mind in the sketch of another i will pass on more lowlymore willing to be imperfect since fate permits such noble creatures after all to be only this or that it is much if one is not only a crow or magpiecarlyle is only a lion some

amazement and a splendour scarcely to be faced with steady eyes he does not converseonly harangues it is the usual misfortune of such marked menhappily not one invariable or inevitablethat they cannot allow other minds room to breathe and show themselves in their atmosphere and thus miss the refreshment and instruction which the greatest never cease to need from the experience of the humblest  carlyle allows no one a chance but bears down all opposition not only by his wit and onset of words resistless in their sharpness as so many bayonets but by actual physical superiorityraising his voice and rushing on his opponent with a torrent of sound this is not in the least from unwillingness to allow freedom to others on the contrary no man would more enjoy a manly resistance to his thought but it is the impulse of a mind accustomed to follow out its own impulse as the hawk its prey and which knows not how to stop in the chase carlyle indeed is arrogant and overbearing but in his arrogance there is no littlenessno selflove it is the heroic arrogance of some old scandinavian conquerorit is his nature and the untameable impulse that has given him power to crush the dragons you do not love him perhaps nor revere and perhaps also he would only laugh at you if you did but you like him heartily and like to see him the powerful smith the siegfried melting all the old iron in his furnace till it glows to a sunset red and burns you if you senselessly go too near  he seems to me quite isolatedlonely as the desertyet never was a man more fitted to prize a man could he find one to match his mood he finds them but only in the past he sings rather than talks he pours upon you a kind of satirical heroical critical poem with regular cadences and generally catching up near the beginning some singular epithet which serves as a refrain when his song is full or with which as with a knitting needle he catches up the stitches if he has chanced now and then to let fall a row  for the higher kinds of poetry he has no sense and his talk on that subject is delightfully and gorgeously absurd he sometimes stops a minute to laugh at it himself then begins anew with fresh vigour for all the spirits he is driving before him seem to him as fata morganas ugly masks in fact if he can but make them turn about but he laughs that they seem to others such dainty ariels his talk like his

the fate of all   that sends the respite or the blow     thats free to give or to recall  carlyles paper reads like a solemn and touching funeral oration to the uncovered mourners as they stand round the grave before it is closed  a very beautiful soul has suddenly been summoned from among us one of the clearest intellects and most aÃ«rial activities in england has unexpectedly been called away charles buller died on wednesday morning last without previous sickness reckoned of importance till a day or two before an event of unmixed sadness which has created a just sorrow private and public the light of many a social circle is dimmer henceforth and will miss long a presence which was always gladdening and beneficent in the coming storms of political trouble which heap themselves more and more in ominous clouds on our horizon one radiant element is to be wanting now  mr buller was in his fortythird year and had sat in parliament some twenty of those a man long kept under by the peculiarities of his endowment and position but rising rapidly into importance of late years beginning to reap the fruits of long patience and to see an ever wider field open round him he was what in party language is called a reformer from his earliest youth and never swerved from that faith nor could swerve his luminous sincere intellect laid bare to him in all its abject incoherency the thing that was untrue which thenceforth became for him a thing that was not tenable that it was perilous and scandalous to attempt maintaining twenty years in the dreary weltering lake of parliamentary confusion with its disappointments and bewilderments had not quenched this tendency in which as we say he persevered as by a law of nature itself for the essence of his mind was clearness healthy purity incompatibility with fraud in any of its forms what he accomplished therefore whether great or little was all to be added to the sum of good none of it to be deducted there shone mildly in his whole conduct a beautiful veracity as if it were unconscious of itself a perfect spontaneous absence of all cant hypocrisy and hollow pretence not in word and act only but in thought and instinct to a singular extent it can be said of him that he was a spontaneous clear man very gentle too though full of fire simple brave graceful what he did and what he said came from him as light from a luminous body and had thus always in it a high and rare merit which any of the more discerning could appreciate fully  to many for a long while mr buller passed merely for a man of wit and certainly his beautiful natural gaiety of character which by no means meant levity was commonly thought to mean it and did for many years hinder the recognition of his intrinsic higher qualities slowly it began to be discovered that under all this manycoloured radiancy and coruscation there burnt a most steady light a sound penetrating intellect full of adroit resources and loyal by nature itself to all that was methodic manful truein brief a mildly resolute chivalrous and gallant character capable of doing much serious service  a man of wit he indisputably was whatever more amongst the wittiest of men his speech and manner of being played everywhere like soft brilliancy of lambent fire round the common objects of the hour and was beyond all others that english society could show entitled to the name of excellent for it was spontaneous like all else in him genuine humanethe glittering play of the soul of a real man to hear him the most serious of men might think within himself how beautiful is human gaiety too alone of wits buller never made wit he could be silent or grave enough where better was going often rather liked to be silent if permissible and always was so where needful his wit moreover was ever the ally of wisdom not of folly or unkindness or injustice no soul was ever hurt by it never we believe never did his wit offend justly any man and often have we seen his ready resource relieve one ready to be offended and light up a pausing circle all into harmony again in truth it was beautiful to see such clear almost childlike simplicity of heart coexisting with the finished dexterities and long experiences of a man of the world honour to human worth in whatever form we find it this man was true to his friends true to his convictionsand true without effort as the magnet is to the north he was ever found on the right side helpful to it not obstructive of it in all he attempted or performed  weak health a faculty indeed brilliant clear prompt not deficient in depth either or in any kind of active valour but wanting the stern energy that could long endure to continue in the deep in the chaotic new and painfully inconditethis marked out for him his limits which perhaps with regrets enough his natural veracity and practicality would lead him quietly to admit and stand by he was not the man to grapple in its dark and deadly dens with the lernÃ¦an coil of social hydras perhaps not under any circumstances but he did unassisted what he could faithfully himself did somethingnay something truly considerableand in his patience with the much that by him and his strength could not be done let us grant there was something of beautiful too  properly indeed his career as a public man was but beginning in the office he last held much was silently expected of him he himself too recognised well what a fearful and immense question this of pauperism is with what ominous rapidity the demand for solution of it is pressing on and how little the world generally is yet aware what methods and principles new strange and altogether contradictory to the shallow maxims and idle philosophies current at present would be needed for dealing with it this task he perhaps contemplated with apprehension but he is not now to be tried with this or with any task more he has fallen at this point of the march an honourable soldier and has left us here to fight along without him be his memory dear and honourable to us as that of one so worthy ought what in him was true and valiant endures for evermorebeyond all memory or record his light airy brilliancy has suddenly become solemn fixed in the earnest stillness of eternity there shall we also and our little works all shortly be  in 1850 appeared the latterday pamphlets essays suggested by the convulsions of 1848 in which more than in any previous publication the author spoke out in the character of a social and political censor of his own age he seemed to be the worshipper of mere brute force the advocate of all harsh coercive measures model prisons and schools for the reform of criminals poorlaws churches as at present constituted the aristocracy parliament and other institutions were assailed and ridiculed in unmeasured terms and generally the english public was set down as composed of sham heroes and a valet or flunkey world from their very nature as stern denunciations of what the author considered contemporary fallacies wrongs and hypocrisies these pamphlets produced a storm of critical indignation against him  the life of john sterling was published in the following year and carlyle then began that long spell of workthe history of frederick the greatwhich extended over thirteen years the last and perhaps the greatest monument of his genius  in 1856 when we may suppose his mind to be full of the details of battles and overflowing with military tactics he received from sir w napier his history of the administration of scinde and wrote the following letter to the author    thomas carlyle to sir william napier    chelsea may 12 1856  dear sir  i have read with attention and with many feelings and reflections your record of sir c napiers administration of scinde you must permit me to thank you in the name of britain at large for writing such a book and in my own poor name to acknowledge the great compliment and kindness implied in sending me a copy for myself  it is a book which every living englishman would be the better for readingfor studying diligently till he saw into it till he recognised and believed the high and tragic phenomenon set forth there a book which may be called profitable in the old scripture sense profitable for reproof for correction and admonition for great sorrow yet for building up in righteousness tooin heroic manful endeavour to do well and not ill in ones time and place one feels it a kind of possession to know that one has had such a fellowcitizen and contemporary in these evil days  the fine and noble qualities of the man are very recognisable to me his subtle piercing intellect turned all to the practical giving him just insight into men and into things his inexhaustible adroit contrivances his fiery valour sharp promptitude to seize the good moment that will not return a lynxeyed fiery man with the spirit of an old knight in him more of a hero than any modern i have seen for a long time  a singular veracity one finds in him not in his words alonewhich however i like much for their fine rough naÃ¯vetÃ©but in his actions judgments aims in all that he thinks and does and sayswhich indeed i have observed is the root of all greatness or real worth in human creatures and properly the first and also the rarest attribute of what we call genius among men  the path of such a man through the foul jungle of this worldthe struggle of heavens inspiration against the terrestrial fooleries cupidities and cowardicescannot be other than tragical but the man does tear out a bit of way for himself too strives towards the good goal inflexibly persistent till his long rest come the man does leave his mark behind him ineffaceable beneficent to all good men maleficent to none and we must not complain the british nation of this time in india or elsewheregod knows no nation ever had more need of such men in every region of its affairs but also perhaps no nation ever had a much worse chance to get hold of them to recognise and loyally second them even when they are there  anarchic stupidity is wide as the night victorious wisdom is but as a lamp in it shining here and there contrast a napier even in scinde with for example a lally at pondicherry or on the place de grÃ¨ve one has to admit that it is the common lot that it might have been far worse  there is great talent in this book apart from its subject the narrative moves on with strong weighty step like a marching phalanx with the gleam of clear steel in itsheers down the opponent objects and tramples them out of sight in a very potent manner the writer it is evident had in him a lively glowing image complete in all its parts of the transaction to be told and that is his grand secret of giving the reader so lively a conception of it i was surprised to find how much i had carried away with me even of the hill campaign and of trukkee itself though without a map the attempt to understand such a thing seemed to me desperate at first  with many thanks and gratified to have made this reflex acquaintance which if it should ever chance to become a direct one might gratify me still more    i remain always yours sincerely    t carlylea

discharge of his duty carlyle broke a long silence with the following letter    to the editor of the times  sir  there is a great deal of public sympathy and of deeper sort than usual awake at present on the subject of inspector braidwood it is a beautiful emotion and apparently a perfectly just one and well bestowed judging by whatever light one gets braidwood seems to have been a man of singular worth in his department and otherwise such a servant as the public seldom has thoroughly skilled in his function nobly valiant in it and faithful to itfaithful to the death in rude modest form actually a kind of hero who has perished in serving us  probably his sorrowing family is not left in wealthy circumstances most certainly it is pity when a generous emotion in many men or in any man has to die out futile and leave no action behind it the question therefore suggests itselfshould not there be a braidwood testimonial the proper parties undertaking it in a modest serious manner the public silently testifying to such extent at least what worth its emotion has  i venture to throw out this hint and if it be acted on will with great satisfaction give my mite among other people but

printed in the times tuesday july 2 1861  the history of frederick the great was completed early in 1865 later in the same year the students of edinburgh university elected carlyle as lord rector we cannot do better than describe the proceedings and the subsequent address in the words of the late alexander smith  mr gladstone demitted office and then it behoved the students of the university to cast about for a worthy successor two candidates were proposed mr carlyle and mr disraeli and on the election day mr carlyle was returned by a large and enthusiastic majority this was all very well but a doubt lingered in the minds of many whether mr carlyle would accept the office or if accepting it whether he would deliver an addresssaid address being the sole apple which the rectorial tree is capable of bearing the hare was indeed caught but it was doubtful somewhat whether the hare would allow itself to be cooked after the approved academical fashion it was tolerably well known that mr carlyle had emerged from his long spell of work on frederick in a condition of health the reverse of robust that he had once or twice before declined similar honours from scottish universitiesfrom glasgow some twelve or fourteen years ago and from aberdeen some seven or eight and that he was constitutionally opposed to all varieties of popular displays more especially those of the oratorical sort  but all dispute was ended when it was officially announced that mr carlyle had accepted the office of lord rector that he would conform to all its requirements and that the rectorial address would be delivered late in spring and so when the days began to lengthen in these northern latitudes and crocuses to show their yellow and purple heads people began to talk about the visit of the great writer and to speculate on what manner and fashion of speech he would deliver  edinburgh has no university hall and accordingly when speechday approached the largest public room in the city was chartered by the university authorities this public roomthe music hall in george streetwill contain under severe pressure from eighteen hundred to nineteen hundred persons and tickets to that extent were secured by the students and members of the general council curious stories are told of the eagerness on every side manifested to hear mr carlyle country clergymen from beyond aberdeen came into edinburgh for the sole purpose of hearing and seeing gentlemen came down from london by train the night before and returned to london by train the night after  in a very few minutes after the doors were opened the large hall was filled in every part and when up the central passage the principal the lord rector the members of the senate and other gentlemen advanced towards the platform the cheering was vociferous and hearty the principal occupied the chair of course the lord rector on his right the lord provost on his left every eye was fixed on the rector to all appearance as he sat time and labour had dealt tenderly with him his face had not yet lost the country bronze which he brought up with him from dumfriesshire as a student fiftysix years ago his long residence in london had not touched his annandale look nor had itas we soon learnedtouched his annandale accent his countenance was striking homely sincere truthfulthe countenance of a man on whom the burden of the unintelligible world had weighed more heavily than on most his hair was yet almost dark his moustache and short beard were iron grey his eyes were wide melancholy sorrowful and seemed as if they had been at times aweary of the sun altogether in his aspect there was something aboriginal as of a piece of unhewn granite which had never been polished to any approved pattern whose natural and original vitality had never been tampered with in a word there seemed no passivity about mr carlylehe was the diamond and the world was his pane of glass he was a graving tool rather than a thing graven upona man to set his mark on the worlda man on whom the world could not set its mark and just as glancing towards fife a few minutes before one could not help thinking of his early connection with edward irving so seeing him sit beside the venerable principal of the university one could not help thinking of his earliest connection with literature  time brings men into the most unexpected relationships when the principal was plain mr brewster editor of the edinburgh cyclopÃ¦dia little dreaming that he should ever be knight of hanover and head of the northern metropolitan university mr carlylejust as little dreaming that he should be the foremost man of letters of his day and lord rector of the same universitywas his contributor writing for said cyclopÃ¦dia biographies of montesquieu and other notables and so it came about that after years of separation and of honourable labour the old editor and contributor were brought together againin new aspects  the proceedings began by the conferring of the degree of lld on mr erskine of linlathenan old friend of mr carlyleson professors huxley tyndall and ramsay and on dr rae the arctic explorer that done amid a tempest of cheering and hats enthusiastically waved mr carlyle slipping off his rectorial robewhich must have been a very shirt of nessus to himadvanced to the table and began to speak in low wavering melancholy tones which were in accordance with the melancholy eyes and in the annandale accent with which his playfellows must have been familiar long ago so selfcontained was he so impregnable to outward influences that all his years of edinburgh and london life could not impair even in the slightest degree that  the opening sentences were lost in the applause what need of quoting a speech which by this time has been read by everybody appraise it as you please it was a thing per se just as if you wish a purple dye you must fish up the murex if you wish ivory you must go to the east so if you desire an address such as edinburgh listened to the other day you must go to chelsea for it it may not be quite to your taste but in any case there is no other intellectual warehouse in which that kind of article is kept in stock  the gratitude i owe to him isor should beequal to that of most he has been to me only a voice sometimes sad sometimes wrathful sometimes scornful and when i saw him for the first time with the eye of flesh stand up amongst us the other day and heard him speak kindly brotherly affectionate wordshis first appearance of that kind i suppose since he discoursed of heroes and hero worship to the london peoplei am not ashamed to confess that i felt moved towards him as i do not think in any possible combination of circumstances i could have felt moved towards any other living mana  footnote a the argosy may 1866  the edinburgh correspondent to a london paper thus describes what took place  a vast interest among the intelligent public has been excited by the prospect of mr thomas carlyles appearance to be installed as lord rector of the university of edinburgh with the exception of the delivery of his lectures on heroes and heroworship he has avoided oratory and to many of his admirers the present occasion seemed likely to afford their only chance of ever seeing him in the flesh and hearing his living voice the result has been that the university authorities have been beset by applications in number altogether unprecedentedto nearly all of which they could only give the reluctant answer that admission for strangers was impossible the students who elect mr carlyle received tickets if they applied within the specified time and the members of the university council or graduates obtained the residue according to priority of application ladies tickets to the number of one hundred and fifty were issued each professor obtaining four and the remaining thirty being placed at the disposal of sir david brewster the principal and the one hundred and fifty lucky ladies were conspicuous in the front of the gallery today having been admitted before the doors for students and other males were open  the hour appointed for letting them in was kept preciselyit was halfpast one pm but an hour before it despite occasional showers of rain a crowd had begun to gather at the front door of the musichall and at the opening of the door it had gathered to proportions sufficient to half fill the building its capacity under severe crushing being about two thousand  when the door was opened they rushed in as crowds of young men only can and dare rush and up the double stairs they streamed like a torrent which torrent however policemen and checkgates soon moderated i chanced to fall into a lucky current of the crowd and got in amongst the first two or three hundred and got forward to the fourth seat from the platform as good a place for seeing and hearing as any  the proceedings of the day were fixed to commence at two pm and the halfhour of waiting was filled up by the students in throwing occasional volleys of peas whistling en masse various lively tunes and in clambering like small escalading parties on to and over the platform to take advantage of the seats in the organ gallery behind for edinburgh students however let me say that these proceedings were singularly decorous they did indulge in a little fun when nothing else was doing but they did not come for that alone any student who wanted fun could have sold his ticket at a handsome profit for which better fun could be had elsewhere i heard among the crowd that some students had got so high a price as a guinea each for their tickets and i heard of others who had been offered no less but had refused it and i must say further that they listened to mr carlyles address with as much attention and reverence as they could have bestowed on a prophetonly i daresay most prophets would have elicited less applause and laughter  shortly before two the city magistrates and a few other personages mounted the platform and with as much quietness as the fancy of the students directed took the seats which had been marked out for them by large red pasteboard tickets at two precisely the students in the organ gallery started to the tops of the seats and began to cheer vociferously and almost instantly all the audience followed their example the procession was on its way through the hall and in half a minute lord provost chambers in his official robes mounted the platform stair then principal sir david brewster and lord rector carlyle both in their goldlaced robes of office then the rev dr lee and the other professors in their gowns also the llds to be in black gowns lord neaves and dr guthrie were there in an llds black gown and blue ribbons mr harvey the president of the royal academy and sir d baxter bartmen conspicuous in their plain clothes  dr lee offered up a prayer of a minute and a half at the amen of which i could see mr carlyle bow very low then the business of the occasion commenced mr gibsona tall thin palefaced beardless acute composedlooking young gentleman in an mas gownintroduced mr carlyle the most distinguished son of the university to the principal sir david brewster as the lord rector elected by the students sir david saluted him as such thinking perhaps of the time when an unknown young man thomas carlyle wrote articles for brewsters cyclopÃ¦dia and got brewsters name to introduce to public notice his translation of legendres geometry next professor muirhead for the time being the dean of the faculty of laws in the university introduced various gentlemen to the principal in order as persons whom the senate had thought worthy of the degree of lld giving a dignified but not always very happy account of the merits of each there was mr erskine of linlathen mr carlyles host for the time being and often previously an old friend of irving and chalmers himself the writer of various elegant and sincere religious books and one of the best and most amiable of men if intelligent goodness ever entitled any one to the degree of lld he certainly deserves it and when i say this i do not insinuate that on grounds of pure intellect he is not well entitled to the honour he is now i should think nearer eighty than seventy years of agea mildlooking fulleyed old man with a face somewhat of the type of lord derbys there was professor huxley young in years dark heavybrowed alert and resolute but not moulded after any high ideal and there was professor tyndall also young lithe of limb and nonchalant in manner when his name was called he sat as if he had no concern in what was going on and then rose with an easy smile partly of modesty but in great measure of indifference  dr rae the arctic explorer and first discoverer of the fate of sir john franklin who is an md of edinburgh was now made lld he is of tall wiry energetic figure slightly baldish with greyish curly hair keen handsome face high crown and sloping forehead and his bearing is that of a soldierof a man who has both given and obeyed commands and been drilled to stand steady and upright carlyle himself was offered the degree of lld but he declined the honour laughing it off in fact in a letter with such excuses as that he had a brother a dr carlyle an md also a man of genius i insert parenthetically and known in literature as a translator of dante and that if two dr carlyles should appear at paradise mistakes might arise  after all the llds had heard their merits enumerated and had had a black hood or wallet of some kind with a blue ribbon conspicuous in it flung over their heads principal brewster announced that the lord rector would now deliver his address thereupon mr carlyle rose at once shook himself out of his goldlaced rectorial gown left it on his chair and stepped quietly to the table and drawing his tall bony frame into a position of straight perpendicularity not possible to one man in five hundred at seventy years of age he began to speak quietly and distinctly but nervously there was a slight flush on his face but he bore himself with composure and dignity and in the course of half an hour he was obviously beginning to feel at his ease so far at least as to have adequate command over the current of his thought  he spoke on quite freely and easily hardly ever repeated a word never looked at a note and only once returned to finish up a topic from which he had deviated he apologised for not having come with a written discourse it was usual and it would have been more comfortable for me just at present but he had tried it and could not satisfy himself and as the spoken word comes from the heart he had resolved to try that method what he said in words will be learned otherwise than from me i could not well describe it but i do not think i ever heard any address that i should be so unwilling to blot from my memory not that there was much in it that cannot be found in his writings or inferred from them but the manner of the man was a key to the writings and for naturalness and quiet power i have never seen anything to compare with it he did not deal in rhetoric he talkedit was continuous strong quiet talklike a patriarch about to leave the world to the young lads who had chosen him and were just entering the world his voice is a soft downy voicenot a tone in it is of the shrill fierce kind that one would expect it to be in reading the latterday pamphlets  there was not a trace of effort or of affectation or even of extravagance shrewd common sense there was in abundance there was the involved disrupted style also but it looked so natural that reflection was needed to recognise in it that very style which purists find to be unenglish and unintelligible over the angles of this disrupted style rolled out a few cascades of humourquite as if by accident he let them go talking on in his soft downy accents without a smile occasionally for an instant looking very serious with his dark eyes beating like pulses but generally looking merely composed and kindly and so to speak fatherlike he concluded by reciting his own translation of a poem of goethe    the future hides in it gladness and sorrow  and this he did in a style of melancholy grandeur not to be described but still less to be forgotten it was then alone that the personality of the philosopher and poet were revealed continuously in his manner of utterance the features of his face are familiar to all from his portraits but i do not think any portrait unless perhaps woolners medallion gives full expression to the resolution that is visible in his face besides they all make him look sadder and older than he appears although he be threescore and ten his hair is still abundant and tolerably black and there is considerable colour in his cheek not a man of his age on that platform today looked so young and he had done more work than any ten on it  the correspondent of the pall mall gazette gives some interesting particulars  mr carlyle had not spoken in public before yesterday since those grand utterances on heroes and heroworship in the institute in edwards street marylebone which one can scarcely believe whilst reading them to have been in the best sense extemporaneously delivered in that case mr carlyle began the series as we have heard by bringing a manuscript which he evidently found much in his way and presently abandoned on the second evening he brought some notes or headings but these also tripped him until he had left them the remaining lectures were given like his conversation which no one can hear without feeling that with all its glow and inspiration every sentence would be if taken down found faultless it was so in his remarkable extemporaneous address yesterday he had no notes whatever but says our correspondent in transmitting the report i have never heard a speech of whose more remarkable qualities so few can be conveyed on paper you will read of applause and laughter but you will little realize the eloquent blood flaming up the speakers cheek the kindling of his eye or the inexpressible voice and look when the drolleries were coming out when he spoke of claptrap books exciting astonishment in the minds of foolish persons the evident halting at the word fools and the smoothing of his hair as if he must be decorous which preceded the change to foolish persons were exceedingly comical as for the flaming bursts they took shape in grand tones whose impression was made deeper not by raising but by lowering the voice your correspondent here declares that he should hold it worth his coming all the way from london in the rain in the sunday night train were it only to have heard carlyle say there is a nobler ambition than the gaining of all california or the getting of all the suffrages that are on the planet just now in the first few minutes of the address there was some hesitation and much of the shrinking that one might expect in a secluded scholar but these very soon cleared away and during the larger part and to the close of the oration it was evident that he was receiving a sympathetic influence from his listeners which he did not fail to return tenfold the applause became less frequent the silence became that of a woven spell and the recitation of the beautiful lines from goethe at the end was so masterlyso marvellousthat one felt in it that carlyles real anathemas against rhetoric were but the expression of his knowledge that there is a rhetoric beyond all other arts  in the times the following leader appeared upon mr carlyles address  there is something in the return of a man to the haunts of his youth after he has acquired fame and a recognised position in the world which is of itself sufficient to arrest attention we are interested in the retrospect and the contrast the juxtaposition of the old and the new the hopes of early years the memory of the struggles and contests of manhood the repose of victory a man may differ as much as he pleases from the doctrines of mr carlyle he may reject his historical teachings and may distrust his politics but he must be of a very unkindly disposition not to be touched by his reception at edinburgh it is fiftyfour years he told the students of the university since he a boy of fourteen came as a student full of wonder and expectation to the old capital of his native country and now he returns having accomplished the days of man spoken of by the psalmist that he may be honoured by students of this generation and may give them a few words of advice on the life which lies before them  the discourse of the new lord rector squared very well with the occasion there was no novelty in it new truths are not the gifts which the old offer the young the lesson we learn last is but the fulness of the meaning of what was only partially apprehended at first mr carlyle brought out things familiar enough to everyone who has read his works there were the old platitudes and the old truths and it must be owned mingled here and there with them the old errors time has however its recompenses and if the freshness of youth seemed to be wanting in the address of the rector so also was its crudity there was a singular mellowness in mr carlyles speech which was reflected in the homely language in which it was couched the chief lessons he had to enforce were to avoid cram and to be painstaking diligent and patient in the acquisition of knowledge students are not to try to make themselves acquainted with the outsides of as many things as possible and to go flourishing about upon the strength of their acquisitions but to count a thing as known only when it is stamped on their mind the doctrine is only a new reading of the old maxim non multa sed multum but it is as much needed now as ever it was still more appropriate to the present day was mr carlyles protest against the notion that a university is the place where a man is to be fitted for the special work of a profession a university as he puts it teaches a man how to read or as we may say more generally how to learn it is not the function of such a place to offer particular and technical knowledge but to prepare a man for mastering any science by teaching him the method of all a child learns the use of his body not the art of a carpenter or smith and the university student learns the use of his mind not the professional lore of a lawyer or a physician it is pleasant to meet with a strong reassertion of doctrines which the utilitarianism of a commercial and manufacturing age is too apt to make us all forget mr carlyle is essentially conservative in his notions on academic functions accuracy discrimination judgment are with him the beall and endall of educational training if a man has learnt to know a thing in itself and in its relation to surrounding phenomena he has got from a university what it is its proper duty to teach accordingly we find him bestowing a good word on poor old arthur collins who showed that he possessed these valuable qualities in the humble work of compiling a peerage  the new lord rector is however as conservative in his choice of the implements of study as he is in the determination of its objects the languages and the history of the great nations of antiquity he puts foremost like any other pedagogue the greeks and the romans are he tells the edinburgh students a pair of nations shining in the records left by themselves as a kind of pillar to light up life in the darkness of the past ages and he adds that it would be well worth their while to get an understanding of what these people were and what they did it is here however that an old error of mr carlyles crops up among his wellremembered truths he quotes from machiavellievidently agreeing himself with the sentiment though he refrained from asking the assent of his audience to itthe statement that the history of rome showed that a democracy could not permanently exist without the occasional intervention of a dictator it is possible that if machiavelli had had the experience of the centuries which have elapsed since his day he would have seen fit to alter his conclusion and it is to be regretted that the admiration which mr carlyle feels for the great men of history will not allow him to believe in the possibility of a political society where each might find his proper sphere and duty without disturbing the order and natural succession of the commonwealth his judgment on this point is like that of a man who had only known the steamengine before the invention of governor balls and was ready to declare that its mechanism would be shattered if a boy were not always at hand to regulate the pressure of the steam                                       we may turn however from this difference to another of mr carlyles doctrines which mark at once his independence of thought and his respect for experience where he declares the necessity for recognising the hereditary principle in government if there is to be any fixity in things in the same way we find him almost lamenting the fact that oxford once apparently so fastanchored as to be immovable has begun to twist and toss on the eddy of new ideas  it is impossible to glance at mr carlyles easter monday discourse without recalling the oration which his predecessor pronounced on resigning office last autumn    mr carlyle is as simple and practical as his predecessor was dazzling and rhetorical an ounce of mother wit quotes the new lord rector is worth a pound of clergy and while he admires demosthenes he prefers the eloquence of phocion a little later he repeats his old doctrine on the virtue of silence laments the fact that the finest nations in the worldthe english and the americanare going all away into wind and tongue and protests that a man is not to be esteemed wise because he has poured out speech copiously mr carlyle has so often inculcated these sentiments in his books that there can be no suspicion of an arriÃ¨re pensÃ©e in their utterance now but the contrast between him and his predecessor is at the least instructive each does however in some measure supply what is deficient in the other no one would claim for the chancellor of the exchequer the intensity of power of his successor but in his abundant energy his wide sympathy with popular movement and his real if vague and indiscriminating faith in the activity and progress of modern life he conveys lessons of trust in the present and hopefulness in the future which would be illexchanged for the patient and somewhat sad stoicism of mr carlyle  carlyle was still in scotland on april 21 and there the terrible and solemn news had to be conveyed to him of the sudden death of her who had been his true and faithful lifecompanion for forty years  mrs carlyle died on saturday april 21 under very peculiar circumstances she was taking her usual drive in hyde park about four oclock when her little favourite dogwhich was running by the side of the broughamwas run over by a carriage she was greatly alarmed though the dog was not seriously hurt she lifted the dog into the carriage and the man drove on not receiving any call or direction from his mistress as was usual he stopped the carriage and discovered her as he thought in a fit or ill and drove to st georges hospital which was near at hand when there it was discovered that she must have been dead some little time mrs carlyles health had been for several months feeble but not in a state to excite anxiety or alarm  on the following wednesday her remains were conveyed from london to haddington for interment there and the funeral took place on thursday afternoon mr carlyle was accompanied from london whither he had returned immediately on the receipt of that solemn message by his brother dr carlyle mr john forster and the hon mr twistleton the funeral cortÃ¨ge was followed on foot by a large number of gentlemen who had known mrs carlyle and her father dr welsh who was held in high estimation in the town where he had practised medicine till his death in 1819 the grave which is the same as that occupied by dr welshs remains lies in the centre of the ruined choir of the old cathedral at haddington in accordance with the scottish practice there was no service read and mr carlyle threw a handful of earth on the coffin after it had been lowered into the grave                                       carlyle wrote the following inscription to be placed on his wifes tombstone      here likewise now rests jane welsh carlyle spouse of thomas     carlyle chelsea london she was born at haddington 14th     july 1801 only child of the above john welsh and of grace     welsh caplegell dumfriesshire his wife in her bright     existence she had more sorrows than are common but also a     soft invincibility a clearness of discernment and a noble     loyalty of heart which are rare for forty years she was the     true and loving helpmate of her husband and by act and word     unweariedly forwarded him as none else could in all of worthy     that he did or attempted she died at london 21st april     1866 suddenly snatched away from him and the light of his     life as if gone out  later in the same year weighed down as he was by his great sorrow carlyle nevertheless thought it a public duty to come forward in defence of governor eyre when the quelling of the jamaica insurrection excited so much controversy and seemed to divide england into two parties he acted as vicepresident of the defence fund the following is a letter written to mr hamilton hume giving his views on the subject in full    ripple court ringwould dover    august 23 1866  sir  the clamour raised against governor eyre appears to me to be disgraceful to the good sense of england and if it rested on any depth of conviction and were not rather as i always flatter myself it is a thing of rumour and hearsay of repetition and reverberation mostly from the teeth outward i should consider it of evil omen to the country and to its highest interests in these times for my own share all the light that has yet reached me on mr eyre and his history in the world goes steadily to establish the conclusion that he is a just humane and valiant man faithful to his trusts everywhere and with no ordinary faculty of executing them that his late services in jamaica were of great perhaps of incalculable value as certainly they were of perilous and appalling difficultysomething like the case of fire suddenly reported in the ships powder room in midocean where the moments mean the ages and life and death hang on your use or misuse of the moments and in short that penalty and clamour are not the thing this governor merits from any of us but honour and thanks and wise imitation i will farther say should similar emergencies arise on the great scale or on the small in whatever we are governing  the english nation never loved anarchy nor was wont to spend its sympathy on miserable mad seditions especially of this inhuman and halfbrutish type but always loved order and the prompt suppression of seditions and reserved its tears for something worthier than promoters of such delirious and fatal enterprises who had got their wages for their sad industry has the english nation changed then altogether i flatter myself it is not not yet quite but only that certain loose superficial portions of it have become a great deal louder and not any wiser than they formerly used to be  at any rate though much averse at any time and at this time in particular to figure on committees or run into public noises without call i do at once and feel that as a british citizen i should and must make you welcome to my name for your committee and to whatever good it can do you with the hope only that many other british men of far more significance in such a matter will at once or gradually do the like and that in fine by wise effort and persistence a blind and disgraceful act of public injustice may be prevented and an egregrious folly as wellnot to say for none can say or compute what a vital detriment throughout the british empire in such an example set to all the colonies and governors the british empire has  farther service i fear i am not in a state to promise but the whole weight of my conviction and good wishes is with you and if other service possible to me do present itself i shall not want for willingness in case of need enclosed is my mite of contribution to   your fundi have the honour to be yours truly    t carlyle    to hamilton hume esq   hon sec eyre defence fund  in august 1867 carlyle broke silence again with an utterance in the style of the latterday pamphlets entitled shooting niagara and after published anonymously though everyone of course knew it to be his in macmillans magazine shortly afterwards it was reprinted as a separate pamphlet with additions and with the authors name on the titlepage  in february 1868 carlyle wrote some recollections of sir william hamilton as a contribution to professor veitchs memoir of that accomplished metaphysician  in november 1870 he addressed a long and very remarkable letter to the times on the frenchgerman war which is reprinted in the latest edition of his collected miscellanies  two years later november 1872 he added a very beautiful supplement to the peoples edition of his life of schiller founded on saupes schiller and his fathers household and other more recent books on schiller that had appeared in germany  his last literary productions were a series of papers on the early kings of norway and an essay on the portraits of john knox which appeared in instalments in frasers magazine in the first four months of 1875 on the 4th december of that year carlyle attained his eightieth year and this anniversary was signalised by some of the more distinguished of his friends and admirers by striking a medal the head being executed by mr boehm whose noble statue of carlyle exhibited in the royal academy in the previous year had won so much merited praise from mr ruskin and others the medal was accompanied by an address signed by the subscribers carlyle seems to have been much gratified with this honour which took him quite by surprise and he expressed his acknowledgments as follows  this of the medal and formal address of friends was an altogether unexpected event to be received as a conspicuous and peculiar honour without example hitherto anywhere in my life to you  i address my thankful acknowledgments which surely are deep and sincere and will beg you to convey the same to all the kind friends so beautifully concerned in it let no one of you be other than assured that the beautiful transaction in result management and intention was altogether gratifying welcome and honourable to me and that i cordially thank one and all of you for what you have been pleased to do your fine and noble gift shall remain among my precious possessions and be the symbol to me of something still more golden than itself on the part of my many dear and too generous friends so long as i continue in this world    yours and theirs from the heart    t carlyle  carlyles last public utterances were a letter on the eastern question addressed to mr george howard and printed in the times of november 28 1876 and a letter to the editor of the times on the crisis printed in that journal on may 5 1877  he was now beginning to feel the effects of his great age yearly and monthly he grew more feeble his wonted walking exercise had to be curtailed and at last abandoned he was affectionately and piously tended during these last years by his niece mary aitken now mrs alexander carlyle in the autumn of 1879 he lost his brother dr john aitken carlyle the translator of dantes inferno  the end came at last after a long and gradual decay of strength the great writer and noblehearted man passed away peacefully at about halfpast eight oclock on the morning of saturday february 5 1881 in the eightysixth year of his age  his remains were conveyed to scotland and were laid in the burialground at ecclefechan where the ashes of his father and mother and of others of his kindred repose he had executed what is known in scotch law as a deed of mortification by virtue of which he bequeathed to edinburgh university the estate of craigenputtochwhich had come to him through his wifefor the foundation of ten bursaries in the faculty of arts to be called the john welsh bursaries in his will he bequeathed the books which he had used in writing on cromwell and friedrich to harvard college massachusetts  in less than a month after his death with a haste on many accounts to be deplored and which has excited much animadversion his literary executor mr james anthony froude the historian issued two volumes of posthumous reminiscences written by carlyle partly in 1832 and partly in 186667 the first section consists of a memorial paper written immediately after his fathers death the second contains reminiscences of his early friend edward irving commenced at cheyne row in the autumn of 1866 and finished at mentone on the 2nd january 1867 the reminiscences of lord jeffrey were begun on the following day and finished on january 19 the paper on southey and wordsworth relegated to the appendix was also written at mentone between the 28th january and the 8th march 1867 the memorials of his wife which fill the greater part of the second volume were written at cheyne row during the month after her death  of the earlier portraits of carlyle three are specially interesting 1 the fulllength sketch by croquis daniel maclise which formed one of the fraser gallery portraits and was published in the magazine in june 1833 the original sketch of this is now deposited in the forster collection at south kensington 2 count dorsays sketch published by mitchell in 1839 is highly characteristic of the artist it was taken when no man of position was counted a dutiful subject who did not wear a black satin stock and a petersham coat the great authors own favourite among the early portraits was 3 the sketch by samuel laurence engraved in hornes new spirit of the age published in 1844 since the art of photography came into vogue a series of photographs of various degrees of merit and success have been executed by messrs elliott and fry and by watkins the late mrs cameron also produced a photograph of him in her peculiar style but it was not so successful as her fine portrait of tennyson an oilpainting by mr watts exhibited some fifteen years ago and now also forming part of the forster collection at south kensington is remarkable for its weird wildness but it gave great displeasure to the old philosopher himself more lately we have a remarkable portrait by mr whistler who seized the tout ensemble of his illustrious sitters character and costume in a very effective manner the terra cotta statue by mr boehm exhibited at the royal academy in 1875 has received such merited meed of enthusiastic praise from mr ruskin that it needs no added praise of ours it has been excellently photographed from two points of view by mr hedderly of riley street chelsea  one of the best and happiest of the many likenesses of mr carlyle that appeared during the last decade of his life was a sketch by mrs allinghama picture as well as a portraitrepresenting the venerable philosopher in a long and picturesque dressinggown seated on a chair and poring over a folio in the garden at the back of the quaint old house at chelsea which will henceforth as long as it stands be associated with his memory beside him on the grass lies a long clay pipe a churchwarden which he has been smoking in the sweet morning air so that altogether as far as pictorial graphic and photographic art can go the features form and bodily semblance of carlyle will be as well known to future generations as they are to our own                                       the impression of his brilliant and eloquent talk though it will perhaps remain for at least half a century to come more or less vivid to some of those of the new generation who were privileged to hear it will of course gradually fade away but it seems hardly probable that the rich legacy of his long roll of writingshistorical biographical criticalcan be regarded as other than a permanent one in which each succeeding generation will find fresh delight and instruction the series of vivid pictures he has left behind in his french revolution in his cromwell in his frederick can hardly become obsolete or cease to be attractive nor is such power of wordpainting likely soon to be equalled or ever to be surpassed the salt of humour that savours nearly all he wrote that lambent humour that lightens and plays over the grimmest and sternest of his pages will also serve to keep his writings fresh and readable many of his dicta and opinions will doubtless be more and more called in question especially in those of his works which are more directly of a didactic than a narrative character and in regard to subjects which he was by habit by mental constitution and by that prejudice from which the greatest can never wholly free themselves incapable of judging broadly or soundlysuch for instance as the scope and functions of painting and the fine arts generally the value of modern poetry or the working of constitutional and parliamentary institutions    richard

gentlemen  i have accepted the office you have elected me to and have now the duty to return thanks for the great honour done me your enthusiasm towards me i admit is very beautiful in itself however undesirable it may be in regard to the object of it it is a feeling honourable to all men and one well known to myself when i was in a position analogous to your own i can only hope that it may endure to the endthat noble desire to honour those whom you think worthy of honour and come to be more and more select and discriminate in the choice of the object of it for i can well understand that you will modify your opinions of me and many things else as you go on laughter and cheers there are now fiftysix years gone last november since i first entered your city a boy of not quite fourteenfiftysix years agoto attend classes here and gain knowledge of all kinds i know not what with feelings of wonder and awestruck expectation and now after a long long course this is what we have come to cheers there is something touching and tragic and yet at the same time beautiful to see the third generation as it were of my dear old native land rising up and saying well you are not altogether an unworthy labourer in the vineyard you have toiled through a great variety of fortunes and have had many judges as the old proverb says he that builds by the wayside has many masters we must expect a variety of judges but the voice of young scotland through you is really of some value to me and i return you many thanks for it though i cannot describe my emotions to you and perhaps they will be much more conceivable if expressed in silence cheers  when this office was proposed to me some of you know that i was not very ambitious to accept it at first i was taught to believe that there were more or less certain important duties which would lie in my power this i confess was my chief motive in going into itat least in reconciling the objections felt to such things for if i can do anything to honour you and my dear old alma mater why should i not do so loud cheers well but on practically looking into the matter when the office actually came into my hands i find it grows more and more uncertain and abstruse to me whether there is much real duty that i can do at all i live four hundred miles away from you in an entirely different state of things and my weak healthnow for many years accumulating upon meand a total unacquaintance with such subjects as concern your affairs hereall this fills me with apprehension that there is really nothing worth the least consideration that i can do on that score you may however depend upon it that if any such duty does arise in any form i will use my most faithful endeavour to do whatever is right and proper according to the best of my judgment cheers  in the meanwhile the duty i have at presentwhich might be very pleasant but which is quite the reverse as you may fancyis to address some words to you on some subjects more or less cognate to the pursuits you are engaged in in fact i had meant to throw out some loose observationsloose in point of order i meanin such a way as they may occur to methe truths i have in me about the business you are engaged in the race you have started on what kind of race it is you young gentlemen have begun and what sort of arena you are likely to find in this world i ought i believe according to custom to have written all that down on paper and had it read out that would have been much handier for me at the present moment a laugh but when i attempted to write i found that i was not accustomed to write speeches and that i did not get on very well so i flung that away and resolved to trust to the inspiration of the momentjust to what came uppermost you will therefore have to accept what is readiest what comes direct from the heart and you must just take that in compensation for any good order of arrangement there might have been in it  i will endeavour to say nothing that is not true as far as i can manage and that is pretty much all that i can engage for a laugh advices i believe to young menand to all menare very seldom much valued there is a great deal of advising and very little faithful performing and talk that does not end in any kind of action is better suppressed altogether i would not therefore go much into advising but there is one advice i must give you it is in fact the summary of all advices and you have heard it a thousand times i dare say but i must nevertheless let you hear it the thousand and first time for it is most intensely true whether you will believe it at present or notnamely that above all things the interest of your own life depends upon being diligent now while it is called today in this place where you have come to get education diligent that includes all virtues in it that a student can have i mean to include in it all qualities that lead into the acquirement of real instruction and improvement in such a place if you will believe me you who are young yours is the golden season of life as you have heard it called so it verily is the seedtime of life in which if you do not sow or if you sow tares instead of wheat you cannot expect to reap well afterwards and you will arrive at indeed little while in the course of years when you come to look back and if you have not done what you have heard from your advisersand among many counsellers there is wisdomyou will bitterly repent when it is too late the habits of study acquired at universities are of the highest importance in afterlife at the season when you are in young years the whole mind is as it were fluid and is capable of forming itself into any shape that the owner of the mind pleases to order it to form itself into the mind is in a fluid state but it hardens up gradually to the consistency of rock or iron and you cannot alter the habits of an old man but as he has begun he will proceed and go on to the last by diligence i mean among other thingsand very chieflyhonesty in all your inquiries into what you are about pursue your studies in the way your conscience calls honest more and more endeavour to do that keep i mean to say an accurate separation of what you have really come to know in your own minds and what is still unknown leave all that on the hypothetical side of the barrier as things afterwards to be acquired if acquired at all and be careful not to stamp a thing as known when you do not yet know it count a thing known only when it is stamped on your mind so that you may survey it on all sides with intelligence  there is such a thing as a man endeavouring to persuade himself and endeavouring to persuade others that he knows about things when he does not know more than the outside skin of them and he goes flourishing about with them hear hear and a laugh there is also a process called cramming in some universities a laughthat is getting up such points of things as the examiner is likely to put questions about avoid all that as entirely unworthy of an honourable habit be modest and humble and diligent in your attention to what your teachers tell you who are profoundly interested in trying to bring you forward in the right way so far as they have been able to understand it try all things they set before you in order if possible to understand them and to value them in proportion to your fitness for them gradually see what kind of work you can do for it is the first of all problems for a man to find out what kind of work he is to do in this universe in fact morality as regards study is as in all other things the primary consideration and overrides all others a dishonest man cannot do anything real and it would be greatly better if he were tied up from doing any such thing he does nothing but darken counsel by the words he utters that is a very old doctrine but a very true one and you will find it confirmed by all the thinking men that have ever lived in this long series of generations of which we are the latest  i daresay you know very many of you that it is now seven hundred years since universities were first set up in this world of ours abelard and other people had risen up with doctrines in them the people wished to hear of and students flocked towards them from all parts of the world there was no getting the thing recorded in books as you may now you had to hear him speaking to you vocally or else you could not learn at all what it was that he wanted to say and so they gathered together the various people who had anything to teach and formed themselves gradually under the patronage of kings and other potentates who were anxious about the culture of their populations nobly anxious for their benefit and became a university  i daresay perhaps you have heard it said that all that is greatly altered by the invention of printing which took place about midway between us and the origin of universities a man has not now to go away to where a professor is actually speaking because in most cases he can get his doctrine out of him through a book and can read it and read it again and again and study it i dont know that i know of any way in which the whole facts of a subject may be more completely taken in if our studies are moulded in conformity with it nevertheless universities have and will continue to have an indispensable value in societya very high value i consider the very highest interests of man vitally intrusted to them  in regard to theology as you are aware it has been the study of the deepest heads that have come into the worldwhat is the nature of this stupendous universe and what its relations to all things as known to man and as only known to the awful author of it in fact the members of the church keep theology in a lively condition laughter for the benefit of the whole population which is the great object of our universities i consider it is the same now intrinsically though very much forgotten from many causes and not so successful as might be wished at all a laugh it remains however a very curious truth what has been said by observant people that the main use of the universities in the present age is that after you have done with all your classes the next thing is a collection of books a great library of good books which you proceed to study and to read what the universities have mainly donewhat i have found the university did for me was that it taught me to read in various languages and various sciences so that i could go into the books that treated of these things and try anything i wanted to make myself master of gradually as i found it suit me whatever you may think of all that the clearest and most imperative duty lies on every one of you to be assiduous in your reading and learn to be good readers which is perhaps a more difficult thing than you imagine learn to be discriminative in your readingto read all kinds of things that you have an interest in and that you find to be really fit for what you are engaged in of course at the present time in a great deal of the reading incumbent on you you must be guided by the books recommended to you by your professors for assistance towards the prelections and then when you get out of the university and go into studies of your own you will find it very important that you have selected a field a province in which you can study and work  the most unhappy of all men is the man that cannot tell what he is going to do that has got no work cut out for him in the world and does not go into it for work is the grand cure of all the maladies and miseries that ever beset mankindhonest work which you intend getting done if you are in a strait a very good indication as to choiceperhaps the best you could getis a book you have a great curiosity about you are then in the readiest and best of all possible conditions to improve by that book it is analogous to what doctors tell us about the physical health and appetites of the patient you must learn to distinguish between false appetite and real there is such a thing as a false appetite which will lead a man into vagaries with regard to diet will tempt him to eat spicy things which he should not eat at all and would not but that it is toothsome and for the moment in baseness of mind a man ought to inquire and find out what he really and truly has an appetite forwhat suits his constitution and that doctors tell him is the very thing he ought to have in general and so with books as applicable to almost all of you i will say that it is highly expedient to go into historyto inquire into what has passed before you in the families of men the history of the romans and greeks will first of all concern you and you will find that all the knowledge you have got will be extremely applicable to elucidate that there you have the most remarkable race of men in the world set before you to say nothing of the languages which your professors can better explain and which i believe are admitted to be the most perfect orders of speech we have yet found to exist among men and you will find if you read well a pair of extremely remarkable nations shining in the records left by themselves as a kind of pillar to light up life in the darkness of the past ages and it will be well worth your while if you can get into the understanding of what these people were and what they did you will find a great deal of hearsay as i have found that does not touch on the matter but perhaps some of you will get to see a roman face to face you will know in some measure how they contrived to exist and to perform these feats in the world i believe also you will find a thing not much noted that there was a very great deal of deep religion in its form in both nations that is noted by the wisest of historians and particularly by ferguson who is particularly well worth reading on roman history and i believe he was an alumnus in our own university his book is a very creditable book he points out the profoundly religious nature of the roman people notwithstanding the wildness and ferociousness of their nature they believed that jupiter optimusjupiter maximuswas lord of the universe and that he had appointed the romans to become the chief of men provided they followed his commandsto brave all difficulty and to stand up with an invincible frontto be ready to do and die and also to have the same sacred regard to veracity to promise to integrity and all the virtues that surround that noblest quality of mencourageto which the romans gave the name of virtue manhood as the one thing ennobling for a man  in the literary ages of rome that had very much decayed away but still it had retained its place among the lower classes of the roman people of the deeply religious nature of the greeks along with their beautiful and sunny effulgences of art you have a striking proof if you look for it  in the tragedies of sophocles there is a most distinct recognition of the eternal justice of heaven and the unfailing punishment of crime against the laws of god  i believe you will find in all histories that that has been at the head and foundation of them all and that no nation that did not contemplate this wonderful universe with an awestricken and reverential feeling that there was a great unknown omnipotent and allwise and allvirtuous being superintending all men in it and all interests in itno nation ever came to very much nor did any man either who forgot that if a man did forget that he forgot the most important part of his mission in this world  in our own history of england which you will take a great deal of natural pains to make yourselves acquainted with you will find it beyond all others worthy of your study because i believe that the british nationand i include in them the scottish nationproduced a finer set of men than any you will find it possible to get anywhere else in the world applause i dont know in any history of greece or rome where you will get so fine a man as oliver cromwell applause and we have had men worthy of memory in our little corner of the island here as well as others and our history has been strong at least in being connected with the world itselffor if you examine well you will find that john knox was the author as it were of oliver cromwell that the puritan revolution would never have taken place in england at all if it had not been for that scotchman applause this is an arithmetical fact and is not prompted by national vanity on my part at all laughter and applause and it is very possible if you look at the struggle that was going on in england as i have had to do in my time you will see that people were overawed with the immense impediments lying in the way  a small minority of godfearing men in the country were flying away with any ship they could get to new england rather than take the lion by the beard they durstnt confront the powers with their most just complaint to be delivered from idolatry they wanted to make the nation altogether conformable to the hebrew bible which they understood to be according to the will of god and there could be no aim more legitimate however they could not have got their desire fulfilled at all if knox had not succeeded by the firmness and nobleness of his mind for he is also of the select of the earth to mejohn knox applause what he has suffered from the ungrateful generations that have followed him should really make us humble ourselves to the dust to think that the most excellent man our country has produced to whom we owe everything that distinguishes us among modern nations should have been sneered at and abused by people knox was heard by scotlandthe people heard him with the marrow of their bonesthey took up his doctrine and they defied principalities and powers to move them from it we must have it they said  it was at that time the puritan struggle arose in england and you know well that the scottish earls and nobility with their tenantry marched away to dunsehill and sat down there and just in the course of that struggle when it was either to be suppressed or brought into greater vitality they encamped on the top of dunsehill thirty thousand armed men drilled for that occasion each regiment around its landlord its earl or whatever he might be called and eager for christs crown and covenant that was the signal for all england rising up into unappeasable determination to have the gospel there also and you know it went on and came to be a contest whether the parliament or the king should rulewhether it should be old formalities and use and wont or something that had been of new conceived in the souls of mennamely a divine determination to walk according to the laws of god here as the sum of all prosperitywhich of these should have the mastery and after a long long agony of struggle it was decidedthe way we know i should say also of that protectorate of oliver cromwellsnotwithstanding the abuse it has encountered and the denial of everybody that it was able to get on in the world and so onit appears to me to have been the most salutary thing in the modern history of england on the whole if oliver cromwell had continued it out i dont know what it would have come to it would have got corrupted perhaps in other hands and could not have gone on but it was pure and true to the last fibre in his mindthere was truth in it when he ruled over it  machiavelli has remarked in speaking about the romans that democracy cannot exist anywhere in the world as a government it is an impossibility that it should be continued and he goes on proving that in his own way i do not ask you all to follow him in his conviction hear but it is to him a clear truth that it is a solecism and impossibility that the universal mass of men should govern themselves he says of the romans that they continued a long time but it was purely in virtue of this item in their constitutionnamely that they had all the conviction in their minds that it was solemnly necessary at times to appoint a dictatora man who had the power of life and death over everythingwho degraded men out of their places ordered them to execution and did whatever seemed to him good in the name of god above him he was commanded to take care that the republic suffered no detriment and machiavelli calculates that that was the thing that purified the social system from time to time and enabled it to hang on as it didan extremely likely thing if it was composed of nothing but bad and tumultuous men triumphing in general over the better and all going the bad road in fact well oliver cromwells protectorate or dictatorate if you will lasted for about ten years and you will find that nothing that was contrary to the laws of heaven was allowed to live by oliver a laugh and applause for example it was found by his parliament called barebonesthe most zealous of all parliaments probablythe court of chancery in england was in a state that was really capable of no apologyno man could get up and say that that was a right court there were i think fifteen thousand or fifteen hundredlaughteri dont really remember which but we shall call it by the last renewed laughterthere were fifteen hundred cases lying in it undecided and one of them i remember for a large amount of money was eightythree years old and it was going on still wigs were waving over it and lawyers were taking their fees and there was no end of it upon which the barebones people after deliberation about it thought it was expedient and commanded by the author of man and the fountain of justice and for the true and right to abolish the court really i dont know who could have dissented from that opinion at the same time it was thought by those who were wiser and had more experience of the world that it was a very dangerous thing and would never suit at all the lawyers began to make an immense noise about it laughter all the public the great mass of solid and welldisposed people who had got no deep insight into such matters were very adverse to it and the president of it old sir francis rous who translated the psalmsthose that we sing every sunday in the church yeta very good man and a wise manthe provost of etonhe got the minority or i dont know whether or no he did not persuade the majorityhe at any rate got a great number of the parliament to go to oliver the dictator and lay down their functions altogether and declare officially with their signature on monday morning that the parliament was dissolved  the thing was passed on saturday night and on monday morning rous came and said we cannot carry on the affair any longer and we remit it into the hands of your highness oliver in that way became protector a second time  i give you this as an instance that oliver felt that the parliament that had been dismissed had been perfectly right with regard to chancery and that there was no doubt of the propriety of abolishing chancery or reforming it in some kind of way he considered it and this is what he did he assembled sixty of the wisest lawyers to be found in england happily there were men great in the lawmen who valued the laws as much as anybody does now i suppose a laugh oliver said to them go and examine this thing and in the name of god inform me what is necessary to be done with regard to it you will see how we may clean out the foul things in it that render it poison to everybody well they sat down then and in the course of six weeksthere was no public speaking then no reporting of speeches and no trouble of any kind there was just the business in handthey got sixty propositions fixed in their minds of the things that required to be done and upon these sixty propositions chancery was reconstituted and remodelled and so it has lasted to our time it had become a nuisance and could not have continued much longer  that is an instance of the manner in which things were done when a dictatorship prevailed in the country and that was what the dictator did upon the whole i do not think that in general out of common history books you will ever get into the real history of this country or anything particular which it would beseem you to know you may read very ingenious and very clever books by men whom it would be the height of insolence in me to do any other thing than express my respect for but their position is essentially sceptical man is unhappily in that condition that he will make only a temporary explanation of anything and you will not be able if you are like the man to understand how this island came to be what it is you will not find it recorded in books you will find recorded in books a jumble of tumults disastrous ineptitudes and all that kind of thing but to get what you want you will have to look into side sources and inquire in all directions  i remember getting collins peerage to reada very poor peerage as a work of genius but an excellent book for diligence and fidelityi was writing on oliver cromwell at the time applause i could get no biographical dictionary and i thought the peerage book would help me at least tell me whether people were old or young and about all persons concerned in the actions about which i wrote i got a great deal of help out of poor collins he was a diligent and dark london bookseller of about a hundred years ago who compiled out of all kinds of treasury chests archives books that were authentic and out of all kinds of things out of which he could get the information he wanted he was a very meritorious man i not only found the solution of anything i wanted there but i began gradually to perceive this immense fact which i really advise every one of you who read history to look out for and read forif he has not found itit was that the kings of england all the way from the norman conquest down to the times of charles i had appointed so far as they knew those who deserved to be appointed peers they were all royal men with minds full of justice and valour and humanity and all kinds of qualities that are good for men to have who ought to rule over others then their genealogy was remarkableand there is a great deal more in genealogies than is generally believed at present  i never heard tell of any clever man that came out of entirely stupid people if you look around the families of your acquaintance you will see such cases in all directions i know that it has been the case in mine i can trace the father and the son and the grandson and the family stamp is quite distinctly legible upon each of them so that it goes for a great dealthe hereditary principle in government as in other things and it must be recognised so soon as there is any fixity in things  you will remark that if at any time the genealogy of a peerage failsif the man that actually holds the peerage is a fool in these earnest striking times the man gets into mischief and gets into treasonhe gets himself extinguished altogether in fact laughter  from these documents of old collins it seems that a peer conducts himself in a solemn good pious manly kind of way when he takes leave of life and when he has hospitable habits and is valiant in his procedure throughout and that in general a king with a noble approximation to what was right had nominated this man saying come you to me sir come out of the common level of the people where you are liable to be trampled upon come here and take a district of country and make it into your own image more or less be a king under me and understand that that is your function i say this is the most divine thing that a human being can do to other human beings and no kind of being whatever has so much of the character of god almightys divine government as that thing we see that went all over england and that is the grand soul of englands history  it is historically true that down to the time of charles i it was not understood that any man was made a peer without having a merit in him to constitute him a proper subject for a peerage in charles is time it grew to be known or said that if a man was by birth a gentleman and was worth Â£10000 ayear and bestowed his gifts up and down among courtiers he could be made a peer under charles ii it went on with still more rapidity and has been going on with ever increasing velocity until we see the perfect breakneck pace at which they are now going a laugh and now a peerage is a paltry kind of thing to what it was in these old times i could go into a great many more details about things of that sort but i must turn to another branch of the subject  one remark more about your reading i do not know whether it has been sufficiently brought home to you that there are two kinds of books when a man is reading on any kind of subject in most departments of booksin all books if you take it in a wide senseyou will find that there is a division of good books and bad booksthere is a good kind of a book and a bad kind of a book i am not to assume that you are all ill acquainted with this but i may remind you that it is a very important consideration at present it casts aside altogether the idea that people have that if they are reading any bookthat if an ignorant man is reading any book he is doing rather better than nothing at all i entirely call that in question i even venture to deny it laughter and cheers it would be much safer and better would he have no concern with books at all than with some of them you know these are my views there are a number an increasing number of books that are decidedly to him not useful hear but he will learn also that a certain number of books were written by a supreme noble kind of peoplenot a very great numberbut a great number adhere more or less to that side of things in short as i have written it down somewhere else i conceive that books are like mens soulsdivided into sheep and goats laughter and applause some of them are calculated to be of very great advantage in teachingin forwarding the teaching of all generations others are going down down doing more and more wilder and wilder mischief  and for the rest in regard to all your studies here and whatever you may learn you are to remember that the object is not particular knowledgethat you are going to get higher in technical perfections and all that sort of thing there is a higher aim lies at the rear of all that especially among those who are intended for literary for speaking pursuitsthe sacred profession you are ever to bear in mind that there lies behind that the acquisition of what may be called wisdomnamely sound appreciation and just decision as to all the objects that come round about you and the habit of behaving with justice and wisdom in short great is wisdomgreat is the value of wisdom it cannot be exaggerated the highest achievement of manblessed is he that getteth understanding and that i believe occasionally may be missed very easily but never more easily than now i think if that is a failure all is a failure however i will not touch further upon that matter  in this university i learn from many sides that there is a great and considerable stir about endowments oh i should have said in regard to book reading if it be so very important how very useful would an excellent library be in every university i hope that will not be neglected by those gentlemen who have charge of youand indeed i am happy to hear that your library is very much improved since the time i knew it and i hope it will go on improving more and more you require money to do that and you require also judgment in the selectors of the bookspious insight into what is really for the advantage of human souls and the exclusion of all kinds of claptrap books which merely excite the astonishment of foolish people laughter wise booksas much as possible good books  as i was saying there appears to be a great demand for endowmentsan assiduous and praiseworthy industry for getting new funds collected for encouraging the ingenious youth of universities especially in this the chief university of the country hear hear well i entirely participate in everybodys approval of the movement it is very desirable it should be responded to and one expects most assuredly will at least if it is not it will be shameful to the country of scotland which never was so rich in money as at the present moment and never stood so much in need of getting noble universities to counteract many influences that are springing up alongside of money it should not be backward in coming forward in the way of endowments a laughat least in rivalry to our rude old barbarous ancestors as we have been pleased to call them such munificence as theirs is beyond all praise to whom i am sorry to say we are not yet by any manner of means equal or approaching equality laughter there is an overabundance of money and sometimes i cannot help thinking that probably never has there been at any other time in scotland the hundredth part of the money that now is or even the thousandth part for wherever i go there is that goldnuggeting a laughthat prosperity  many men are counting their balances by millions money was never so abundant and nothing that is good to be done with it hear hear and a laugh no man knowsor very few men knowwhat benefit to get out of his money in fact it too often is secretly a curse to him much better for him never to have had any but i do not expect that generally to be believed laughter nevertheless i should think it a beautiful relief to any man that has an honest purpose struggling in him to bequeath a handsome house of refuge so to speak for some meritorious man who may hereafter be born into the world to enable him a little to get on his way to do in fact as those old norman kings whom i have described to youto raise a man out of the dirt and mud where he is getting trampled unworthily on his part into some kind of position where he may acquire the power to do some good in his generation i hope that as much as possible will be done in that way that efforts will not be relaxed till the thing is in a satisfactory state at the same time in regard to the classical department of things it is to be desired that it were properly supportedthat we could allow people to go and devote more leisure possibly to the cultivation of particular departments  we might have more of this from scotch universities than we have i am bound however to say that it does not appear as if of late times endowment was the real soul of the matter the english for example are the richest people for endowments on the face of the earth in their universities and it is a remarkable fact that since the time of bentley you cannot name anybody that has gained a great name in scholarship among them or constituted a point of revolution in the pursuits of men in that way the man that did that is a man worthy of being remembered among men although he may be a poor man and not endowed with worldly wealth one man that actually did constitute a revolution was the son of a poor weaver in saxony who edited his tibullus in dresden in the room of a poor comrade and who while he was editing his tibullus had to gather his peasecod shells on the streets and boil them for his dinner that was his endowment but he was recognised soon to have done a great thing his name was heyne  i can remember it was quite a revolution in my mind when i got hold of that mans book on virgil i found that for the first time i had understood himthat he had introduced me for the first time into an insight of roman life and pointed out the circumstances in which these were written and here was interpretation and it has gone on in all manner of development and has spread out into other countries  upon the whole there is one reason why endowments are not given now as they were in old days when they founded abbeys colleges and all kinds of things of that description with such success as we know all that has changed now why that has decayed away may in part be that people have become doubtful that colleges are now the real sources of that which i call wisdom whether they are anything moreanything much morethan a cultivating of man in the specific arts in fact there has been a suspicion of that kind in the world for a long time a laugh that is an old saying an old proverb an ounce of mother wit is worth a pound of clergy laughter there is a suspicion that a man is perhaps not nearly so wise as he looks or because he has poured out speech so copiously laughter  when the seven free arts on which the old universities were based came to be modified a little in order to be convenient for or to promote the wants of modern societythough perhaps some of them are obsolete enough even yet for some of usthere arose a feeling that mere vocality mere culture of speech if that is what comes out of a man though he may be a great speaker an eloquent orator yet there is no real substance thereif that is what was required and aimed at by the man himself and by the community that set him upon becoming a learned man maidservants i hear people complaining are getting instructed in the ologies and so on and are apparently totally ignorant of brewing boiling and baking laughter above all things not taught what is necessary to be known from the highest to the loweststrict obedience humility and correct moral conduct oh it is a dismal chapter all that if one went into it  what has been done by rushing after fine speech i have written down some very fierce things about that perhaps considerably more emphatic than i would wish them to be now but they are deeply my conviction hear hear there is very great necessity indeed of getting a little more silent than we are it seems to me the finest nations of the worldthe english and the americanare going all away into wind and tongue applause and laughter but it will appear sufficiently tragical byandbye long after i am away out of it silence is the eternal duty of a man he wont get to any real understanding of what is complex and what is more than any other pertinent to his interests without maintaining silence watch the tongue is a very old precept and a most true one i do not want to discourage any of you from your demosthenes and your studies of the niceties of language and all that believe me i value that as much as any of you i consider it a very graceful thing and a proper thing for every human creature to know what the implement which he uses in communicating his thoughts is and how to make the very utmost of it i want you to study demosthenes and know all his excellencies at the same time i must say that speech does not seem to me on the whole to have turned to any good account  why tell me that a man is a fine speaker if it is not the truth that he is speaking phocion who did not speak at all was a great deal nearer hitting the mark than demosthenes laughter he used to tell the atheniansyou cant fight philip you have not the slightest chance with him he is a man who holds his tongue he has great disciplined armies he can brag anybody you like in your cities here and he is going on steadily with an unvarying aim towards his object and he will infallibly beat any kind of men such as you going on raging from shore to shore with all that rampant nonsense demosthenes said to him one daythe athenians will get mad some day and kill you yes phocion says when they are mad and you as soon as they get sane again laughter  it is also told about him going to messina on some deputation that the athenians wanted on some kind of matter of an intricate and contentious nature that phocion went with some story in his mouth to speak about he was a man of few wordsno unveracity and after he had gone on telling the story a certain time there was one burst of interruption one man interrupted with something he tried to answer and then another and finally the people began bragging and bawling and no end of debate till it ended in the want of power in the people to say any more phocion drew back altogether struck dumb and would not speak another word to any man and he left it to them to decide in any way they liked  it appears to me there is a kind of eloquence in that which is equal to anything demosthenes ever saidtake your own way and let me out altogether applause  all these considerations and manifold more connected with theminnumerable considerations resulting from observation of the world at this momenthave led many people to doubt of the salutary effect of vocal education altogether i do not mean to say it should be entirely excluded but i look to something that will take hold of the matter much more closely and not allow it slip out of our fingers and remain worse than it was for if a good speakeran eloquent speakeris not speaking the truth is there a more horrid kind of object in creation loud cheers of such speech i hear all manner and kind of people say it is excellent but i care very little about how he said it provided i understand it and it be true excellent speaker but what if he is telling me things that are untrue that are not the fact about itif he has formed a wrong judgment about itif he has no judgment in his mind to form a right conclusion in regard to the matter an excellent speaker of that kind is as it were sayingho every one that wants to be persuaded of the thing that is not true come hither great laughter and applause i would recommend you to be very chary of that kind of excellent speech renewed laughter  well all that being the too wellknown product of our method of vocal educationthe mouth merely operating on the tongue of the pupil and teaching him to wag it in a particular way laughterit had made a great many thinking men entertain a very great distrust of this not very salutary way of procedure and they have longed for some kind of practical way of working out the business there would be room for a great deal of description about it if i went into it but i must content myself with saying that the most remarkable piece of reading that you may be recommended to take and try if you can study is a book by goetheone of his last books which he wrote when he was an old man about seventy years of agei think one of the most beautiful he ever wrote full of mild wisdom and which is found to be very touching by those who have eyes to discern and hearts to feel it it is one of the pieces in wilhelm meisters travels i read it through many years ago and of course i had to read into it very hard when i was translating it applause and it has always dwelt in my mind as about the most remarkable bit of writing that i have known to be executed in these late centuries i have often said there are ten pages of that which if ambition had been my only rule i would rather have written than have written all the books that have appeared since i came into the world cheers deep deep is the meaning of what is said there they turn on the christian religion and the religious phenomena of christian lifealtogether sketched out in the most airy graceful delicatelywise kind of way so as to keep himself out of the common controversies of the street and of the forum yet to indicate what was the result of things he had been long meditating upon among others he introduces in an aÃ«rial flighty kind of way here and there a touch which grows into a beautiful picturea scheme of entirely mute education at least with no more speech than is absolutely necessary for what they have to do  three of the wisest men that can be got are met to consider what is the function which transcends all others in importance to build up the young generation which shall be free from all that perilous stuff that has been weighing us down and clogging every step and which is the only thing we can hope to go on with if we would leave the world a little better and not the worse of our having been in it for those who are to follow the man who is the eldest of the three says to goethe you give by nature to the wellformed children you bring into the world a great many precious gifts and very frequently these are best of all developed by nature herself with a very slight assistance where assistance is seen to be wise and profitable and forbearance very often on the part of the overlooker of the process of education but there is one thing that no child brings into the world with it and without which all other things are of no use wilhelm who is there beside him says what is that all who enter the world want it says the eldest perhaps you yourself wilhelm says well tell me what it is it is says the eldest reverenceehrfurchtreverence honour done to those who are grander and better than you without fear distinct from fear ehrfurchtthe soul of all religion that ever has been among men or ever will be and he goes into practicality he practically distinguishes the kinds of religion that are in the world and he makes out three reverences the boys are all trained to go through certain gesticulations to lay their hands on their breast and look up to heaven and they give their three reverences the first and simplest is that of reverence for what is above us it is the soul of all the pagan religions there is nothing better in man than that then there is reverence for what is around us or about usreverence for our equals and to which he attributes an immense power in the culture of man the third is reverence for what is beneath usto learn to recognise in pain sorrow and contradiction even in those things odious as they are to flesh and bloodto learn that there lies in these a priceless blessing and he defines that as being the soul of the christian religionthe highest of all religions a height as goethe saysand that is very true even to the letter as i considera height to which the human species was fated and enabled to attain and from which having once attained it it can never retrograde it cannot descend down below that permanently goethes idea is  often one thinks it was good to have a faith of that kindthat always even in the most degraded sunken and unbelieving times he calculates there will be found some few souls who will recognise what that meant and that the world having once received it there is no fear of its retrograding he goes on then to tell us the way in which they seek to teach boys in the sciences particularly whatever the boy is fit for wilhelm left his own boy there expecting they would make him a master of arts or something of that kind and when he came back for him he saw a thundering cloud of dust coming over the plain of which he could make nothing it turned out to be a tempest of wild horses managed by young lads who had a turn for hunting with their grooms his own son was among them and he found that the breaking of colts was the thing he was most suited for laughter this is what goethe calls art which i should not make clear to you by any definition unless it is clear already a laugh i would not attempt to define it as music painting and poetry and so on it is in quite a higher sense than the common one and in which i am afraid most of our painters poets and music men would not pass muster a laugh he considers that the highest pitch to which human culture can go and he watches with great industry how it is to be brought about with men who have a turn for it  very wise and beautiful it is it gives one an idea that something greatly better is possible for man in the world i confess it seems to me it is a shadow of what will come unless the world is to come to a conclusion that is perfectly frightful some kind of scheme of education like that presided over by the wisest and most sacred men that can be got in the world and watching from a distancea training in practicality at every turn no speech in it except that speech that is to be followed by action for that ought to be the rule as nearly as possible among them for rarely should men speak at all unless it is to say that thing that is to be done and let him go and do his part in it and to say no more about it i should say there is nothing in the world you can conceive so difficult prima facie as that of getting a set of men gathered togetherrough rude and ignorant peoplegather them together promise them a shilling a day rank them up give them very severe and sharp drill and by bullying and drillfor the word drill seems as if it meant the treatment that would force them to learnthey learn what it is necessary to learn and there is the man a piece of an animated machine a wonder of wonders to look at he will go and obey one man and walk into the cannons mouth for him and do anything whatever that is commanded of him by his general officer and i believe all manner of things in this way could be done if there were anything like the same attention bestowed very many things could be regimented and organized into the mute system of education that goethe evidently adumbrates there but i believe when people look into it it will be found that they will not be very long in trying to make some efforts in that direction for the saving of human labour and the avoidance of human misery would be uncountable if it were set about and begun even in part  alas it is painful to think how very far away it isany fulfilment of such things for i need not hide from you young gentlemenand that is one of the last things i am going to tell youthat you have got into a very troublous epoch of the world and i dont think you will find it improve the footing you have though you have many advantages which we had not you have careers open to you by public examinations and so on which is a thing much to be approved and which we hope to see perfected more and more all that was entirely unknown in my time and you have many things to recognise as advantages but you will find the ways of the world more anarchical than ever i think as far as i have noticed revolution has come upon us we have got into the age of revolutions all kinds of things are coming to be subjected to fire as it were hotter and hotter the wind rises around everything  curious to say now in oxford and other places that used to seem to live at anchor in the stream of time regardless of all changes they are getting into the highest humour of mutation and all sorts of new ideas are getting afloat it is evident that whatever is not made of asbestos will have to be burnt in this world it will not stand the heat it is getting exposed to and in saying that it is but saying in other words that we are in an epoch of anarchyanarchy plus the constable laughter there is nobody that picks ones pocket without some policeman being ready to take him up renewed laughter but in every other thing he is the son not of kosmos but of chaos he is a disobedient and reckless and altogether a waste kind of objectcommonplace man in these epochs and the wiser kind of manthe select of whom i hope you will be parthas more and more a set time to it to look forward and will require to move with double wisdom and will find in short that the crooked things that he has to pull straight in his own life or round about wherever he may be are manifold and will task all his strength wherever he may go  but why should i complain of that eitherfor that is a thing a man is born to in all epochs he is born to expend every particle of strength that god almighty has given him in doing the work he finds he is fit forto stand it out to the last breath of life and do his best we are called upon to do that and the reward we all getwhich we are perfectly sure of if we have merited itis that we have got the work done or at least that we have tried to do the work for that is a great blessing in itself and i should say there is not very much more reward than that going in this world if the man gets meat and clothes what matters it whether he have Â£10000 or Â£10000000 or Â£70 ayear he can get meat and clothes for that and he will find very little difference intrinsically if he is a wise man  i warmly second the advice of the wisest of mendont be ambitious dont be at all too desirous to success be loyal and modest cut down the proud towering thoughts that you get into you or see they be pure as well as high there is a nobler ambition than the gaining of all california would be or the getting of all the suffrages that are on the planet just now loud and prolonged cheers  finally gentlemen i have one advice to give you which is practically of very great importance though a very humble one  i have no doubt you will have among you people ardently bent to consider life cheap for the purpose of getting forward in what they are aiming at of high and you are to consider throughout much more than is done at present that health is a thing to be attended to continuallythat you are to regard that as the very highest of all temporal things for you applause there is no kind of achievement you could make in the world that is equal to perfect health what are nuggets and millions the french financier said alas why is there no sleep to be sold sleep was not in the market at any quotation laughter and applause  it is a curious thing that i remarked long ago and have often turned in my head that the old word for holy in the german languageheiligalso means healthy and so heilbronn means holywell or healthywell we have in the scotch hale and i suppose our english word wholewith a wall of one piece without any hole in itis the same word i find that you could not get any better definition of what holy really is than healthycompletely healthy mens sana in corpore sano applause  a man with his intellect a clear plain geometric mirror brilliantly sensitive of all objects and impressions around it and imagining all things in their correct proportionsnot twisted up into convex or concave and distorting everything so that he cannot see the truth of the matter without endless groping and manipulationhealthy clear and free and all round about him we never can attain that at all in fact the operations we have got into are destructive of it you cannot if you are going to do any decisive intellectual operationif you are going to write a bookat least i never couldwithout getting decidedly made ill by it and really you must if it is your businessand you must follow out what you are atand it sometimes is at the expense of health only remember at all times to get back as fast as possible out of it into health and regard the real equilibrium as the centre of things you should always look at the heilig which means holy and holy means healthy  well that old etymologywhat a lesson it is against certain gloomy austere ascetic people that have gone about as if this world were all a dismalprison house it has indeed got all the ugly things in it that i have been alluding to but there is an eternal sky over it and the blessed sunshine verdure of spring and rich autumn and all that in it too piety does not mean that a man should make a sour face about things and refuse to enjoy in moderation what his maker has given neither do you find it to have been so with old knox if you look into him you will find a beautiful scotch humour in him as well as the grimmest and sternest truth when necessary and a great deal of laughter we find really some of the sunniest glimpses of things come out of knox that i have seen in any man for instance in his history of the reformation which is a book i hope every one of you will reada glorious book  on the whole i would bid you stand up to your work whatever it may be and not be afraid of itnot in sorrows or contradiction to yield but pushing on towards the goal and dont suppose that people are hostile to you in the world you will rarely find anybody designedly doing you ill you may feel often as if the whole world is obstructing you more or less but you will find that to be because the world is travelling in a different way from you and rushing on in its own path each man has only an extremely goodwill to himselfwhich he has a right to haveand is moving on towards his object keep out of literature as a general rule i should say also laughter if you find many people who are hard and indifferent to you in a world that you consider to be unhospitable and cruelas often indeed happens to a tenderhearted stirring young creatureyou will also find there are noble hearts who will look kindly on you and their help will be precious to you beyond price you will get good and evil as you go on and have the success that has been appointed to you  i will wind up with a small bit of verse that is from goethe also and has often gone through my mind to me it has the tone of a modern psalm in it in some measure it is sweet and clear the clearest of sceptical men had not anything like so clear a mind as that man hadfreer from cant and misdirected notion of any kind than any man in these ages has been this is what the poet says    the future hides in it   gladness and sorrow   we press still thorow   nought that abides in it   daunting usonward    and solemn before us   veiled the dark portal   goal of all mortal   stars silent rest oer us   graves under us silent    while earnest thou gazest   comes boding of terror   come phantasm and error   perplexes the bravest   with doubt and misgiving    but heard are the voices   heard are the sages   the worlds and the ages   choose well your choice is   brief and yet endless    here eyes do regard you   in eternitys stillness   here is all fulness   ye brave to reward you   work and despair nota  footnote a originally published in carlyles past and present lond 1843 p 318 and introduced there by the following words  my candid readers we will march out of this third book with a rhythmic word of goethes on our tongue a word which perhaps has already sung itself in dark hours and in bright through many a heart to me finding it devout yet wholly credible and veritable full of piety yet free of cant to me joyfully

was i have strictly held by that and abstained from more but the news i now have from edinburgh is of such a complexion so dubious and so surprising to me and i now find i shall privately have so much regret in a certain eventwhich seems to be reckoned possible and to depend on one gentleman of the seventhat to secure my own conscience in the matter a few plainer words seem needful to whatever i have said of you already therefore i now volunteer to add that i think you not only the one man in britain capable of bringing metaphysical philosophy in the ultimate german or european and highest actual form of it distinctly home to the understanding of british men who wish to understand it but that i notice in you farther on the moral side a sound strength of intellectual discernment a noble valour and reverence of mind which seems to me to mark you out as the man capable of doing us the highest service in ethical science too that of restoring or decisively beginning to restore the doctrine of morals to what i must ever reckon its one true and everlasting basis namely the divine or suprasensual one and thus of victoriously reconciling and rendering identical the latest dictates of modern science with the earliest dawnings of wisdom among the race of men  this is truly my opinion and how important to me not for the sake of edinburgh university alone but of the whole world for ages to come i need not say to you i have not the honour of any personal acquaintance with mr adam black late member for edinburgh but for fifty years back have known him in the distance and by current and credible report as a man of solid sense independence probity and public spirit and if in your better knowledge of the circumstances you judge it suitable to read this note to himto him or indeed to any other personyou are perfectly at liberty to do so    yours sincerely always    t carlyle illustration     farewell letter to the students   mr carlyle exlord rector of the university of edinburgh being asked before the expiration of his term of office to deliver a valedictory address to the students he sent the following letter to mr robertson vicepresident of the committee for his election    chelsea december 6 1868  dear sir  i much regret that a valedictory speech from me in present circumstances is a thing i must not think of be pleased to advise the young gentlemen who were so friendly towards me that i have already sent them in silence but with emotions deep enough perhaps too deep my loving farewell and that ingratitude or want of regard is by no means among the causes that keep me absent with a fine youthful enthusiasm beautiful to look upon they bestowed on me that bit of honour loyally all they had and it has now for reasons one and another become touchingly memorable to metouchingly and even grandly and tragicallynever to be forgotten for the remainder of my life bid them in my name if they still love me fight the good fight and quit themselves like men in the warfare to which they are as if conscript and consecrated and which lies ahead tell them to consult the eternal oracles not yet inaudible nor ever to become so when worthily inquired of and to disregard nearly altogether in comparison the temporary noises menacings and deliriums may they love wisdom as wisdom if she is to yield her treasures must be loved piously valiantly humbly beyond life itself or the prizes of life with all ones heart and all ones soul in that case i will say again and not in any other case it shall be well with them  adieu my young friends a long adieu yours with great sincerity    t carlyle     bequest by mr carlyle   at a meeting of the senatus academicus of edinburgh university a few weeks after his decease a deed of mortification by thomas carlyle in favour of that body for the foundation of ten bursaries in the faculty of arts was read the document opens as follows  i thomas carlyle residing at chelsea presently rector in the university of edinburgh from the love favour and affection which i bear to that university and from my interest in the advancement of education in my native scotland as elsewhere for these and for other more peculiar reasons which also i wish to record do intend and am now in the act of making to the said university a bequest as underwritten of the estate of craigenputtoch which is now my property craigenputtoch lies at the head of the parish of dunscore in nithsdale dumfriesshire the extent is of about 1800 acres rental at present on lease of nineteen years is Â£250 the annual worth with the improvements now in progress is probably Â£300 craigenputtoch was for many generations the patrimony of a family named welsh the eldest son usually a john welsh in series going back think some to the famous john welsh soninlaw of the reformer knox the last male heir of the family was john welsh esq surgeon haddington his one child and heiress was my late dear magnanimous muchloving and to me inestimable wife in memory of whom and of her constant nobleness and piety towards him and towards me i am nowshe having been the last of her kindredabout to bequeath to edinburgh university with whatever piety is in me this craigenputtoch which was theirs and hers on the terms and for the purposes and under the conditions underwritten therefore i do mortify and dispose to and in favour of the said university of edinburgh for the foundation and endowment of ten equal bursaries to be called the john welsh bursaries in the said university heritably and irredeemably all and whole the lands of upper craigenputtoch the said estate is not to be sold but to be kept and administered as land the net annual revenue of it to be divided into ten equal bursaries to be called as aforesaid the john welsh bursaries the senatus academicus shall bestow them on the ten applicants entering the university who on strict and thorough examination and open competitive trial by examiners whom the senatus will appoint for that end are judged to show the best attainment of actual proficiency and the best likelihood of more in the department or faculty called of arts as taught there examiners to be actual professors in said faculty the fittest whom the senatus can select with fit assessors or coadjutors and witnesses if the senatus see good and always the report of the said examiners to be minuted and signed and to govern the appointments made and to be recorded therewith more specially i appoint that five of the john welsh bursaries shall be given for the best proficiency in mathematicsi would rather say in mathesis if that were a thing to be judged of from competitionbut practically above all in pure geometry such being perennial the symptom not only of steady application but of a clear methodic intellect and offering in all epochs good promise for all manner of arts and pursuits the other five bursaries i appoint to depend for the present and indefinitely onwards on proficiency in classical learning that is to say in knowledge of latin greek and english all of these or any two of them this also gives good promise of a young mind but as i do not feel certain that it gives perennially or will perennially be thought in universities to give the best promise i am willing that the senatus of the university in case of a change of its opinion on this point hereafter in the course of generations shall bestow these latter five bursaries on what it does then consider the most excellent proficiency in matters classical or the best proof of a classical mind which directs its own highest effort towards teaching and diffusing in the new generations that will come the bursaries to be open to free competition of all who come to study in edinburgh university and who have never been of any other university the competition to be held on or directly before or after their first matriculation there bursaries to be always given on solemnly strict and faithful trial to the worthiest or if what in justice can never happen though it illustrates my intention the claims of two were absolutely equal and could not be settled by further trial preference is to fall in favour of the more unrecommended and unfriended under penalties graver than i or any highest mortal can pretend to impose but which i can never doubtas the law of eternal justice inexorably valid whether noticed or unnoticed pervades all corners of space and of timeare very sure to be punctually exacted if incurred this is to be the perpetual rule for the senatus in deciding  after stating some other conditions the document thus concludes  and so may a little trace of help to the young heroic soul struggling for what is highest spring from this poor arrangement and bequest may it run for ever if it can as a thread of pure water from the scottish rocks trickling into its little basin by the thirsty wayside for those to whom it veritably belongs amen such is my bequest to edinburgh university in witness whereof these presents written upon this and the two preceding pages by james steven burns clerk to john cook writer to the signet are subscribed by me at chelsea the 20th day of june 1867 before these witnesses john forster barristeratlaw man of letters etc residing at palacegate house kensington london and james anthony froude man of letters residing at no 5
