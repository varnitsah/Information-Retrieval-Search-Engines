comes back to the enchanted palace      xxix      poetry and prose      xxx       a wedding at the stone house     i  an irate neighbor   a tall slim girl halfpast sixteen with serious gray eyes and hair which her friends called auburn had sat down on the broad red sandstone doorstep of a prince edward island farmhouse one ripe afternoon in august firmly resolved to construe so many lines of virgil  but an august afternoon with blue hazes scarfing the harvest slopes little winds whispering elfishly in the poplars and a dancing slendor of red poppies outflaming against the dark coppice of young firs in a corner of the cherry orchard was fitter for dreams than dead languages the virgil soon slipped unheeded to the ground and anne her chin propped on her clasped hands and her eyes on the splendid mass of fluffy clouds that were heaping up just over mr j a harrisons house like a great white mountain was far away in a delicious world where a certain schoolteacher was doing a wonderful work shaping the destinies of future statesmen and inspiring youthful minds and hearts with high and lofty ambitions  to be sure if you came down to harsh facts    which it must be confessed anne seldom did until she had to    it did not seem likely that there was much promising material for celebrities in avonlea school but you could never tell what might happen if a teacher used her influence for good anne had certain rosetinted ideals of what a teacher might accomplish if she only went the right way about it and she was in the midst of a delightful scene forty years hence with a famous personage    just exactly what he was to be famous for was left in convenient haziness but anne thought it would be rather nice to have him a college president or a canadian premier    bowing low over her wrinkled hand and assuring her that it was she who had first kindled his ambition and that all his success in life was due to the lessons she had instilled so long ago in avonlea school this pleasant vision was shattered by a most unpleasant interruption  a demure little jersey cow came scuttling down the lane and five seconds later mr harrison arrived    if arrived be not too mild a term to describe the manner of his irruption into the yard  he bounced over the fence without waiting to open the gate and angrily confronted astonished anne who had risen to her feet and stood looking at him in some bewilderment mr harrison was their new righthand neighbor and she had never met him before although she had seen him once or twice  in early april before anne had come home from queens mr robert bell whose farm adjoined the cuthbert place on the west had sold out and moved to charlottetown his farm had been bought by a certain mr j a harrison whose name and the fact that he was a new brunswick man were all that was known about him but before he had been a month in avonlea he had won the reputation of being an odd person    a crank mrs rachel lynde said mrs rachel was an outspoken lady as those of you who may have already made her acquaintance will remember mr harrison was certainly different from other people    and that is the essential characteristic of a crank as everybody knows  in the first place he kept house for himself and had publicly stated that he wanted no fools of women around his diggings feminine avonlea took its revenge by the gruesome tales it related about his housekeeping and cooking he had hired little john henry carter of white sands and john henry started the stories for one thing there was never any stated time for meals in the harrison establishment mr harrison got a bite when he felt hungry and if john henry were around at the time he came in for a share but if he were not he had to wait until mr harrisons next hungry spell john henry mournfully averred that he would have starved to death if it wasnt that he got home on sundays and got a good filling up and that his mother always gave him a basket of grub to take back with him on monday mornings  as for washing dishes mr harrison never made any pretence of doing it unless a rainy sunday came then he went to work and washed them all at once in the rainwater hogshead and left them to drain dry  again mr harrison was close when he was asked to subscribe to the rev mr allans salary he said hed wait and see how many dollars worth of good he got out of his preaching first    he didnt believe in buying a pig in a poke and when mrs lynde went to ask for a contribution to missions    and incidentally to see the inside of the house    he told her there were more heathens among the old woman gossips in avonlea than anywhere else he knew of and hed cheerfully contribute to a mission for christianizing them if shed undertake it mrs rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor mrs robert bell was safe in her grave for it would have broken her heart to see the state of her house in which she used to take so much pride  why she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day mrs lynde told marilla cuthbert indignantly and if you could see it now i had to hold up my skirts as i walked across it  finally mr harrison kept a parrot called ginger nobody in avonlea had ever kept a parrot before consequently that proceeding was considered barely respectable and such a parrot if you took john henry carters word for it never was such an unholy bird it swore terribly mrs carter would have taken john henry away at once if she had been sure she could get another place for him besides ginger had bitten a piece right out of the back of john henrys neck one day when he had stooped down too near the cage mrs carter showed everybody the mark when the luckless john henry went home on sundays  all these things flashed through annes mind as mr harrison stood quite speechless with wrath apparently before her in his most amiable mood mr harrison could not have been considered a handsome man he was short and fat and bald and now with his round face purple with rage and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head anne thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen  all at once mr harrison found his voice  im not going to put up with this he spluttered not a day longer do you hear miss bless my soul this is the third time miss     the third time patience has ceased to be a virtue miss i warned your aunt the last time not to let it occur again     and shes let it    shes done it    what does she mean by it that is what i want to know that is what im here about miss  will you explain what the trouble is asked anne in her most dignified manner she had been practicing it considerably of late to have it in good working order when school began but it had no apparent effect on the irate j a harrison  trouble is it bless my soul trouble enough i should think the trouble is miss that i found that jersey cow of your aunts in my oats again not half an hour ago the third time mark you i found her in last tuesday and i found her in yesterday i came here and told your aunt not to let it occur again she has let it occur again wheres your aunt miss i just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of my mind    a piece of j a harrisons mind miss  if you mean miss marilla cuthbert she is not my aunt and she has gone down to east grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill said anne with due increase of dignity at every word i am very sorry that my cow should have broken into your oats     she is my cow and not miss cuthberts    matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was a little calf and he bought her from mr bell  sorry miss sorry isnt going to help matters any youd better go and look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats    trampled them from center to circumference miss  i am very sorry repeated anne firmly but perhaps if you kept your fences in better repair dolly might not have broken in it is your part of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and i noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition  my fence is all right snapped mr harrison angrier than ever at this carrying of the war into the enemys country the jail fence couldnt keep a demon of a cow like that out and i can tell you you redheaded snippet that if the cow is yours as you say youd be better employed in watching her out of other peoples grain than in sitting round reading yellowcovered novels    with a scathing glance at the innocent tancolored virgil by annes feet  something at that moment was red besides annes hair    which had always been a tender point with her  id rather have red hair than none at all except a little fringe round my ears she flashed  the shot told for mr harrison was really very sensitive about his bald head his anger choked him up again and he could only glare speechlessly at anne who recovered her temper and followed up her advantage  i can make allowance for you mr harrison because i have an imagination i can easily imagine how very trying it must be to find a cow in your oats and i shall not cherish any hard feelings against you for the things youve said i promise you that dolly shall never break into your oats again i give you my word of honor on that point  well mind you she doesnt muttered mr harrison in a somewhat subdued tone but he stamped off angrily enough and anne heard him growling to himself until he was out of earshot  grievously disturbed in mind anne marched across the yard and shut the naughty jersey up in the milking pen  she cant possibly get out of that unless she tears the fence down she reflected she looks pretty quiet now i daresay she has sickened herself on those oats i wish id sold her to mr shearer when he wanted her last week but i thought it was just as well to wait until we had the auction of the stock and let them all go together i believe it is true about mr harrison being a crank certainly theres nothing of the kindred spirit about him  anne had always a weather eye open for kindred spirits  marilla cuthbert was driving into the yard as anne returned from the house and the latter flew to get tea ready they discussed the matter at the tea table  ill be glad when the auction is over said marilla it is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable martin to look after them he has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if id give him the day off to go to his aunts funeral i dont know how many aunts he has got i am sure thats the fourth thats died since he hired here a year ago ill be more than thankful when the crop is in and mr barry takes over the farm well have to keep dolly shut up in the pen till martin comes for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed i declare it is a world of trouble as rachel says heres poor mary keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than i know she has a brother in british columbia and she has written to him about them but she hasnt heard from him yet  what are the children like how old are they  six past    theyre twins  oh ive always been especially interested in twins ever since mrs hammond had so many said anne eagerly are they pretty  goodness you couldnt tell    they were too dirty davy had been out making mud pies and dora went out to call him in davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then because she cried he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about mary said dora was really a very good child but that davy was full of mischief he has never had any bringing up you might say his father died when he was a baby and mary has been sick almost ever since  im always sorry for children that have no bringing up said anne soberly you know i hadnt any till you took me in hand i hope their uncle will look after them just what relation is mrs keith to you  mary none in the world it was her husband    he was our third cousin theres mrs lynde coming through the yard i thought shed be up to hear about mary  dont tell her about mr harrison and the cow implored anne  marilla promised but the promise was quite unnecessary for mrs lynde was no sooner fairly seated than she said  i saw mr harrison chasing your jersey out of his oats today when i was coming home from carmody i thought he looked pretty mad did he make much of a rumpus  anne and marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles few things in avonlea ever escaped mrs lynde it was only that morning anne had said  if you went to your own room at midnight locked the door pulled down the blind and sneezed mrs lynde would ask you the next day how your cold was  i believe he did admitted marilla i was away he gave anne a piece of his mind  i think he is a very disagreeable man said anne with a resentful toss of her ruddy head  you never said a truer word said mrs rachel solemnly i knew thered be trouble when robert bell sold his place to a new brunswick man thats what i dont know what avonlea is coming to with so many strange people rushing into it itll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds  why what other strangers are coming in asked marilla  havent you heard well theres a family of donnells for one thing theyve rented peter sloanes old house peter has hired the man to run his mill they belong down east and nobody knows anything about them then that shiftless timothy cotton family are going to move up from white sands and theyll simply be a burden on the public he is in consumption    when he isnt stealing     and his wife is a slacktwisted creature that cant turn her hand to a thing she washes her dishes sitting down mrs george pye has taken her husbands orphan nephew anthony pye hell be going to school to you anne so you may expect trouble thats what and youll have another strange pupil too paul irving is coming from the states to live with his grandmother you remember his father marilla    stephen irving him that jilted lavendar lewis over at grafton  i dont think he jilted her there was a quarrel    i suppose there was blame on both sides  well anyway he didnt marry her and shes been as queer as possible ever since they say    living all by herself in that little stone house she calls echo lodge stephen went off to the states and went into business with his uncle and married a yankee hes never been home since though his mother has been up to see him once or twice his wife died two years ago and hes sending the boy home to his mother for a spell hes ten years old and i dont know if hell be a very desirable pupil you can never tell about those yankees  mrs lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born or brought up elsewhere than in prince edward island with a decided cananygoodthingcomeoutofnazareth air they might be good people of course but you were on the safe side in doubting it she had a special prejudice against yankees her husband had been cheated out of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in boston and neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced mrs rachel that the whole united states was not responsible for it  avonlea school wont be the worse for a little new blood said marilla drily and if this boy is anything like his father hell be all right steve irving was the nicest boy that was ever raised in these parts though some people did call him proud i should think mrs irving would be very glad to have the child she has been very lonesome since her husband died  oh the boy may be well enough but hell be different from avonlea children said mrs rachel as if that clinched the matter mrs rachels opinions concerning any person place or thing were always warranted to wear whats this i hear about your going to start up a village improvement society anne  i was just talking it over with some of the girls and boys at the last debating club said anne flushing they thought it would be rather nice    and so do mr and mrs allan lots of villages have them now  well youll get into no end of hot water if you do better leave it alone anne thats what people dont like being improved  oh we are not going to try to improve the people it is avonlea itself there are lots of things which might be done to make it prettier for instance if we could coax mr levi boulter to pull down that dreadful old house on his upper farm wouldnt that be an improvement  it certainly would admitted mrs rachel that old ruin has been an eyesore to the settlement for years but if you improvers can coax levi boulter to do anything for the public that he isnt to be paid for doing may i be there to see and hear the process thats what i dont want to discourage you anne for there may be something in your idea though i suppose you did get it out of some rubbishy yankee magazine but youll have your hands full with your school and i advise you as a friend not to bother with your improvements thats what but there i know youll go ahead with it if youve set your mind on it you were always one to carry a thing through somehow  something about the firm outlines of annes lips told that mrs rachel was not far astray in this estimate annes heart was bent on forming the improvement society gilbert blythe who was to teach in white sands but would always be home from friday night to monday morning was enthusiastic about it and most of the other folks were willing to go in for anything that meant occasional meetings and consequently some fun as for what the improvements were to be nobody had any very clear idea except anne and gilbert they had talked them over and planned them out until an ideal avonlea existed in their minds if nowhere else  mrs rachel had still another item of news  theyve given the carmody school to a priscilla grant didnt you go to queens with a girl of that name anne  yes indeed priscilla to teach at carmody how perfectly lovely exclaimed anne her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening stars causing mrs lynde to wonder anew if she would ever get it settled to her satisfaction whether anne shirley were really a pretty girl or not     ii  selling in haste and repenting at leisure   anne drove over to carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon and took diana barry with her diana was of course a pledged member of the improvement society and the two girls talked about little else all the way to carmody and back  the very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that hall painted said diana as they drove past the avonlea hall a rather shabby building set down in a wooded hollow with spruce trees hooding it about on all sides its a disgraceful looking place and we must attend to it even before we try to get mr levi boulder to pull his house down father says well never succeed in doing that levi boulter is too mean to spend the time it would take  perhaps hell let the boys take it down if they promise to haul the boards and split them up for him for kindling wood said anne hopefully we must do our best and be content to go slowly at first we cant expect to improve everything all at once well have to educate public sentiment first of course  diana wasnt exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant but it sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a society with such an aim in view  i thought of something last night that we could do anne you know that threecornered piece of ground where the roads from carmody and newbridge and white sands meet its all grown over with young spruce but wouldnt it be nice to have them all cleared out and just leave the two or three birch trees that are on it  splendid agreed anne gaily and have a rustic seat put under the birches and when spring comes well have a flowerbed made in the middle of it and plant geraniums  yes only well have to devise some way of getting old mrs hiram sloane to keep her cow off the road or shell eat our geraniums up laughed diana i begin to see what you mean by educating public sentiment anne theres the old boulter house now did you ever see such a rookery and perched right close to the road too an old house with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its eyes picked out  i think an old deserted house is such a sad sight said anne dreamily it always seems to me to be thinking about its past and mourning for its oldtime joys marilla says that a large family was raised in that old house long ago and that it was a real pretty place with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it it was full of little children and laughter and songs and now it is empty and nothing ever wanders through it but the wind how lonely and sorrowful it must feel perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights    the ghosts of the little children of long ago and the roses and the songs    and for a little while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again  diana shook her head  i never imagine things like that about places now anne dont you remember how cross mother and marilla were when we imagined ghosts into the haunted wood to this day i cant go through that bush comfortably after dark and if i began imagining such things about the old boulter house id be frightened to pass it too besides those children arent dead theyre all grown up and doing well    and one of them is a butcher and flowers and songs couldnt have ghosts anyhow  anne smothered a little sigh she loved diana dearly and they had always been good comrades but she had long ago learned that when she wandered into the realm of fancy she must go alone the way to it was by an enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her  a thundershower came up while the girls were at carmody it did not last long however and the drive home through lanes where the raindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the drenched ferns gave out spicy odors was delightful but just as they turned into the cuthbert lane anne saw something that spoiled the beauty of the landscape for her  before them on the right extended mr harrisons broad graygreen field of late oats wet and luxuriant and there standing squarely in the middle of it up to her sleek sides in the lush growth and blinking at them calmly over the intervening tassels was a jersey cow  anne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips that boded no good to the predatory quadruped not a word said she but she climbed nimbly down over the wheels and whisked across the fence before diana understood what had happened  anne come back shrieked the latter as soon as she found her voice youll ruin your dress in that wet grain    ruin it she doesnt hear me well shell never get that cow out by herself i must go and help her of course  anne was charging through the grain like a mad thing diana hopped briskly down tied the horse securely to a post turned the skirt of her pretty gingham dress over her shoulders mounted the fence and started in pursuit of her frantic friend she could run faster than anne who was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt and soon overtook her behind them they left a trail that would break mr harrisons heart when he should see it  anne for mercys sake stop panted poor diana im right out of breath and you are wet to the skin  i must    get    that cow    out    before    mr harrison    sees her gasped anne i dont    care    if im    drowned    if we    can    only    do that  but the jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out of her luscious browsing ground no sooner had the two breathless girls got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner of the field  head her off screamed anne run diana run  diana did run anne tried to and the wicked jersey went around the field as if she were possessed privately diana thought she was it was fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the corner gap into the cuthbert lane  there is no denying that anne was in anything but an angelic temper at that precise moment nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a buggy halted just outside the lane wherein sat mr shearer of carmody and his son both of whom wore a broad smile  i guess youd better have sold me that cow when i wanted to buy her last week anne chuckled mr shearer  ill sell her to you now if you want her said her flushed and disheveled owner you may have her this very minute  done ill give you twenty for her as i offered before and jim here can drive her right over to carmody shell go to town with the rest of the shipment this evening mr reed of brighton wants a jersey cow  five minutes later jim shearer and the jersey cow were marching up the road and impulsive anne was driving along the green gables lane with her twenty dollars  what will marilla say asked diana  oh she wont care dolly was my own cow and it isnt likely shed bring more than twenty dollars at the auction but oh dear if mr harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again and after my giving him my word of honor that id never let it happen well it has taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows a cow that could jump over or break through our milkpen fence couldnt be trusted anywhere  marilla had gone down to mrs lyndes and when she returned knew all about dollys sale and transfer for mrs lynde had seen most of the transaction from her window and guessed the rest  i suppose its just as well shes gone though you do do things in a dreadful headlong fashion anne i dont see how she got out of the pen though she must have broken some of the boards off  i didnt think of looking said anne but ill go and see now martin has never come back yet perhaps some more of his aunts have died i think its something like mr peter sloane and the octogenarians the other evening mrs sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to mr sloane i see here that another octogenarian has just died what is an octogenarian peter and mr sloane said he didnt know but they must be very sickly creatures for you never heard tell of them but they were dying thats the way with martins aunts  martins just like all the rest of those french said marilla in disgust you cant depend on them for a day marilla was looking over annes carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard a minute later anne dashed into the kitchen wringing her hands  anne shirley whats the matter now  oh marilla whatever shall i do this is terrible and its all my fault oh will i ever learn to stop and reflect a little before doing reckless things mrs lynde always told me i would do something dreadful some day and now ive done it  anne you are the most exasperating girl what is it youve done  sold mr harrisons jersey cow    the one he bought from mr bell    to mr shearer dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute  anne shirley are you dreaming  i only wish i were theres no dream about it though its very like a nightmare and mr harrisons cow is in charlottetown by this time oh marilla i thought id finished getting into scrapes and here i am in the very worst one i ever was in in my life what can i do  do theres nothing to do child except go and see mr harrison about it we can offer him our jersey in exchange if he doesnt want to take the money she is just as good as his  im sure hell be awfully cross and disagreeable about it though moaned anne  i daresay he will he seems to be an irritable sort of a man ill go and explain to him if you like  no indeed im not as mean as that exclaimed anne this is all my fault and im certainly not going to let you take my punishment ill go myself and ill go at once the sooner its over the better for it will be terribly humiliating  poor anne got her hat and her twenty dollars and was passing out when she happened to glance through the open pantry door on the table reposed a nut cake which she had baked that morning    a particularly toothsome concoction iced with pink icing and adorned with walnuts anne had intended it for friday evening when the youth of avonlea were to meet at green gables to organize the improvement society but what were they compared to the justly offended mr harrison anne thought that cake ought to soften the heart of any man especially one who had to do his own cooking and she promptly popped it into a box she would take it to mr harrison as a peace offering  that is if he gives me a chance to say anything at all she thought ruefully as she climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut across the fields golden in the light of the dreamy august evening i know now just how people feel who are being led to execution     iii  mr harrison at home   mr harrisons house was an oldfashioned loweaved whitewashed structure set against a thick spruce grove  mr harrison himself was sitting on his vineshaded veranda in his shirt sleeves enjoying his evening pipe when he realized who was coming up the path he sprang suddenly to his feet bolted into the house and shut the door this was merely the uncomfortable result of his surprise mingled with a good deal of shame over his outburst of temper the day before but it nearly swept the remnant of her courage from annes heart  if hes so cross now what will he be when he hears what ive done she reflected miserably as she rapped at the door  but mr harrison opened it smiling sheepishly and invited her to enter in a tone quite mild and friendly if somewhat nervous he had laid aside his pipe and donned his coat he offered anne a very dusty chair very politely and her reception would have passed off pleasantly enough if it had not been for the telltale of a parrot who was peering through the bars of his cage with wicked golden eyes no sooner had anne seated herself than ginger exclaimed  bless my soul whats that redheaded snippet coming here for  it would be hard to say whose face was the redder mr harrisons or annes  dont you mind that parrot said mr harrison casting a furious glance at ginger hes    hes always talking nonsense i got him from my brother who was a sailor sailors dont always use the choicest language and parrots are very imitative birds  so i should think said poor anne the remembrance of her errand quelling her resentment she couldnt afford to snub mr harrison under the circumstances that was certain when you had just sold a mans jersey cow offhand without his knowledge or consent you must not mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things nevertheless the redheaded snippet was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have been  ive come to confess something to you mr harrison she said resolutely its    its about    that jersey cow  bless my soul exclaimed mr harrison nervously has she gone and broken into my oats again well never mind    never mind if she has its no difference    none at all i    i was too hasty yesterday thats a fact never mind if she has  oh if it were only that sighed anne but its ten times worse i dont     bless my soul do you mean to say shes got into my wheat  no    no    not the wheat but     then its the cabbages shes broken into my cabbages that i was raising for exhibition hey  its not the cabbages mr harrison ill tell you everything    that is what i came forbut please dont interrupt me it makes me so nervous just let me tell my story and dont say anything till i get throughand then no doubt youll say plenty anne concluded but in thought only  i wont say another word said mr harrison and he didnt but ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating redheaded snippet at intervals until anne felt quite wild  i shut my jersey cow up in our pen yesterday this morning i went to carmody and when i came back i saw a jersey cow in your oats diana and i chased her out and you cant imagine what a hard time we had i was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexedand mr shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow i sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars it was wrong of me i should have waited and consulted marilla of course but im dreadfully given to doing things without thinkingeverybody who knows me will tell you that mr shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train  redheaded snippet quoted ginger in a tone of profound contempt  at this point mr harrison arose and with an expression that would have struck terror into any bird but a parrot carried gingers cage into an adjoining room and shut the door ginger shrieked swore and otherwise conducted himself in keeping with his reputation but finding himself left alone relapsed into sulky silence  excuse me and go on said mr harrison sitting down again my brother the sailor never taught that bird any manners  i went home and after tea i went out to the milking pen mr harrison    anne leaned forward clasping her hands with her old childish gesture while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into mr harrisons embarrassed face    i found my cow still shut up in the pen it was your cow i had sold to mr shearer  bless my soul exclaimed mr harrison in blank amazement at this unlookedfor conclusion what a very extraordinary thing  oh it isnt in the least extraordinary that i should be getting myself and other people into scrapes said anne mournfully im noted for that you might suppose id have grown out of it by this time    ill be seventeen next march    but it seems that i havent mr harrison is it too much to hope that youll forgive me im afraid its too late to get your cow back but here is the money for her    or you can have mine in exchange if youd rather shes a very good cow and i cant express how sorry i am for it all  tut tut said mr harrison briskly dont say another word about it miss its of no consequence    no consequence whatever accidents will happen im too hasty myself sometimes miss     far too hasty but i cant help speaking out just what i think and folks must take me as they find me if that cow had been in my cabbages now    but never mind she wasnt so its all right i think id rather have your cow in exchange since you want to be rid of her  oh thank you mr harrison im so glad you are not vexed i was afraid you would be  and i suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me after the fuss i made yesterday hey but you mustnt mind me im a terrible outspoken old fellow thats all    awful apt to tell the truth no matter if it is a bit plain  so is mrs lynde said anne before she could prevent herself  who mrs lynde dont you tell me im like that old gossip said mr harrison irritably im not    not a bit what have you got in that box  a cake said anne archly in her relief at mr harrisons unexpected amiability her spirits soared upward featherlight i brought it over for you    i thought perhaps you didnt have cake very often  i dont thats a fact and im mighty fond of it too im much obliged to you it looks good on top i hope its good all the way through  it is said anne gaily confident i have made cakes in my time that were not as mrs allan could tell you but this one is all right i made it for the improvement society but i can make another for them  well ill tell you what miss you must help me eat it ill put the kettle on and well have a cup of tea how will that do  will you let me make the tea said anne dubiously  mr harrison chuckled  i see you havent much confidence in my ability to make tea youre wrong    i can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank but go ahead yourself fortunately it rained last sunday so theres plenty of clean dishes  anne hopped briskly up and went to work she washed the teapot in several waters before she put the tea to steep then she swept the stove and set the table bringing the dishes out of the pantry the state of that pantry horrified anne but she wisely said nothing mr harrison told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches anne adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to the stains on the tablecloth soon the tea was ready and anne found herself sitting opposite mr harrison at his own table pouring his tea for him and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and plans she could hardly believe the evidence of her senses  mr harrison had brought ginger back averring that the poor bird would be lonesome and anne feeling that she could forgive everybody and everything offered him a walnut but gingers feelings had been grievously hurt and he rejected all overtures of friendship he sat moodily on his perch and ruffled his feathers up until he looked like a mere ball of green and gold  why do you call him ginger asked anne who liked appropriate names and thought ginger accorded not at all with such gorgeous plumage  my brother the sailor named him maybe it had some reference to his temper i think a lot of that bird though    youd be surprised if you knew how much he has his faults of course that bird has cost me a good deal one way and another some people object to his swearing habits but he cant be broken of them ive tried    other people have tried some folks have prejudices against parrots silly aint it i like them myself gingers a lot of company to me nothing would induce me to give that bird up    nothing in the world miss  mr harrison flung the last sentence at anne as explosively as if he suspected her of some latent design of persuading him to give ginger up anne however was beginning to like the queer fussy fidgety little man and before the meal was over they were quite good friends mr harrison found out about the improvement society and was disposed to approve of it  thats right go ahead theres lots of room for improvement in this settlement    and in the people too  oh i dont know flashed anne to herself or to her particular cronies she might admit that there were some small imperfections easily removable in avonlea and its inhabitants but to hear a practical outsider like mr harrison saying it was an entirely different thing i think avonlea is a lovely place and the people in it are very nice too  i guess youve got a spice of temper commented mr harrison surveying the flushed cheeks and indignant eyes opposite him it goes with hair like yours i reckon avonlea is a pretty decent place or i wouldnt have located here but i suppose even you will admit that it has some faults  i like it all the better for them said loyal anne i dont like places or people either that havent any faults i think a truly perfect person would be very uninteresting mrs milton white says she never met a perfect person but shes heard enough about one     her husbands first wife dont you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect  it would be more uncomfortable to be married to the perfect wife declared mr harrison with a sudden and inexplicable warmth  when tea was over anne insisted on washing the dishes although mr harrison assured her that there were enough in the house to do for weeks yet she would dearly have loved to sweep the floor also but no broom was visible and she did not like to ask where it was for fear there wasnt one at all  you might run across and talk to me once in a while suggested mr harrison when she was leaving tisnt far and folks ought to be neighborly im kind of interested in that society of yours seems to me therell be some fun in it who are you going to tackle first  we are not going to meddle with people    it is only places we mean to improve said anne in a dignified tone she rather suspected that mr harrison was making fun of the project  when she had gone mr harrison watched her from the window    a lithe girlish shape tripping lightheartedly across the fields in the sunset afterglow  im a crusty lonesome crabbed old chap he said aloud but theres something about that little girl makes me feel young again    and its such a pleasant sensation id like to have it repeated once in a while  redheaded snippet croaked ginger mockingly  mr harrison shook his fist at the parrot  you ornery bird he muttered i almost wish id wrung your neck when my brother the sailor brought you home will you never be done getting me into trouble  anne ran home blithely and recounted her adventures to marilla who had been not a little alarmed by her long absence and was on the point of starting out to look for her  its a pretty good world after all isnt it marilla concluded anne happily mrs lynde was complaining the other day that it wasnt much of a world she said whenever you looked forward to anything pleasant you were sure to be more or less disappointed     perhaps that is true but there is a good side to it too the bad things dont always come up to your expectations either     they nearly always turn out ever so much better than you think i looked forward to a dreadfully unpleasant experience when i went over to mr harrisons tonight and instead he was quite kind and i had almost a nice time i think were going to be real good friends if we make plenty of allowances for each other and everything has turned out for the best but all the same marilla i shall certainly never again sell a cow before making sure to whom she belongs and i do not like parrots     iv  different opinions   one evening at sunset jane andrews gilbert blythe and anne shirley were lingering by a fence in the shadow of gently swaying spruce boughs where a wood cut known as the birch path joined the main road jane had been up to spend the afternoon with anne who walked part of the way home with her at the fence they met gilbert and all three were now talking about the fateful morrow for that morrow was the first of september and the schools would open jane would go to newbridge and gilbert to white sands  you both have the advantage of me sighed anne youre going to teach children who dont know you but i have to teach my own old schoolmates and mrs lynde says shes afraid they wont respect me as they would a stranger unless im very cross from the first but i dont believe a teacher should be cross oh it seems to me such a responsibility  i guess well get on all right said jane comfortably jane was not troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good she meant to earn her salary fairly please the trustees and get her name on the school inspectors roll of honor further ambitions jane had none the main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross to do that if my pupils wont do as i tell them i shall punish them  how  give them a good whipping of course  oh jane you wouldnt cried anne shocked jane you couldnt  indeed i could and would if they deserved it said jane decidedly  i could never whip a child said anne with equal decision i dont believe in it at all miss stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order and mr phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all no if i cant get along without whipping i shall not try to teach school there are better ways of managing i shall try to win my pupils affections and then they will want to do what i tell them  but suppose they dont said practical jane  i wouldnt whip them anyhow im sure it wouldnt do any good oh dont whip your pupils jane dear no matter what they do  what do you think about it gilbert demanded jane dont you think there are some children who really need a whipping now and then  dont you think its a cruel barbarous thing to whip a child     any child exclaimed anne her face flushing with earnestness  well said gilbert slowly torn between his real convictions and his wish to measure up to annes ideal theres something to be said on both sides i dont believe in whipping children much i think as you say anne that there are better ways of managing as a rule and that corporal punishment should be a last resort but on the other hand as jane says i believe there is an occasional child who cant be influenced in any other way and who in short needs a whipping and would be improved by it corporal punishment as a last resort is to be my rule  gilbert having tried to please both sides succeeded as is usual and eminently right in pleasing neither jane tossed her head  ill whip my pupils when theyre naughty its the shortest and easiest way of convincing them  anne gave gilbert a disappointed glance  i shall never whip a child she repeated firmly i feel sure it isnt either right or necessary  suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something said jane  id keep him in after school and talk kindly and firmly to him said anne there is some good in every person if you can find it it is a teachers duty to find and develop it that is what our school management professor at queens told us you know do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him its far more important to influence the children aright than it is even to teach them the three rs professor rennie says  but the inspector examines them in the three rs mind you and he wont give you a good report if they dont come up to his standard protested jane  id rather have my pupils love me and look back to me in after years as a real helper than be on the roll of honor asserted anne decidedly  wouldnt you punish children at all when they misbehaved asked gilbert  oh yes i suppose i shall have to although i know ill hate to do it but you can keep them in at recess or stand them on the floor or give them lines to write  i suppose you wont punish the girls by making them sit with the boys said jane slyly  gilbert and anne looked at each other and smiled rather foolishly once upon a time anne had been made to sit with gilbert for punishment and sad and bitter had been the consequences thereof  well time will tell which is the best way said jane philosophically as they parted  anne went back to green gables by way of birch path shadowy rustling fernscented through violet vale and past willowmere where dark and light kissed each other under the firs and down through lovers lane    spots she and diana had so named long ago she walked slowly enjoying the sweetness of wood and field and the starry summer twilight and thinking soberly about the new duties she was to take up on the morrow when she reached the yard at green gables mrs lyndes loud decided tones floated out through the open kitchen window  mrs lynde has come up to give me good advice about tomorrow thought anne with a grimace but i dont believe ill go in her advice is much like pepper i think    excellent in small quantities but rather scorching in her doses ill run over and have a chat with mr harrison instead  this was not the first time anne had run over and chatted with mr harrison since the notable affair of the jersey cow she had been there several evenings and mr harrison and she were very good friends although there were times and seasons when anne found the outspokenness on which he prided himself rather trying ginger still continued to regard her with suspicion and never failed to greet her sarcastically as redheaded snippet mr harrison had tried vainly to break him of the habit by jumping excitedly up whenever he saw anne coming and exclaiming  bless my soul heres that pretty little girl again or something equally flattering but ginger saw through the scheme and scorned it anne was never to know how many compliments mr harrison paid her behind her back he certainly never paid her any to her face  well i suppose youve been back in the woods laying in a supply of switches for tomorrow was his greeting as anne came up the veranda steps  no indeed said anne indignantly she was an excellent target for teasing because she always took things so seriously i shall never have a switch in my school mr harrison of course i shall have to have a pointer but i shall use it for pointing only  so you mean to strap them instead well i dont know but youre right a switch stings more at the time but the strap smarts longer thats a fact  i shall not use anything of the sort im not going to whip my pupils  bless my soul exclaimed mr harrison in genuine astonishment how do you lay out to keep order then  i shall govern by affection mr harrison  it wont do said mr harrison wont do at all anne spare the rod and spoil the child when i went to school the master whipped me regular every day because he said if i wasnt in mischief just then i was plotting it  methods have changed since your schooldays mr harrison  but human nature hasnt mark my words youll never manage the young fry unless you keep a rod in pickle for them the thing is impossible  well im going to try my way first said anne who had a fairly strong will of her own and was apt to cling very tenaciously to her theories  youre pretty stubborn i reckon was mr harrisons way of putting it well well well see someday when you get riled up    and people with hair like yours are desperate apt to get riled    youll forget all your pretty little notions and give some of them a whaling youre too young to be teaching anyhow     far too young and childish  altogether anne went to bed that night in a rather pessimistic mood she slept poorly and was so pale and tragic at breakfast next morning that marilla was alarmed and insisted on making her take a cup of scorching ginger tea anne sipped it patiently although she could not imagine what good ginger tea would do had it been some magic brew potent to confer age and experience anne would have swallowed a quart of it without flinching  marilla what if i fail  youll hardly fail completely in one day and theres plenty more days coming said marilla the trouble with you anne is that youll expect to teach those children everything and reform all their faults right off and if you cant youll think youve failed     v  a fullfledged schoolmaam   when anne reached the school that morning    for the first time in her life she had traversed the birch path deaf and blind to its beauties    all was quiet and still the preceding teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival and when anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of shining morning faces and bright inquisitive eyes she hung up her hat and faced her pupils hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling  she had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a speech she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school she had revised and improved it painstakingly and then she had learned it off by heart it was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge the only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it  after what seemed to her a year    about ten seconds in reality    she said faintly take your testaments please and sank breathlessly into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that followed while the children read their verses anne marshalled her shaky wits into order and looked over the array of little pilgrims to the grownup land  most of them were of course quite well known to her her own classmates had passed out in the preceding year but the rest had all gone to school with her excepting the primer class and ten newcomers to avonlea anne secretly felt more interest in these ten than in those whose possibilities were already fairly well mapped out to her to be sure they might be just as commonplace as the rest but on the other hand there might be a genius among them it was a thrilling idea  sitting by himself at a corner desk was anthony pye he had a dark sullen little face and was staring at anne with a hostile expression in his black eyes anne instantly made up her mind that she would win that boys affection and discomfit the pyes utterly  in the other corner another strange boy was sitting with arty sloane   a jolly looking little chap with a snub nose freckled face and big light blue eyes fringed with whitish lashes     probably the donnell boy and if resemblance went for anything his sister was sitting across the aisle with mary bell anne wondered what sort of mother the child had to send her to school dressed as she was she wore a faded pink silk dress trimmed with a great deal of cotton lace soiled white kid slippers and silk stockings her sandy hair was tortured into innumerable kinky and unnatural curls surmounted by a flamboyant bow of pink ribbon bigger than her head judging from her expression she was very well satisfied with herself  a pale little thing with smooth ripples of fine silky fawncolored hair flowing over her shoulders must anne thought be annetta bell whose parents had formerly lived in the newbridge school district but by reason of hauling their house fifty yards north of its old site were now in avonlea three pallid little girls crowded into one seat were certainly cottons and there was no doubt that the small beauty with the long brown curls and hazel eyes who was casting coquettish looks at jack gills over the edge of her testament was prillie rogerson whose father had recently married a second wife and brought prillie home from her grandmothers in grafton a tall awkward girl in a back seat who seemed to have too many feet and hands anne could not place at all but later on discovered that her name was barbara shaw and that she had come to live with an avonlea aunt she was also to find that if barbara ever managed to walk down the aisle without falling over her own or somebody elses feet the avonlea scholars wrote the unusual fact up on the porch wall to commemorate it  but when annes eyes met those of the boy at the front desk facing her own a queer little thrill went over her as if she had found her genius she knew this must be paul irving and that mrs rachel lynde had been right for once when she prophesied that he would be unlike the avonlea children more than that anne realized that he was unlike other children anywhere and that there was a soul subtly akin to her own gazing at her out of the very dark blue eyes that were watching her so intently  she knew paul was ten but he looked no more than eight he had the most beautiful little face she had ever seen in a child     features of exquisite delicacy and refinement framed in a halo of chestnut curls his mouth was delicious being full without pouting the crimson lips just softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners that narrowly escaped being dimpled he had a sober grave meditative expression as if his spirit was much older than his body but when anne smiled softly at him it vanished in a sudden answering smile which seemed an illumination of his whole being as if some lamp had suddenly kindled into flame inside of him irradiating him from top to toe best of all it was involuntary born of no external effort or motive but simply the outflashing of a hidden personality rare and fine and sweet with a quick interchange of smiles anne and paul were fast friends forever before a word had passed between them  the day went by like a dream anne could never clearly recall it afterwards it almost seemed as if it were not she who was teaching but somebody else she heard classes and worked sums and set copies mechanically the children behaved quite well only two cases of discipline occurred morley andrews was caught driving a pair of trained crickets in the aisle anne stood morley on the platform for an hour and    which morley felt much more keenly     confiscated his crickets she put them in a box and on the way from school set them free in violet vale but morley believed then and ever afterwards that she took them home and kept them for her own amusement  the other culprit was anthony pye who poured the last drops of water from his slate bottle down the back of aurelia clays neck anne kept anthony in at recess and talked to him about what was expected of gentlemen admonishing him that they never poured water down ladies necks she wanted all her boys to be gentlemen she said her little lecture was quite kind and touching but unfortunately anthony remained absolutely untouched he listened to her in silence with the same sullen expression and whistled scornfully as he went out anne sighed and then cheered herself up by remembering that winning a pyes affections like the building of rome wasnt the work of a day in fact it was doubtful whether some of the pyes had any affections to win but anne hoped better things of anthony who looked as if he might be a rather nice boy if one ever got behind his sullenness  when school was dismissed and the children had gone anne dropped wearily into her chair her head ached and she felt woefully discouraged there was no real reason for discouragement since nothing very dreadful had occurred but anne was very tired and inclined to believe that she would never learn to like teaching and how terrible it would be to be doing something you didnt like every day for    well say forty years anne was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there or wait till she was safely in her own white room at home before she could decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor and anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her recall a recent criticism of mr harrisons on an overdressed female he had seen in a charlottetown store she looked like a headon collision between a fashion plate and a nightmare  the newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk puffed frilled and shirred wherever puff frill or shirring could possibly be placed her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat bedecked with three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers a veil of pink chiffon lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots hung like a flounce from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers behind her she wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small woman and a very strong odor of perfume attended her  i am mrs donnell    mrs h b donnell announced this vision and i have come in to see you about something clarice almira told me when she came home to dinner today it annoyed me excessively  im sorry faltered anne vainly trying to recollect any incident of the morning connected with the donnell children  clarice almira told me that you pronounced our name donnell now miss shirley the correct pronunciation of our name is donnell     accent on the last syllable i hope youll remember this in future  ill try to gasped anne choking back a wild desire to laugh i know by experience that its very unpleasant to have ones name spelled wrong and i suppose it must be even worse to have it pronounced wrong  certainly it is and clarice almira also informed me that you call my son jacob  he told me his name was jacob protested anne  i might well have expected that said mrs h b donnell in a tone which implied that gratitude in children was not to be looked for in this degenerate age that boy has such plebeian tastes miss shirley when he was born i wanted to call him st clair     it sounds so aristocratic doesnt it but his father insisted he should be called jacob after his uncle i yielded because uncle jacob was a rich old bachelor and what do you think miss shirley when our innocent boy was five years old uncle jacob actually went and got married and now he has three boys of his own did you ever hear of such ingratitude the moment the invitation to the wedding    for he had the impertinence to send us an invitation miss shirley    came to the house i said no more jacobs for me thank you from that day i called my son st clair and st clair i am determined he shall be called his father obstinately continues to call him jacob and the boy himself has a perfectly unaccountable preference for the vulgar name but st clair he is and st clair he shall remain you will kindly remember this miss shirley will you not thank you i told clarice almira that i was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right donnell   accent on the last syllable    and st clair    on no account jacob youll remember thank you  when mrs h b donnell had skimmed away anne locked the school door and went home at the foot of the hill she found paul irving by the birch path he held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which avonlea children called rice lillies  please teacher i found these in mr wrights field he said shyly and i came back to give them to you because i thought you were the kind of lady that would like them and because    he lifted his big beautiful eyes    i like you teacher  you darling said anne taking the fragrant spikes as if pauls words had been a spell of magic discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain she went through the birch path lightfootedly attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction  well how did you get along marilla wanted to know  ask me that a month later and i may be able to tell you i cant now    i dont know myself    im too near it my thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy the only thing i feel really sure of having accomplished today is that i taught cliffie wright that a is a he never knew it before isnt it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in shakespeare and paradise lost  mrs lynde came up later on with more encouragement that good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher  and every one of them said they liked you splendid anne except anthony pye i must admit he didnt he said you werent any good just like all girl teachers theres the pye leaven for you but never mind  im not going to mind said anne quietly and im going to make anthony pye like me yet patience and kindness will surely win him  well you can never tell about a pye said mrs rachel cautiously they go by contraries like dreams often as not as for that donnell woman shell get no donnelling from me i can assure you the name is donnell and always has been the woman is crazy thats what she has a pug dog she calls queenie and it has its meals at the table along with the family eating off a china plate id be afraid of a judgment if i was her thomas says donnell himself is a sensible hardworking man but he hadnt much gumption when he picked out a wife thats what     vi  all sorts and conditions of men    and women   a september day on prince edward island hills a crisp wind blowing up over the sand dunes from the sea a long red road winding through fields and woods now looping itself about a corner of thick set spruces now threading a plantation of young maples with great feathery sheets of ferns beneath them now dipping down into a hollow where a brook flashed out of the woods and into them again now basking in open sunshine between ribbons of goldenrod and smokeblue asters air athrill with the pipings of myriads of crickets those glad little pensioners of the summer hills a plump brown pony ambling along the road two girls behind him full to the lips with the simple priceless joy of youth and life  oh this is a day left over from eden isnt it diana    and anne sighed for sheer happiness the air has magic in it look at the purple in the cup of the harvest valley diana and oh do smell the dying fir its coming up from that little sunny hollow where mr eben wright has been cutting fence poles bliss is it on such a day to be alive but to smell dying fir is very heaven thats two thirds wordsworth and one third anne shirley it doesnt seem possible that there should be dying fir in heaven does it and yet it doesnt seem to me that heaven would be quite perfect if you couldnt get a whiff of dead fir as you went through its woods perhaps well have the odor there without the death yes i think that will be the way that delicious aroma must be the souls of the firs    and of course it will be just souls in heaven  trees havent souls said practical diana but the smell of dead fir is certainly lovely im going to make a cushion and fill it with fir needles youd better make one too anne  i think i shall    and use it for my naps id be certain to dream i was a dryad or a woodnymph then but just this minute im well content to be anne shirley avonlea schoolmaam driving over a road like this on such a sweet friendly day  its a lovely day but we have anything but a lovely task before us sighed diana why on earth did you offer to canvass this road anne almost all the cranks in avonlea live along it and well probably be treated as if we were begging for ourselves its the very worst road of all  that is why i chose it of course gilbert and fred would have taken this road if we had asked them but you see diana i feel myself responsible for the avis since i was the first to suggest it and it seems to me that i ought to do the most disagreeable things im sorry on your account but you neednt say a word at the cranky places ill do all the talking     mrs lynde would say i was well able to mrs lynde doesnt know whether to approve of our enterprise or not she inclines to when she remembers that mr and mrs allan are in favor of it but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in the states is a count against it so she is halting between two opinions and only success will justify us in mrs lyndes eyes priscilla is going to write a paper for our next improvement meeting and i expect it will be good for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs in the family i shall never forget the thrill it gave me when i found out that mrs charlotte e morgan was priscillas aunt it seemed so wonderful that i was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote edgewood days and the rosebud garden  where does mrs morgan live  in toronto and priscilla says she is coming to the island for a visit next summer and if it is possible priscilla is going to arrange to have us meet her that seems almost too good to be truebut its something pleasant to imagine after you go to bed  the avonlea village improvement society was an organized fact gilbert blythe was president fred wright vicepresident anne shirley secretary and diana barry treasurer the improvers as they were promptly christened were to meet once a fortnight at the homes of the members it was admitted that they could not expect to affect many improvements so late in the season but they meant to plan the next summers campaign collect and discuss ideas write and read papers and as anne said educate the public sentiment generally  there was some disapproval of course and    which the improvers felt much more keenly    a good deal of ridicule mr elisha wright was reported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization would be courting club mrs hiram sloane declared she had heard the improvers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with geraniums mr levi boulter warned his neighbors that the improvers would insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after plans approved by the society mr james spencer sent them word that he wished they would kindly shovel down the church hill eben wright told anne that he wished the improvers could induce old josiah sloane to keep his whiskers trimmed mr lawrence bell said he would whitewash his barns if nothing else would please them but he would not hang lace curtains in the cowstable windows mr major spencer asked clifton sloane an improver who drove the milk to the carmody cheese factory if it was true that everybody would have to have his milkstand handpainted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it  in spite of    or perhaps human nature being what it is because of    this the society went gamely to work at the only improvement they could hope to bring about that fall at the second meeting in the barry parlor oliver sloane moved that they start a subscription to reshingle and paint the hall julia bell seconded it with an uneasy feeling that she was doing something not exactly ladylike gilbert put the motion it was carried unanimously and anne gravely recorded it in her minutes the next thing was to appoint a committee and gertie pye determined not to let julia bell carry off all the laurels boldly moved that miss jane andrews be chairman of said committee this motion being also duly seconded and carried jane returned the compliment by appointing gertie on the committee along with gilbert anne diana and fred wright the committee chose their routes in private conclave anne and diana were told off for the newbridge road gilbert and fred for the white sands road and jane and gertie for the carmody road  because explained gilbert to anne as they walked home together through the haunted wood the pyes all live along that road and they wont give a cent unless one of themselves canvasses them  the next saturday anne and diana started out they drove to the end of the road and canvassed homeward calling first on the andrew girls  if catherine is alone we may get something said diana but if eliza is there we wont  eliza was there    very much so    and looked even grimmer than usual miss eliza was one of those people who give you the impression that life is indeed a vale of tears and that a smile never to speak of a laugh is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible the andrew girls had been girls for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain girls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage catherine it was said had not entirely given up hope but eliza who was born a pessimist had never had any they lived in a little brown house built in a sunny corner scooped out of mark andrews beech woods eliza complained that it was terrible hot in summer but catherine was wont to say it was lovely and warm in winter  eliza was sewing patchwork not because it was needed but simply as a protest against the frivolous lace catherine was crocheting eliza listened with a frown and catherine with a smile as the girls explained their errand to be sure whenever catherine caught elizas eye she discarded the smile in guilty confusion but it crept back the next moment  if i had money to waste said eliza grimly id burn it up and have the fun of seeing a blaze maybe but i wouldnt give it to that hall not a cent its no benefit to the settlement    just a place for young folks to meet and carry on when theys better be home in their beds  oh eliza young folks must have some amusement protested catherine  i dont see the necessity we didnt gad about to halls and places when we were young catherine andrews this world is getting worse every day  i think its getting better said catherine firmly  you think miss elizas voice expressed the utmost contempt it doesnt signify what you think catherine andrews facts is facts  well i always like to look on the bright side eliza  there isnt any bright side  oh indeed there is cried anne who couldnt endure such heresy in silence why there are ever so many bright sides miss andrews its really a beautiful world  you wont have such a high opinion of it when youve lived as long in it as i have retorted miss eliza sourly and you wont be so enthusiastic about improving it either how is your mother diana dear me but she has failed of late she looks terrible run down and how long is it before marilla expects to be stone blind anne  the doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very careful faltered anne  eliza shook her head  doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up i wouldnt have much hope if i was her its best to be prepared for the worst  but oughtnt we be prepared for the best too pleaded anne its just as likely to happen as the worst  not in my experience and ive fiftyseven years to set against your sixteen retorted eliza going are you well i hope this new society of yours will be able to keep avonlea from running any further down hill but i havent much hope of it  anne and diana got themselves thankfully out and drove away as fast as the fat pony could go as they rounded the curve below the beech wood a plump figure came speeding over mr andrews pasture waving to them excitedly it was catherine andrews and she was so out of breath that she could hardly speak but she thrust a couple of quarters into annes hand  thats my contribution to painting the hall she gasped id like to give you a dollar but i dont dare take more from my egg money for eliza would find it out if i did im real interested in your society and i believe youre going to do a lot of good im an optimist i have to be living with eliza i must hurry back before she misses me    she thinks im feeding the hens i hope youll have good luck canvassing and dont be cast down over what eliza said the world is getting better    it certainly is  the next house was daniel blairs  now it all depends on whether his wife is home or not said diana as they jolted along a deeprutted lane if she is we wont get a cent everybody says dan blair doesnt dare have his hair cut without asking her permission and its certain shes very close to state it moderately she says she has to be just before shes generous but mrs lynde says shes so much before that generosity never catches up with her at all  anne related their experience at the blair place to marilla that evening  we tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry going on dreadfully we couldnt make out the words but diana says she knows they were swearing by the sound of them i cant believe that of mr blair for he is always so quiet and meek but at least he had great provocation for marilla when that poor man came to the door red as a beet with perspiration streaming down his face he had on one of his wifes big gingham aprons i cant get this durned thing off he said for the strings are tied in a hard knot and i cant bust em so youll have to excuse me ladies we begged him not to mention it and went in and sat down mr blair sat down too he twisted the apron around to his back and rolled it up but he did look so ashamed and worried that i felt sorry for him and diana said she feared we had called at an inconvenient time oh not at all said mr blair trying to smile    you know he is always very polite    im a little busy    getting ready to bake a cake as it were my wife got a telegram today that her sister from montreal is coming tonight and shes gone to the train to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea she writ out the recipe and told me what to do but ive clean forgot half the directions already and it says flavor according to taste what does that mean how can you tell and what if my taste doesnt happen to be other peoples taste would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake  i felt sorrier than ever for the poor man he didnt seem to be in his proper sphere at all i had heard of henpecked husbands and now i felt that i saw one it was on my lips to say mr blair if youll give us a subscription for the hall ill mix up your cake for you but i suddenly thought it wouldnt be neighborly to drive too sharp a bargain with a fellow creature in distress so i offered to mix the cake for him without any conditions at all he just jumped at my offer he said hed been used to making his own bread before he was married but he feared cake was beyond him and yet he hated to disappoint his wife he got me another apron and diana beat the eggs and i mixed the cake mr blair ran about and got us the materials he had forgotten all about his apron and when he ran it streamed out behind him and diana said she thought she would die to see it he said he could bake the cake all right    he was used to that    and then he asked for our list and he put down four dollars so you see we were rewarded but even if he hadnt given a cent id always feel that we had done a truly christian act in helping him  theodore whites was the next stopping place neither anne nor diana had ever been there before and they had only a very slight acquaintance with mrs theodore who was not given to hospitality should they go to the back or front door while they held a whispered consultation mrs theodore appeared at the front door with an armful of newspapers deliberately she laid them down one by one on the porch floor and the porch steps and then down the path to the very feet of her mystified callers  will you please wipe your feet carefully on the grass and then walk on these papers she said anxiously ive just swept the house all over and i cant have any more dust tracked in the paths been real muddy since the rain yesterday  dont you dare laugh warned anne in a whisper as they marched along the newspapers and i implore you diana not to look at me no matter what she says or i shall not be able to keep a sober face  the papers extended across the hall and into a prim fleckless parlor anne and diana sat down gingerly on the nearest chairs and explained their errand mrs white heard them politely interrupting only twice once to chase out an adventurous fly and once to pick up a tiny wisp of grass that had fallen on the carpet from annes dress anne felt wretchedly guilty but mrs white subscribed two dollars and paid the money down    to prevent us from having to go back for it diana said when they got away mrs white had the newspapers gathered up before they had their horse untied and as they drove out of the yard they saw her busily wielding a broom in the hall  ive always heard that mrs theodore white was the neatest woman alive and ill believe it after this said diana giving way to her suppressed laughter as soon as it was safe  i am glad she has no children said anne solemnly it would be dreadful beyond words for them if she had  at the spencers mrs isabella spencer made them miserable by saying something illnatured about everyone in avonlea mr thomas boulter refused to give anything because the hall when it had been built twenty years before hadnt been built on the site he recommended mrs esther bell who was the picture of health took half an hour to detail all her aches and pains and sadly put down fifty cents because she wouldnt be there that time next year to do it    no she would be in her grave  their worst reception however was at simon fletchers when they drove into the yard they saw two faces peering at them through the porch window but although they rapped and waited patiently and persistently nobody came to the door two decidedly ruffled and indignant girls drove away from simon fletchers even anne admitted that she was beginning to feel discouraged but the tide turned after that several sloane homesteads came next where they got liberal subscriptions and from that to the end they fared well with only an occasional snub their last place of call was at robert dicksons by the pond bridge they stayed to tea here although they were nearly home rather than risk offending mrs dickson who had the reputation of being a very touchy woman  while they were there old mrs james white called in  ive just been down to lorenzos she announced hes the proudest man in avonlea this minute what do you think theres a brand new boy there    and after seven girls thats quite an event i can tell you anne pricked up her ears and when they drove away she said  im going straight to lorenzo whites  but he lives on the white sands road and its quite a distance out of our way protested diana gilbert and fred will canvass him  they are not going around until next saturday and it will be too late by then said anne firmly the novelty will be worn off lorenzo white is dreadfully mean but he will subscribe to anything just now we mustnt let such a golden opportunity slip diana the result justified annes foresight mr white met them in the yard beaming like the sun upon an easter day when anne asked for a subscription he agreed enthusiastically  certain certain just put me down for a dollar more than the highest subscription youve got  that will be five dollars    mr daniel blair put down four said anne half afraid but lorenzo did not flinch  five it is    and heres the money on the spot now i want you to come into the house theres something in there worth seeing    something very few people have seen as yet just come in and pass your opinion  what will we say if the baby isnt pretty whispered diana in trepidation as they followed the excited lorenzo into the house  oh there will certainly be something else nice to say about it said anne easily there always is about a baby  the baby was pretty however and mr white felt that he got his five dollars worth of the girls honest delight over the plump little newcomer but that was the first last and only time that lorenzo white ever subscribed to anything  anne tired as she was made one more effort for the public weal that night slipping over the fields to interview mr harrison who was as usual smoking his pipe on the veranda with ginger beside him strickly speaking he was on the carmody road but jane and gertie who were not acquainted with him save by doubtful report had nervously begged anne to canvass him  mr harrison however flatly refused to subscribe a cent and all annes wiles were in vain  but i thought you approved of our society mr harrison she mourned  so i do    so i do    but my approval doesnt go as deep as my pocket anne  a few more experiences such as i have had today would make me as much of a pessimist as miss eliza andrews anne told her reflection in the east gable mirror at bedtime     vii  the pointing of duty   anne leaned back in her chair one mild october evening and sighed she was sitting at a table covered with text books and exercises but the closely written sheets of paper before her had no apparent connection with studies or school work  what is the matter asked gilbert who had arrived at the open kitchen door just in time to hear the sigh  anne colored and thrust her writing out of sight under some school compositions  nothing very dreadful i was just trying to write out some of my thoughts as professor hamilton advised me but i couldnt get them to please me they seem so still and foolish directly theyre written down on white paper with black ink fancies are like shadows     you cant cage them theyre such wayward dancing things but perhaps ill learn the secret some day if i keep on trying i havent a great many spare moments you know by the time i finish correcting school exercises and compositions i dont always feel like writing any of my own  you are getting on splendidly in school anne all the children like you said gilbert sitting down on the stone step  no not all anthony pye doesnt and wont like me what is worse he doesnt respect me    no he doesnt he simply holds me in contempt and i dont mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably it isnt that he is so very bad    he is only rather mischievous but no worse than some of the others he seldom disobeys me but he obeys with a scornful air of toleration as if it wasnt worthwhile disputing the point or he would    and it has a bad effect on the others ive tried every way to win him but im beginning to fear i never shall i want to for hes rather a cute little lad if he is a pye and i could like him if hed let me  probably its merely the effect of what he hears at home  not altogether anthony is an independent little chap and makes up his own mind about things he has always gone to men before and he says girl teachers are no good well well see what patience and kindness will do i like overcoming difficulties and teaching is really very interesting work paul irving makes up for all that is lacking in the others that child is a perfect darling gilbert and a genius into the bargain im persuaded the world will hear of him some day concluded anne in a tone of conviction  i like teaching too said gilbert its good training for one thing why anne ive learned more in the weeks ive been teaching the young ideas of white sands than i learned in all the years i went to school myself we all seem to be getting on pretty well the newbridge people like jane i hear and i think white sands is tolerably satisfied with your humble servant    all except mr andrew spencer i met mrs peter blewett on my way home last night and she told me she thought it her duty to inform me that mr spencer didnt approve of my methods  have you ever noticed asked anne reflectively that when people say it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for something disagreeable why is it that they never seem to think it a duty to tell you the pleasant things they hear about you mrs h b donnell called at the school again yesterday and told me she thought it her duty to inform me that mrs harmon andrew didnt approve of my reading fairy tales to the children and that mr rogerson thought prillie wasnt coming on fast enough in arithmetic if prillie would spend less time making eyes at the boys over her slate she might do better i feel quite sure that jack gillis works her class sums for her though ive never been able to catch him redhanded  have you succeeded in reconciling mrs donnells hopeful son to his saintly name  yes laughed anne but it was really a difficult task at first when i called him st clair he would not take the least notice until id spoken two or three times and then when the other boys nudged him he would look up with such an aggrieved air as if id called him john or charlie and he couldnt be expected to know i meant him so i kept him in after school one night and talked kindly to him i told him his mother wished me to call him st clair and i couldnt go against her wishes he saw it when it was all explained out    hes really a very reasonable little fellow    and he said i could call him st clair but that hed lick the stuffing out of any of the boys that tried it of course i had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language since then i call him st clair and the boys call him jake and all goes smoothly he informs me that he means to be a carpenter but mrs donnell says i am to make a college professor out of him  the mention of college gave a new direction to gilberts thoughts and they talked for a time of their plans and wishes    gravely earnestly hopefully as youth loves to talk while the future is yet an untrodden path full of wonderful possibilities  gilbert had finally made up his mind that he was going to be a doctor  its a splendid profession he said enthusiastically a fellow has to fight something all through life    didnt somebody once define man as a fighting animal    and i want to fight disease and pain and ignorance    which are all members one of another i want to do my share of honest real work in the world anne     add a little to the sum of human knowledge that all the good men have been accumulating since it began the folks who lived before me have done so much for me that i want to show my gratitude by doing something for the folks who will live after me it seems to me that is the only way a fellow can get square with his obligations to the race  id like to add some beauty to life said anne dreamily i dont exactly want to make people know more    though i know that is the noblest ambition    but id love to make them have a pleasanter time because of me    to have some little joy or happy thought that would never have existed if i hadnt been born  i think youre fulfilling that ambition every day said gilbert admiringly  and he was right anne was one of the children of light by birthright after she had passed through a life with a smile or a word thrown across it like a gleam of sunshine the owner of that life saw it for the time being at least as hopeful and lovely and of good report  finally gilbert rose regretfully  well i must run up to macphersons moody spurgeon came home from queens today for sunday and he was to bring me out a book professor boyd is lending me  and i must get marillas tea she went to see mrs keith this evening and she will soon be back  anne had tea ready when marilla came home the fire was crackling cheerily a vase of frostbleached ferns and rubyred maple leaves adorned the table and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air but marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh  are your eyes troubling you does your head ache queried anne anxiously  no im only tired    and worried its about mary and those children     mary is worse    she cant last much longer and as for the twins i dont know what is to become of them  hasnt their uncle been heard from  yes mary had a letter from him hes working in a lumber camp and shacking it whatever that means anyway he says he cant possibly take the children till the spring he expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter she says she cant bear to ask any of them mary never got on any too well with the east grafton people and thats a fact and the long and short of it is anne that im sure mary wants me to take those children    she didnt say so but she looked it  oh anne clasped her hands all athrill with excitement and of course you will marilla wont you  i havent made up my mind said marilla rather tartly i dont rush into things in your headlong way anne third cousinship is a pretty slim claim and it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after    twins at that  marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children  twins are very interesting    at least one pair of them said anne its only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous and i think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when im away in school  i dont reckon thered be much amusement in it    more worry and bother than anything else i should say it wouldnt be so risky if they were even as old as you were when i took you i wouldnt mind dora so much    she seems good and quiet but that davy is a limb  anne was fond of children and her heart yearned over the keith twins the remembrance of her own neglected childhood was very vivid with her still she knew that marillas only vulnerable point was her stern devotion to what she believed to be her duty and anne skillfully marshalled her arguments along this line  if davy is naughty its all the more reason why he should have good training isnt it marilla if we dont take them we dont know who will nor what kind of influences may surround them suppose mrs keiths next door neighbors the sprotts were to take them mrs lynde says henry sprott is the most profane man that ever lived and you cant believe a word his children say wouldnt it be dreadful to have the twins learn anything like that or suppose they went to the wiggins mrs lynde says that mr wiggins sells everything off the place that can be sold and brings his family up on skim milk you wouldnt like your relations to be starved even if they were only third cousins would you it seems to me marilla that it is our duty to take them  i suppose it is assented marilla gloomily i daresay ill tell mary ill take them you neednt look so delighted anne it will mean a good deal of extra work for you i cant sew a stitch on account of my eyes so youll have to see to the making and mending of their clothes and you dont like sewing  i hate it said anne calmly but if you are willing to take those children from a sense of duty surely i can do their sewing from a sense of duty it does people good to have to do things they dont like    in moderation     viii  marilla adopts twins   mrs rachel lynde was sitting at her kitchen window knitting a quilt just as she had been sitting one evening several years previously when matthew cuthbert had driven down over the hill with what mrs rachel called his imported orphan but that had been in springtime and this was late autumn and all the woods were leafless and the fields sere and brown the sun was just setting with a great deal of purple and golden pomp behind the dark woods west of avonlea when a buggy drawn by a comfortable brown nag came down the hill mrs rachel peered at it eagerly  theres marilla getting home from the funeral she said to her husband who was lying on the kitchen lounge thomas lynde lay more on the lounge nowadays than he had been used to do but mrs rachel who was so sharp at noticing anything beyond her own household had not as yet noticed this and shes got the twins with her    yes theres davy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the ponys tail and marilla jerking him back doras sitting up on the seat as prim as you please she always looks as if shed just been starched and ironed well poor marilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake still i dont see that she could do anything less than take them under the circumstances and shell have anne to help her annes tickled to death over the whole business and she has a real knacky way with children i must say dear me it doesnt seem a day since poor matthew brought anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of marilla bringing up a child and now she has adopted twins youre never safe from being surprised till youre dead  the fat pony jogged over the bridge in lyndes hollow and along the green gables lane marillas face was rather grim it was ten miles from east grafton and davy keith seemed to be possessed with a passion for perpetual motion it was beyond marillas power to make him sit still and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall over the back of the wagon and break his neck or tumble over the dashboard under the ponys heels in despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when she got him home whereupon davy climbed into her lap regardless of the reins flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bearlike hug  i dont believe you mean it he said smacking her wrinkled cheek affectionately you dont look like a lady whod whip a little boy just cause he couldnt keep still didnt you find it awful hard to keep still when you was only s old as me  no i always kept still when i was told said marilla trying to speak sternly albeit she felt her heart waxing soft within her under davys impulsive caresses  well i spose that was cause you was a girl said davy squirming back to his place after another hug you was a girl once i spose though its awful funny to think of it dora can sit still    but there aint much fun in it i dont think seems to me it must be slow to be a girl here dora let me liven you up a bit  davys method of livening up was to grasp doras curls in his fingers and give them a tug dora shrieked and then cried  how can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her grave this very day demanded marilla despairingly  but she was glad to die said davy confidentially i know cause she told me so she was awful tired of being sick wed a long talk the night before she died she told me you was going to take me and dora for the winter and i was to be a good boy im going to be good but cant you be good running round just as well as sitting still and she said i was always to be kind to dora and stand up for her and im going to  do you call pulling her hair being kind to her  well i aint going to let anybody else pull it said davy doubling up his fists and frowning theyd just better try it i didnt hurt her much    she just cried cause shes a girl im glad im a boy but im sorry im a twin when jimmy sprotts sister conterdicks him he just says im oldern you so of course i know better and that settles her but i cant tell dora that and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me you might let me drive the geegee for a spell since im a man  altogether marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out dora submitted calmly to be kissed but davy responded to annes welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement im mr davy keith  at the supper table dora behaved like a little lady but davys manners left much to be desired  im so hungry i aint got time to eat plitely he said when marilla reproved him dora aint half as hungry as i am look at all the excise i took on the road here that cakes awful nice and plummy we havent had any cake at home for evern ever so long cause mother was too sick to make it and mrs sprott said it was as much as she could do to bake our bread for us and mrs wiggins never puts any plums in her cakes catch her can i have another piece  marilla would have refused but anne cut a generous second slice however she reminded davy that he ought to say thank you for it davy merely grinned at her and took a huge bite when he had finished the slice he said  if youll give me another piece ill say thank you for it  no you have had plenty of cake said marilla in a tone which anne knew and davy was to learn to be final  davy winked at anne and then leaning over the table snatched doras first piece of cake from which she had just taken one dainty little bite out of her very fingers and opening his mouth to the fullest extent crammed the whole slice in doras lip trembled and marilla was speechless with horror anne promptly exclaimed with her best schoolmaam air  oh davy gentlemen dont do things like that  i know they dont said davy as soon as he could speak but i aint a gemplum  but dont you want to be said shocked anne  course i do but you cant be a gemplum till you grow up  oh indeed you can anne hastened to say thinking she saw a chance to sow good seed betimes you can begin to be a gentleman when you are a little boy and gentlemen never snatch things from ladies     or forget to say thank you    or pull anybodys hair  they dont have much fun thats a fact said davy frankly i guess ill wait till im grown up to be one  marilla with a resigned air had cut another piece of cake for dora she did not feel able to cope with davy just then it had been a hard day for her what with the funeral and the long drive at that moment she looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done credit to eliza andrews herself  the twins were not noticeably alike although both were fair dora had long sleek curls that never got out of order davy had a crop of fuzzy little yellow ringlets all over his round head doras hazel eyes were gentle and mild davys were as roguish and dancing as an elfs doras nose was straight davys a positive snub dora had a prunes and prisms mouth davys was all smiles and besides he had a dimple in one cheek and none in the other which gave him a dear comical lopsided look when he laughed mirth and mischief lurked in every corner of his little face  theyd better go to bed said marilla who thought it was the easiest way to dispose of them dora will sleep with me and you can put davy in the west gable youre not afraid to sleep alone are you davy  no but i aint going to bed for ever so long yet said davy comfortably  oh yes you are that was all the muchtried marilla said but something in her tone squelched even davy he trotted obediently upstairs with anne  when im grown up the very first thing im going to do is stay up all night just to see what it would be like he told her confidentially  in after years marilla never thought of that first week of the twins sojourn at green gables without a shiver not that it really was so much worse than the weeks that followed it but it seemed so by reason of its novelty there was seldom a waking minute of any day when davy was not in mischief or devising it but his first notable exploit occurred two days after his arrival on sunday morning    a fine warm day as hazy and mild as september anne dressed him for church while marilla attended to dora davy at first objected strongly to having his face washed  marilla washed it yesterday    and mrs wiggins scoured me with hard soap the day of the funeral thats enough for one week i dont see the good of being so awful clean its lots more comfable being dirty  paul irving washes his face every day of his own accord said anne astutely  davy had been an inmate of green gables for little over fortyeight hours but he already worshipped anne and hated paul irving whom he had heard anne praising enthusiastically the day after his arrival if paul irving washed his face every day that settled it he davy keith would do it too if it killed him the same consideration induced him to submit meekly to the other details of his toilet and he was really a handsome little lad when all was done anne felt an almost maternal pride in him as she led him into the old cuthbert pew  davy behaved quite well at first being occupied in casting covert glances at all the small boys within view and wondering which was paul irving the first two hymns and the scripture reading passed off uneventfully mr allan was praying when the sensation came  lauretta white was sitting in front of davy her head slightly bent and her fair hair hanging in two long braids between which a tempting expanse of white neck showed encased in a loose lace frill lauretta was a fat placidlooking child of eight who had conducted herself irreproachably in church from the very first day her mother carried her there an infant of six months  davy thrust his hand into his pocket and produced    a caterpillar a furry squirming caterpillar marilla saw and clutched at him but she was too late davy dropped the caterpillar down laurettas neck  right into the middle of mr allans prayer burst a series of piercing shrieks the minister stopped appalled and opened his eyes every head in the congregation flew up lauretta white was dancing up and down in her pew clutching frantically at the back of her dress  ow    mommer    mommer    ow    take it off    ow    get it out    ow    that bad boy put it down my neck    ow    mommer    its going further down    ow    ow    ow     mrs white rose and with a set face carried the hysterical writhing lauretta out of church her shrieks died away in the distance and mr allan proceeded with the service but everybody felt that it was a failure that day for the first time in her life marilla took no notice of the text and anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification  when they got home marilla put davy to bed and made him stay there for the rest of the day she would not give him any dinner but allowed him a plain tea of bread and milk anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully by him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish but annes mournful eyes troubled him  i spose he said reflectively that paul irving wouldnt have dropped a caterpillar down a girls neck in church would he  indeed he wouldnt said anne sadly  well im kind of sorry i did it then conceded davy but it was such a jolly big caterpillar    i picked him up on the church steps just as we went in it seemed a pity to waste him and say wasnt it fun to hear that girl yell  tuesday afternoon the aid society met at green gables anne hurried home from school for she knew that marilla would need all the assistance she could give dora neat and proper in her nicely starched white dress and black sash was sitting with the members of the aid in the parlor speaking demurely when spoken to keeping silence when not and in every way comporting herself as a model child davy blissfully dirty was making mud pies in the barnyard  i told him he might said marilla wearily i thought it would keep him out of worse mischief he can only get dirty at that well have our teas over before we call him to his dora can have hers with us but i would never dare to let davy sit down at the table with all the aids here  when anne went to call the aids to tea she found that dora was not in the parlor mrs jasper bell said davy had come to the front door and called her out a hasty consultation with marilla in the pantry resulted in a decision to let both children have their teas together later on  tea was half over when the dining room was invaded by a forlorn figure marilla and anne stared in dismay the aids in amazement could that be dora    that sobbing nondescript in a drenched dripping dress and hair from which the water was streaming on marillas new coinspot rug  dora what has happened to you cried anne with a guilty glance at mrs jasper bell whose family was said to be the only one in the world in which accidents never occurred  davy made me walk the pigpen fence wailed dora i didnt want to but he called me a fraidcat and i fell off into the pigpen and my dress got all dirty and the pig runned right over me my dress was just awful but davy said if id stand under the pump hed wash it clean and i did and he pumped water all over me but my dress aint a bit cleaner and my pretty sash and shoes is all spoiled  anne did the honors of the table alone for the rest of the meal while marilla went upstairs and redressed dora in her old clothes davy was caught and sent to bed without any supper anne went to his room at twilight and talked to him seriously    a method in which she had great faith not altogether unjustified by results she told him she felt very badly over his conduct  i feel sorry now myself admitted davy but the trouble is i never feel sorry for doing things till after ive did them dora wouldnt help me make pies cause she was afraid of messing her cloes and that made me hopping mad i spose paul irving wouldnt have made his sister walk a pigpen fence if he knew shed fall in  no he would never dream of such a thing paul is a perfect little gentleman  davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time then he crawled up and put his arms about annes neck snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder  anne dont you like me a little bit even if i aint a good boy like paul  indeed i do said anne sincerely somehow it was impossible to help liking davy but id like you better still if you werent so naughty  i    did something else today went on davy in a muffled voice im sorry now but im awful scared to tell you you wont be very cross will you and you wont tell marilla will you  i dont know davy perhaps i ought to tell her but i think i can promise you i wont if you promise me that you will never do it again whatever it is  no i never will anyhow its not likely id find any more of them this year i found this one on the cellar steps  davy what is it youve done  i put a toad in marillas bed you can go and take it out if you like but say anne wouldnt it be fun to leave it there  davy keith anne sprang from davys clinging arms and flew across the hall to marillas room the bed was slightly rumpled she threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad blinking at her from under a pillow  how can i carry that awful thing out moaned anne with a shudder the fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while marilla was busy in the pantry anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall when she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief  if marilla knew shed never feel safe getting into bed again in her life im so glad that little sinner repented in time theres diana signaling to me from her window im glad    i really feel the need of some diversion for what with anthony pye in school and davy keith at home my nerves have had about all they can endure for one day     ix  a question of color   that old nuisance of a rachel lynde was here again today pestering me for a subscription towards buying a carpet for the vestry room said mr harrison wrathfully i detest that woman more than anybody i know she can put a whole sermon text comment and application into six words and throw it at you like a brick  anne who was perched on the edge of the veranda enjoying the charm of a mild west wind blowing across a newly ploughed field on a gray november twilight and piping a quaint little melody among the twisted firs below the garden turned her dreamy face over her shoulder  the trouble is you and mrs lynde dont understand one another she explained that is always what is wrong when people dont like each other i didnt like mrs lynde at first either but as soon as i came to understand her i learned to  mrs lynde may be an acquired taste with some folks but i didnt keep on eating bananas because i was told id learn to like them if i did growled mr harrison and as for understanding her i understand that she is a confirmed busybody and i told her so  oh that must have hurt her feelings very much said anne reproachfully how could you say such a thing i said some dreadful things to mrs lynde long ago but it was when i had lost my temper i couldnt say them deliberately  it was the truth and i believe in telling the truth to everybody  but you dont tell the whole truth objected anne you only tell the disagreeable part of the truth now youve told me a dozen times that my hair was red but youve never once told me that i had a nice nose  i daresay you know it without any telling chuckled mr harrison  i know i have red hair too    although its much darker than it used to be    so theres no need of telling me that either  well well ill try and not mention it again since youre so sensitive you must excuse me anne ive got a habit of being outspoken and folks mustnt mind it  but they cant help minding it and i dont think its any help that its your habit what would you think of a person who went about sticking pins and needles into people and saying excuse me you mustnt mind it    its just a habit ive got youd think he was crazy wouldnt you and as for mrs lynde being a busybody perhaps she is but did you tell her she had a very kind heart and always helped the poor and never said a word when timothy cotton stole a crock of butter out of her dairy and told his wife hed bought it from her mrs cotton cast it up to her the next time they met that it tasted of turnips and mrs lynde just said she was sorry it had turned out so poorly  i suppose she has some good qualities conceded mr harrison grudgingly most folks have i have some myself though you might never suspect it but anyhow i aint going to give anything to that carpet folks are everlasting begging for money here it seems to me hows your project of painting the hall coming on  splendidly we had a meeting of the avis last friday night and found that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and shingle the roof too most people gave very liberally mr harrison  anne was a sweetsouled lass but she could instill some venom into innocent italics when occasion required  what color are you going to have it  we have decided on a very pretty green the roof will be dark red of course mr roger pye is going to get the paint in town today  whos got the job  mr joshua pye of carmody he has nearly finished the shingling we had to give him the contract for every one of the pyes     and there are four families you know    said they wouldnt give a cent unless joshua got it they had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought that was too much to lose although some people think we shouldnt have given in to the pyes mrs lynde says they try to run everything  the main question is will this joshua do his work well if he does i dont see that it matters whether his name is pye or pudding  he has the reputation of being a good workman though they say hes a very peculiar man he hardly ever talks  hes peculiar enough all right then said mr harrison drily or at least folks here will call him so i never was much of a talker till i came to avonlea and then i had to begin in selfdefense or mrs lynde would have said i was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught sign language youre not going yet anne  i must i have some sewing to do for dora this evening besides davy is probably breaking marillas heart with some new mischief by this time this morning the first thing he said was where does the dark go anne i want to know i told him it went around to the other side of the world but after breakfast he declared it didnt    that it went down the well marilla says she caught him hanging over the wellbox four times today trying to reach down to the dark  hes a limb declared mr harrison he came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of gingers tail before i could get in from the barn the poor bird has been moping ever since those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks  everything thats worth having is some trouble said anne secretly resolving to forgive davys next offence whatever it might be since he had avenged her on ginger  mr roger pye brought the hall paint home that night and mr joshua pye a surly taciturn man began painting the next day he was not disturbed in his task the hall was situated on what was called the lower road in late autumn this road was always muddy and wet and people going to carmody traveled by the longer upper road the hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it mr joshua pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart  friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to carmody soon after his departure mrs rachel lynde drove by having braved the mud of the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its new coat of paint when she rounded the spruce curve she saw  the sight affected mrs lynde oddly she dropped the reins held up her hands and said gracious providence she stared as if she could not believe her eyes then she laughed almost hysterically  there must be some mistake    there must i knew those pyes would make a mess of things  mrs lynde drove home meeting several people on the road and stopping to tell them about the hall the news flew like wildfire gilbert blythe poring over a text book at home heard it from his fathers hired boy at sunset and rushed breathlessly to green gables joined on the way by fred wright they found diana barry jane andrews and anne shirley despair personified at the yard gate of green gables under the big leafless willows  it isnt true surely anne exclaimed gilbert  it is true answered anne looking like the muse of tragedy mrs lynde called on her way from carmody to tell me oh it is simply dreadful what is the use of trying to improve anything  what is dreadful asked oliver sloane arriving at this moment with a bandbox he had brought from town for marilla  havent you heard said jane wrathfully well its simply this   joshua pye has gone and painted the hall blue instead of green   a deep brilliant blue the shade they use for painting carts and wheelbarrows and mrs lynde says it is the most hideous color for a building especially when combined with a red roof that she ever saw or imagined you could simply have knocked me down with a feather when i heard it its heartbreaking after all the trouble weve had  how on earth could such a mistake have happened wailed diana  the blame of this unmerciful disaster was eventually narrowed down to the pyes the improvers had decided to use mortonharris paints and the mortonharris paint cans were numbered according to a color card a purchaser chose his shade on the card and ordered by the accompanying number number 147 was the shade of green desired and when mr roger pye sent word to the improvers by his son john andrew that he was going to town and would get their paint for them the improvers told john andrew to tell his father to get 147 john andrew always averred that he did so but mr roger pye as stanchly declared that john andrew told him 157 and there the matter stands to this day  that night there was blank dismay in every avonlea house where an improver lived the gloom at green gables was so intense that it quenched even davy anne wept and would not be comforted  i must cry even if i am almost seventeen marilla she sobbed it is so mortifying and it sounds the death knell of our society well simply be laughed out of existence  in life as in dreams however things often go by contraries the avonlea people did not laugh they were too angry their money had gone to paint the hall and consequently they felt themselves bitterly aggrieved by the mistake public indignation centered on the pyes roger pye and john andrew had bungled the matter between them and as for joshua pye he must be a born fool not to suspect there was something wrong when he opened the cans and saw the color of the paint joshua pye when thus animadverted upon retorted that the avonlea taste in colors was no business of his whatever his private opinion might be he had been hired to paint the hall not to talk about it and he meant to have his money for it  the improvers paid him his money in bitterness of spirit after consulting mr peter sloane who was a magistrate  youll have to pay it peter told him you cant hold him responsible for the mistake since he claims he was never told what the color was supposed to be but just given the cans and told to go ahead but its a burning shame and that hall certainly does look awful  the luckless improvers expected that avonlea would be more prejudiced than ever against them but instead public sympathy veered around in their favor people thought the eager enthusiastic little band who had worked so hard for their object had been badly used mrs lynde told them to keep on and show the pyes that there really were people in the world who could do things without making a muddle of them mr major spencer sent them word that he would clean out all the stumps along the road front of his farm and seed it down with grass at his own expense and mrs hiram sloane called at the school one day and beckoned anne mysteriously out into the porch to tell her that if the sassiety wanted to make a geranium bed at the crossroads in the spring they neednt be afraid of her cow for she would see that the marauding animal was kept within safe bounds even mr harrison chuckled if he chuckled at all in private and was all sympathy outwardly  never mind anne most paints fade uglier every year but that blue is as ugly as it can be to begin with so its bound to fade prettier and the roof is shingled and painted all right folks will be able to sit in the hall after this without being leaked on youve accomplished so much anyhow  but avonleas blue hall will be a byword in all the neighboring settlements from this time out said anne bitterly  and it must be confessed that it was     x  davy in search of a sensation   anne walking home from school through the birch path one november afternoon felt convinced afresh that life was a very wonderful thing the day had been a good day all had gone well in her little kingdom st clair donnell had not fought any of the other boys over the question of his name prillie rogersons face had been so puffed up from the effects of toothache that she did not once try to coquette with the boys in her vicinity barbara shaw had met with only one accident    spilling a dipper of water over the floor    and anthony pye had not been in school at all  what a nice month this november has been said anne who had never quite got over her childish habit of talking to herself november is usually such a disagreeable month    as if the year had suddenly found out that she was growing old and could do nothing but weep and fret over it this year is growing old gracefully    just like a stately old lady who knows she can be charming even with gray hair and wrinkles weve had lovely days and delicious twilights this last fortnight has been so peaceful and even davy has been almost wellbehaved i really think he is improving a great deal how quiet the woods are today     not a murmur except that soft wind purring in the treetops it sounds like surf on a faraway shore how dear the woods are you beautiful trees i love every one of you as a friend  anne paused to throw her arm about a slim young birch and kiss its creamwhite trunk diana rounding a curve in the path saw her and laughed  anne shirley youre only pretending to be grown up i believe when youre alone youre as much a little girl as you ever were  well one cant get over the habit of being a little girl all at once said anne gaily you see i was little for fourteen years and ive only been grownuppish for scarcely three im sure i shall always feel like a child in the woods these walks home from school are almost the only time i have for dreaming     except the halfhour or so before i go to sleep im so busy with teaching and studying and helping marilla with the twins that i havent another moment for imagining things you dont know what splendid adventures i have for a little while after i go to bed in the east gable every night i always imagine im something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid     a great prima donna or a red cross nurse or a queen last night i was a queen its really splendid to imagine you are a queen you have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to which you couldnt in real life but here in the woods i like best to imagine quite different things    im a dryad living in an old pine or a little brown woodelf hiding under a crinkled leaf that white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine the only difference is shes a tree and im a girl but thats no real difference where are you going diana  down to the dicksons i promised to help alberta cut out her new dress cant you walk down in the evening anne and come home with me  i might    since fred wright is away in town said anne with a rather too innocent face  diana blushed tossed her head and walked on she did not look offended however  anne fully intended to go down to the dicksons that evening but she did not when she arrived at green gables she found a state of affairs which banished every other thought from her mind marilla met her in the yard    a wildeyed marilla  anne dora is lost  dora lost anne looked at davy who was swinging on the yard gate and detected merriment in his eyes davy do you know where she is  no i dont said davy stoutly i havent seen her since dinner time cross my heart  ive been away ever since one oclock said marilla thomas lynde took sick all of a sudden and rachel sent up for me to go at once when i left here dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and davy was making mud pies behind the barn i only got home half an hour ago    and no dora to be seen davy declares he never saw her since i left  neither i did avowed davy solemnly  she must be somewhere around said anne she would never wander far away alone    you know how timid she is perhaps she has fallen asleep in one of the rooms  marilla shook her head  ive hunted the whole house through but she may be in some of the buildings  a thorough search followed every corner of house yard and outbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people anne roved the orchards and the haunted wood calling doras name marilla took a candle and explored the cellar davy accompanied each of them in turn and was fertile in thinking of places where dora could possibly be finally they met again in the yard  its a most mysterious thing groaned marilla  where can she be said anne miserably  maybe shes tumbled into the well suggested davy cheerfully  anne and marilla looked fearfully into each others eyes the thought had been with them both through their entire search but neither had dared to put it into words  she    she might have whispered marilla  anne feeling faint and sick went to the wellbox and peered over the bucket sat on the shelf inside far down below was a tiny glimmer of still water the cuthbert well was the deepest in avonlea if dora   but anne could not face the idea she shuddered and turned away  run across for mr harrison said marilla wringing her hands  mr harrison and john henry are both away    they went to town today ill go for mr barry  mr barry came back with anne carrying a coil of rope to which was attached a clawlike instrument that had been the business end of a grubbing fork marilla and anne stood by cold and shaken with horror and dread while mr barry dragged the well and davy astride the gate watched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment  finally mr barry shook his head with a relieved air  she cant be down there its a mighty curious thing where she could have got to though look here young man are you sure youve no idea where your sister is  ive told you a dozen times that i havent said davy with an injured air maybe a tramp come and stole her  nonsense said marilla sharply relieved from her horrible fear of the well anne do you suppose she could have strayed over to mr harrisons she has always been talking about his parrot ever since that time you took her over  i cant believe dora would venture so far alone but ill go over and see said anne  nobody was looking at davy just then or it would have been seen that a very decided change came over his face he quietly slipped off the gate and ran as fast as his fat legs could carry him to the barn  anne hastened across the fields to the harrison establishment in no very hopeful frame of mind the house was locked the window shades were down and there was no sign of anything living about the place she stood on the veranda and called dora loudly  ginger in the kitchen behind her shrieked and swore with sudden fierceness but between his outbursts anne heard a plaintive cry from the little building in the yard which served mr harrison as a toolhouse anne flew to the door unhasped it and caught up a small mortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned nail keg  oh dora dora what a fright you have given us how came you to be here  davy and i came over to see ginger sobbed dora but we couldnt see him after all only davy made him swear by kicking the door and then davy brought me here and run out and shut the door and i couldnt get out i cried and cried i was frightened and oh im so hungry and cold and i thought youd never come anne  davy but anne could say no more she carried dora home with a heavy heart her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in the pain caused by davys behavior the freak of shutting dora up might easily have been pardoned but davy had told falsehoods    downright coldblooded falsehoods about it that was the ugly fact and anne could not shut her eyes to it she could have sat down and cried with sheer disappointment she had grown to love davy dearly    how dearly she had not known until this minute    and it hurt her unbearably to discover that he was guilty of deliberate falsehood  marilla listened to annes tale in a silence that boded no good davyward mr barry laughed and advised that davy be summarily dealt with when he had gone home anne soothed and warmed the sobbing shivering dora got her her supper and put her to bed then she returned to the kitchen just as marilla came grimly in leading or rather pulling the reluctant cobwebby davy whom she had just found hidden away in the darkest corner of the stable  she jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and sat down by the east window anne was sitting limply by the west window between them stood the culprit his back was toward marilla and it was a meek subdued frightened back but his face was toward anne and although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship in davys eyes as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be punished for it but could count on a laugh over it all with anne later on  but no half hidden smile answered him in annes gray eyes as there might have done had it been only a question of mischief there was something else    something ugly and repulsive  how could you behave so davy she asked sorrowfully  davy squirmed uncomfortably  i just did it for fun things have been so awful quiet here for so long that i thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare it was too  in spite of fear and a little remorse davy grinned over the recollection  but you told a falsehood about it davy said anne more sorrowfully than ever  davy looked puzzled  whats a falsehood do you mean a whopper  i mean a story that was not true  course i did said davy frankly if i hadnt you wouldnt have been scared i had to tell it  anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions davys impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch two big tears brimmed up in her eyes  oh davy how could you she said with a quiver in her voice dont you know how wrong it was  davy was aghast anne crying    he had made anne cry a flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it he rushed to anne hurled himself into her lap flung his arms around her neck and burst into tears  i didnt know it was wrong to tell whoppers he sobbed how did you expect me to know it was wrong all mr sprotts children told them regular every day and cross their hearts too i spose paul irving never tells whoppers and here ive been trying awful hard to be as good as him but now i spose youll never love me again but i think you might have told me it was wrong im awful sorry ive made you cry anne and ill never tell a whopper again  davy buried his face in annes shoulder and cried stormily anne in a sudden glad flash of understanding held him tight and looked over his curly thatch at marilla  he didnt know it was wrong to tell falsehoods marilla i think we must forgive him for that part of it this time if he will promise never to say what isnt true again  i never will now that i know its bad asseverated davy between sobs if you ever catch me telling a whopper again you can    davy groped mentally for a suitable penance    you can skin me alive anne  dont say whopper davy    say falsehood said the schoolmaam  why queried davy settling comfortably down and looking up with a tearstained investigating face why aint whopper as good as falsehood i want to know its just as big a word  its slang and its wrong for little boys to use slang  theres an awful lot of things its wrong to do said davy with a sigh i never sposed there was so many im sorry its wrong to tell whop     falsehoods cause its awful handy but since it is im never going to tell any more what are you going to do to me for telling them this time i want to know anne looked beseechingly at marilla  i dont want to be too hard on the child said marilla i daresay nobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies and those sprott children were no fit companions for him poor mary was too sick to train him properly and i presume you couldnt expect a sixyearold child to know things like that by instinct i suppose well just have to assume he doesnt know anything right and begin at the beginning but hell have to be punished for shutting dora up and i cant think of any way except to send him to bed without his supper and weve done that so often cant you suggest something else anne i should think you ought to be able to with that imagination youre always talking of  but punishments are so horrid and i like to imagine only pleasant things said anne cuddling davy there are so many unpleasant things in the world already that there is no use in imagining any more  in the end davy was sent to bed as usual there to remain until noon next day he evidently did some thinking for when anne went up to her room a little later she heard him calling her name softly going in she found him sitting up in bed with his elbows on his knees and his chin propped on his hands  anne he said solemnly is it wrong for everybody to tell whop    falsehoods i want to know  yes indeed  is it wrong for a grownup person  yes  then said davy decidedly marilla is bad for she tells them and shes worsen me for i didnt know it was wrong but she does  davy keith marilla never told a story in her life said anne indignantly  she did so she told me last tuesday that something dreadful would happen to me if i didnt say my prayers every night and i havent said them for over a week just to see what would happen     and nothing has concluded davy in an aggrieved tone  anne choked back a mad desire to laugh with the conviction that it would be fatal and then earnestly set about saving marillas reputation  why davy keith she said solemnly something dreadful has happened to you this very day  davy looked sceptical  i spose you mean being sent to bed without any supper he said scornfully but that isnt dreadful course i dont like it but ive been sent to bed so much since i come here that im getting used to it and you dont save anything by making me go without supper either for i always eat twice as much for breakfast  i dont mean your being sent to bed i mean the fact that you told a falsehood today and davy    anne leaned over the footboard of the bed and shook her finger impressively at the culprit    for a boy to tell what isnt true is almost the worst thing that could happen to him    almost the very worst so you see marilla told you the truth  but i thought the something bad would be exciting protested davy in an injured tone  marilla isnt to blame for what you thought bad things arent always exciting theyre very often just nasty and stupid  it was awful funny to see marilla and you looking down the well though said davy hugging his knees  anne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed on the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached  i wish youd tell me the joke said marilla a little grimly i havent seen much to laugh at today  youll laugh when you hear this assured anne and marilla did laugh which showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of anne but she sighed immediately afterwards  i suppose i shouldnt have told him that although i heard a minister say it to a child once but he did aggravate me so it was that night you were at the carmody concert and i was putting him to bed he said he didnt see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to god anne i do not know what we are going to do with that child i never saw his beat im feeling clean discouraged  oh dont say that marilla remember how bad i was when i came here  anne you never were bad    never i see that now when ive learned what real badness is you were always getting into terrible scrapes ill admit but your motive was always good davy is just bad from sheer love of it  oh no i dont think it is real badness with him either pleaded anne its just mischief and it is rather quiet for him here you know he has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have something to occupy it dora is so prim and proper she is no good for a boys playmate i really think it would be better to let them go to school marilla  no said marilla resolutely my father always said that no child should be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven years old and mr allan says the same thing the twins can have a few lessons at home but go to school they shant till theyre seven  well we must try to reform davy at home then said anne cheerfully with all his faults hes really a dear little chap i cant help loving him marilla it may be a dreadful thing to say but honestly i like davy better than dora for all shes so good  i dont know but that i do myself confessed marilla and it isnt fair for dora isnt a bit of trouble there couldnt be a better child and youd hardly know she was in the house  dora is too good said anne shed behave just as well if there wasnt a soul to tell her what to do she was born already brought up so she doesnt need us and i think concluded anne hitting on a very vital truth that we always love best the people who need us davy needs us badly  he certainly needs something agreed marilla rachel lynde would say it was a good spanking     xi  facts and fancies   teaching is really very interesting work wrote anne to a queens academy chum jane says she thinks it is monotonous but i dont find it so something funny is almost sure to happen every day and the children say such amusing things jane says she punishes her pupils when they make funny speeches which is probably why she finds teaching monotonous this afternoon little jimmy andrews was trying to spell speckled and couldnt manage it well he said finally i cant spell it but i know what it means  what i asked  st clair donnells face miss  st clair is certainly very much freckled although i try to prevent the others from commenting on it    for i was freckled once and well do i remember it but i dont think st clair minds it was because jimmy called him st clair that st clair pounded him on the way home from school i heard of the pounding but not officially so i dont think ill take any notice of it  yesterday i was trying to teach lottie wright to do addition i said if you had three candies in one hand and two in the other how many would you have altogether a mouthful said lottie and in the nature study class when i asked them to give me a good reason why toads shouldnt be killed benjie sloane gravely answered because it would rain the next day  its so hard not to laugh stella i have to save up all my amusement until i get home and marilla says it makes her nervous to hear wild shrieks of mirth proceeding from the east gable without any apparent cause she says a man in grafton went insane once and that was how it began  did you know that thomas a becket was canonized as a snake rose bell says he was    also that william tyndale wrote the new testament claude white says a glacier is a man who puts in window frames  i think the most difficult thing in teaching as well as the most interesting is to get the children to tell you their real thoughts about things one stormy day last week i gathered them around me at dinner hour and tried to get them to talk to me just as if i were one of themselves i asked them to tell me the things they most wanted some of the answers were commonplace enough      dolls ponies and skates others were decidedly original hester boulter wanted to wear her sunday dress every day and eat in the sitting room hannah bell wanted to be good without having to take any trouble about it marjory white aged ten wanted to be a widow questioned why she gravely said that if you werent married people called you an old maid and if you were your husband bossed you but if you were a widow thered be no danger of either the most remarkable wish was sally bells she wanted a honeymoon i asked her if she knew what it was and she said she thought it was an extra nice kind of bicycle because her cousin in montreal went on a honeymoon when he was married and he had always had the very latest in bicycles  another day i asked them all to tell me the naughtiest thing they had ever done i couldnt get the older ones to do so but the third class answered quite freely eliza bell had set fire to her aunts carded rolls asked if she meant to do it she said not altogether she just tried a little end to see how it would burn and the whole bundle blazed up in a jiffy emerson gillis had spent ten cents for candy when he should have put it in his missionary box annetta bells worst crime was eating some blueberries that grew in the graveyard willie white had slid down the sheephouse roof a lot of times with his sunday trousers on but i was punished for it cause i had to wear patched pants to sunday school all summer and when youre punished for a thing you dont have to repent of it declared willie  i wish you could see some of their compositions    so much do i wish it that ill send you copies of some written recently last week i told the fourth class i wanted them to write me letters about anything they pleased adding by way of suggestion that they might tell me of some place they had visited or some interesting thing or person they had seen they were to write the letters on real note paper seal them in an envelope and address them to me all without any assistance from other people last friday morning i found a pile of letters on my desk and that evening i realized afresh that teaching has its pleasures as well as its pains those compositions would atone for much here is ned clays address spelling and grammar as originally penned  miss teacher shirley  green gabels  pe island can  birds   dear teacher i think i will write you a composition about birds birds is very useful animals my cat catches birds his name is william but pa calls him tom he is oll striped and he got one of his ears froz of last winter only for that he would be a goodlooking cat my unkle has adopted a cat it come to his house one day and woudent go away and unkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed he lets it sleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his children that is not right we ought to be kind to cats and give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our children this is oll i can think of so no more at present from  edward blake clay   st clair donnells is as usual short and to the point st clair never wastes words i do not think he chose his subject or added the postscript out of malice aforethought it is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination   dear miss shirley  you told us to describe something strange we have seen i will describe the avonlea hall it has two doors an inside one and an outside one it has six windows and a chimney it has two ends and two sides it is painted blue that is what makes it strange it is built on the lower carmody road it is the third most important building in avonlea the others are the church and the blacksmith shop they hold debating clubs and lectures in it and concerts  yours truly  jacob donnell  ps the hall is a very bright blue   annetta bells letter was quite long which surprised me for writing essays is not annettas forte and hers are generally as brief as st clairs annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior but there isnt a shadow of orginality in her here is her letter  dearest teacher  i think i will write you a letter to tell you how much i love you i love you with my whole heart and soul and mind    with all there is of me to love    and i want to serve you for ever it would be my highest privilege that is why i try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns  you are so beautiful my teacher your voice is like music and your eyes are like pansies when the dew is on them you are like a tall stately queen your hair is like rippling gold anthony pye says it is red but you neednt pay any attention to anthony  i have only known you for a few months but i cannot realize that there was ever a time when i did not know you    when you had not come into my life to bless and hallow it i will always look back to this year as the most wonderful in my life because it brought you to me besides its the year we moved to avonlea from newbridge my love for you has made my life very rich and it has kept me from much of harm and evil i owe this all to you my sweetest teacher  i shall never forget how sweet you looked the last time i saw you in that black dress with flowers in your hair i shall see you like that for ever even when we are both old and gray you will always be young and fair to me dearest teacher i am thinking of you all the time   in the morning and at the noontide and at the twilight i love you when you laugh and when you sigh    even when you look disdainful i never saw you look cross though anthony pye says you always look so but i dont wonder you look cross at him for he deserves it i love you in every dress    you seem more adorable in each new dress than the last  dearest teacher good night the sun has set and the stars are shining    stars that are as bright and beautiful as your eyes i kiss your hands and face my sweet may god watch over you and protect you from all harm  your afecksionate pupil  annetta bell   this extraordinary letter puzzled me not a little i knew annetta couldnt have composed it any more than she could fly when i went to school the next day i took her for a walk down to the brook at recess and asked her to tell me the truth about the letter annetta cried and fessed up freely she said she had never written a letter and she didnt know how to or what to say but there was bundle of love letters in her mothers top bureau drawer which had been written to her by an old beau  it wasnt father sobbed annetta it was someone who was studying for a minister and so he could write lovely letters but ma didnt marry him after all she said she couldnt make out what he was driving at half the time but i thought the letters were sweet and that id just copy things out of them here and there to write you i put teacher where he put lady and i put in something of my own when i could think of it and i changed some words i put dress in place of mood i didnt know just what a mood was but i sposed it was something to wear i didnt spose youd know the difference i dont see how you found out it wasnt all mine you must be awful clever teacher  i told annetta it was very wrong to copy another persons letter and pass it off as her own but im afraid that all annetta repented of was being found out  and i do love you teacher she sobbed it was all true even if the minister wrote it first i do love you with all my heart  its very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances  here is barbara shaws letter i cant reproduce the blots of the original  dear teacher  you said we might write about a visit i never visited but once it was at my aunt marys last winter my aunt mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper the first night i was there we were at tea i knocked over a jug and broke it aunt mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before when we got up i stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt the next morning when i got up i hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and i upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast when i was helping aunt mary with the dinner dishes i dropped a china plate and it smashed that evening i fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week i heard aunt mary tell uncle joseph it was a mercy or id have broken everything in the house when i got better it was time to go home i dont like visiting very much i like going to school better especially since i came to avonlea  yours respectfully  barbara shaw   willie whites began  respected miss  i want to tell you about my very brave aunt she lives in ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard the dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion querydid willie mean a menagerie lion that had run away from a circus and it turned out that the dog was a lion and my very brave aunt had druv him into the barn with a stick it was a wonder she was not et up but she was very brave emerson gillis says if she thought it was a dog she wasnt any braver than if it really was a dog but emerson is jealous because he hasnt got a brave aunt himself nothing but uncles  i have kept the best for the last you laugh at me because i think paul is a genius but i am sure his letter will convince you that he is a very uncommon child paul lives away down near the shore with his grandmother and he has no playmates    no real playmates you remember our school management professor told us that we must not have favorites among our pupils but i cant help loving paul irving the best of all mine i dont think it does any harm though for everybody loves paul even mrs lynde who says she could never have believed shed get so fond of a yankee the other boys in school like him too there is nothing weak or girlish about him in spite of his dreams and fancies he is very manly and can hold his own in all games he fought st clair donnell recently because st clair said the union jack was away ahead of the stars and stripes as a flag the result was a drawn battle and a mutual agreement to respect each others patriotism henceforth st clair says he can hit the hardest but paul can hit the oftenest   pauls letter  my dear teacher  you told us we might write you about some interesting people we knew i think the most interesting people i know are my rock people and i mean to tell you about them i have never told anybody about them except grandma and father but i would like to have you know about them because you understand things there are a great many people who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them  my rock people live at the shore i used to visit them almost every evening before the winter came now i cant go till spring but they will be there for people like that never change    that is the splendid thing about them nora was the first one of them i got acquainted with and so i think i love her the best she lives in andrews cove and she has black hair and black eyes and she knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies you ought to hear the stories she can tell then there are the twin sailors they dont live anywhere they sail all the time but they often come ashore to talk to me they are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the world   and more than what is in the world do you know what happened to the youngest twin sailor once he was sailing and he sailed right into a moonglade a moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea you know teacher well the youngest twin sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the moon and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened it and sailed right through he had some wonderful adventures in the moon but it would make this letter too long to tell them  then there is the golden lady of the cave one day i found a big cave down on the shore and i went away in and after a while i found the golden lady she has golden hair right down to her feet and her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive and she has a golden harp and plays on it all day long    you can hear the music any time along shore if you listen carefully but most people would think it was only the wind among the rocks ive never told nora about the golden lady i was afraid it might hurt her feelings it even hurt her feelings if i talked too long with the twin sailors  i always met the twin sailors at the striped rocks the youngest twin sailor is very goodtempered but the oldest twin sailor can look dreadfully fierce at times i have my suspicions about that oldest twin i believe hed be a pirate if he dared theres really something very mysterious about him he swore once and i told him if he ever did it again he neednt come ashore to talk to me because id promised grandmother id never associate with anybody that swore he was pretty well scared i can tell you and he said if i would forgive him he would take me to the sunset so the next evening when i was sitting on the striped rocks the oldest twin came sailing over the sea in an enchanted boat and i got in her the boat was all pearly and rainbowy like the inside of the mussel shells and her sail was like moonshine well we sailed right across to the sunset think of that teacher ive been in the sunset and what do you suppose it is the sunset is a land all flowers we sailed into a great garden and the clouds are beds of flowers we sailed into a great harbor all the color of gold and i stepped right out of the boat on a big meadow all covered with buttercups as big as roses i stayed there for ever so long it seemed nearly a year but the oldest twin says it was only a few minutes you see in the sunset land the time is ever so much longer than it is here  your loving pupil paul irving  p s of course this letter isnt really true teacher pi     xii  a jonah day   it really began the night before with a restless wakeful vigil of grumbling toothache when anne arose in the dull bitter winter morning she felt that life was flat stale and unprofitable  she went to school in no angelic mood her cheek was swollen and her face ached the schoolroom was cold and smoky for the fire refused to burn and the children were huddled about it in shivering groups anne sent them to their seats with a sharper tone than she had ever used before anthony pye strutted to his with his usual impertinent swagger and she saw him whisper something to his seatmate and then glance at her with a grin  never so it seemed to anne had there been so many squeaky pencils as there were that morning and when barbara shaw came up to the desk with a sum she tripped over the coal scuttle with disastrous results the coal rolled to every part of the room her slate was broken into fragments and when she picked herself up her face stained with coal dust sent the boys into roars of laughter  anne turned from the second reader class which she was hearing  really barbara she said icily if you cannot move without falling over something youd better remain in your seat it is positively disgraceful for a girl of your age to be so awkward  poor barbara stumbled back to her desk her tears combining with the coal dust to produce an effect truly grotesque never before had her beloved sympathetic teacher spoken to her in such a tone or fashion and barbara was heartbroken anne herself felt a prick of conscience but it only served to increase her mental irritation and the second reader class remember that lesson yet as well as the unmerciful infliction of arithmetic that followed just as anne was snapping the sums out st clair donnell arrived breathlessly  you are half an hour late st clair anne reminded him frigidly why is this  please miss i had to help ma make a pudding for dinner cause were expecting company and clarice almiras sick was st clairs answer given in a perfectly respectful voice but nevertheless provocative of great mirth among his mates  take your seat and work out the six problems on page eightyfour of your arithmetic for punishment said anne st clair looked rather amazed at her tone but he went meekly to his desk and took out his slate then he stealthily passed a small parcel to joe sloane across the aisle anne caught him in the act and jumped to a fatal conclusion about that parcel  old mrs hiram sloane had lately taken to making and selling nut cakes by way of adding to her scanty income the cakes were specially tempting to small boys and for several weeks anne had had not a little trouble in regard to them on their way to school the boys would invest their spare cash at mrs hirams bring the cakes along with them to school and if possible eat them and treat their mates during school hours anne had warned them that if they brought any more cakes to school they would be confiscated and yet here was st clair donnell coolly passing a parcel of them wrapped up in the blue and white striped paper mrs hiram used under her very eyes  joseph said anne quietly bring that parcel here  joe startled and abashed obeyed he was a fat urchin who always blushed and stuttered when he was frightened never did anybody look more guilty than poor joe at that moment  throw it into the fire said anne  joe looked very blank  p    p    p    lease m    m    miss he began  do as i tell you joseph without any words about it  b    b    but m    m    miss    th    th    theyre    gasped joe in desperation  joseph are you going to obey me or are you not said anne  a bolder and more selfpossessed lad than joe sloane would have been overawed by her tone and the dangerous flash of her eyes this was a new anne whom none of her pupils had ever seen before joe with an agonized glance at st clair went to the stove opened the big square front door and threw the blue and white parcel in before st clair who had sprung to his feet could utter a word then he dodged back just in time  for a few moments the terrified occupants of avonlea school did not know whether it was an earthquake or a volcanic explosion that had occurred the innocent looking parcel which anne had rashly supposed to contain mrs hirams nut cakes really held an assortment of firecrackers and pinwheels for which warren sloane had sent to town by st clair donnells father the day before intending to have a birthday celebration that evening the crackers went off in a thunderclap of noise and the pinwheels bursting out of the door spun madly around the room hissing and spluttering anne dropped into her chair white with dismay and all the girls climbed shrieking upon their desks joe sloane stood as one transfixed in the midst of the commotion and st clair helpless with laughter rocked to and fro in the aisle prillie rogerson fainted and annetta bell went into hysterics  it seemed a long time although it was really only a few minutes before the last pinwheel subsided anne recovering herself sprang to open doors and windows and let out the gas and smoke which filled the room then she helped the girls carry the unconscious prillie into the porch where barbara shaw in an agony of desire to be useful poured a pailful of half frozen water over prillies face and shoulders before anyone could stop her  it was a full hour before quiet was restored     but it was a quiet that might be felt everybody realized that even the explosion had not cleared the teachers mental atmosphere nobody except anthony pye dared whisper a word ned clay accidentally squeaked his pencil while working a sum caught annes eye and wished the floor would open and swallow him up the geography class were whisked through a continent with a speed that made them dizzy the grammar class were parsed and analyzed within an inch of their lives chester sloane spelling odoriferous with two fs was made to feel that he could never live down the disgrace of it either in this world or that which is to come  anne knew that she had made herself ridiculous and that the incident would be laughed over that night at a score of teatables but the knowledge only angered her further in a calmer mood she could have carried off the situation with a laugh but now that was impossible so she ignored it in icy disdain  when anne returned to the school after dinner all the children were as usual in their seats and every face was bent studiously over a desk except anthony pyes he peered across his book at anne his black eyes sparkling with curiosity and mockery anne twitched open the drawer of her desk in search of chalk and under her very hand a lively mouse sprang out of the drawer scampered over the desk and leaped to the floor  anne screamed and sprang back as if it had been a snake and anthony pye laughed aloud  then a silence fell    a very creepy uncomfortable silence annetta bell was of two minds whether to go into hysterics again or not especially as she didnt know just where the mouse had gone but she decided not to who could take any comfort out of hysterics with a teacher so whitefaced and so blazingeyed standing before one  who put that mouse in my desk said anne her voice was quite low but it made a shiver go up and down paul irvings spine joe sloane caught her eye felt responsible from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet but stuttered out wildly  n    n    not m    m    me t    t    teacher n    n    not m    m    me  anne paid no attention to the wretched joseph she looked at anthony pye and anthony pye looked back unabashed and unashamed  anthony was it you  yes it was said anthony insolently  anne took her pointer from her desk it was a long heavy hardwood pointer  come here anthony  it was far from being the most severe punishment anthony pye had ever undergone anne even the stormysouled anne she was at that moment could not have punished any child cruelly but the pointer nipped keenly and finally anthonys bravado failed him he winced and the tears came to his eyes  anne consciencestricken dropped the pointer and told anthony to go to his seat she sat down at her desk feeling ashamed repentant and bitterly mortified her quick anger was gone and she would have given much to have been able to seek relief in tears so all her boasts had come to this    she had actually whipped one of her pupils how jane would triumph and how mr harrison would chuckle but worse than this bitterest thought of all she had lost her last chance of winning anthony pye never would he like her now  anne by what somebody has called a herculaneum effort kept back her tears until she got home that night then she shut herself in the east gable room and wept all her shame and remorse and disappointment into her pillows    wept so long that marilla grew alarmed invaded the room and insisted on knowing what the trouble was  the trouble is ive got things the matter with my conscience sobbed anne oh this has been such a jonah day marilla im so ashamed of myself i lost my temper and whipped anthony pye  im glad to hear it said marilla with decision its what you should have done long ago  oh no no marilla and i dont see how i can ever look those children in the face again i feel that i have humiliated myself to the very dust you dont know how cross and hateful and horrid i was i cant forget the expression in paul irvings eyes    he looked so surprised and disappointed oh marilla i have tried so hard to be patient and to win anthonys liking    and now it has all gone for nothing  marilla passed her hard workworn hand over the girls glossy tumbled hair with a wonderful tenderness when annes sobs grew quieter she said very gently for her  you take things too much to heart anne we all make mistakes    but people forget them and jonah days come to everybody as for anthony pye why need you care if he does dislike you he is the only one  i cant help it i want everybody to love me and it hurts me so when anybody doesnt and anthony never will now oh i just made an idiot of myself today marilla ill tell you the whole story  marilla listened to the whole story and if she smiled at certain parts of it anne never knew when the tale was ended she said briskly  well never mind this days done and theres a new one coming tomorrow with no mistakes in it yet as you used to say yourself just come downstairs and have your supper youll see if a good cup of tea and those plum puffs i made today wont hearten you up  plum puffs wont minister to a mind diseased said anne disconsolately but marilla thought it a good sign that she had recovered sufficiently to adapt a quotation  the cheerful supper table with the twins bright faces and marillas matchless plum puffs    of which davy ate four     did hearten her up considerably after all she had a good sleep that night and awakened in the morning to find herself and the world transformed it had snowed softly and thickly all through the hours of darkness and the beautiful whiteness glittering in the frosty sunshine looked like a mantle of charity cast over all the mistakes and humiliations of the past       every morn is a fresh beginning      every morn is the world made new  sang anne as she dressed  owing to the snow she had to go around by the road to school and she thought it was certainly an impish coincidence that anthony pye should come ploughing along just as she left the green gables lane she felt as guilty as if their positions were reversed but to her unspeakable astonishment anthony not only lifted his cap    which he had never done before    but said easily  kind of bad walking aint it can i take those books for you teacher  anne surrendered her books and wondered if she could possibly be awake anthony walked on in silence to the school but when anne took her books she smiled down at him    not the stereotyped kind smile she had so persistently assumed for his benefit but a sudden outflashing of good comradeship anthony smiled    no if the truth must be told anthony grinned back a grin is not generally supposed to be a respectful thing yet anne suddenly felt that if she had not yet won anthonys liking she had somehow or other won his respect  mrs rachel lynde came up the next saturday and confirmed this  well anne i guess youve won over anthony pye thats what he says he believes you are some good after all even if you are a girl says that whipping you gave him was just as good as a mans  i never expected to win him by whipping him though said anne a little mournfully feeling that her ideals had played her false somewhere it doesnt seem right im sure my theory of kindness cant be wrong  no but the pyes are an exception to every known rule thats what declared mrs rachel with conviction  mr harrison said thought youd come to it when he heard it and jane rubbed it in rather unmercifully     xiii  a golden picnic   anne on her way to orchard slope met diana bound for green gables just where the mossy old log bridge spanned the brook below the haunted wood and they sat down by the margin of the dryads bubble where tiny ferns were unrolling like curlyheaded green pixy folk wakening up from a nap  i was just on my way over to invite you to help me celebrate my birthday on saturday said anne  your birthday but your birthday was in march  that wasnt my fault laughed anne if my parents had consulted me it would never have happened then i should have chosen to be born in spring of course it must be delightful to come into the world with the mayflowers and violets you would always feel that you were their foster sister but since i didnt the next best thing is to celebrate my birthday in the spring priscilla is coming over saturday and jane will be home well all four start off to the woods and spend a golden day making the acquaintance of the spring we none of us really know her yet but well meet her back there as we never can anywhere else i want to explore all those fields and lonely places anyhow i have a conviction that there are scores of beautiful nooks there that have never really been seen although they may have been looked at well make friends with wind and sky and sun and bring home the spring in our hearts  it sounds awfully nice said diana with some inward distrust of annes magic of words but wont it be very damp in some places yet  oh well wear rubbers was annes concession to practicalities and i want you to come over early saturday morning and help me prepare lunch im going to have the daintiest things possible     things that will match the spring you understand    little jelly tarts and lady fingers and drop cookies frosted with pink and yellow icing and buttercup cake and we must have sandwiches too though theyre not very poetical  saturday proved an ideal day for a picnic    a day of breeze and blue warm sunny with a little rollicking wind blowing across meadow and orchard over every sunlit upland and field was a delicate flowerstarred green  mr harrison harrowing at the back of his farm and feeling some of the spring witchwork even in his sober middleaged blood saw four girls basket laden tripping across the end of his field where it joined a fringing woodland of birch and fir their blithe voices and laughter echoed down to him  its so easy to be happy on a day like this isnt it anne was saying with true anneish philosophy lets try to make this a really golden day girls a day to which we can always look back with delight were to seek for beauty and refuse to see anything else begone dull care jane you are thinking of something that went wrong in school yesterday  how do you know gasped jane amazed  oh i know the expression    ive felt it often enough on my own face but put it out of your mind theres a dear it will keep till monday    or if it doesnt so much the better oh girls girls see that patch of violets theres something for memorys picture gallery when im eighty years old    if i ever am    i shall shut my eyes and see those violets just as i see them now thats the first good gift our day has given us  if a kiss could be seen i think it would look like a violet said priscilla  anne glowed  im so glad you spoke that thought priscilla instead of just thinking it and keeping it to yourself this world would be a much more interesting place    although it is very interesting anyhow     if people spoke out their real thoughts  it would be too hot to hold some folks quoted jane sagely  i suppose it might be but that would be their own faults for thinking nasty things anyhow we can tell all our thoughts today because we are going to have nothing but beautiful thoughts everybody can say just what comes into her head that is conversation heres a little path i never saw before lets explore it  the path was a winding one so narrow that the girls walked in single file and even then the fir boughs brushed their faces under the firs were velvety cushions of moss and further on where the trees were smaller and fewer the ground was rich in a variety of green growing things  what a lot of elephants ears exclaimed diana im going to pick a big bunch theyre so pretty  how did such graceful feathery things ever come to have such a dreadful name asked priscilla  because the person who first named them either had no imagination at all or else far too much said anne oh girls look at that  that was a shallow woodland pool in the center of a little open glade where the path ended later on in the season it would be dried up and its place filled with a rank growth of ferns but now it was a glimmering placid sheet round as a saucer and clear as crystal a ring of slender young birches encircled it and little ferns fringed its margin  how sweet said jane  let us dance around it like woodnymphs cried anne dropping her basket and extending her hands  but the dance was not a success for the ground was boggy and janes rubbers came off  you cant be a woodnymph if you have to wear rubbers was her decision  well we must name this place before we leave it said anne yielding to the indisputable logic of facts everybody suggest a name and well draw lots diana  birch pool suggested diana promptly  crystal lake said jane  anne standing behind them implored priscilla with her eyes not to perpetrate another such name and priscilla rose to the occasion with glimmerglass annes selection was the fairies mirror  the names were written on strips of birch bark with a pencil schoolmaam jane produced from her pocket and placed in annes hat then priscilla shut her eyes and drew one crystal lake read jane triumphantly crystal lake it was and if anne thought that chance had played the pool a shabby trick she did not say so  pushing through the undergrowth beyond the girls came out to the young green seclusion of mr silas sloanes back pasture across it they found the entrance to a lane striking up through the woods and voted to explore it also it rewarded their quest with a succession of pretty surprises first skirting mr sloanes pasture came an archway of wild cherry trees all in bloom the girls swung their hats on their arms and wreathed their hair with the creamy fluffy blossoms then the lane turned at right angles and plunged into a spruce wood so thick and dark that they walked in a gloom as of twilight with not a glimpse of sky or sunlight to be seen  this is where the bad wood elves dwell whispered anne they are impish and malicious but they cant harm us because they are not allowed to do evil in the spring there was one peeping at us around that old twisted fir and didnt you see a group of them on that big freckly toadstool we just passed the good fairies always dwell in the sunshiny places  i wish there really were fairies said jane wouldnt it be nice to have three wishes granted you    or even only one what would you wish for girls if you could have a wish granted id wish to be rich and beautiful and clever  id wish to be tall and slender said diana  i would wish to be famous said priscilla anne thought of her hair and then dismissed the thought as unworthy  id wish it might be spring all the time and in everybodys heart and all our lives she said  but that said priscilla would be just wishing this world were like heaven  only like a part of heaven in the other parts there would be summer and autumn    yes and a bit of winter too i think i want glittering snowy fields and white frosts in heaven sometimes dont you jane  i    i dont know said jane uncomfortably jane was a good girl a member of the church who tried conscientiously to live up to her profession and believed everything she had been taught but she never thought about heaven any more than she could help for all that  minnie may asked me the other day if we would wear our best dresses every day in heaven laughed diana  and didnt you tell her we would asked anne  mercy no i told her we wouldnt be thinking of dresses at all there  oh i think we will    a little said anne earnestly therell be plenty of time in all eternity for it without neglecting more important things i believe well all wear beautiful dresses    or i suppose raiment would be a more suitable way of speaking i shall want to wear pink for a few centuries at first    it would take me that long to get tired of it i feel sure i do love pink so and i can never wear it in this world  past the spruces the lane dipped down into a sunny little open where a log bridge spanned a brook and then came the glory of a sunlit beechwood where the air was like transparent golden wine and the leaves fresh and green and the wood floor a mosaic of tremulous sunshine then more wild cherries and a little valley of lissome firs and then a hill so steep that the girls lost their breath climbing it but when they reached the top and came out into the open the prettiest surprise of all awaited them  beyond were the back fields of the farms that ran out to the upper carmody road just before them hemmed in by beeches and firs but open to the south was a little corner and in it a garden     or what had once been a garden a tumbledown stone dyke overgrown with mosses and grass surrounded it along the eastern side ran a row of garden cherry trees white as a snowdrift there were traces of old paths still and a double line of rosebushes through the middle but all the rest of the space was a sheet of yellow and white narcissi in their airiest most lavish windswayed bloom above the lush green grasses  oh how perfectly lovely three of the girls cried anne only gazed in eloquent silence  how in the world does it happen that there ever was a garden back here said priscilla in amazement  it must be hester grays garden said diana ive heard mother speak of it but i never saw it before and i wouldnt have supposed that it could be in existence still youve heard the story anne  no but the name seems familiar to me  oh youve seen it in the graveyard she is buried down there in the poplar corner you know the little brown stone with the opening gates carved on it and sacred to the memory of hester gray aged twentytwo jordan gray is buried right beside her but theres no stone to him its a wonder marilla never told you about it anne to be sure it happened thirty years ago and everybody has forgotten  well if theres a story we must have it said anne lets sit right down here among the narcissi and diana will tell it why girls there are hundreds of them    theyve spread over everything it looks as if the garden were carpeted with moonshine and sunshine combined this is a discovery worth making to think that ive lived within a mile of this place for six years and have never seen it before now diana  long ago began diana this farm belonged to old mr david gray he didnt live on it    he lived where silas sloane lives now he had one son jordan and he went up to boston one winter to work and while he was there he fell in love with a girl named hester murray she was working in a store and she hated it shed been brought up in the country and she always wanted to get back when jordan asked her to marry him she said she would if hed take her away to some quiet spot where shed see nothing but fields and trees so he brought her to avonlea mrs lynde said he was taking a fearful risk in marrying a yankee and its certain that hester was very delicate and a very poor housekeeper but mother says she was very pretty and sweet and jordan just worshipped the ground she walked on well mr gray gave jordan this farm and he built a little house back here and jordan and hester lived in it for four years she never went out much and hardly anybody went to see her except mother and mrs lynde jordan made her this garden and she was crazy about it and spent most of her time in it she wasnt much of a housekeeper but she had a knack with flowers and then she got sick mother says she thinks she was in consumption before she ever came here she never really laid up but just grew weaker and weaker all the time jordan wouldnt have anybody to wait on her he did it all himself and mother says he was as tender and gentle as a woman every day hed wrap her in a shawl and carry her out to the garden and shed lie there on a bench quite happy they say she used to make jordan kneel down by her every night and morning and pray with her that she might die out in the garden when the time came and her prayer was answered one day jordan carried her out to the bench and then he picked all the roses that were out and heaped them over her and she just smiled up at him    and closed her eyes    and that concluded diana softly was the end  oh what a dear story sighed anne wiping away her tears  what became of jordan asked priscilla  he sold the farm after hester died and went back to boston mr jabez sloane bought the farm and hauled the little house out to the road jordan died about ten years after and he was brought home and buried beside hester  i cant understand how she could have wanted to live back here away from everything said jane  oh i can easily understand that said anne thoughtfully i wouldnt want it myself for a steady thing because although i love the fields and woods i love people too but i can understand it in hester she was tired to death of the noise of the big city and the crowds of people always coming and going and caring nothing for her she just wanted to escape from it all to some still green friendly place where she could rest and she got just what she wanted which is something very few people do i believe she had four beautiful years before she died   four years of perfect happiness so i think she was to be envied more than pitied and then to shut your eyes and fall asleep among roses with the one you loved best on earth smiling down at you    oh i think it was beautiful  she set out those cherry trees over there said diana she told mother shed never live to eat their fruit but she wanted to think that something she had planted would go on living and helping to make the world beautiful after she was dead  im so glad we came this way said anne the shiningeyed this is my adopted birthday you know and this garden and its story is the birthday gift it has given me did your mother ever tell you what hester gray looked like diana  no    only just that she was pretty  im rather glad of that because i can imagine what she looked like without being hampered by facts i think she was very slight and small with softly curling dark hair and big sweet timid brown eyes and a little wistful pale face  the girls left their baskets in hesters garden and spent the rest of the afternoon rambling in the woods and fields surrounding it discovering many pretty nooks and lanes when they got hungry they had lunch in the prettiest spot of all    on the steep bank of a gurgling brook where white birches shot up out of long feathery grasses the girls sat down by the roots and did full justice to annes dainties even the unpoetical sandwiches being greatly appreciated by hearty unspoiled appetites sharpened by all the fresh air and exercise they had enjoyed anne had brought glasses and lemonade for her guests but for her own part drank cold brook water from a cup fashioned out of birch bark the cup leaked and the water tasted of earth as brook water is apt to do in spring but anne thought it more appropriate to the occasion than lemonade  look do you see that poem she said suddenly pointing  where jane and diana stared as if expecting to see runic rhymes on the birch trees  there    down in the brook    that old green mossy log with the water flowing over it in those smooth ripples that look as if theyd been combed and that single shaft of sunshine falling right athwart it far down into the pool oh its the most beautiful poem i ever saw  i should rather call it a picture said jane a poem is lines and verses  oh dear me no anne shook her head with its fluffy wild cherry coronal positively the lines and verses are only the outward garments of the poem and are no more really it than your ruffles and flounces are you jane the real poem is the soul within them     and that beautiful bit is the soul of an unwritten poem it is not every day one sees a soul    even of a poem  i wonder what a soul    a persons soul    would look like said priscilla dreamily  like that i should think answered anne pointing to a radiance of sifted sunlight streaming through a birch tree only with shape and features of course i like to fancy souls as being made of light and some are all shot through with rosy stains and quivers    and some have a soft glitter like moonlight on the sea    and some are pale and transparent like mist at dawn  i read somewhere once that souls were like flowers said priscilla  then your soul is a golden narcissus said anne and dianas is like a red red rose janes is an apple blossom pink and wholesome and sweet  and your own is a white violet with purple streaks in its heart finished priscilla  jane whispered to diana that she really could not understand what they were talking about could she  the girls went home by the light of a calm golden sunset their baskets filled with narcissus blossoms from hesters garden some of which anne carried to the cemetery next day and laid upon hesters grave minstrel robins were whistling in the firs and the frogs were singing in the marshes all the basins among the hills were brimmed with topaz and emerald light  well we have had a lovely time after all said diana as if she had hardly expected to have it when she set out  it has been a truly golden day said priscilla  im really awfully fond of the woods myself said jane  anne said nothing she was looking afar into the western sky and thinking of little hester gray     xiv  a danger averted   anne walking home from the post office one friday evening was joined by mrs lynde who was as usual cumbered with all the cares of church and state  ive just been down to timothy cottons to see if i could get alice louise to help me for a few days she said i had her last week for though shes too slow to stop quick shes better than nobody but shes sick and cant come timothys sitting there too coughing and complaining hes been dying for ten years and hell go on dying for ten years more that kind cant even die and have done with it    they cant stick to anything even to being sick long enough to finish it theyre a terrible shiftless family and what is to become of them i dont know but perhaps providence does  mrs lynde sighed as if she rather doubted the extent of providential knowledge on the subject  marilla was in about her eyes again tuesday wasnt she what did the specialist think of them she continued  he was much pleased said anne brightly he says there is a great improvement in them and he thinks the danger of her losing her sight completely is past but he says shell never be able to read much or do any fine handwork again how are your preparations for your bazaar coming on  the ladies aid society was preparing for a fair and supper and mrs lynde was the head and front of the enterprise  pretty well    and that reminds me mrs allan thinks it would be nice to fix up a booth like an oldtime kitchen and serve a supper of baked beans doughnuts pie and so on were collecting oldfashioned fixings everywhere mrs simon fletcher is going to lend us her mothers braided rugs and mrs levi boulter some old chairs and aunt mary shaw will lend us her cupboard with the glass doors i suppose marilla will let us have her brass candlesticks and we want all the old dishes we can get mrs allan is specially set on having a real blue willow ware platter if we can find one but nobody seems to have one do you know where we could get one  miss josephine barry has one ill write and ask her if shell lend it for the occasion said anne  well i wish you would i guess well have the supper in about a fortnights time uncle abe andrews is prophesying rain and storms for about that time and thats a pretty sure sign well have fine weather  the said uncle abe it may be mentioned was at least like other prophets in that he had small honor in his own country he was in fact considered in the light of a standing joke for few of his weather predictions were ever fulfilled mr elisha wright who labored under the impression that he was a local wit used to say that nobody in avonlea ever thought of looking in the charlottetown dailies for weather probabilities no they just asked uncle abe what it was going to be tomorrow and expected the opposite nothing daunted uncle abe kept on prophesying  we want to have the fair over before the election comes off continued mrs lynde for the candidates will be sure to come and spend lots of money the tories are bribing right and left so they might as well be given a chance to spend their money honestly for once  anne was a redhot conservative out of loyalty to matthews memory but she said nothing she knew better than to get mrs lynde started on politics she had a letter for marilla postmarked from a town in british columbia  its probably from the childrens uncle she said excitedly when she got home oh marilla i wonder what he says about them  the best plan might be to open it and see said marilla curtly a close observer might have thought that she was excited also but she would rather have died than show it  anne tore open the letter and glanced over the somewhat untidy and poorly written contents  he says he cant take the children this spring    hes been sick most of the winter and his wedding is put off he wants to know if we can keep them till the fall and hell try and take them then we will of course wont we marilla  i dont see that there is anything else for us to do said marilla rather grimly although she felt a secret relief anyhow theyre not so much trouble as they were    or else weve got used to them davy has improved a great deal  his manners are certainly much better said anne cautiously as if she were not prepared to say as much for his morals  anne had come home from school the previous evening to find marilla away at an aid meeting dora asleep on the kitchen sofa and davy in the sitting room closet blissfully absorbing the contents of a jar of marillas famous yellow plum preserves     company jam davy called it    which he had been forbidden to touch he looked very guilty when anne pounced on him and whisked him out of the closet  davy keith dont you know that it is very wrong of you to be eating that jam when you were told never to meddle with anything in that closet  yes i knew it was wrong admitted davy uncomfortably but plum jam is awful nice anne i just peeped in and it looked so good i thought id take just a weeny taste i stuck my finger in    anne groaned    and licked it clean and it was so much gooder than id ever thought that i got a spoon and just sailed in  anne gave him such a serious lecture on the sin of stealing plum jam that davy became conscience stricken and promised with repentant kisses never to do it again  anyhow therell be plenty of jam in heaven thats one comfort he said complacently  anne nipped a smile in the bud  perhaps there will    if we want it she said but what makes you think so  why its in the catechism said davy  oh no there is nothing like that in the catechism davy  but i tell you there is persisted davy it was in that question marilla taught me last sunday why should we love god it says because he makes preserves and redeems us preserves is just a holy way of saying jam  i must get a drink of water said anne hastily when she came back it cost her some time and trouble to explain to davy that a certain comma in the said catechism question made a great deal of difference in the meaning  well i thought it was too good to be true he said at last with a sigh of disappointed conviction and besides i didnt see when hed find time to make jam if its one endless sabbath day as the hymn says i dont believe i want to go to heaven wont there ever be any saturdays in heaven anne  yes saturdays and every other kind of beautiful days and every day in heaven will be more beautiful than the one before it davy assured anne who was rather glad that marilla was not by to be shocked marilla it is needless to say was bringing the twins up in the good old ways of theology and discouraged all fanciful speculations thereupon davy and dora were taught a hymn a catechism question and two bible verses every sunday dora learned meekly and recited like a little machine with perhaps as much understanding or interest as if she were one davy on the contrary had a lively curiosity and frequently asked questions which made marilla tremble for his fate  chester sloane says well do nothing all the time in heaven but walk around in white dresses and play on harps and he says he hopes he wont have to go till hes an old man cause maybe hell like it better then and he thinks it will be horrid to wear dresses and i think so too why cant men angels wear trousers anne chester sloane is interested in those things cause theyre going to make a minister of him hes got to be a minister cause his grandmother left the money to send him to college and he cant have it unless he is a minister she thought a minister was such a spectable thing to have in a family chester says he doesnt mind much    though hed rather be a blacksmith    but hes bound to have all the fun he can before he begins to be a minister cause he doesnt expect to have much afterwards i aint going to be a minister im going to be a storekeeper like mr blair and keep heaps of candy and bananas but id rather like going to your kind of a heaven if theyd let me play a mouth organ instead of a harp do you spose they would  yes i think they would if you wanted it was all anne could trust herself to say  the avis met at mr harmon andrews that evening and a full attendance had been requested since important business was to be discussed the avis was in a flourishing condition and had already accomplished wonders early in the spring mr major spencer had redeemed his promise and had stumped graded and seeded down all the road front of his farm a dozen other men some prompted by a determination not to let a spencer get ahead of them others goaded into action by improvers in their own households had followed his example the result was that there were long strips of smooth velvet turf where once had been unsightly undergrowth or brush the farm fronts that had not been done looked so badly by contrast that their owners were secretly shamed into resolving to see what they could do another spring the triangle of ground at the cross roads had also been cleared and seeded down and annes bed of geraniums unharmed by any marauding cow was already set out in the center  altogether the improvers thought that they were getting on beautifully even if mr levi boulter tactfully approached by a carefully selected committee in regard to the old house on his upper farm did bluntly tell them that he wasnt going to have it meddled with  at this especial meeting they intended to draw up a petition to the school trustees humbly praying that a fence be put around the school grounds and a plan was also to be discussed for planting a few ornamental trees by the church if the funds of the society would permit of it    for as anne said there was no use in starting another subscription as long as the hall remained blue the members were assembled in the andrews parlor and jane was already on her feet to move the appointment of a committee which should find out and report on the price of said trees when gertie pye swept in pompadoured and frilled within an inch of her life gertie had a habit of being late    to make her entrance more effective spiteful people said gerties entrance in this instance was certainly effective for she paused dramatically on the middle of the floor threw up her hands rolled her eyes and exclaimed ive just heard something perfectly awful what do you think mr judson parker is going to rent all the road fence of his farm to a patent medicine company to paint advertisements on  for once in her life gertie pye made all the sensation she desired if she had thrown a bomb among the complacent improvers she could hardly have made more  it cant be true said anne blankly  thats just what i said when i heard it first dont you know said gertie who was enjoying herself hugely i said it couldnt be true    that judson parker wouldnt have the heart to do it dont you know but father met him this afternoon and asked him about it and he said it was true just fancy his farm is sideon to the newbridge road and how perfectly awful it will look to see advertisements of pills and plasters all along it dont you know  the improvers did know all too well even the least imaginative among them could picture the grotesque effect of half a mile of board fence adorned with such advertisements all thought of church and school grounds vanished before this new danger parliamentary rules and regulations were forgotten and anne in despair gave up trying to keep minutes at all everybody talked at once and fearful was the hubbub  oh let us keep calm implored anne who was the most excited of them all and try to think of some way of preventing him  i dont know how youre going to prevent him exclaimed jane bitterly everybody knows what judson parker is hed do anything for money he hasnt a spark of public spirit or any sense of the beautiful  the prospect looked rather unpromising judson parker and his sister were the only parkers in avonlea so that no leverage could be exerted by family connections martha parker was a lady of all too certain age who disapproved of young people in general and the improvers in particular judson was a jovial smoothspoken man so uniformly goodnatured and bland that it was surprising how few friends he had perhaps he had got the better in too many business transactions   which seldom makes for popularity he was reputed to be very sharp and it was the general opinion that he hadnt much principle  if judson parker has a chance to turn an honest penny as he says himself hell never lose it declared fred wright  is there nobody who has any influence over him asked anne despairingly  he goes to see louisa spencer at white sands suggested carrie sloane perhaps she could coax him not to rent his fences  not she said gilbert emphatically i know louisa spencer well she doesnt believe in village improvement societies but she does believe in dollars and cents shed be more likely to urge judson on than to dissuade him  the only thing to do is to appoint a committee to wait on him and protest said julia bell and you must send girls for hed hardly be civil to boys     but i wont go so nobody need nominate me  better send anne alone said oliver sloane she can talk judson over if anybody can  anne protested she was willing to go and do the talking but she must have others with her for moral support diana and jane were therefore appointed to support her morally and the improvers broke up buzzing like angry bees with indignation anne was so worried that she didnt sleep until nearly morning and then she dreamed that the trustees had put a fence around the school and painted try purple pills all over it  the committee waited on judson parker the next afternoon anne pleaded eloquently against his nefarious design and jane and diana supported her morally and valiantly judson was sleek suave flattering paid them several compliments of the delicacy of sunflowers felt real bad to refuse such charming young ladies     but business was business couldnt afford to let sentiment stand in the way these hard times  but ill tell what i will do he said with a twinkle in his light full eyes ill tell the agent he must use only handsome tasty colors    red and yellow and so on ill tell him he mustnt paint the ads blue on any account  the vanquished committee retired thinking things not lawful to be uttered  we have done all we can do and must simply trust the rest to providence said jane with an unconscious imitation of mrs lyndes tone and manner  i wonder if mr allan could do anything reflected diana  anne shook her head  no its no use to worry mr allan especially now when the babys so sick judson would slip away from him as smoothly as from us although he has taken to going to church quite regularly just now that is simply because louisa spencers father is an elder and very particular about such things  judson parker is the only man in avonlea who would dream of renting his fences said jane indignantly even levi boulter or lorenzo white would never stoop to that tightfisted as they are they would have too much respect for public opinion  public opinion was certainly down on judson parker when the facts became known but that did not help matters much judson chuckled to himself and defied it and the improvers were trying to reconcile themselves to the prospect of seeing the prettiest part of the newbridge road defaced by advertisements when anne rose quietly at the presidents call for reports of committees on the occasion of the next meeting of the society and announced that mr judson parker had instructed her to inform the society that he was not going to rent his fences to the patent medicine company  jane and diana stared as if they found it hard to believe their ears parliamentary etiquette which was generally very strictly enforced in the avis forbade them giving instant vent to their curiosity but after the society adjourned anne was besieged for explanations anne had no explanation to give judson parker had overtaken her on the road the preceding evening and told her that he had decided to humor the avis in its peculiar prejudice against patent medicine advertisements that was all anne would say then or ever afterwards and it was the simple truth but when jane andrews on her way home confided to oliver sloane her firm belief that there was more behind judson parkers mysterious change of heart than anne shirley had revealed she spoke the truth also  anne had been down to old mrs irvings on the shore road the preceding evening and had come home by a short cut which led her first over the lowlying shore fields and then through the beech wood below robert dicksons by a little footpath that ran out to the main road just above the lake of shining waters    known to unimaginative people as barrys pond  two men were sitting in their buggies reined off to the side of the road just at the entrance of the path one was judson parker the other was jerry corcoran a newbridge man against whom as mrs lynde would have told you in eloquent italics nothing shady had ever been proved he was an agent for agricultural implements and a prominent personage in matters political he had a finger     some people said all his fingers    in every political pie that was cooked and as canada was on the eve of a general election jerry corcoran had been a busy man for many weeks canvassing the county in the interests of his partys candidate just as anne emerged from under the overhanging beech boughs she heard corcoran say if youll vote for amesbury parker    well ive a note for that pair of harrows youve got in the spring i suppose you wouldnt object to having it back eh  we    ll since you put it in that way drawled judson with a grin i reckon i might as well do it a man must look out for his own interests in these hard times  both saw anne at this moment and conversation abruptly ceased anne bowed frostily and walked on with her chin slightly more tilted than usual soon judson parker overtook her  have a lift anne he inquired genially  thank you no said anne politely but with a fine needlelike disdain in her voice that pierced even judson parkers none too sensitive consciousness his face reddened and he twitched his reins angrily but the next second prudential considerations checked him he looked uneasily at anne as she walked steadily on glancing neither to the right nor to the left had she heard corcorans unmistakable offer and his own too plain acceptance of it confound corcoran if he couldnt put his meaning into less dangerous phrases hed get into trouble some of these longcomeshorts and confound redheaded schoolmaams with a habit of popping out of beechwoods where they had no business to be if anne had heard judson parker measuring her corn in his own half bushel as the country saying went and cheating himself thereby as such people generally do believed that she would tell it far and wide now judson parker as has been seen was not overly regardful of public opinion but to be known as having accepted a bribe would be a nasty thing and if it ever reached isaac spencers ears farewell forever to all hope of winning louisa jane with her comfortable prospects as the heiress of a welltodo farmer judson parker knew that mr spencer looked somewhat askance at him as it was he could not afford to take any risks  ahem    anne ive been wanting to see you about that little matter we were discussing the other day ive decided not to let my fences to that company after all a society with an aim like yours ought to be encouraged  anne thawed out the merest trifle  thank you she said  and    and    you neednt mention that little conversation of mine with jerry  i have no intention of mentioning it in any case said anne icily for she would have seen every fence in avonlea painted with advertisements before she would have stooped to bargain with a man who would sell his vote  just so    just so agreed judson imagining that they understood each other beautifully i didnt suppose you would of course i was only stringing jerry    he thinks hes so allfired cute and smart ive no intention of voting for amesbury im going to vote for grant as ive always done    youll see that when the election comes off i just led jerry on to see if he would commit himself and its all right about the fence     you can tell the improvers that  it takes all sorts of people to make a world as ive often heard but i think there are some who could be spared anne told her reflection in the east gable mirror that night i wouldnt have mentioned the disgraceful thing to a soul anyhow so my conscience is clear on that score i really dont know who or what is to be thanked for this i did nothing to bring it about and its hard to believe that providence ever works by means of the kind of politics men like judson parker and jerry corcoran have     xv  the beginning of vacation   anne locked the schoolhouse door on a still yellow evening when the winds were purring in the spruces around the playground and the shadows were long and lazy by the edge of the woods she dropped the key into her pocket with a sigh of satisfaction the school year was ended she had been reengaged for the next with many expressions of satisfaction    only mr harmon andrews told her she ought to use the strap oftener    and two delightful months of a wellearned vacation beckoned her invitingly anne felt at peace with the world and herself as she walked down the hill with her basket of flowers in her hand since the earliest mayflowers anne had never missed her weekly pilgrimage to matthews grave everyone else in avonlea except marilla had already forgotten quiet shy unimportant matthew cuthbert but his memory was still green in annes heart and always would be she could never forget the kind old man who had been the first to give her the love and sympathy her starved childhood had craved  at the foot of the hill a boy was sitting on the fence in the shadow of the spruces    a boy with big dreamy eyes and a beautiful sensitive face he swung down and joined anne smiling but there were traces of tears on his cheeks  i thought id wait for you teacher because i knew you were going to the graveyard he said slipping his hand into hers im going there too    im taking this bouquet of geraniums to put on grandpa irvings grave for grandma and look teacher im going to put this bunch of white roses beside grandpas grave in memory of my little mother   because i cant go to her grave to put it there but dont you think shell know all about it just the same  yes i am sure she will paul  you see teacher its just three years today since my little mother died its such a long long time but it hurts just as much as ever    and i miss her just as much as ever sometimes it seems to me that i just cant bear it it hurts so  pauls voice quivered and his lip trembled he looked down at his roses hoping that his teacher would not notice the tears in his eyes  and yet said anne very softly you wouldnt want it to stop hurting     you wouldnt want to forget your little mother even if you could  no indeed i wouldnt    thats just the way i feel youre so good at understanding teacher nobody else understands so well    not even grandma although shes so good to me father understood pretty well but still i couldnt talk much to him about mother because it made him feel so bad when he put his hand over his face i always knew it was time to stop poor father he must be dreadfully lonesome without me but you see he has nobody but a housekeeper now and he thinks housekeepers are no good to bring up little boys especially when he has to be away from home so much on business grandmothers are better next to mothers someday when im brought up ill go back to father and were never going to be parted again  paul had talked so much to anne about his mother and father that she felt as if she had known them she thought his mother must have been very like what he was himself in temperament and disposition and she had an idea that stephen irving was a rather reserved man with a deep and tender nature which he kept hidden scrupulously from the world  fathers not very easy to get acquainted with paul had said once i never got really acquainted with him until after my little mother died but hes splendid when you do get to know him i love him the best in all the world and grandma irving next and then you teacher id love you next to father if it wasnt my duty to love grandma irving best because shes doing so much for me you know teacher i wish she would leave the lamp in my room till i go to sleep though she takes it right out as soon as she tucks me up because she says i mustnt be a coward im not scared but id rather have the light my little mother used always to sit beside me and hold my hand till i went to sleep i expect she spoiled me mothers do sometimes you know  no anne did not know this although she might imagine it she thought sadly of her little mother the mother who had thought her so perfectly beautiful and who had died so long ago and was buried beside her boyish husband in that unvisited grave far away anne could not remember her mother and for this reason she almost envied paul  my birthday is next week said paul as they walked up the long red hill basking in the june sunshine and father wrote me that he is sending me something that he thinks ill like better than anything else he could send i believe it has come already for grandma is keeping the bookcase drawer locked and that is something new and when i asked her why she just looked mysterious and said little boys mustnt be too curious its very exciting to have a birthday isnt it ill be eleven youd never think it to look at me would you grandma says im very small for my age and that its all because i dont eat enough porridge i do my very best but grandma gives such generous platefuls    theres nothing mean about grandma i can tell you ever since you and i had that talk about praying going home from sunday school that day teacher     when you said we ought to pray about all our difficulties    ive prayed every night that god would give me enough grace to enable me to eat every bit of my porridge in the mornings but ive never been able to do it yet and whether its because i have too little grace or too much porridge i really cant decide grandma says father was brought up on porridge and it certainly did work well in his case for you ought to see the shoulders he has but sometimes concluded paul with a sigh and a meditative air i really think porridge will be the death of me  anne permitted herself a smile since paul was not looking at her all avonlea knew that old mrs irving was bringing her grandson up in accordance with the good oldfashioned methods of diet and morals  let us hope not dear she said cheerfully how are your rock people coming on does the oldest twin still continue to behave himself  he has to said paul emphatically he knows i wont associate with him if he doesnt he is really full of wickedness i think  and has nora found out about the golden lady yet  no but i think she suspects im almost sure she watched me the last time i went to the cave i dont mind if she finds out     it is only for her sake i dont want her to    so that her feelings wont be hurt but if she is determined to have her feelings hurt it cant be helped  if i were to go to the shore some night with you do you think i could see your rock people too  paul shook his head gravely  no i dont think you could see my rock people im the only person who can see them but you could see rock people of your own youre one of the kind that can were both that kind you know teacher he added squeezing her hand chummily isnt it splendid to be that kind teacher  splendid anne agreed gray shining eyes looking down into blue shining ones anne and paul both knew       how fair the realm      imagination opens to the view  and both knew the way to that happy land there the rose of joy bloomed immortal by dale and stream clouds never darkened the sunny sky sweet bells never jangled out of tune and kindred spirits abounded the knowledge of that lands geography     east o the sun west o the moon    is priceless lore not to be bought in any market place it must be the gift of the good fairies at birth and the years can never deface it or take it away it is better to possess it living in a garret than to be the inhabitant of palaces without it  the avonlea graveyard was as yet the grassgrown solitude it had always been to be sure the improvers had an eye on it and priscilla grant had read a paper on cemeteries before the last meeting of the society at some future time the improvers meant to have the lichened wayward old board fence replaced by a neat wire railing the grass mown and the leaning monuments straightened up  anne put on matthews grave the flowers she had brought for it and then went over to the little poplar shaded corner where hester gray slept ever since the day of the spring picnic anne had put flowers on hesters grave when she visited matthews the evening before she had made a pilgrimage back to the little deserted garden in the woods and brought therefrom some of hesters own white roses  i thought you would like them better than any others dear she said softly  anne was still sitting there when a shadow fell over the grass and she looked up to see mrs allan they walked home together  mrs allans face was not the face of the girlbride whom the minister had brought to avonlea five years before it had lost some of its bloom and youthful curves and there were fine patient lines about eyes and mouth a tiny grave in that very cemetery accounted for some of them and some new ones had come during the recent illness now happily over of her little son but mrs allans dimples were as sweet and sudden as ever her eyes as clear and bright and true and what her face lacked of girlish beauty was now more than atoned for in added tenderness and strength  i suppose you are looking forward to your vacation anne she said as they left the graveyard  anne nodded  yes    i could roll the word as a sweet morsel under my tongue i think the summer is going to be lovely for one thing mrs morgan is coming to the island in july and priscilla is going to bring her up i feel one of my old thrills at the mere thought  i hope youll have a good time anne youve worked very hard this past year and you have succeeded  oh i dont know ive come so far short in so many things i havent done what i meant to do when i began to teach last fall i havent lived up to my ideals  none of us ever do said mrs allan with a sigh but then anne you know what lowell says not failure but low aim is crime we must have ideals and try to live up to them even if we never quite succeed life would be a sorry business without them with them its grand and great hold fast to your ideals anne  i shall try but i have to let go most of my theories said anne laughing a little i had the most beautiful set of theories you ever knew when i started out as a schoolmaam but every one of them has failed me at some pinch or another  even the theory on corporal punishment teased mrs allan  but anne flushed  i shall never forgive myself for whipping anthony  nonsense dear he deserved it and it agreed with him you have had no trouble with him since and he has come to think theres nobody like you your kindness won his love after the idea that a girl was no good was rooted out of his stubborn mind  he may have deserved it but that is not the point if i had calmly and deliberately decided to whip him because i thought it a just punishment for him i would not feel over it as i do but the truth is mrs allan that i just flew into a temper and whipped him because of that i wasnt thinking whether it was just or unjust    even if he hadnt deserved it id have done it just the same that is what humiliates me  well we all make mistakes dear so just put it behind you we should regret our mistakes and learn from them but never carry them forward into the future with us there goes gilbert blythe on his wheel    home for his vacation too i suppose how are you and he getting on with your studies  pretty well we plan to finish the virgil tonight    there are only twenty lines to do then we are not going to study any more until september  do you think you will ever get to college  oh i dont know anne looked dreamily afar to the opaltinted horizon marillas eyes will never be much better than they are now although we are so thankful to think that they will not get worse and then there are the twins    somehow i dont believe their uncle will ever really send for them perhaps college may be around the bend in the road but i havent got to the bend yet and i dont think much about it lest i might grow discontented  well i should like to see you go to college anne but if you never do dont be discontented about it we make our own lives wherever we are after all    college can only help us to do it more easily they are broad or narrow according to what we put into them not what we get out life is rich and full here     everywhere    if we can only learn how to open our whole hearts to its richness and fulness  i think i understand what you mean said anne thoughtfully and i know i have so much to feel thankful for    oh so much     my work and paul irving and the dear twins and all my friends do you know mrs allan im so thankful for friendship it beautifies life so much  true friendship is a very helpful thing indeed said mrs allan and we should have a very high ideal of it and never sully it by any failure in truth and sincerity i fear the name of friendship is often degraded to a kind of intimacy that has nothing of real friendship in it  yes    like gertie pyes and julia bells they are very intimate and go everywhere together but gertie is always saying nasty things of julia behind her back and everybody thinks she is jealous of her because she is always so pleased when anybody criticizes julia i think it is desecration to call that friendship if we have friends we should look only for the best in them and give them the best that is in us dont you think then friendship would be the most beautiful thing in the world  friendship is very beautiful smiled mrs allan but some day     then she paused abruptly in the delicate whitebrowed face beside her with its candid eyes and mobile features there was still far more of the child than of the woman annes heart so far harbored only dreams of friendship and ambition and mrs allan did not wish to brush the bloom from her sweet unconsciousness so she left her sentence for the future years to finish     xvi  the substance of things hoped for   anne said davy appealingly scrambling up on the shiny leathercovered sofa in the green gables kitchen where anne sat reading a letter anne im awful hungry youve no idea  ill get you a piece of bread and butter in a minute said anne absently her letter evidently contained some exciting news for her cheeks were as pink as the roses on the big bush outside and her eyes were as starry as only annes eyes could be  but i aint bread and butter hungry said davy in a disgusted tone im plum cake hungry  oh laughed anne laying down her letter and putting her arm about davy to give him a squeeze thats a kind of hunger that can be endured very comfortably davyboy you know its one of marillas rules that you cant have anything but bread and butter between meals  well gimme a piece then    please  davy had been at last taught to say please but he generally tacked it on as an afterthought he looked with approval at the generous slice anne presently brought to him you always put such a nice lot of butter on it anne marilla spreads it pretty thin it slips down a lot easier when theres plenty of butter  the slice slipped down with tolerable ease judging from its rapid disappearance davy slid head first off the sofa turned a double somersault on the rug and then sat up and announced decidedly  anne ive made up my mind about heaven i dont want to go there  why not asked anne gravely  cause heaven is in simon fletchers garret and i dont like simon fletcher  heaven in    simon fletchers garret gasped anne too amazed even to laugh davy keith whatever put such an extraordinary idea into your head  milty boulter says thats where it is it was last sunday in sunday school the lesson was about elijah and elisha and i up and asked miss rogerson where heaven was miss rogerson looked awful offended she was cross anyhow because when shed asked us what elijah left elisha when he went to heaven milty boulter said his old cloes and us fellows all laughed before we thought i wish you could think first and do things afterwards cause then you wouldnt do them but milty didnt mean to be disrespeckful he just couldnt think of the name of the thing miss rogerson said heaven was where god was and i wasnt to ask questions like that milty nudged me and said in a whisper heavens in uncle simons garret and ill esplain about it on the road home so when we was coming home he esplained miltys a great hand at esplaining things even if he dont know anything about a thing hell make up a lot of stuff and so you get it esplained all the same his mother is mrs simons sister and he went with her to the funeral when his cousin jane ellen died the minister said shed gone to heaven though milty says she was lying right before them in the coffin but he sposed they carried the coffin to the garret afterwards well when milty and his mother went upstairs after it was all over to get her bonnet he asked her where heaven was that jane ellen had gone to and she pointed right to the ceiling and said up there milty knew there wasnt anything but the garret over the ceiling so thats how he found out and hes been awful scared to go to his uncle simons ever since  anne took davy on her knee and did her best to straighten out this theological tangle also she was much better fitted for the task than marilla for she remembered her own childhood and had an instinctive understanding of the curious ideas that sevenyearolds sometimes get about matters that are of course very plain and simple to grown up people she had just succeeded in convincing davy that heaven was not in simon fletchers garret when marilla came in from the garden where she and dora had been picking peas dora was an industrious little soul and never happier than when helping in various small tasks suited to her chubby fingers she fed chickens picked up chips wiped dishes and ran errands galore she was neat faithful and observant she never had to be told how to do a thing twice and never forgot any of her little duties davy on the other hand was rather heedless and forgetful but he had the born knack of winning love and even yet anne and marilla liked him the better  while dora proudly shelled the peas and davy made boats of the pods with masts of matches and sails of paper anne told marilla about the wonderful contents of her letter  oh marilla what do you think ive had a letter from priscilla and she says that mrs morgan is on the island and that if it is fine thursday they are going to drive up to avonlea and will reach here about twelve they will spend the afternoon with us and go to the hotel at white sands in the evening because some of mrs morgans american friends are staying there oh marilla isnt it wonderful i can hardly believe im not dreaming  i daresay mrs morgan is a lot like other people said marilla drily although she did feel a trifle excited herself mrs morgan was a famous woman and a visit from her was no commonplace occurrence theyll be here to dinner then  yes and oh marilla may i cook every bit of the dinner myself i want to feel that i can do something for the author of the rosebud garden if it is only to cook a dinner for her you wont mind will you  goodness im not so fond of stewing over a hot fire in july that it would vex me very much to have someone else do it youre quite welcome to the job  oh thank you said anne as if marilla had just conferred a tremendous favor ill make out the menu this very night  youd better not try to put on too much style warned marilla a little alarmed by the highflown sound of menu youll likely come to grief if you do  oh im not going to put on any style if you mean trying to do or have things we dont usually have on festal occasions assured anne that would be affectation and although i know i havent as much sense and steadiness as a girl of seventeen and a schoolteacher ought to have im not so silly as that but i want to have everything as nice and dainty as possible davyboy dont leave those peapods on the back stairs    someone might slip on them ill have a light soup to begin with    you know i can make lovely creamofonion soup    and then a couple of roast fowls ill have the two white roosters i have real affection for those roosters and theyve been pets ever since the gray hen hatched out just the two of them    little balls of yellow down but i know they would have to be sacrificed sometime and surely there couldnt be a worthier occasion than this but oh marilla i cannot kill them    not even for mrs morgans sake ill have to ask john henry carter to come over and do it for me  ill do it volunteered davy if marillall hold them by the legs cause i guess itd take both my hands to manage the axe its awful jolly fun to see them hopping about after their heads are cut off  then ill have peas and beans and creamed potatoes and a lettuce salad for vegetables resumed anne and for dessert lemon pie with whipped cream and coffee and cheese and lady fingers ill make the pies and lady fingers tomorrow and do up my white muslin dress and i must tell diana tonight for shell want to do up hers mrs morgans heroines are nearly always dressed in white muslin and diana and i have always resolved that that was what we would wear if we ever met her it will be such a delicate compliment dont you think davy dear you mustnt poke peapods into the cracks of the floor i must ask mr and mrs allan and miss stacy to dinner too for theyre all very anxious to meet mrs morgan its so fortunate shes coming while miss stacy is here davy dear dont sail the peapods in the water bucket    go out to the trough oh i do hope it will be fine thursday and i think it will for uncle abe said last night when he called at mr harrisons that it was going to rain most of this week  thats a good sign agreed marilla  anne ran across to orchard slope that evening to tell the news to diana who was also very much excited over it and they discussed the matter in the hammock swung under the big willow in the barry garden  oh anne maynt i help you cook the dinner implored diana you know i can make splendid lettuce salad  indeed you may said anne unselfishly and i shall want you to help me decorate too i mean to have the parlor simply a bower of blossoms    and the dining table is to be adorned with wild roses oh i do hope everything will go smoothly mrs morgans heroines never get into scrapes or are taken at a disadvantage and they are always so selfpossessed and such good housekeepers they seem to be born good housekeepers you remember that gertrude in edgewood days kept house for her father when she was only eight years old when i was eight years old i hardly knew how to do a thing except bring up children mrs morgan must be an authority on girls when she has written so much about them and i do want her to have a good opinion of us ive imagined it all out a dozen different ways    what shell look like and what shell say and what ill say and im so anxious about my nose there are seven freckles on it as you can see they came at the avi s picnic when i went around in the sun without my hat i suppose its ungrateful of me to worry over them when i should be thankful theyre not spread all over my face as they once were but i do wish they hadnt come    all mrs morgans heroines have such perfect complexions i cant recall a freckled one among them  yours are not very noticeable comforted diana try a little lemon juice on them tonight  the next day anne made her pies and lady fingers did up her muslin dress and swept and dusted every room in the house    a quite unnecessary proceeding for green gables was as usual in the apple pie order dear to marillas heart but anne felt that a fleck of dust would be a desecration in a house that was to be honored by a visit from charlotte e morgan she even cleaned out the catchall closet under the stairs although there was not the remotest possibility of mrs morgans seeing its interior  but i want to feel that it is in perfect order even if she isnt to see it anne told marilla you know in her book golden keys she makes her two heroines alice and louisa take for their motto that verse of longfellows       in the elder days of art      builders wrought with greatest care      each minute and unseen part      for the gods see everywhere  and so they always kept their cellar stairs scrubbed and never forgot to sweep under the beds i should have a guilty conscience if i thought this closet was in disorder when mrs morgan was in the house ever since we read golden keys last april diana and i have taken that verse for our motto too  that night john henry carter and davy between them contrived to execute the two white roosters and anne dressed them the usually distasteful task glorified in her eyes by the destination of the plump birds  i dont like picking fowls she told marilla but isnt it fortunate we dont have to put our souls into what our hands may be doing ive been picking chickens with my hands but in imagination ive been roaming the milky way  i thought youd scattered more feathers over the floor than usual remarked marilla  then anne put davy to bed and made him promise that he would behave perfectly the next day  if im as good as good can be all day tomorrow will you let me be just as bad as i like all the next day asked davy  i couldnt do that said anne discreetly but ill take you and dora for a row in the flat right to the bottom of the pond and well go ashore on the sandhills and have a picnic  its a bargain said davy ill be good you bet i meant to go over to mr harrisons and fire peas from my new popgun at ginger but another dayll do as well i espect it will be just like sunday but a picnic at the shorell make up for that     xvii  a chapter of accidents   anne woke three times in the night and made pilgrimages to her window to make sure that uncle abes prediction was not coming true finally the morning dawned pearly and lustrous in a sky full of silver sheen and radiance and the wonderful day had arrived  diana appeared soon after breakfast with a basket of flowers over one arm and her muslin dress over the other    for it would not do to don it until all the dinner preparations were completed meanwhile she wore her afternoon pink print and a lawn apron fearfully and wonderfully ruffled and frilled and very neat and pretty and rosy she was  you look simply sweet said anne admiringly  diana sighed  but ive had to let out every one of my dresses again i weigh four pounds more than i did in july anne where will this end mrs morgans heroines are all tall and slender  well lets forget our troubles and think of our mercies said anne gaily mrs allan says that whenever we think of anything that is a trial to us we should also think of something nice that we can set over against it if you are slightly too plump youve got the dearest dimples and if i have a freckled nose the shape of it is all right do you think the lemon juice did any good  yes i really think it did said diana critically and much elated anne led the way to the garden which was full of airy shadows and wavering golden lights  well decorate the parlor first we have plenty of time for priscilla said theyd be here about twelve or half past at the latest so well have dinner at one  there may have been two happier and more excited girls somewhere in canada or the united states at that moment but i doubt it every snip of the scissors as rose and peony and bluebell fell seemed to chirp mrs morgan is coming today anne wondered how mr harrison could go on placidly mowing hay in the field across the lane just as if nothing were going to happen  the parlor at green gables was a rather severe and gloomy apartment with rigid horsehair furniture stiff lace curtains and white antimacassars that were always laid at a perfectly correct angle except at such times as they clung to unfortunate peoples buttons even anne had never been able to infuse much grace into it for marilla would not permit any alterations but it is wonderful what flowers can accomplish if you give them a fair chance when anne and diana finished with the room you would not have recognized it  a great blue bowlful of snowballs overflowed on the polished table the shining black mantelpiece was heaped with roses and ferns every shelf of the whatnot held a sheaf of bluebells the dark corners on either side of the grate were lighted up with jars full of glowing crimson peonies and the grate itself was aflame with yellow poppies all this splendor and color mingled with the sunshine falling through the honeysuckle vines at the windows in a leafy riot of dancing shadows over walls and floor made of the usually dismal little room the veritable bower of annes imagination and even extorted a tribute of admiration from marilla who came in to criticize and remained to praise  now we must set the table said anne in the tone of a priestess about to perform some sacred rite in honor of a divinity well have a big vaseful of wild roses in the center and one single rose in front of everybodys plateand a special bouquet of rosebuds only by mrs morgansan allusion to the rosebud garden you know  the table was set in the sitting room with marillas finest linen and the best china glass and silver you may be perfectly certain that every article placed on it was polished or scoured to the highest possible perfection of gloss and glitter  then the girls tripped out to the kitchen which was filled with appetizing odors emanating from the oven where the chickens were already sizzling splendidly anne prepared the potatoes and diana got the peas and beans ready then while diana shut herself into the pantry to compound the lettuce salad anne whose cheeks were already beginning to glow crimson as much with excitement as from the heat of the fire prepared the bread sauce for the chickens minced her onions for the soup and finally whipped the cream for her lemon pies  and what about davy all this time was he redeeming his promise to be good he was indeed to be sure he insisted on remaining in the kitchen for his curiosity wanted to see all that went on but as he sat quietly in a corner busily engaged in untying the knots in a piece of herring net he had brought home from his last trip to the shore nobody objected to this  at half past eleven the lettuce salad was made the golden circles of the pies were heaped with whipped cream and everything was sizzling and bubbling that ought to sizzle and bubble  wed better go and dress now said anne for they may be here by twelve we must have dinner at sharp one for the soup must be served as soon as its done  serious indeed were the toilet rites presently performed in the east gable anne peered anxiously at her nose and rejoiced to see that its freckles were not at all prominent thanks either to the lemon juice or to the unusual flush on her cheeks when they were ready they looked quite as sweet and trim and girlish as ever did any of mrs morgans heroines  i do hope ill be able to say something once in a while and not sit like a mute said diana anxiously all mrs morgans heroines converse so beautifully but im afraid ill be tonguetied and stupid and ill be sure to say i seen i havent often said it since miss stacy taught here but in moments of excitement its sure to pop out anne if i were to say i seen before mrs morgan id die of mortification and it would be almost as bad to have nothing to say  im nervous about a good many things said anne but i dont think there is much fear that i wont be able to talk  and to do her justice there wasnt  anne shrouded her muslin glories in a big apron and went down to concoct her soup marilla had dressed herself and the twins and looked more excited than she had ever been known to look before at half past twelve the allans and miss stacy came everything was going well but anne was beginning to feel nervous it was surely time for priscilla and mrs morgan to arrive she made frequent trips to the gate and looked as anxiously down the lane as ever her namesake in the bluebeard story peered from the tower casement  suppose they dont come at all she said piteously  dont suppose it it would be too mean said diana who however was beginning to have uncomfortable misgivings on the subject  anne said marilla coming out from the parlor miss stacy wants to see miss barrys willowware platter  anne hastened to the sitting room closet to get the platter she had in accordance with her promise to mrs lynde written to miss barry of charlottetown asking for the loan of it miss barry was an old friend of annes and she promptly sent the platter out with a letter exhorting anne to be very careful of it for she had paid twenty dollars for it the platter had served its purpose at the aid bazaar and had then been returned to the green gables closet for anne would not trust anybody but herself to take it back to town  she carried the platter carefully to the front door where her guests were enjoying the cool breeze that blew up from the brook it was examined and admired then just as anne had taken it back into her own hands a terrific crash and clatter sounded from the kitchen pantry marilla diana and anne fled out the latter pausing only long enough to set the precious platter hastily down on the second step of the stairs  when they reached the pantry a truly harrowing spectacle met their eyes    a guilty looking small boy scrambling down from the table with his clean print blouse liberally plastered with yellow filling and on the table the shattered remnants of what had been two brave becreamed lemon pies  davy had finished ravelling out his herring net and had wound the twine into a ball then he had gone into the pantry to put it up on the shelf above the table where he already kept a score or so of similar balls which so far as could be discovered served no useful purpose save to yield the joy of possession davy had to climb on the table and reach over to the shelf at a dangerous angle    something he had been forbidden by marilla to do as he had come to grief once before in the experiment the result in this instance was disastrous davy slipped and came sprawling squarely down on the lemon pies his clean blouse was ruined for that time and the pies for all time it is however an ill wind that blows nobody good and the pig was eventually the gainer by davys mischance  davy keith said marilla shaking him by the shoulder didnt i forbid you to climb up on that table again didnt i  i forgot whimpered davy youve told me not to do such an awful lot of things that i cant remember them all  well you march upstairs and stay there till after dinner perhaps youll get them sorted out in your memory by that time no anne never you mind interceding for him im not punishing him because he spoiled your pies    that was an accident im punishing him for his disobedience go davy i say  aint i to have any dinner wailed davy  you can come down after dinner is over and have yours in the kitchen  oh all right said davy somewhat comforted i know annell save some nice bones for me wont you anne cause you know i didnt mean to fall on the pies say anne since they are spoiled cant i take some of the pieces upstairs with me  no no lemon pie for you master davy said marilla pushing him toward the hall  what shall we do for dessert asked anne looking regretfully at the wreck and ruin  get out a crock of strawberry preserves said marilla consolingly theres plenty of whipped cream left in the bowl for it  one oclock came    but no priscilla or mrs morgan anne was in an agony everything was done to a turn and the soup was just what soup should be but couldnt be depended on to remain so for any length of time  i dont believe theyre coming after all said marilla crossly  anne and diana sought comfort in each others eyes  at half past one marilla again emerged from the parlor  girls we must have dinner everybody is hungry and its no use waiting any longer priscilla and mrs morgan are not coming thats plain and nothing is being improved by waiting  anne and diana set about lifting the dinner with all the zest gone out of the performance  i dont believe ill be able to eat a mouthful said diana dolefully  nor i but i hope everything will be nice for miss stacys and mr and mrs allans sakes said anne listlessly  when diana dished the peas she tasted them and a very peculiar expression crossed her face  anne did you put sugar in these peas  yes said anne mashing the potatoes with the air of one expected to do her duty i put a spoonful of sugar in we always do dont you like it  but i put a spoonful in too when i set them on the stove said diana  anne dropped her masher and tasted the peas also then she made a grimace  how awful i never dreamed you had put sugar in because i knew your mother never does i happened to think of it for a wonder     im always forgetting it    so i popped a spoonful in  its a case of too many cooks i guess said marilla who had listened to this dialogue with a rather guilty expression i didnt think youd remember about the sugar anne for im perfectly certain you never did before    so i put in a spoonful  the guests in the parlor heard peal after peal of laughter from the kitchen but they never knew what the fun was about there were no green peas on the dinner table that day however  well said anne sobering down again with a sigh of recollection we have the salad anyhow and i dont think anything has happened to the beans lets carry the things in and get it over  it cannot be said that that dinner was a notable success socially the allans and miss stacy exerted themselves to save the situation and marillas customary placidity was not noticeably ruffled but anne and diana between their disappointment and the reaction from their excitement of the forenoon could neither talk nor eat anne tried heroically to bear her part in the conversation for the sake of her guests but all the sparkle had been quenched in her for the time being and in spite of her love for the allans and miss stacy she couldnt help thinking how nice it would be when everybody had gone home and she could bury her weariness and disappointment in the pillows of the east gable  there is an old proverb that really seems at times to be inspired    it never rains but it pours the measure of that days tribulations was not yet full just as mr allan had finished returning thanks there arose a strange ominous sound on the stairs as of some hard heavy object bounding from step to step finishing up with a grand smash at the bottom everybody ran out into the hall anne gave a shriek of dismay  at the bottom of the stairs lay a big pink conch shell amid the fragments of what had been miss barrys platter and at the top of the stairs knelt a terrified davy gazing down with wideopen eyes at the havoc  davy said marilla ominously did you throw that conch down on purpose  no i never did whimpered davy i was just kneeling here quiet as quiet to watch you folks through the bannisters and my foot struck that old thing and pushed it off    and im awful hungry    and i do wish youd lick a fellow and have done with it instead of always sending him upstairs to miss all the fun  dont blame davy said anne gathering up the fragments with trembling fingers it was my fault i set that platter there and forgot all about it i am properly punished for my carelessness but oh what will miss barry say  well you know she only bought it so it isnt the same as if it was an heirloom said diana trying to console  the guests went away soon after feeling that it was the most tactful thing to do and anne and diana washed the dishes talking less than they had ever been known to do before then diana went home with a headache and anne went with another to the east gable where she stayed until marilla came home from the post office at sunset with a letter from priscilla written the day before mrs morgan had sprained her ankle so severely that she could not leave her room  and oh anne dear wrote priscilla im so sorry but im afraid we wont get up to green gables at all now for by the time auntys ankle is well she will have to go back to toronto she has to be there by a certain date  well sighed anne laying the letter down on the red sandstone step of the back porch where she was sitting while the twilight rained down out of a dappled sky i always thought it was too good to be true that mrs morgan should really come but there    that speech sounds as pessimistic as miss eliza andrews and im ashamed of making it after all it was not too good to be true    things just as good and far better are coming true for me all the time and i suppose the events of today have a funny side too perhaps when diana and i are old and gray we shall be able to laugh over them but i feel that i cant expect to do it before then for it has truly been a bitter disappointment  youll probably have a good many more and worse disappointments than that before you get through life said marilla who honestly thought she was making a comforting speech it seems to me anne that you are never going to outgrow your fashion of setting your heart so on things and then crashing down into despair because you dont get them  i know im too much inclined that way agreed anne ruefully when i think something nice is going to happen i seem to fly right up on the wings of anticipation and then the first thing i realize i drop down to earth with a thud but really marilla the flying part is glorious as long as it lasts    its like soaring through a sunset i think it almost pays for the thud  well maybe it does admitted marilla id rather walk calmly along and do without both flying and thud but everybody has her own way of living    i used to think there was only one right way     but since ive had you and the twins to bring up i dont feel so sure of it what are you going to do about miss barrys platter  pay her back the twenty dollars she paid for it i suppose im so thankful it wasnt a cherished heirloom because then no money could replace it  maybe you could find one like it somewhere and buy it for her  im afraid not platters as old as that are very scarce mrs lynde couldnt find one anywhere for the supper i only wish i could for of course miss barry would just as soon have one platter as another if both were equally old and genuine marilla look at that big star over mr harrisons maple grove with all that holy hush of silvery sky about it it gives me a feeling that is like a prayer after all when one can see stars and skies like that little disappointments and accidents cant matter so much can they  wheres davy said marilla with an indifferent glance at the star  in bed ive promised to take him and dora to the shore for a picnic tomorrow of course the original agreement was that he must be good but he tried to be good    and i hadnt the heart to disappoint him  youll drown yourself or the twins rowing about the pond in that flat grumbled marilla ive lived here for sixty years and ive never been on the pond yet  well its never too late to mend said anne roguishly suppose you come with us tomorrow well shut green gables up and spend the whole day at the shore daffing the world aside  no thank you said marilla with indignant emphasis id be a nice sight wouldnt i rowing down the pond in a flat i think i hear rachel pronouncing on it theres mr harrison driving away somewhere do you suppose there is any truth in the gossip that mr harrison is going to see isabella andrews  no im sure there isnt he just called there one evening on business with mr harmon andrews and mrs lynde saw him and said she knew he was courting because he had a white collar on i dont believe mr harrison will ever marry he seems to have a prejudice against marriage  well you can never tell about those old bachelors and if he had a white collar on id agree with rachel that it looks suspicious for im sure he never was seen with one before  i think he only put it on because he wanted to conclude a business deal with harmon andrews said anne ive heard him say thats the only time a man needs to be particular about his appearance because if he looks prosperous the party of the second part wont be so likely to try to cheat him i really feel sorry for mr harrison i dont believe he feels satisfied with his life it must be very lonely to have no one to care about except a parrot dont you think but i notice mr harrison doesnt like to be pitied nobody does i imagine  theres gilbert coming up the lane said marilla if he wants you to go for a row on the pond mind you put on your coat and rubbers theres a heavy dew tonight     xviii  an adventure on the tory road   anne said davy sitting up in bed and propping his chin on his hands anne where is sleep people go to sleep every night and of course i know its the place where i do the things i dream but i want to know where it is and how i get there and back without knowing anything about it    and in my nighty too where is it  anne was kneeling at the west gable window watching the sunset sky that was like a great flower with petals of crocus and a heart of fiery yellow she turned her head at davys question and answered dreamily       over the mountains of the moon      down the valley of the shadow  paul irving would have known the meaning of this or made a meaning out of it for himself if he didnt but practical davy who as anne often despairingly remarked hadnt a particle of imagination was only puzzled and disgusted  anne i believe youre just talking nonsense  of course i was dear boy dont you know that it is only very foolish folk who talk sense all the time  well i think you might give a sensible answer when i ask a sensible question said davy in an injured tone  oh you are too little to understand said anne but she felt rather ashamed of saying it for had she not in keen remembrance of many similar snubs administered in her own early years solemnly vowed that she would never tell any child it was too little to understand yet here she was doing it    so wide sometimes is the gulf between theory and practice  well im doing my best to grow said davy but its a thing you cant hurry much if marilla wasnt so stingy with her jam i believe id grow a lot faster  marilla is not stingy davy said anne severely it is very ungrateful of you to say such a thing  theres another word that means the same thing and sounds a lot better but i dont just remember it said davy frowning intently i heard marilla say she was it herself the other day  if you mean economical its a very different thing from being stingy it is an excellent trait in a person if she is economical if marilla had been stingy she wouldnt have taken you and dora when your mother died would you have liked to live with mrs wiggins  you just bet i wouldnt davy was emphatic on that point nor i dont want to go out to uncle richard neither id far rather live here even if marilla is that longtailed word when it comes to jam cause youre here anne say anne wont you tell me a story fore i go to sleep i dont want a fairy story theyre all right for girls i spose but i want something exciting    lots of killing and shooting in it and a house on fire and intrusting things like that  fortunately for anne marilla called out at this moment from her room  anne dianas signaling at a great rate youd better see what she wants  anne ran to the east gable and saw flashes of light coming through the twilight from dianas window in groups of five which meant according to their old childish code come over at once for i have something important to reveal anne threw her white shawl over her head and hastened through the haunted wood and across mr bells pasture corner to orchard slope  ive good news for you anne said diana mother and i have just got home from carmody and i saw mary sentner from spencer vale in mr blairs store she says the old copp girls on the tory road have a willowware platter and she thinks its exactly like the one we had at the supper she says theyll likely sell it for martha copp has never been known to keep anything she could sell but if they wont theres a platter at wesley keysons at spencervale and she knows theyd sell it but she isnt sure its just the same kind as aunt josephines  ill go right over to spencervale after it tomorrow said anne resolutely and you must come with me it will be such a weight off my mind for i have to go to town day after tomorrow and how can i face your aunt josephine without a willowware platter it would be even worse than the time i had to confess about jumping on the spare room bed  both girls laughed over the old memory    concerning which if any of my readers are ignorant and curious i must refer them to annes earlier history  the next afternoon the girls fared forth on their platter hunting expedition it was ten miles to spencervale and the day was not especially pleasant for traveling it was very warm and windless and the dust on the road was such as might have been expected after six weeks of dry weather  oh i do wish it would rain soon sighed anne everything is so parched up the poor fields just seem pitiful to me and the trees seem to be stretching out their hands pleading for rain as for my garden it hurts me every time i go into it i suppose i shouldnt complain about a garden when the farmers crops are suffering so mr harrison says his pastures are so scorched up that his poor cows can hardly get a bite to eat and he feels guilty of cruelty to animals every time he meets their eyes  after a wearisome drive the girls reached spencervale and turned down the tory road    a green solitary highway where the strips of grass between the wheel tracks bore evidence to lack of travel along most of its extent it was lined with thickset young spruces crowding down to the roadway with here and there a break where the back field of a spencervale farm came out to the fence or an expanse of stumps was aflame with fireweed and goldenrod  why is it called the tory road asked anne  mr allan says it is on the principle of calling a place a grove because there are no trees in it said diana for nobody lives along the road except the copp girls and old martin bovyer at the further end who is a liberal the tory government ran the road through when they were in power just to show they were doing something  dianas father was a liberal for which reason she and anne never discussed politics green gables folk had always been conservatives  finally the girls came to the old copp homestead    a place of such exceeding external neatness that even green gables would have suffered by contrast the house was a very oldfashioned one situated on a slope which fact had necessitated the building of a stone basement under one end the house and outbuildings were all whitewashed to a condition of blinding perfection and not a weed was visible in the prim kitchen garden surrounded by its white paling  the shades are all down said diana ruefully i believe that nobody is home  this proved to be the case the girls looked at each other in perplexity  i dont know what to do said anne if i were sure the platter was the right kind i would not mind waiting until they came home but if it isnt it may be too late to go to wesley keysons afterward  diana looked at a certain little square window over the basement  that is the pantry window i feel sure she said because this house is just like uncle charles at newbridge and that is their pantry window the shade isnt down so if we climbed up on the roof of that little house we could look into the pantry and might be able to see the platter do you think it would be any harm  no i dont think so decided anne after due reflection since our motive is not idle curiosity  this important point of ethics being settled anne prepared to mount the aforesaid little house a construction of lathes with a peaked roof which had in times past served as a habitation for ducks the copp girls had given up keeping ducks    because they were such untidy birds   and the house had not been in use for some years save as an abode of correction for setting hens although scrupulously whitewashed it had become somewhat shaky and anne felt rather dubious as she scrambled up from the vantage point of a keg placed on a box  im afraid it wont bear my weight she said as she gingerly stepped on the roof  lean on the window sill advised diana and anne accordingly leaned much to her delight she saw as she peered through the pane a willowware platter exactly such as she was in quest of on the shelf in front of the window so much she saw before the catastrophe came in her joy anne forgot the precarious nature of her footing incautiously ceased to lean on the window sill gave an impulsive little hop of pleasure    and the next moment she had crashed through the roof up to her armpits and there she hung quite unable to extricate herself diana dashed into the duck house and seizing her unfortunate friend by the waist tried to draw her down  ow    dont shrieked poor anne there are some long splinters sticking into me see if you can put something under my feet    then perhaps i can draw myself up  diana hastily dragged in the previously mentioned keg and anne found that it was just sufficiently high to furnish a secure resting place for her feet but she could not release herself  could i pull you out if i crawled up suggested diana  anne shook her head hopelessly  no    the splinters hurt too badly if you can find an axe you might chop me out though oh dear i do really begin to believe that i was born under an illomened star  diana searched faithfully but no axe was to be found  ill have to go for help she said returning to the prisoner  no indeed you wont said anne vehemently if you do the story of this will get out everywhere and i shall be ashamed to show my face no we must just wait until the copp girls come home and bind them to secrecy theyll know where the axe is and get me out im not uncomfortable as long as i keep perfectly still     not uncomfortable in body i mean i wonder what the copp girls value this house at i shall have to pay for the damage ive done but i wouldnt mind that if i were only sure they would understand my motive in peeping in at their pantry window my sole comfort is that the platter is just the kind i want and if miss copp will only sell it to me i shall be resigned to what has happened  what if the copp girls dont come home until after night    or till tomorrow suggested diana  if theyre not back by sunset youll have to go for other assistance i suppose said anne reluctantly but you mustnt go until you really have to oh dear this is a dreadful predicament i wouldnt mind my misfortunes so much if they were romantic as mrs morgans heroines always are but they are always just simply ridiculous fancy what the copp girls will think when they drive into their yard and see a girls head and shoulders sticking out of the roof of one of their outhouses listen    is that a wagon no diana i believe it is thunder  thunder it was undoubtedly and diana having made a hasty pilgrimage around the house returned to announce that a very black cloud was rising rapidly in the northwest  i believe were going to have a heavy thundershower she exclaimed in dismay oh anne what will we do  we must prepare for it said anne tranquilly a thunderstorm seemed a trifle in comparison with what had already happened youd better drive the horse and buggy into that open shed fortunately my parasol is in the buggy here    take my hat with you marilla told me i was a goose to put on my best hat to come to the tory road and she was right as she always is  diana untied the pony and drove into the shed just as the first heavy drops of rain fell there she sat and watched the resulting downpour which was so thick and heavy that she could hardly see anne through it holding the parasol bravely over her bare head there was not a great deal of thunder but for the best part of an hour the rain came merrily down occasionally anne slanted back her parasol and waved an encouraging hand to her friend but conversation at that distance was quite out of the question finally the rain ceased the sun came out and diana ventured across the puddles of the yard  did you get very wet she asked anxiously  oh no returned anne cheerfully my head and shoulders are quite dry and my skirt is only a little damp where the rain beat through the lathes dont pity me diana for i havent minded it at all i kept thinking how much good the rain will do and how glad my garden must be for it and imagining what the flowers and buds would think when the drops began to fall i imagined out a most interesting dialogue between the asters and the sweet peas and the wild canaries in the lilac bush and the guardian spirit of the garden when i go home i mean to write it down i wish i had a pencil and paper to do it now because i daresay ill forget the best parts before i reach home  diana the faithful had a pencil and discovered a sheet of wrapping paper in the box of the buggy anne folded up her dripping parasol put on her hat spread the wrapping paper on a shingle diana handed up and wrote out her garden idyl under conditions that could hardly be considered as favorable to literature nevertheless the result was quite pretty and diana was enraptured when anne read it to her  oh anne its sweet    just sweet do send it to the canadian woman  anne shook her head  oh no it wouldnt be suitable at all there is no plot in it you see its just a string of fancies i like writing such things but of course nothing of the sort would ever do for publication for editors insist on plots so priscilla says oh theres miss sarah copp now please diana go and explain  miss sarah copp was a small person garbed in shabby black with a hat chosen less for vain adornment than for qualities that would wear well she looked as amazed as might be expected on seeing the curious tableau in her yard but when she heard dianas explanation she was all sympathy she hurriedly unlocked the back door produced the axe and with a few skillfull blows set anne free the latter somewhat tired and stiff ducked down into the interior of her prison and thankfully emerged into liberty once more  miss copp she said earnestly i assure you i looked into your pantry window only to discover if you had a willowware platter i didnt see anything elsei didnt look for anything else  bless you thats all right said miss sarah amiably you neednt worrytheres no harm done thank goodness we copps keep our pantries presentable at all times and dont care who sees into them as for that old duckhouse im glad its smashed for maybe now martha will agree to having it taken down she never would before for fear it might come in handy sometime and ive had to whitewash it every spring but you might as well argue with a post as with martha she went to town todayi drove her to the station and you want to buy my platter well what will you give for it  twenty dollars said anne who was never meant to match business wits with a copp or she would not have offered her price at the start  well ill see said miss sarah cautiously that platter is mine fortunately or id never dare to sell it when martha wasnt here as it is i daresay shell raise a fuss marthas the boss of this establishment i can tell you im getting awful tired of living under another womans thumb but come in come in you must be real tired and hungry ill do the best i can for you in the way of tea but i warn you not to expect anything but bread and butter and some cowcumbers martha locked up all the cake and cheese and preserves afore she went she always does because she says im too extravagant with them if company comes  the girls were hungry enough to do justice to any fare and they enjoyed miss sarahs excellent bread and butter and cowcumbers thoroughly when the meal was over miss sarah said  i dont know as i mind selling the platter but its worth twentyfive dollars its a very old platter  diana gave annes foot a gentle kick under the table meaning dont agreeshell let it go for twenty if you hold out but anne was not minded to take any chances in regard to that precious platter she promptly agreed to give twentyfive and miss sarah looked as if she felt sorry she hadnt asked for thirty  well i guess you may have it i want all the money i can scare up just now the fact is miss sarah threw up her head importantly with a proud flush on her thin cheeksim going to be marriedto luther wallace he wanted me twenty years ago i liked him real well but he was poor then and father packed him off i spose i shouldnt have let him go so meek but i was timid and frightened of father besides i didnt know men were so skurse  when the girls were safely away diana driving and anne holding the coveted platter carefully on her lap the green rainfreshened solitudes of the tory road were enlivened by ripples of girlish laughter  ill amuse your aunt josephine with the strange eventful history of this afternoon when i go to town tomorrow weve had a rather trying time but its over now ive got the platter and that rain has laid the dust beautifully so alls well that ends well  were not home yet said diana rather pessimistically and theres no telling what may happen before we are youre such a girl to have adventures anne  having adventures comes natural to some people said anne serenely you just have a gift for them or you havent     xix  just a happy day   after all anne had said to marilla once i believe the nicest and sweetest days are not those on which anything very splendid or wonderful or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures following one another softly like pearls slipping off a string  life at green gables was full of just such days for annes adventures and misadventures like those of other people did not all happen at once but were sprinkled over the year with long stretches of harmless happy days between filled with work and dreams and laughter and lessons such a day came late in august in the forenoon anne and diana rowed the delighted twins down the pond to the sandshore to pick sweet grass and paddle in the surf over which the wind was harping an old lyric learned when the world was young  in the afternoon anne walked down to the old irving place to see paul she found him stretched out on the grassy bank beside the thick fir grove that sheltered the house on the north absorbed in a book of fairy tales he sprang up radiantly at sight of her  oh im so glad youve come teacher he said eagerly because grandmas away youll stay and have tea with me wont you its so lonesome to have tea all by oneself you know teacher ive had serious thoughts of asking young mary joe to sit down and eat her tea with me but i expect grandma wouldnt approve she says the french have to be kept in their place and anyhow its difficult to talk with young mary joe she just laughs and says well yous do beat all de kids i ever knowed that isnt my idea of conversation  of course ill stay to tea said anne gaily i was dying to be asked my mouth has been watering for some more of your grandmas delicious shortbread ever since i had tea here before  paul looked very sober  if it depended on me teacher he said standing before anne with his hands in his pockets and his beautiful little face shadowed with sudden care you should have shortbread with a right good will but it depends on mary joe i heard grandma tell her before she left that she wasnt to give me any shortcake because it was too rich for little boys stomachs but maybe mary joe will cut some for you if i promise i wont eat any let us hope for the best  yes let us agreed anne whom this cheerful philosophy suited exactly and if mary joe proves hardhearted and wont give me any shortbread it doesnt matter in the least so you are not to worry over that  youre sure you wont mind if she doesnt said paul anxiously  perfectly sure dear heart  then i wont worry said paul with a long breath of relief especially as i really think mary joe will listen to reason shes not a naturally unreasonable person but she has learned by experience that it doesnt do to disobey grandmas orders grandma is an excellent woman but people must do as she tells them she was very much pleased with me this morning because i managed at last to eat all my plateful of porridge it was a great effort but i succeeded grandma says she thinks shell make a man of me yet but teacher i want to ask you a very important question you will answer it truthfully wont you  ill try promised anne  do you think im wrong in my upper story asked paul as if his very existence depended on her reply  goodness no paul exclaimed anne in amazement certainly youre not what put such an idea into your head  mary joe    but she didnt know i heard her mrs peter sloanes hired girl veronica came to see mary joe last evening and i heard them talking in the kitchen as i was going through the hall i heard mary joe say dat paul he is de queeres leetle boy he talks dat queer i tink deres someting wrong in his upper story i couldnt sleep last night for ever so long thinking of it and wondering if mary joe was right i couldnt bear to ask grandma about it somehow but i made up my mind id ask you im so glad you think im all right in my upper story  of course you are mary joe is a silly ignorant girl and you are never to worry about anything she says said anne indignantly secretly resolving to give mrs irving a discreet hint as to the advisability of restraining mary joes tongue  well thats a weight off my mind said paul im perfectly happy now teacher thanks to you it wouldnt be nice to have something wrong in your upper story would it teacher i suppose the reason mary joe imagines i have is because i tell her what i think about things sometimes  it is a rather dangerous practice admitted anne out of the depths of her own experience  well by and by ill tell you the thoughts i told mary joe and you can see for yourself if theres anything queer in them said paul but ill wait till it begins to get dark that is the time i ache to tell people things and when nobody else is handy i just have to tell mary joe but after this i wont if it makes her imagine im wrong in my upper story ill just ache and bear it  and if the ache gets too bad you can come up to green gables and tell me your thoughts suggested anne with all the gravity that endeared her to children who so dearly love to be taken seriously  yes i will but i hope davy wont be there when i go because he makes faces at me i dont mind very much because he is such a little boy and i am quite a big one but still it is not pleasant to have faces made at you and davy makes such terrible ones sometimes i am frightened he will never get his face straightened out again he makes them at me in church when i ought to be thinking of sacred things dora likes me though and i like her but not so well as i did before she told minnie may barry that she meant to marry me when i grew up i may marry somebody when i grow up but im far too young to be thinking of it yet dont you think teacher  rather young agreed teacher  speaking of marrying reminds me of another thing that has been troubling me of late continued paul mrs lynde was down here one day last week having tea with grandma and grandma made me show her my little mothers picture    the one father sent me for my birthday present i didnt exactly want to show it to mrs lynde mrs lynde is a good kind woman but she isnt the sort of person you want to show your mothers picture to you know teacher but of course i obeyed grandma mrs lynde said she was very pretty but kind of actressy looking and must have been an awful lot younger than father then she said some of these days your pa will be marrying again likely how will you like to have a new ma master paul well the idea almost took my breath away teacher but i wasnt going to let mrs lynde see that i just looked her straight in the face    like this    and i said mrs lynde father made a pretty good job of picking out my first mother and i could trust him to pick out just as good a one the second time and i can trust him teacher but still i hope if he ever does give me a new mother hell ask my opinion about her before its too late theres mary joe coming to call us to tea ill go and consult with her about the shortbread  as a result of the consultation mary joe cut the shortbread and added a dish of preserves to the bill of fare anne poured the tea and she and paul had a very merry meal in the dim old sitting room whose windows were open to the gulf breezes and they talked so much nonsense that mary joe was quite scandalized and told veronica the next evening that de school mees was as queer as paul after tea paul took anne up to his room to show her his mothers picture which had been the mysterious birthday present kept by mrs irving in the bookcase pauls little lowceilinged room was a soft whirl of ruddy light from the sun that was setting over the sea and swinging shadows from the fir trees that grew close to the square deepset window from out this soft glow and glamor shone a sweet girlish face with tender mother eyes that was hanging on the wall at the foot of the bed  thats my little mother said paul with loving pride i got grandma to hang it there where id see it as soon as i opened my eyes in the morning i never mind not having the light when i go to bed now because it just seems as if my little mother was right here with me father knew just what i would like for a birthday present although he never asked me isnt it wonderful how much fathers do know  your mother was very lovely paul and you look a little like her but her eyes and hair are darker than yours  my eyes are the same color as fathers said paul flying about the room to heap all available cushions on the window seat but fathers hair is gray he has lots of it but it is gray you see father is nearly fifty thats ripe old age isnt it but its only outside hes old inside hes just as young as anybody now teacher please sit here and ill sit at your feet may i lay my head against your knee thats the way my little mother and i used to sit oh this is real splendid i think  now i want to hear those thoughts which mary joe pronounces so queer said anne patting the mop of curls at her side paul never needed any coaxing to tell his thoughts    at least to congenial souls  i thought them out in the fir grove one night he said dreamily of course i didnt believe them but i thought them you know teacher and then i wanted to tell them to somebody and there was nobody but mary joe mary joe was in the pantry setting bread and i sat down on the bench beside her and i said mary joe do you know what i think i think the evening star is a lighthouse on the land where the fairies dwell and mary joe said well yous are de queer one dare aint no such ting as fairies i was very much provoked of course i knew there are no fairies but that neednt prevent my thinking there is you know teacher but i tried again quite patiently i said well then mary joe do you know what i think i think an angel walks over the world after the sun sets    a great tall white angel with silvery folded wings     and sings the flowers and birds to sleep children can hear him if they know how to listen then mary joe held up her hands all over flour and said well yous are de queer leetle boy yous make me feel scare and she really did looked scared i went out then and whispered the rest of my thoughts to the garden there was a little birch tree in the garden and it died grandma says the salt spray killed it but i think the dryad belonging to it was a foolish dryad who wandered away to see the world and got lost and the little tree was so lonely it died of a broken heart  and when the poor foolish little dryad gets tired of the world and comes back to her tree her heart will break said anne  yes but if dryads are foolish they must take the consequences just as if they were real people said paul gravely do you know what i think about the new moon teacher i think it is a little golden boat full of dreams  and when it tips on a cloud some of them spill out and fall into your sleep  exactly teacher oh you do know and i think the violets are little snips of the sky that fell down when the angels cut out holes for the stars to shine through and the buttercups are made out of old sunshine and i think the sweet peas will be butterflies when they go to heaven now teacher do you see anything so very queer about those thoughts  no laddie dear they are not queer at all they are strange and beautiful thoughts for a little boy to think and so people who couldnt think anything of the sort themselves if they tried for a hundred years think them queer but keep on thinking them paul     some day you are going to be a poet i believe  when anne reached home she found a very different type of boyhood waiting to be put to bed davy was sulky and when anne had undressed him he bounced into bed and buried his face in the pillow  davy you have forgotten to say your prayers said anne rebukingly  no i didnt forget said davy defiantly but i aint going to say my prayers any more im going to give up trying to be good cause no matter how good i am youd like paul irving better so i might as well be bad and have the fun of it  i dont like paul irving better said anne seriously i like you just as well only in a different way  but i want you to like me the same way pouted davy  you cant like different people the same way you dont like dora and me the same way do you  davy sat up and reflected  no    o    o he admitted at last i like dora because shes my sister but i like you because youre you  and i like paul because he is paul and davy because he is davy said anne gaily  well i kind of wish id said my prayers then said davy convinced by this logic but its too much bother getting out now to say them ill say them twice over in the morning anne wont that do as well  no anne was positive it would not do as well so davy scrambled out and knelt down at her knee when he had finished his devotions he leaned back on his little bare brown heels and looked up at her  anne im gooder than i used to be  yes indeed you are davy said anne who never hesitated to give credit where credit was due  i know im gooder said davy confidently and ill tell you how i know it today marilla give me two pieces of bread and jam one for me and one for dora one was a good deal bigger than the other and marilla didnt say which was mine but i give the biggest piece to dora that was good of me wasnt it  very good and very manly davy  of course admitted davy dora wasnt very hungry and she only et half her slice and then she give the rest to me but i didnt know she was going to do that when i give it to her so i was good anne  in the twilight anne sauntered down to the dryads bubble and saw gilbert blythe coming down through the dusky haunted wood she had a sudden realization that gilbert was a schoolboy no longer and how manly he lookedthe tall frankfaced fellow with the clear straightforward eyes and the broad shoulders anne thought gilbert was a very handsome lad even though he didnt look at all like her ideal man she and diana had long ago decided what kind of a man they admired and their tastes seemed exactly similar he must be very tall and distinguished looking with melancholy inscrutable eyes and a melting sympathetic voice there was nothing either melancholy or inscrutable in gilberts physiognomy but of course that didnt matter in friendship  gilbert stretched himself out on the ferns beside the bubble and looked approvingly at anne if gilbert had been asked to describe his ideal woman the description would have answered point for point to anne even to those seven tiny freckles whose obnoxious presence still continued to vex her soul gilbert was as yet little more than a boy but a boy has his dreams as have others and in gilberts future there was always a girl with big limpid gray eyes and a face as fine and delicate as a flower he had made up his mind also that his future must be worthy of its goddess even in quiet avonlea there were temptations to be met and faced white sands youth were a rather fast set and gilbert was popular wherever he went but he meant to keep himself worthy of annes friendship and perhaps some distant day her love and he watched over word and thought and deed as jealously as if her clear eyes were to pass in judgment on it she held over him the unconscious influence that every girl whose ideals are high and pure wields over her friends an influence which would endure as long as she was faithful to those ideals and which she would as certainly lose if she were ever false to them in gilberts eyes annes greatest charm was the fact that she never stooped to the petty practices of so many of the avonlea girlsthe small jealousies the little deceits and rivalries the palpable bids for favor anne held herself apart from all this not consciously or of design but simply because anything of the sort was utterly foreign to her transparent impulsive nature crystal clear in its motives and aspirations  but gilbert did not attempt to put his thoughts into words for he had already too good reason to know that anne would mercilessly and frostily nip all attempts at sentiment in the budor laugh at him which was ten times worse  you look like a real dryad under that birch tree he said teasingly  i love birch trees said anne laying her cheek against the creamy satin of the slim bole with one of the pretty caressing gestures that came so natural to her  then youll be glad to hear that mr major spencer has decided to set out a row of white birches all along the road front of his farm by way of encouraging the avis said gilbert he was talking to me about it today major spencer is the most progressive and publicspirited man in avonlea and mr william bell is going to set out a spruce hedge along his road front and up his lane our society is getting on splendidly anne it is past the experimental stage and is an accepted fact the older folks are beginning to take an interest in it and the white sands people are talking of starting one too even elisha wright has come around since that day the americans from the hotel had the picnic at the shore they praised our roadsides so highly and said they were so much prettier than in any other part of the island and when in due time the other farmers follow mr spencers good example and plant ornamental trees and hedges along their road fronts avonlea will be the prettiest settlement in the province  the aids are talking of taking up the graveyard said anne and i hope they will because there will have to be a subscription for that and it would be no use for the society to try it after the hall affair but the aids would never have stirred in the matter if the society hadnt put it into their thoughts unofficially those trees we planted on the church grounds are flourishing and the trustees have promised me that they will fence in the school grounds next year if they do ill have an arbor day and every scholar shall plant a tree and well have a garden in the corner by the road  weve succeeded in almost all our plans so far except in getting the old boulter house removed said gilbert and ive given that up in despair levi wont have it taken down just to vex us theres a contrary streak in all the boulters and its strongly developed in him  julia bell wants to send another committee to him but i think the better way will just be to leave him severely alone said anne sagely  and trust to providence as mrs lynde says smiled gilbert certainly no more committees they only aggravate him julia bell thinks you can do anything if you only have a committee to attempt it next spring anne we must start an agitation for nice lawns and grounds well sow good seed betimes this winter ive a treatise here on lawns and lawnmaking and im going to prepare a paper on the subject soon well i suppose our vacation is almost over school opens monday has ruby gillis got the carmody school  yes priscilla wrote that she had taken her own home school so the carmody trustees gave it to ruby im sorry priscilla is not coming back but since she cant im glad ruby has got the school she will be home for saturdays and it will seem like old times to have her and jane and diana and myself all together again  marilla just home from mrs lyndes was sitting on the back porch step when anne returned to the house  rachel and i have decided to have our cruise to town tomorrow she said mr lynde is feeling better this week and rachel wants to go before he has another sick spell  i intend to get up extra early tomorrow morning for ive ever so much to do said anne virtuously for one thing im going to shift the feathers from my old bedtick to the new one i ought to have done it long ago but ive just kept putting it off     its such a detestable task its a very bad habit to put off disagreeable things and i never mean to again or else i cant comfortably tell my pupils not to do it that would be inconsistent then i want to make a cake for mr harrison and finish my paper on gardens for the avis and write stella and wash and starch my muslin dress and make doras new apron  you wont get half done said marilla pessimistically i never yet planned to do a lot of things but something happened to prevent me     xx  the way it often happens   anne rose betimes the next morning and blithely greeted the fresh day when the banners of the sunrise were shaken triumphantly across the pearly skies green gables lay in a pool of sunshine flecked with the dancing shadows of poplar and willow beyond the land was mr harrisons wheatfield a great windrippled expanse of pale gold the world was so beautiful that anne spent ten blissful minutes hanging idly over the garden gate drinking the loveliness in  after breakfast marilla made ready for her journey dora was to go with her having been long promised this treat  now davy you try to be a good boy and dont bother anne she straitly charged him if you are good ill bring you a striped candy cane from town  for alas marilla had stooped to the evil habit of bribing people to be good  i wont be bad on purpose but sposen im bad zacksidentally davy wanted to know  youll have to guard against accidents admonished marilla anne if mr shearer comes today get a nice roast and some steak if he doesnt youll have to kill a fowl for dinner tomorrow  anne nodded  im not going to bother cooking any dinner for just davy and myself today she said that cold ham bone will do for noon lunch and ill have some steak fried for you when you come home at night  im going to help mr harrison haul dulse this morning announced davy he asked me to and i guess hell ask me to dinner too mr harrison is an awful kind man hes a real sociable man i hope ill be like him when i grow up i mean behave like him    i dont want to look like him but i guess theres no danger for mrs lynde says im a very handsome child do you spose itll last anne i want to know  i daresay it will said anne gravely you are a handsome boy davy     marilla looked volumes of disapproval    but you must live up to it and be just as nice and gentlemanly as you look to be  and you told minnie may barry the other day when you found her crying cause some one said she was ugly that if she was nice and kind and loving people wouldnt mind her looks said davy discontentedly seems to me you cant get out of being good in this world for some reason or nother you just have to behave  dont you want to be good asked marilla who had learned a great deal but had not yet learned the futility of asking such questions  yes i want to be good but not too good said davy cautiously you dont have to be very good to be a sunday school superintendent mr bells that and hes a real bad man  indeed hes not said marila indignantly  he is    he says he is himself asseverated davy he said it when he prayed in sunday school last sunday he said he was a vile worm and a miserable sinner and guilty of the blackest niquity what did he do that was so bad marilla did he kill anybody or steal the collection cents i want to know  fortunately mrs lynde came driving up the lane at this moment and marilla made off feeling that she had escaped from the snare of the fowler and wishing devoutly that mr bell were not quite so highly figurative in his public petitions especially in the hearing of small boys who were always wanting to know  anne left alone in her glory worked with a will the floor was swept the beds made the hens fed the muslin dress washed and hung out on the line then anne prepared for the transfer of feathers she mounted to the garret and donned the first old dress that came to hand    a navy blue cashmere she had worn at fourteen it was decidedly on the short side and as skimpy as the notable wincey anne had worn upon the occasion of her debut at green gables but at least it would not be materially injured by down and feathers anne completed her toilet by tying a big red and white spotted handkerchief that had belonged to matthew over her head and thus accoutred betook herself to the kitchen chamber whither marilla before her departure had helped her carry the feather bed  a cracked mirror hung by the chamber window and in an unlucky moment anne looked into it there were those seven freckles on her nose more rampant than ever or so it seemed in the glare of light from the unshaded window  oh i forgot to rub that lotion on last night she thought id better run down to the pantry and do it now  anne had already suffered many things trying to remove those freckles on one occasion the entire skin had peeled off her nose but the freckles remained a few days previously she had found a recipe for a freckle lotion in a magazine and as the ingredients were within her reach she straightway compounded it much to the disgust of marilla who thought that if providence had placed freckles on your nose it was your bounden duty to leave them there  anne scurried down to the pantry which always dim from the big willow growing close to the window was now almost dark by reason of the shade drawn to exclude flies anne caught the bottle containing the lotion from the shelf and copiously anointed her nose therewith by means of a little sponge sacred to the purpose this important duty done she returned to her work any one who has ever shifted feathers from one tick to another will not need to be told that when anne finished she was a sight to behold her dress was white with down and fluff and her front hair escaping from under the handkerchief was adorned with a veritable halo of feathers at this auspicious moment a knock sounded at the kitchen door  that must be mr shearer thought anne im in a dreadful mess but ill have to run down as i am for hes always in a hurry  down flew anne to the kitchen door if ever a charitable floor did open to swallow up a miserable befeathered damsel the green gables porch floor should promptly have engulfed anne at that moment on the doorstep were standing priscilla grant golden and fair in silk attire a short stout grayhaired lady in a tweed suit and another lady tall stately wonderfully gowned with a beautiful highbred face and large blacklashed violet eyes whom anne instinctively felt as she would have said in her earlier days to be mrs charlotte e morgan  in the dismay of the moment one thought stood out from the confusion of annes mind and she grasped at it as at the proverbial straw all mrs morgans heroines were noted for rising to the occasion no matter what their troubles were they invariably rose to the occasion and showed their superiority over all ills of time space and quantity anne therefore felt it was her duty to rise to the occasion and she did it so perfectly that priscilla afterward declared she never admired anne shirley more than at that moment no matter what her outraged feelings were she did not show them she greeted priscilla and was introduced to her companions as calmly and composedly as if she had been arrayed in purple and fine linen to be sure it was somewhat of a shock to find that the lady she had instinctively felt to be mrs morgan was not mrs morgan at all but an unknown mrs pendexter while the stout little grayhaired woman was mrs morgan but in the greater shock the lesser lost its power anne ushered her guests to the spare room and thence into the parlor where she left them while she hastened out to help priscilla unharness her horse  its dreadful to come upon you so unexpectedly as this apologized priscilla but i did not know till last night that we were coming aunt charlotte is going away monday and she had promised to spend today with a friend in town but last night her friend telephoned to her not to come because they were quarantined for scarlet fever so i suggested we come here instead for i knew you were longing to see her we called at the white sands hotel and brought mrs pendexter with us she is a friend of aunts and lives in new york and her husband is a millionaire we cant stay very long for mrs pendexter has to be back at the hotel by five oclock  several times while they were putting away the horse anne caught priscilla looking at her in a furtive puzzled way  she neednt stare at me so anne thought a little resentfully if she doesnt know what it is to change a feather bed she might imagine it  when priscilla had gone to the parlor and before anne could escape upstairs diana walked into the kitchen anne caught her astonished friend by the arm  diana barry who do you suppose is in that parlor at this very moment mrs charlotte e morgan    and a new york millionaires wife    and here i am like this    and not a thing in the house for dinner but a cold ham bone diana  by this time anne had become aware that diana was staring at her in precisely the same bewildered fashion as priscilla had done it was really too much  oh diana dont look at me so she implored you at least must know that the neatest person in the world couldnt empty feathers from one tick into another and remain neat in the process  it    it    isnt the feathers hesitated diana its    its    your nose anne  my nose oh diana surely nothing has gone wrong with it  anne rushed to the little looking glass over the sink one glance revealed the fatal truth her nose was a brilliant scarlet  anne sat down on the sofa her dauntless spirit subdued at last  what is the matter with it asked diana curiosity overcoming delicacy  i thought i was rubbing my freckle lotion on it but i must have used that red dye marilla has for marking the pattern on her rugs was the despairing response what shall i do  wash it off said diana practically  perhaps it wont wash off first i dye my hair then i dye my nose marilla cut my hair off when i dyed it but that remedy would hardly be practicable in this case well this is another punishment for vanity and i suppose i deserve it    though theres not much comfort in that it is really almost enough to make one believe in illluck though mrs lynde says there is no such thing because everything is foreordained  fortunately the dye washed off easily and anne somewhat consoled betook herself to the east gable while diana ran home presently anne came down again clothed and in her right mind the muslin dress she had fondly hoped to wear was bobbing merrily about on the line outside so she was forced to content herself with her black lawn she had the fire on and the tea steeping when diana returned the latter wore her muslin at least and carried a covered platter in her hand  mother sent you this she said lifting the cover and displaying a nicely carved and jointed chicken to annes greatful eyes  the chicken was supplemented by light new bread excellent butter and cheese marillas fruit cake and a dish of preserved plums floating in their golden syrup as in congealed summer sunshine there was a big bowlful of pinkandwhite asters also by way of decoration yet the spread seemed very meager beside the elaborate one formerly prepared for mrs morgan  annes hungry guests however did not seem to think anything was lacking and they ate the simple viands with apparent enjoyment but after the first few moments anne thought no more of what was or was not on her bill of fare mrs morgans appearance might be somewhat disappointing as even her loyal worshippers had been forced to admit to each other but she proved to be a delightful conversationalist she had traveled extensively and was an excellent storyteller she had seen much of men and women and crystalized her experiences into witty little sentences and epigrams which made her hearers feel as if they were listening to one of the people in clever books but under all her sparkle there was a strongly felt undercurrent of true womanly sympathy and kindheartedness which won affection as easily as her brilliancy won admiration nor did she monopolize the conversation she could draw others out as skillfully and fully as she could talk herself and anne and diana found themselves chattering freely to her mrs pendexter said little she merely smiled with her lovely eyes and lips and ate chicken and fruit cake and preserves with such exquisite grace that she conveyed the impression of dining on ambrosia and honeydew but then as anne said to diana later on anybody so divinely beautiful as mrs pendexter didnt need to talk it was enough for her just to look  after dinner they all had a walk through lovers lane and violet vale and the birch path then back through the haunted wood to the dryads bubble where they sat down and talked for a delightful last half hour mrs morgan wanted to know how the haunted wood came by its name and laughed until she cried when she heard the story and annes dramatic account of a certain memorable walk through it at the witching hour of twilight  it has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul hasnt it said anne when her guests had gone and she and diana were alone again i dont know which i enjoyed more    listening to mrs morgan or gazing at mrs pendexter i believe we had a nicer time than if wed known they were coming and been cumbered with much serving you must stay to tea with me diana and well talk it all over  priscilla says mrs pendexters husbands sister is married to an english earl and yet she took a second helping of the plum preserves said diana as if the two facts were somehow incompatible  i daresay even the english earl himself wouldnt have turned up his aristocratic nose at marillas plum preserves said anne proudly  anne did not mention the misfortune which had befallen her nose when she related the days history to marilla that evening but she took the bottle of freckle lotion and emptied it out of the window  i shall never try any beautifying messes again she said darkly resolute they may do for careful deliberate people but for anyone so hopelessly given over to making mistakes as i seem to be its tempting fate to meddle with them     xxi  sweet miss lavendar   school opened and anne returned to her work with fewer theories but considerably more experience she had several new pupils six and sevenyearolds just venturing roundeyed into a world of wonder among them were davy and dora davy sat with milty boulter who had been going to school for a year and was therefore quite a man of the world dora had made a compact at sunday school the previous sunday to sit with lily sloane but lily sloane not coming the first day she was temporarily assigned to mirabel cotton who was ten years old and therefore in doras eyes one of the big girls  i think school is great fun davy told marilla when he got home that night you said id find it hard to sit still and i did     you mostly do tell the truth i notice    but you can wriggle your legs about under the desk and that helps a lot its splendid to have so many boys to play with i sit with milty boulter and hes fine hes longer than me but im wider its nicer to sit in the back seats but you cant sit there till your legs grow long enough to touch the floor milty drawed a picture of anne on his slate and it was awful ugly and i told him if he made pictures of anne like that id lick him at recess i thought first id draw one of him and put horns and a tail on it but i was afraid it would hurt his feelings and anne says you should never hurt anyones feelings it seems its dreadful to have your feelings hurt its better to knock a boy down than hurt his feelings if you must do something milty said he wasnt scared of me but hed just as soon call it somebody else to blige me so he rubbed out annes name and printed barbara shaws under it milty doesnt like barbara cause she calls him a sweet little boy and once she patted him on his head  dora said primly that she liked school but she was very quiet even for her and when at twilight marilla bade her go upstairs to bed she hesitated and began to cry  im    im frightened she sobbed i    i dont want to go upstairs alone in the dark  what notion have you got into your head now demanded marilla im sure youve gone to bed alone all summer and never been frightened before  dora still continued to cry so anne picked her up cuddled her sympathetically and whispered  tell anne all about it sweetheart what are you frightened of  of    of mirabel cottons uncle sobbed dora mirabel cotton told me all about her family today in school nearly everybody in her family has died    all her grandfathers and grandmothers and ever so many uncles and aunts they have a habit of dying mirabel says mirabels awful proud of having so many dead relations and she told me what they all died of and what they said and how they looked in their coffins and mirabel says one of her uncles was seen walking around the house after he was buried her mother saw him i dont mind the rest so much but i cant help thinking about that uncle  anne went upstairs with dora and sat by her until she fell asleep the next day mirabel cotton was kept in at recess and gently but firmly given to understand that when you were so unfortunate as to possess an uncle who persisted in walking about houses after he had been decently interred it was not in good taste to talk about that eccentric gentleman to your deskmate of tender years mirabel thought this very harsh the cottons had not much to boast of how was she to keep up her prestige among her schoolmates if she were forbidden to make capital out of the family ghost  september slipped by into a gold and crimson graciousness of october one friday evening diana came over  id a letter from ella kimball today anne and she wants us to go over to tea tomorrow afternoon to meet her cousin irene trent from town but we cant get one of our horses to go for theyll all be in use tomorrow and your pony is lame    so i suppose we cant go  why cant we walk suggested anne if we go straight back through the woods well strike the west grafton road not far from the kimball place i was through that way last winter and i know the road its no more than four miles and we wont have to walk home for oliver kimball will be sure to drive us hell be only too glad of the excuse for he goes to see carrie sloane and they say his father will hardly ever let him have a horse  it was accordingly arranged that they should walk and the following afternoon they set out going by way of lovers lane to the back of the cuthbert farm where they found a road leading into the heart of acres of glimmering beech and maple woods which were all in a wondrous glow of flame and gold lying in a great purple stillness and peace  its as if the year were kneeling to pray in a vast cathedral full of mellow stained light isnt it said anne dreamily it doesnt seem right to hurry through it does it it seems irreverent like running in a church  we must hurry though said diana glancing at her watch weve left ourselves little enough time as it is  well ill walk fast but dont ask me to talk said anne quickening her pace i just want to drink the days loveliness in    i feel as if she were holding it out to my lips like a cup of airy wine and ill take a sip at every step  perhaps it was because she was so absorbed in drinking it in that anne took the left turning when they came to a fork in the road she should have taken the right but ever afterward she counted it the most fortunate mistake of her life they came out finally to a lonely grassy road with nothing in sight along it but ranks of spruce saplings  why where are we exclaimed diana in bewilderment this isnt the west grafton road  no its the base line road in middle grafton said anne rather shamefacedly i must have taken the wrong turning at the fork i dont know where we are exactly but we must be all of three miles from kimballs still  then we cant get there by five for its half past four now said diana with a despairing look at her watch well arrive after they have had their tea and theyll have all the bother of getting ours over again  wed better turn back and go home suggested anne humbly but diana after consideration vetoed this  no we may as well go and spend the evening since we have come this far  a few yards further on the girls came to a place where the road forked again  which of these do we take asked diana dubiously  anne shook her head  i dont know and we cant afford to make any more mistakes here is a gate and a lane leading right into the wood there must be a house at the other side let us go down and inquire  what a romantic old lane this it said diana as they walked along its twists and turns it ran under patriarchal old firs whose branches met above creating a perpetual gloom in which nothing except moss could grow on either hand were brown wood floors crossed here and there by fallen lances of sunlight all was very still and remote as if the world and the cares of the world were far away  i feel as if we were walking through an enchanted forest said anne in a hushed tone do you suppose well ever find our way back to the real world again diana we shall presently come to a palace with a spellbound princess in it i think  around the next turn they came in sight not indeed of a palace but of a little house almost as surprising as a palace would have been in this province of conventional wooden farmhouses all as much alike in general characteristics as if they had grown from the same seed anne stopped short in rapture and diana exclaimed oh i know where we are now that is the little stone house where miss lavendar lewis lives    echo lodge she calls it i think ive often heard of it but ive never seen it before isnt it a romantic spot  its the sweetest prettiest place i ever saw or imagined said anne delightedly it looks like a bit out of a story book or a dream  the house was a loweaved structure built of undressed blocks of red island sandstone with a little peaked roof out of which peered two dormer windows with quaint wooden hoods over them and two great chimneys the whole house was covered with a luxuriant growth of ivy finding easy foothold on the rough stonework and turned by autumn frosts to most beautiful bronze and winered tints  before the house was an oblong garden into which the lane gate where the girls were standing opened the house bounded it on one side on the three others it was enclosed by an old stone dyke so overgrown with moss and grass and ferns that it looked like a high green bank on the right and left the tall dark spruces spread their palmlike branches over it but below it was a little meadow green with clover aftermath sloping down to the blue loop of the grafton river no other house or clearing was in sight    nothing but hills and valleys covered with feathery young firs  i wonder what sort of a person miss lewis is speculated diana as they opened the gate into the garden they say she is very peculiar  shell be interesting then said anne decidedly peculiar people are always that at least whatever else they are or are not didnt i tell you we would come to an enchanted palace i knew the elves hadnt woven magic over that lane for nothing  but miss lavendar lewis is hardly a spellbound princess laughed diana shes an old maid    shes fortyfive and quite gray ive heard  oh thats only part of the spell asserted anne confidently at heart shes young and beautiful still    and if we only knew how to unloose the spell she would step forth radiant and fair again but we dont know how    its always and only the prince who knows that    and miss lavendars prince hasnt come yet perhaps some fatal mischance has befallen him    though thats against the law of all fairy tales  im afraid he came long ago and went away again said diana they say she used to be engaged to stephan irving    pauls father    when they were young but they quarreled and parted  hush warned anne the door is open  the girls paused in the porch under the tendrils of ivy and knocked at the open door there was a patter of steps inside and a rather odd little personage presented herself    a girl of about fourteen with a freckled face a snub nose a mouth so wide that it did really seem as if it stretched from ear to ear and two long braids of fair hair tied with two enormous bows of blue ribbon  is miss lewis at home asked diana  yes maam come in maam ill tell miss lavendar youre here maam shes upstairs maam  with this the small handmaiden whisked out of sight and the girls left alone looked about them with delighted eyes the interior of this wonderful little house was quite as interesting as its exterior  the room had a low ceiling and two square smallpaned windows curtained with muslin frills all the furnishings were oldfashioned but so well and daintily kept that the effect was delicious but it must be candidly admitted that the most attractive feature to two healthy girls who had just tramped four miles through autumn air was a table set out with pale blue china and laden with delicacies while little goldenhued ferns scattered over the cloth gave it what anne would have termed a festal air  miss lavendar must be expecting company to tea she whispered there are six places set but what a funny little girl she has she looked like a messenger from pixy land i suppose she could have told us the road but i was curious to see miss lavendar s    s    sh shes coming  and with that miss lavendar lewis was standing in the doorway the girls were so surprised that they forgot good manners and simply stared they had unconsciously been expecting to see the usual type of elderly spinster as known to their experience     a rather angular personage with prim gray hair and spectacles nothing more unlike miss lavendar could possibly be imagined  she was a little lady with snowwhite hair beautifully wavy and thick and carefully arranged in becoming puffs and coils beneath it was an almost girlish face pink cheeked and sweet lipped with big soft brown eyes and dimples    actually dimples she wore a very dainty gown of cream muslin with palehued roses on it    a gown which would have seemed ridiculously juvenile on most women of her age but which suited miss lavendar so perfectly that you never thought about it at all  charlotta the fourth says that you wished to see me she said in a voice that matched her appearance  we wanted to ask the right road to west grafton said diana we are invited to tea at mr kimballs but we took the wrong path coming through the woods and came out to the base line instead of the west grafton road do we take the right or left turning at your gate  the left said miss lavendar with a hesitating glance at her tea table then she exclaimed as if in a sudden little burst of resolution  but oh wont you stay and have tea with me please do mr kimballs will have tea over before you get there and charlotta the fourth and i will be so glad to have you  diana looked mute inquiry at anne  wed like to stay said anne promptly for she had made up her mind that she wanted to know more of this surprising miss lavendar if it wont inconvenience you but you are expecting other guests arent you  miss lavendar looked at her tea table again and blushed  i know youll think me dreadfully foolish she said i am foolish    and im ashamed of it when im found out but never unless i am found out im not expecting anybody    i was just pretending i was you see i was so lonely i love company     that is the right kind of company but so few people ever come here because it is so far out of the way charlotta the fourth was lonely too so i just pretended i was going to have a tea party i cooked for it    and decorated the table for it  and set it with my mothers wedding china     and i dressed up for it diana secretly thought miss lavendar quite as peculiar as report had pictured her the idea of a woman of fortyfive playing at having a tea party just as if she were a little girl but anne of the shining eyes exclaimed joyfuly oh do you imagine things too  that too revealed a kindred spirit to miss lavendar  yes i do she confessed boldly of course its silly in anybody as old as i am but what is the use of being an independent old maid if you cant be silly when you want to and when it doesnt hurt anybody a person must have some compensations i dont believe i could live at times if i didnt pretend things im not often caught at it though and charlotta the fourth never tells but im glad to be caught today for you have really come and i have tea all ready for you will you go up to the spare room and take off your hats its the white door at the head of the stairs i must run out to the kitchen and see that charlotta the fourth isnt letting the tea boil charlotta the fourth is a very good girl but she will let the tea boil  miss lavendar tripped off to the kitchen on hospitable thoughts intent and the girls found their way up to the spare room an apartment as white as its door lighted by the ivyhung dormer window and looking as anne said like the place where happy dreams grew  this is quite an adventure isnt it said diana and isnt miss lavendar sweet if she is a little odd she doesnt look a bit like an old maid  she looks just as music sounds i think answered anne  when they went down miss lavendar was carrying in the teapot and behind her looking vastly pleased was charlotta the fourth with a plate of hot biscuits  now you must tell me your names said miss lavendar im so glad you are young girls i love young girls its so easy to pretend im a girl myself when im with them i do hate    with a little grimace    to believe im old now who are you     just for convenience sake diana barry and anne shirley may i pretend that ive known you for a hundred years and call you anne and diana right away  you may the girls said both together  then just lets sit comfily down and eat everything said miss lavendar happily charlotta you sit at the foot and help with the chicken it is so fortunate that i made the sponge cake and doughnuts of course it was foolish to do it for imaginary guests     i know charlotta the fourth thought so didnt you charlotta but you see how well it has turned out of course they wouldnt have been wasted for charlotta the fourth and i could have eaten them through time but sponge cake is not a thing that improves with time  that was a merry and memorable meal and when it was over they all went out to the garden lying in the glamor of sunset  i do think you have the loveliest place here said diana looking round her admiringly  why do you call it echo lodge asked anne  charlotta said miss lavendar go into the house and bring out the little tin horn that is hanging over the clock shelf  charlotta the fourth skipped off and returned with the horn  blow it charlotta commanded miss lavendar  charlotta accordingly blew a rather raucous strident blast there was moments stillness    and then from the woods over the river came a multitude of fairy echoes sweet elusive silvery as if all the horns of elfland were blowing against the sunset anne and diana exclaimed in delight  now laugh charlotta    laugh loudly  charlotta who would probably have obeyed if miss lavendar had told her to stand on her head climbed upon the stone bench and laughed loud and heartily back came the echoes as if a host of pixy people were mimicking her laughter in the purple woodlands and along the firfringed points  people always admire my echoes very much said miss lavendar as if the echoes were her personal property i love them myself they are very good company    with a little pretending on calm evenings charlotta the fourth and i often sit out here and amuse ourselves with them charlotta take back the horn and hang it carefully in its place  why do you call her charlotta the fourth asked diana who was bursting with curiosity on this point  just to keep her from getting mixed up with other charlottas in my thoughts said miss lavendar seriously they all look so much alike theres no telling them apart her name isnt really charlotta at all it is    let me see    what is it i think its leonora    yes it is leonora you see it is this way when mother died ten years ago i couldnt stay here alone     and i couldnt afford to pay the wages of a grownup girl so i got little charlotta bowman to come and stay with me for board and clothes her name really was charlotta    she was charlotta the first she was just thirteen she stayed with me till she was sixteen and then she went away to boston because she could do better there her sister came to stay with me then her name was julietta    mrs bowman had a weakness for fancy names i think    but she looked so like charlotta that i kept calling her that all the time   and she didnt mind so i just gave up trying to remember her right name she was charlotta the second and when she went away evelina came and she was charlotta the third now i have charlotta the fourth but when she is sixteen    shes fourteen now     she will want to go to boston too and what i shall do then i really do not know charlotta the fourth is the last of the bowman girls and the best the other charlottas always let me see that they thought it silly of me to pretend things but charlotta the fourth never does no matter what she may really think i dont care what people think about me if they dont let me see it  well said diana looking regretfully at the setting sun i suppose we must go if we want to get to mr kimballs before dark weve had a lovely time miss lewis  wont you come again to see me pleaded miss lavendar  tall anne put her arm about the little lady  indeed we shall she promised now that we have discovered you well wear out our welcome coming to see you yes we must go     we must tear ourselves away as paul irving says every time he comes to green gables  paul irving there was a subtle change in miss lavendars voice who is he i didnt think there was anybody of that name in avonlea  anne felt vexed at her own heedlessness she had forgotten about miss lavendars old romance when pauls name slipped out  he is a little pupil of mine she explained slowly he came from boston last year to live with his grandmother mrs irving of the shore road  is he stephen irvings son miss lavendar asked bending over her namesake border so that her face was hidden  yes  im going to give you girls a bunch of lavendar apiece said miss lavendar brightly as if she had not heard the answer to her question its very sweet dont you think mother always loved it she planted these borders long ago father named me lavendar because he was so fond of it the very first time he saw mother was when he visited her home in east grafton with her brother he fell in love with her at first sight and they put him in the spare room bed to sleep and the sheets were scented with lavendar and he lay awake all night and thought of her he always loved the scent of lavendar after that    and that was why he gave me the name dont forget to come back soon girls dear well be looking for you charlotta the fourth and i  she opened the gate under the firs for them to pass through she looked suddenly old and tired the glow and radiance had faded from her face her parting smile was as sweet with ineradicable youth as ever but when the girls looked back from the first curve in the lane they saw her sitting on the old stone bench under the silver poplar in the middle of the garden with her head leaning wearily on her hand  she does look lonely said diana softly we must come often to see her  i think her parents gave her the only right and fitting name that could possibly be given her said anne if they had been so blind as to name her elizabeth or nellie or muriel she must have been called lavendar just the same i think its so suggestive of sweetness and oldfashioned graces and silk attire now my name just smacks of bread and butter patchwork and chores  oh i dont think so said diana anne seems to me real stately and like a queen but id like kerrenhappuch if it happened to be your name i think people make their names nice or ugly just by what they are themselves i cant bear josie or gertie for names now but before i knew the pye girls i thought them real pretty  thats a lovely idea diana said anne enthusiastically living so that you beautify your name even if it wasnt beautiful to begin with    making it stand in peoples thoughts for something so lovely and pleasant that they never think of it by itself thank you diana     xxii  odds and ends   so you had tea at the stone house with lavendar lewis said marilla at the breakfast table next morning what is she like now its over fifteen years since i saw her last    it was one sunday in grafton church i suppose she has changed a great deal davy keith when you want something you cant reach ask to have it passed and dont spread yourself over the table in that fashion did you ever see paul irving doing that when he was here to meals  but pauls arms are longern mine brumbled davy theyve had eleven years to grow and mineve only had seven sides i did ask but you and anne was so busy talking you didnt pay any tention sides pauls never been here to any meal escept tea and its easier to be plite at tea than at breakfast you aint half as hungry its an awful long while between supper and breakfast now anne that spoonful aint any bigger than it was last year and im ever so much bigger  of course i dont know what miss lavendar used to look like but i dont fancy somehow that she has changed a great deal said anne after she had helped davy to maple syrup giving him two spoonfuls to pacify him her hair is snowwhite but her face is fresh and almost girlish and she has the sweetest brown eyes    such a pretty shade of woodbrown with little golden glints in them     and her voice makes you think of white satin and tinkling water and fairy bells all mixed up together  she was reckoned a great beauty when she was a girl said marilla i never knew her very well but i liked her as far as i did know her some folks thought her peculiar even then davy if ever i catch you at such a trick again youll be made to wait for your meals till everyone else is done like the french  most conversations between anne and marilla in the presence of the twins were punctuated by these rebukes davyward in this instance davy sad to relate not being able to scoop up the last drops of his syrup with his spoon had solved the difficulty by lifting his plate in both hands and applying his small pink tongue to it anne looked at him with such horrified eyes that the little sinner turned red and said half shamefacedly half defiantly  there aint any wasted that way  people who are different from other people are always called peculiar said anne and miss lavendar is certainly different though its hard to say just where the difference comes in perhaps it is because she is one of those people who never grow old  one might as well grow old when all your generation do said marilla rather reckless of her pronouns if you dont you dont fit in anywhere far as i can learn lavendar lewis has just dropped out of everything shes lived in that out of the way place until everybody has forgotten her that stone house is one of the oldest on the island old mr lewis built it eighty years ago when he came out from england davy stop joggling doras elbow oh i saw you you neednt try to look innocent what does make you behave so this morning  maybe i got out of the wrong side of the bed suggested davy milty boulter says if you do that things are bound to go wrong with you all day his grandmother told him but which is the right side and what are you to do when your beds against the wall i want to know  ive always wondered what went wrong between stephen irving and lavendar lewis continued marilla ignoring davy they were certainly engaged twentyfive years ago and then all at once it was broken off i dont know what the trouble was but it must have been something terrible for he went away to the states and never come home since  perhaps it was nothing very dreadful after all i think the little things in life often make more trouble than the big things said anne with one of those flashes of insight which experience could not have bettered marilla please dont say anything about my being at miss lavendars to mrs lynde shed be sure to ask a hundred questions and somehow i wouldnt like it    nor miss lavendar either if she knew i feel sure  i daresay rachel would be curious admitted marilla though she hasnt as much time as she used to have for looking after other peoples affairs shes tied home now on account of thomas and shes feeling pretty downhearted for i think shes beginning to lose hope of his ever getting better rachel will be left pretty lonely if anything happens to him with all her children settled out west except eliza in town and she doesnt like her husband  marillas pronouns slandered eliza who was very fond of her husband  rachel says if hed only brace up and exert his will power hed get better but what is the use of asking a jellyfish to sit up straight continued marilla thomas lynde never had any will power to exert his mother ruled him till he married and then rachel carried it on its a wonder he dared to get sick without asking her permission but there i shouldnt talk so rachel has been a good wife to him hed never have amounted to anything without her thats certain he was born to be ruled and its well he fell into the hands of a clever capable manager like rachel he didnt mind her way it saved him the bother of ever making up his own mind about anything davy do stop squirming like an eel  ive nothing else to do protested davy i cant eat any more and its no fun watching you and anne eat  well you and dora go out and give the hens their wheat said marilla and dont you try to pull any more feathers out of the white roosters tail either  i wanted some feathers for an injun headdress said davy sulkily milty boulter has a dandy one made out of the feathers his mother give him when she killed their old white gobbler you might let me have some that roosters got ever so many moren he wants  you may have the old feather duster in the garret said anne and ill dye them green and red and yellow for you  you do spoil that boy dreadfully said marilla when davy with a radiant face had followed prim dora out marillas education had made great strides in the past six years but she had not yet been able to rid herself of the idea that it was very bad for a child to have too many of its wishes indulged  all the boys of his class have indian headdresses and davy wants one too said anne i know how it feels    ill never forget how i used to long for puffed sleeves when all the other girls had them and davy isnt being spoiled he is improving every day think what a difference there is in him since he came here a year ago  he certainly doesnt get into as much mischief since he began to go to school acknowledged marilla i suppose he works off the tendency with the other boys but its a wonder to me we havent heard from richard keith before this never a word since last may  ill be afraid to hear from him sighed anne beginning to clear away the dishes if a letter should come id dread opening it for fear it would tell us to send the twins to him  a month later a letter did come but it was not from richard keith a friend of his wrote to say that richard keith had died of consumption a fortnight previously the writer of the letter was the executor of his will and by that will the sum of two thousand dollars was left to miss marilla cuthbert in trust for david and dora keith until they came of age or married in the meantime the interest was to be used for their maintenance  it seems dreadful to be glad of anything in connection with a death said anne soberly im sorry for poor mr keith but i am glad that we can keep the twins  its a very good thing about the money said marilla practically i wanted to keep them but i really didnt see how i could afford to do it especially when they grew older the rent of the farm doesnt do any more than keep the house and i was bound that not a cent of your money should be spent on them you do far too much for them as it is dora didnt need that new hat you bought her any more than a cat needs two tails but now the way is made clear and they are provided for  davy and dora were delighted when they heard that they were to live at green gables for good the death of an uncle whom they had never seen could not weigh a moment in the balance against that but dora had one misgiving  was uncle richard buried she whispered to anne  yes dear of course  he    he    isnt like mirabel cottons uncle is he in a still more agitated whisper he wont walk about houses after being buried will he anne     xxiii  miss lavendars romance   i think ill take a walk through to echo lodge this evening said anne one friday afternoon in december  it looks like snow said marilla dubiously  ill be there before the snow comes and i mean to stay all night diana cant go because she has company and im sure miss lavendar will be looking for me tonight its a whole fortnight since i was there  anne had paid many a visit to echo lodge since that october day sometimes she and diana drove around by the road sometimes they walked through the woods when diana could not go anne went alone between her and miss lavendar had sprung up one of those fervent helpful friendships possible only between a woman who has kept the freshness of youth in her heart and soul and a girl whose imagination and intuition supplied the place of experience anne had at last discovered a real kindred spirit while into the little ladys lonely sequestered life of dreams anne and diana came with the wholesome joy and exhilaration of the outer existence which miss lavendar the world forgetting by the world forgot had long ceased to share they brought an atmosphere of youth and reality to the little stone house charlotta the fourth always greeted them with her very widest smile    and charlottas smiles were fearfully wide    loving them for the sake of her adored mistress as well as for their own never had there been such high jinks held in the little stone house as were held there that beautiful latelingering autumn when november seemed october over again and even december aped the sunshine and hazes of summer  but on this particular day it seemed as if december had remembered that it was time for winter and had turned suddenly dull and brooding with a windless hush predictive of coming snow nevertheless anne keenly enjoyed her walk through the great gray maze of the beechlands though alone she never found it lonely her imagination peopled her path with merry companions and with these she carried on a gay pretended conversation that was wittier and more fascinating than conversations are apt to be in real life where people sometimes fail most lamentably to talk up to the requirements in a make believe assembly of choice spirits everybody says just the thing you want her to say and so gives you the chance to say just what you want to say attended by this invisible company anne traversed the woods and arrived at the fir lane just as broad feathery flakes began to flutter down softly  at the first bend she came upon miss lavendar standing under a big broadbranching fir she wore a gown of warm rich red and her head and shoulders were wrapped in a silvery gray silk shawl  you look like the queen of the fir wood fairies called anne merrily  i thought you would come tonight anne said miss lavendar running forward and im doubly glad for charlotta the fourth is away her mother is sick and she had to go home for the night i should have been very lonely if you hadnt come    even the dreams and the echoes wouldnt have been enough company oh anne how pretty you are she added suddenly looking up at the tall slim girl with the soft roseflush of walking on her face how pretty and how young its so delightful to be seventeen isnt it i do envy you concluded miss lavendar candidly  but you are only seventeen at heart smiled anne  no im old    or rather middleaged which is far worse sighed miss lavendar sometimes i can pretend im not but at other times i realize it and i cant reconcile myself to it as most women seem to im just as rebellious as i was when i discovered my first gray hair now anne dont look as if you were trying to understand seventeen cant understand im going to pretend right away that i am seventeen too and i can do it now that youre here you always bring youth in your hand like a gift were going to have a jolly evening tea first    what do you want for tea well have whatever you like do think of something nice and indigestible  there were sounds of riot and mirth in the little stone house that night what with cooking and feasting and making candy and laughing and pretending it is quite true that miss lavendar and anne comported themselves in a fashion entirely unsuited to the dignity of a spinster of fortyfive and a sedate schoolmaam then when they were tired they sat down on the rug before the grate in the parlor lighted only by the soft fireshine and perfumed deliciously by miss lavendars open rosejar on the mantel the wind had risen and was sighing and wailing around the eaves and the snow was thudding softly against the windows as if a hundred storm sprites were tapping for entrance  im so glad youre here anne said miss lavendar nibbling at her candy if you werent i should be blue    very blue     almost navy blue dreams and makebelieves are all very well in the daytime and the sunshine but when dark and storm come they fail to satisfy one wants real things then but you dont know this    seventeen never knows it at seventeen dreams do satisfy because you think the realities are waiting for you further on when i was seventeen anne i didnt think fortyfive would find me a whitehaired little old maid with nothing but dreams to fill my life  but you arent an old maid said anne smiling into miss lavendars wistful woodbrown eyes old maids are born    they dont become  some are born old maids some achieve old maidenhood and some have old maidenhood thrust upon them parodied miss lavendar whimsically  you are one of those who have achieved it then laughed anne and youve done it so beautifully that if every old maid were like you they would come into the fashion i think  i always like to do things as well as possible said miss lavendar meditatively and since an old maid i had to be i was determined to be a very nice one people say im odd but its just because i follow my own way of being an old maid and refuse to copy the traditional pattern anne did anyone ever tell you anything about stephen irving and me  yes said anne candidly ive heard that you and he were engaged once  so we were    twentyfive years ago    a lifetime ago and we were to have been married the next spring i had my wedding dress made although nobody but mother and stephen ever knew that wed been engaged in a way almost all our lives you might say when stephen was a little boy his mother would bring him here when she came to see my mother and the second time he ever came     he was nine and i was six    he told me out in the garden that he had pretty well made up his mind to marry me when he grew up i remember that i said thank you and when he was gone i told mother very gravely that there was a great weight off my mind because i wasnt frightened any more about having to be an old maid how poor mother laughed  and what went wrong asked anne breathlessly  we had just a stupid silly commonplace quarrel so commonplace that if youll believe me i dont even remember just how it began i hardly know who was the more to blame for it stephen did really begin it but i suppose i provoked him by some foolishness of mine he had a rival or two you see i was vain and coquettish and liked to tease him a little he was a very highstrung sensitive fellow well we parted in a temper on both sides but i thought it would all come right and it would have if stephen hadnt come back too soon anne my dear im sorry to say    miss lavendar dropped her voice as if she were about to confess a predilection for murdering people that i am a dreadfully sulky person oh you neednt smile     its only too true i do sulk and stephen came back before i had finished sulking i wouldnt listen to him and i wouldnt forgive him and so he went away for good he was too proud to come again and then i sulked because he didnt come i might have sent for him perhaps but i couldnt humble myself to do that i was just as proud as he was    pride and sulkiness make a very bad combination anne but i could never care for anybody else and i didnt want to i knew i would rather be an old maid for a thousand years than marry anybody who wasnt stephen irving well it all seems like a dream now of course how sympathetic you look anne    as sympathetic as only seventeen can look but dont overdo it im really a very happy contented little person in spite of my broken heart my heart did break if ever a heart did when i realized that stephen irving was not coming back but anne a broken heart in real life isnt half as dreadful as it is in books its a good deal like a bad tooth    though you wont think that a very romantic simile it takes spells of aching and gives you a sleepless night now and then but between times it lets you enjoy life and dreams and echoes and peanut candy as if there were nothing the matter with it and now youre looking disappointed you dont think im half as interesting a person as you did five minutes ago when you believed i was always the prey of a tragic memory bravely hidden beneath external smiles thats the worst    or the best     of real life anne it wont let you be miserable it keeps on trying to make you comfortable    and succeedingeven when youre determined to be unhappy and romantic isnt this candy scrumptious ive eaten far more than is good for me already but im going to keep recklessly on  after a little silence miss lavendar said abruptly  it gave me a shock to hear about stephens son that first day you were here anne ive never been able to mention him to you since but ive wanted to know all about him what sort of a boy is he  he is the dearest sweetest child i ever knew miss lavendar     and he pretends things too just as you and i do  id like to see him said miss lavendar softly as if talking to herself i wonder if he looks anything like the little dreamboy who lives here with me    my little dreamboy  if you would like to see paul ill bring him through with me sometime said anne  i would like it    but not too soon i want to get used to the thought there might be more pain than pleasure in it    if he looked too much like stephen    or if he didnt look enough like him in a months time you may bring him  accordingly a month later anne and paul walked through the woods to the stone house and met miss lavendar in the lane she had not been expecting them just then and she turned very pale  so this is stephens boy she said in a low tone taking pauls hand and looking at him as he stood beautiful and boyish in his smart little fur coat and cap he    he is very like his father  everybody says im a chip off the old block remarked paul quite at his ease  anne who had been watching the little scene drew a relieved breath she saw that miss lavendar and paul had taken to each other and that there would be no constraint or stiffness miss lavendar was a very sensible person in spite of her dreams and romance and after that first little betrayal she tucked her feelings out of sight and entertained paul as brightly and naturally as if he were anybodys son who had come to see her they all had a jolly afternoon together and such a feast of fat things by way of supper as would have made old mrs irving hold up her hands in horror believing that pauls digestion would be ruined for ever  come again laddie said miss lavendar shaking hands with him at parting  you may kiss me if you like said paul gravely  miss lavendar stooped and kissed him  how did you know i wanted to she whispered  because you looked at me just as my little mother used to do when she wanted to kiss me as a rule i dont like to be kissed boys dont you know miss lewis but i think i rather like to have you kiss me and of course ill come to see you again i think id like to have you for a particular friend of mine if you dont object  i    i dont think i shall object said miss lavendar she turned and went in very quickly but a moment later she was waving a gay and smiling goodbye to them from the window  i like miss lavendar announced paul as they walked through the beech woods i like the way she looked at me and i like her stone house and i like charlotta the fourth i wish grandma irving had a charlotta the fourth instead of a mary joe i feel sure charlotta the fourth wouldnt think i was wrong in my upper story when i told her what i think about things wasnt that a splendid tea we had teacher grandma says a boy shouldnt be thinking about what he gets to eat but he cant help it sometimes when he is real hungry you know teacher i dont think miss lavendar would make a boy eat porridge for breakfast if he didnt like it shed get things for him he did like but of course     paul was nothing if not fairminded    that mightnt be very good for him its very nice for a change though teacher you know     xxiv  a prophet in his own country   one may day avonlea folks were mildly excited over some avonlea notes signed observer which appeared in the charlottetown daily enterprise gossip ascribed the authorship thereof to charlie sloane partly because the said charlie had indulged in similar literary flights in times past and partly because one of the notes seemed to embody a sneer at gilbert blythe avonlea juvenile society persisted in regarding gilbert blythe and charlie sloane as rivals in the good graces of a certain damsel with gray eyes and an imagination  gossip as usual was wrong gilbert blythe aided and abetted by anne had written the notes putting in the one about himself as a blind only two of the notes have any bearing on this history  rumor has it that there will be a wedding in our village ere the daisies are in bloom a new and highly respected citizen will lead to the hymeneal altar one of our most popular ladies  uncle abe our wellknown weather prophet predicts a violent storm of thunder and lightning for the evening of the twentythird of may beginning at seven oclock sharp the area of the storm will extend over the greater part of the province people traveling that evening will do well to take umbrellas and mackintoshes with them  uncle abe really has predicted a storm for sometime this spring said gilbert but do you suppose mr harrison really does go to see isabella andrews  no said anne laughing im sure he only goes to play checkers with mr harrison andrews but mrs lynde says she knows isabella andrews must be going to get married shes in such good spirits this spring  poor old uncle abe felt rather indignant over the notes he suspected that observer was making fun of him he angrily denied having assigned any particular date for his storm but nobody believed him  life in avonlea continued on the smooth and even tenor of its way the planting was put in the improvers celebrated an arbor day each improver set out or caused to be set out five ornamental trees as the society now numbered forty members this meant a total of two hundred young trees early oats greened over the red fields apple orchards flung great blossoming arms about the farmhouses and the snow queen adorned itself as a bride for her husband anne liked to sleep with her window open and let the cherry fragrance blow over her face all night she thought it very poetical marilla thought she was risking her life  thanksgiving should be celebrated in the spring said anne one evening to marilla as they sat on the front door steps and listened to the silversweet chorus of the frogs i think it would be ever so much better than having it in november when everything is dead or asleep then you have to remember to be thankful but in may one simply cant help being thankful     that they are alive if for nothing else i feel exactly as eve must have felt in the garden of eden before the trouble began is that grass in the hollow green or golden it seems to me marilla that a pearl of a day like this when the blossoms are out and the winds dont know where to blow from next for sheer crazy delight must be pretty near as good as heaven  marilla looked scandalized and glanced apprehensively around to make sure the twins were not within earshot they came around the corner of the house just then  aint it an awful nicesmelling evening asked davy sniffing delightedly as he swung a hoe in his grimy hands he had been working in his garden that spring marilla by way of turning davys passion for reveling in mud and clay into useful channels had given him and dora a small plot of ground for a garden both had eagerly gone to work in a characteristic fashion dora planted weeded and watered carefully systematically and dispassionately as a result her plot was already green with prim orderly little rows of vegetables and annuals davy however worked with more zeal than discretion he dug and hoed and raked and watered and transplanted so energetically that his seeds had no chance for their lives  how is your garden coming on davyboy asked anne  kind of slow said davy with a sigh i dont know why the things dont grow better milty boulter says i must have planted them in the dark of the moon and thats the whole trouble he says you must never sow seeds or kill pork or cut your hair or do any portant thing in the wrong time of the moon is that true anne i want to know  maybe if you didnt pull your plants up by the roots every other day to see how theyre getting on at the other end theyd do better said marilla sarcastically  i only pulled six of them up protested davy i wanted to see if there was grubs at the roots milty boulter said if it wasnt the moons fault it must be grubs but i only found one grub he was a great big juicy curly grub i put him on a stone and got another stone and smashed him flat he made a jolly squish i tell you i was sorry there wasnt more of them doras garden was planted same times mine and her things are growing all right it cant be the moon davy concluded in a reflective tone  marilla look at that apple tree said anne why the thing is human it is reaching out long arms to pick its own pink skirts daintily up and provoke us to admiration  those yellow duchess trees always bear well said marilla complacently that treell be loaded this year im real glad   theyre great for pies  but neither marilla nor anne nor anybody else was fated to make pies out of yellow duchess apples that year  the twentythird of may came    an unseasonably warm day as none realized more keenly than anne and her little beehive of pupils sweltering over fractions and syntax in the avonlea schoolroom a hot breeze blew all the forenoon but after noon hour it died away into a heavy stillness at half past three anne heard a low rumble of thunder she promptly dismissed school at once so that the children might get home before the storm came  as they went out to the playground anne perceived a certain shadow and gloom over the world in spite of the fact that the sun was still shining brightly annetta bell caught her hand nervously  oh teacher look at that awful cloud  anne looked and gave an exclamation of dismay in the northwest a mass of cloud such as she had never in all her life beheld before was rapidly rolling up it was dead black save where its curled and fringed edges showed a ghastly livid white there was something about it indescribably menacing as it gloomed up in the clear blue sky now and again a bolt of lightning shot across it followed by a savage growl it hung so low that it almost seemed to be touching the tops of the wooded hills  mr harmon andrews came clattering up the hill in his truck wagon urging his team of grays to their utmost speed he pulled them to a halt opposite the school  guess uncle abes hit it for once in his life anne he shouted his storms coming a leetle ahead of time did ye ever see the like of that cloud here all you young ones that are going my way pile in and those that aint scoot for the post office if yeve moren a quarter of a mile to go and stay there till the showers over  anne caught davy and dora by the hands and flew down the hill along the birch path and past violet vale and willowmere as fast as the twins fat legs could go they reached green gables not a moment too soon and were joined at the door by marilla who had been hustling her ducks and chickens under shelter as they dashed into the kitchen the light seemed to vanish as if blown out by some mighty breath the awful cloud rolled over the sun and a darkness as of late twilight fell across the world at the same moment with a crash of thunder and a blinding glare of lightning the hail swooped down and blotted the landscape out in one white fury  through all the clamor of the storm came the thud of torn branches striking the house and the sharp crack of breaking glass in three minutes every pane in the west and north windows was broken and the hail poured in through the apertures covering the floor with stones the smallest of which was as big as a hens egg for three quarters of an hour the storm raged unabated and no one who underwent it ever forgot it marilla for once in her life shaken out of her composure by sheer terror knelt by her rocking chair in a corner of the kitchen gasping and sobbing between the deafening thunder peals anne white as paper had dragged the sofa away from the window and sat on it with a twin on either side davy at the first crash had howled anne anne is it the judgment day anne anne i never meant to be naughty and then had buried his face in annes lap and kept it there his little body quivering dora somewhat pale but quite composed sat with her hand clasped in annes quiet and motionless it is doubtful if an earthquake would have disturbed dora  then almost as suddenly as it began the storm ceased the hail stopped the thunder rolled and muttered away to the eastward and the sun burst out merry and radiant over a world so changed that it seemed an absurd thing to think that a scant three quarters of an hour could have effected such a transformation  marilla rose from her knees weak and trembling and dropped on her rocker her face was haggard and she looked ten years older  have we all come out of that alive she asked solemnly  you bet we have piped davy cheerfully quite his own man again i wasnt a bit scared either    only just at the first it come on a fellow so sudden i made up my mind quick as a wink that i wouldnt fight teddy sloane monday as id promised but now maybe i will say dora was you scared  yes i was a little scared said dora primly but i held tight to annes hand and said my prayers over and over again  well id have said my prayers too if id have thought of it said davy but he added triumphantly you see i came through just as safe as you for all i didnt say them  anne got marilla a glassful of her potent currant wine    how potent it was anne in her earlier days had had all too good reason to know    and then they went to the door to look out on the strange scene  far and wide was a white carpet knee deep of hailstones drifts of them were heaped up under the eaves and on the steps when three or four days later those hailstones melted the havoc they had wrought was plainly seen for every green growing thing in the field or garden was cut off not only was every blossom stripped from the apple trees but great boughs and branches were wrenched away and out of the two hundred trees set out by the improvers by far the greater number were snapped off or torn to shreds  can it possibly be the same world it was an hour ago asked anne dazedly it must have taken longer than that to play such havoc  the like of this has never been known in prince edward island said marilla never i remember when i was a girl there was a bad storm but it was nothing to this well hear of terrible destruction you may be sure  i do hope none of the children were caught out in it murmured anne anxiously as it was discovered later none of the children had been since all those who had any distance to go had taken mr andrews excellent advice and sought refuge at the post office  there comes john henry carter said marilla  john henry came wading through the hailstones with a rather scared grin  oh aint this awful miss cuthbert mr harrison sent me over to see if yous had come out all right  were none of us killed said marilla grimly and none of the buildings was struck i hope you got off equally well  yasm not quite so well maam we was struck the lightning knocked over the kitchen chimbly and come down the flue and knocked over gingers cage and tore a hole in the floor and went into the sullar yasm  was ginger hurt queried anne  yasm he was hurt pretty bad he was killed later on anne went over to comfort mr harrison she found him sitting by the table stroking gingers gay dead body with a trembling hand  poor ginger wont call you any more names anne he said mournfully  anne could never have imagined herself crying on gingers account but the tears came into her eyes  he was all the company i had anne    and now hes dead well well im an old fool to care so much ill let on i dont care i know youre going to say something sympathetic as soon as i stop talking    but dont if you did id cry like a baby hasnt this been a terrible storm i guess folks wont laugh at uncle abes predictions again seems as if all the storms that hes been prophesying all his life that never happened came all at once beats all how he struck the very day though dont it look at the mess we have here i must hustle round and get some boards to patch up that hole in the floor  avonlea folks did nothing the next day but visit each other and compare damages the roads were impassable for wheels by reason of the hailstones so they walked or rode on horseback the mail came late with ill tidings from all over the province houses had been struck people killed and injured the whole telephone and telegraph system had been disorganized and any number of young stock exposed in the fields had perished  uncle abe waded out to the blacksmiths forge early in the morning and spent the whole day there it was uncle abes hour of triumph and he enjoyed it to the full it would be doing uncle abe an injustice to say that he was glad the storm had happened but since it had to be he was very glad he had predicted it    to the very day too uncle abe forgot that he had ever denied setting the day as for the trifling discrepancy in the hour that was nothing  gilbert arrived at green gables in the evening and found marilla and anne busily engaged in nailing strips of oilcloth over the broken windows  goodness only knows when well get glass for them said marilla mr barry went over to carmody this afternoon but not a pane could he get for love or money lawson and blair were cleaned out by the carmody people by ten oclock was the storm bad at white sands gilbert  i should say so i was caught in the school with all the children and i thought some of them would go mad with fright three of them fainted and two girls took hysterics and tommy blewett did nothing but shriek at the top of his voice the whole time  i only squealed once said davy proudly my garden was all smashed flat he continued mournfully but so was doras he added in a tone which indicated that there was yet balm in gilead  anne came running down from the west gable  oh gilbert have you heard the news mr levi boulters old house was struck and burned to the ground it seems to me that im dreadfully wicked to feel glad over that when so much damage has been done mr boulter says he believes the avis magicked up that storm on purpose  well one thing is certain said gilbert laughing observer has made uncle abes reputation as a weather prophet uncle abes storm will go down in local history it is a most extraordinary coincidence that it should have come on the very day we selected i actually have a half guilty feeling as if i really had magicked it up we may as well rejoice over the old house being removed for theres not much to rejoice over where our young trees are concerned not ten of them have escaped  ah well well just have to plant them over again next spring said anne philosophically that is one good thing about this world    there are always sure to be more springs     xxv  an avonlea scandal   one blithe june morning a fortnight after uncle abes storm anne came slowly through the green gables yard from the garden carrying in her hands two blighted stalks of white narcissus  look marilla she said sorrowfully holding up the flowers before the eyes of a grim lady with her hair coifed in a green gingham apron who was going into the house with a plucked chicken these are the only buds the storm spared    and even they are imperfect im so sorry    i wanted some for matthews grave he was always so fond of june lilies  i kind of miss them myself admitted marilla though it doesnt seem right to lament over them when so many worse things have happened   all the crops destroyed as well as the fruit  but people have sown their oats over again said anne comfortingly and mr harrison says he thinks if we have a good summer they will come out all right though late and my annuals are all coming up again    but oh nothing can replace the june lilies poor little hester gray will have none either i went all the way back to her garden last night but there wasnt one im sure shell miss them  i dont think its right for you to say such things anne i really dont said marilla severely hester gray has been dead for thirty years and her spirit is in heaven    i hope  yes but i believe she loves and remembers her garden here still said anne im sure no matter how long id lived in heaven id like to look down and see somebody putting flowers on my grave if i had had a garden here like hester grays it would take me more than thirty years even in heaven to forget being homesick for it by spells  well dont let the twins hear you talking like that was marillas feeble protest as she carried her chicken into the house  anne pinned her narcissi on her hair and went to the lane gate where she stood for awhile sunning herself in the june brightness before going in to attend to her saturday morning duties the world was growing lovely again old mother nature was doing her best to remove the traces of the storm and though she was not to succeed fully for many a moon she was really accomplishing wonders  i wish i could just be idle all day today anne told a bluebird who was singing and swinging on a willow bough but a schoolmaam who is also helping to bring up twins cant indulge in laziness birdie how sweet you are singing little bird you are just putting the feelings of my heart into song ever so much better than i could myself why who is coming  an express wagon was jolting up the lane with two people on the front seat and a big trunk behind when it drew near anne recognized the driver as the son of the station agent at bright river but his companion was a stranger    a scrap of a woman who sprang nimbly down at the gate almost before the horse came to a standstill she was a very pretty little person evidently nearer fifty than forty but with rosy cheeks sparkling black eyes and shining black hair surmounted by a wonderful beflowered and beplumed bonnet in spite of having driven eight miles over a dusty road she was as neat as if she had just stepped out of the proverbial bandbox  is this where mr james a harrison lives she inquired briskly  no mr harrison lives over there said anne quite lost in astonishment  well i did think this place seemed too tidy    much too tidy for james a to be living here unless he has greatly changed since i knew him chirped the little lady is it true that james a is going to be married to some woman living in this settlement  no oh no cried anne flushing so guiltily that the stranger looked curiously at her as if she half suspected her of matrimonial designs on mr harrison  but i saw it in an island paper persisted the fair unknown a friend sent a marked copy to me    friends are always so ready to do such things james as name was written in over new citizen  oh that note was only meant as a joke gasped anne mr harrison has no intention of marrying anybody i assure you he hasnt  im very glad to hear it said the rosy lady climbing nimbly back to her seat in the wagon because he happens to be married already i am his wife oh you may well look surprised i suppose he has been masquerading as a bachelor and breaking hearts right and left well well james a nodding vigorously over the fields at the long white house your fun is over i am here    though i wouldnt have bothered coming if i hadnt thought you were up to some mischief i suppose turning to anne that parrot of his is as profane as ever  his parrot    is dead    i think gasped poor anne who couldnt have felt sure of her own name at that precise moment  dead everything will be all right then cried the rosy lady jubilantly i can manage james a if that bird is out of the way  with which cryptic utterance she went joyfully on her way and anne flew to the kitchen door to meet marilla  anne who was that woman  marilla said anne solemnly but with dancing eyes do i look as if i were crazy  not more so than usual said marilla with no thought of being sarcastic  well then do you think i am awake  anne what nonsense has got into you who was that woman i say  marilla if im not crazy and not asleep she cant be such stuff as dreams are made of    she must be real anyway im sure i couldnt have imagined such a bonnet she says she is mr harrisons wife marilla  marilla stared in her turn  his wife anne shirley then what has he been passing himself off as an unmarried man for  i dont suppose he did really said anne trying to be just he never said he wasnt married people simply took it for granted oh marilla what will mrs lynde say to this  they found out what mrs lynde had to say when she came up that evening mrs lynde wasnt surprised mrs lynde had always expected something of the sort mrs lynde had always known there was something about mr harrison  to think of his deserting his wife she said indignantly its like something youd read of in the states but who would expect such a thing to happen right here in avonlea  but we dont know that he deserted her protested anne determined to believe her friend innocent till he was proved guilty we dont know the rights of it at all  well we soon will im going straight over there said mrs lynde who had never learned that there was such a word as delicacy in the dictionary im not supposed to know anything about her arrival and mr harrison was to bring some medicine for thomas from carmody today so that will be a good excuse ill find out the whole story and come in and tell you on the way back  mrs lynde rushed in where anne had feared to tread nothing would have induced the latter to go over to the harrison place but she had her natural and proper share of curiosity and she felt secretly glad that mrs lynde was going to solve the mystery she and marilla waited expectantly for that good ladys return but waited in vain mrs lynde did not revisit green gables that night davy arriving home at nine oclock from the boulter place explained why  i met mrs lynde and some strange woman in the hollow he said and gracious how they were talking both at once mrs lynde said to tell you she was sorry it was too late to call tonight anne im awful hungry we had tea at miltys at four and i think mrs boulter is real mean she didnt give us any preserves or cake     and even the bread was skurce  davy when you go visiting you must never criticize anything you are given to eat said anne solemnly it is very bad manners  all right    ill only think it said davy cheerfully do give a fellow some supper anne  anne looked at marilla who followed her into the pantry and shut the door cautiously  you can give him some jam on his bread i know what tea at levi boulters is apt to be  davy took his slice of bread and jam with a sigh  its a kind of disappointing world after all he remarked milty has a cat that takes fits    shes took a fit regular every day for three weeks milty says its awful fun to watch her i went down today on purpose to see her have one but the mean old thing wouldnt take a fit and just kept healthy as healthy though milty and me hung round all the afternoon and waited but never mind     davy brightened up as the insidious comfort of the plum jam stole into his soul    maybe ill see her in one sometime yet it doesnt seem likely shed stop having them all at once when shes been so in the habit of it does it this jam is awful nice  davy had no sorrows that plum jam could not cure  sunday proved so rainy that there was no stirring abroad but by monday everybody had heard some version of the harrison story the school buzzed with it and davy came home full of information  marilla mr harrison has a new wife    well not ezackly new but theyve stopped being married for quite a spell milty says i always sposed people had to keep on being married once theyd begun but milty says no theres ways of stopping if you cant agree milty says one way is just to start off and leave your wife and thats what mr harrison did milty says mr harrison left his wife because she throwed things at him    hard things    and arty sloane says it was because she wouldnt let him smoke and ned clay says it was cause she never let up scolding him i wouldnt leave my wife for anything like that id just put my foot down and say mrs davy youve just got to do whatll please me cause im a man thatd settle her pretty quick i guess but annetta clay says she left him because he wouldnt scrape his boots at the door and she doesnt blame her im going right over to mr harrisons this minute to see what shes like  davy soon returned somewhat cast down  mrs harrison was away    shes gone to carmody with mrs rachel lynde to get new paper for the parlor and mr harrison said to tell anne to go over and see him cause he wants to have a talk with her and say the floor is scrubbed and mr harrison is shaved though there wasnt any preaching yesterday  the harrison kitchen wore a very unfamiliar look to anne the floor was indeed scrubbed to a wonderful pitch of purity and so was every article of furniture in the room the stove was polished until she could see her face in it the walls were whitewashed and the window panes sparkled in the sunlight by the table sat mr harrison in his working clothes which on friday had been noted for sundry rents and tatters but which were now neatly patched and brushed he was sprucely shaved and what little hair he had was carefully trimmed  sit down anne sit down said mr harrison in a tone but two degrees removed from that which avonlea people used at funerals emilys gone over to carmody with rachel lynde    shes struck up a lifelong friendship already with rachel lynde beats all how contrary women are well anne my easy times are over    all over its neatness and tidiness for me for the rest of my natural life i suppose  mr harrison did his best to speak dolefully but an irrepressible twinkle in his eye betrayed him  mr harrison you are glad your wife is come back cried anne shaking her finger at him you neednt pretend youre not because i can see it plainly  mr harrison relaxed into a sheepish smile  well    well    im getting used to it he conceded i cant say i was sorry to see emily a man really needs some protection in a community like this where he cant play a game of checkers with a neighbor without being accused of wanting to marry that neighbors sister and having it put in the paper  nobody would have supposed you went to see isabella andrews if you hadnt pretended to be unmarried said anne severely  i didnt pretend i was if anybodyd have asked me if i was married id have said i was but they just took it for granted i wasnt anxious to talk about the matter    i was feeling too sore over it it would have been nuts for mrs rachel lynde if she had known my wife had left me wouldnt it now  but some people say that you left her  she started it anne she started it im going to tell you the whole story for i dont want you to think worse of me than i deserve    nor of emily neither but lets go out on the veranda everything is so fearful neat in here that it kind of makes me homesick i suppose ill get used to it after awhile but it eases me up to look at the yard emily hasnt had time to tidy it up yet  as soon as they were comfortably seated on the veranda mr harrison began his tale of woe  i lived in scottsford new brunswick before i came here anne my sister kept house for me and she suited me fine she was just reasonably tidy and she let me alone and spoiled me    so emily says but three years ago she died before she died she worried a lot about what was to become of me and finally she got me to promise id get married she advised me to take emily scott because emily had money of her own and was a pattern housekeeper i said says i emily scott wouldnt look at me you ask her and see says my sister and just to ease her mind i promised her i would    and i did and emily said shed have me never was so surprised in my life anne    a smart pretty little woman like her and an old fellow like me i tell you i thought at first i was in luck well we were married and took a little wedding trip to st john for a fortnight and then we went home we got home at ten oclock at night and i give you my word anne that in half an hour that woman was at work housecleaning oh i know youre thinking my house needed it    youve got a very expressive face anne your thoughts just come out on it like print    but it didnt not that bad it had got pretty mixed up while i was keeping bachelors hall i admit but id got a woman to come in and clean it up before i was married and thered been considerable painting and fixing done i tell you if you took emily into a brand new white marble palace shed be into the scrubbing as soon as she could get an old dress on well she cleaned house till one oclock that night and at four she was up and at it again and she kept on that way    fars i could see she never stopped it was scour and sweep and dust everlasting except on sundays and then she was just longing for monday to begin again but it was her way of amusing herself and i could have reconciled myself to it if shed left me alone but that she wouldnt do shed set out to make me over but she hadnt caught me young enough i wasnt allowed to come into the house unless i changed my boots for slippers at the door i darsnt smoke a pipe for my life unless i went to the barn and i didnt use good enough grammar emilyd been a schoolteacher in her early life and shed never got over it then she hated to see me eating with my knife well there it was pick and nag everlasting but i spose anne to be fair i was cantankerous too i didnt try to improve as i might have done    i just got cranky and disagreeable when she found fault i told her one day she hadnt complained of my grammar when i proposed to her it wasnt an overly tactful thing to say a woman would forgive a man for beating her sooner than for hinting she was too much pleased to get him well we bickered along like that and it wasnt exactly pleasant but we might have got used to each other after a spell if it hadnt been for ginger ginger was the rock we split on at last emily didnt like parrots and she couldnt stand gingers profane habits of speech i was attached to the bird for my brother the sailors sake my brother the sailor was a pet of mine when we were little tads and hed sent ginger to me when he was dying i didnt see any sense in getting worked up over his swearing theres nothing i hate worsen profanity in a human being but in a parrot thats just repeating what its heard with no more understanding of it than id have of chinese allowances might be made but emily couldnt see it that way women aint logical she tried to break ginger of swearing but she hadnt any better success than she had in trying to make me stop saying i seen and them things seemed as if the more she tried the worse ginger got same as me  well things went on like this both of us getting raspier till the climax came emily invited our minister and his wife to tea and another minister and his wife that was visiting them id promised to put ginger away in some safe place where nobody would hear him    emily wouldnt touch his cage with a tenfoot pole      and i meant to do it for i didnt want the ministers to hear anything unpleasant in my house but it slipped my mind    emily was worrying me so much about clean collars and grammar that it wasnt any wonder    and i never thought of that poor parrot till we sat down to tea just as minister number one was in the very middle of saying grace ginger who was on the veranda outside the dining room window lifted up his voice the gobbler had come into view in the yard and the sight of a gobbler always had an unwholesome effect on ginger he surpassed himself that time you can smile anne and i dont deny ive chuckled some over it since myself but at the time i felt almost as much mortified as emily i went out and carried ginger to the barn i cant say i enjoyed the meal i knew by the look of emily that there was trouble brewing for ginger and james a when the folks went away i started for the cow pasture and on the way i did some thinking i felt sorry for emily and kind of fancied i hadnt been so thoughtful of her as i might and besides i wondered if the ministers would think that ginger had learned his vocabulary from me the long and short of it was i decided that ginger would have to be mercifully disposed of and when id druv the cows home i went in to tell emily so but there was no emily and there was a letter on the table    just according to the rule in story books emily writ that id have to choose between her and ginger shed gone back to her own house and there she would stay till i went and told her id got rid of that parrot  i was all riled up anne and i said she might stay till doomsday if she waited for that and i stuck to it i packed up her belongings and sent them after her it made an awful lot of talk     scottsford was pretty near as bad as avonlea for gossip    and everybody sympathized with emily it kept me all cross and cantankerous and i saw id have to get out or id never have any peace i concluded id come to the island id been here when i was a boy and i liked it but emily had always said she wouldnt live in a place where folks were scared to walk out after dark for fear theyd fall off the edge so just to be contrary i moved over here and thats all there is to it i hadnt ever heard a word from or about emily till i come home from the back field saturday and found her scrubbing the floor but with the first decent dinner id had since she left me all ready on the table she told me to eat it first and then wed talk    by which i concluded that emily had learned some lessons about getting along with a man so shes here and shes going to stay    seeing that gingers dead and the islands some bigger than she thought theres mrs lynde and her now no dont go anne stay and get acquainted with emily she took quite a notion to you saturday    wanted to know who that handsome redhaired girl was at the next house  mrs harrison welcomed anne radiantly and insisted on her staying to tea  james a has been telling me all about you and how kind youve been making cakes and things for him she said i want to get acquainted with all my new neighbors just as soon as possible mrs lynde is a lovely woman isnt she so friendly  when anne went home in the sweet june dusk mrs harrison went with her across the fields where the fireflies were lighting their starry lamps  i suppose said mrs harrison confidentially that james a has told you our story  yes  then i neednt tell it for james a is a just man and he would tell the truth the blame was far from being all on his side i can see that now i wasnt back in my own house an hour before i wished i hadnt been so hasty but i wouldnt give in i see now that i expected too much of a man and i was real foolish to mind his bad grammar it doesnt matter if a man does use bad grammar so long as he is a good provider and doesnt go poking round the pantry to see how much sugar youve used in a week i feel that james a and i are going to be real happy now i wish i knew who observer is so that i could thank him i owe him a real debt of gratitude  anne kept her own counsel and mrs harrison never knew that her gratitude found its way to its object anne felt rather bewildered over the farreaching consequences of those foolish notes they had reconciled a man to his wife and made the reputation of a prophet  mrs lynde was in the green gables kitchen she had been telling the whole story to marilla  well and how do you like mrs harrison she asked anne  very much i think shes a real nice little woman  thats exactly what she is said mrs rachel with emphasis and as ive just been sayin to marilla i think we ought all to overlook mr harrisons peculiarities for her sake and try to make her feel at home here thats what well i must get back thomasll be wearying for me i get out a little since eliza came and hes seemed a lot better these past few days but i never like to be long away from him i hear gilbert blythe has resigned from white sands hell be off to college in the fall i suppose  mrs rachel looked sharply at anne but anne was bending over a sleepy davy nodding on the sofa and nothing was to be read in her face she carried davy away her oval girlish cheek pressed against his curly yellow head as they went up the stairs davy flung a tired arm about annes neck and gave her a warm hug and a sticky kiss  youre awful nice anne milty boulter wrote on his slate today and showed it to jennie sloane       roses red and vilets blue      sugars sweet and so are you  and that spresses my feelings for you ezackly anne     xxvi  around the bend   thomas lynde faded out of life as quietly and unobtrusively as he had lived it his wife was a tender patient unwearied nurse sometimes rachel had been a little hard on her thomas in health when his slowness or meekness had provoked her but when he became ill no voice could be lower no hand more gently skillful no vigil more uncomplaining  youve been a good wife to me rachel he once said simply when she was sitting by him in the dusk holding his thin blanched old hand in her workhardened one a good wife im sorry i aint leaving you better off but the children will look after you theyre all smart capable children just like their mother a good mother    a good woman       he had fallen asleep then and the next morning just as the white dawn was creeping up over the pointed firs in the hollow marilla went softly into the east gable and wakened anne  anne thomas lynde is gone    their hired boy just brought the word im going right down to rachel  on the day after thomas lyndes funeral marilla went about green gables with a strangely preoccupied air occasionally she looked at anne seemed on the point of saying something then shook her head and buttoned up her mouth after tea she went down to see mrs rachel and when she returned she went to the east gable where anne was correcting school exercises  how is mrs lynde tonight asked the latter  shes feeling calmer and more composed answered marilla sitting down on annes bed    a proceeding which betokened some unusual mental excitement for in marillas code of household ethics to sit on a bed after it was made up was an unpardonable offense but shes very lonely eliza had to go home today    her son isnt well and she felt she couldnt stay any longer  when ive finished these exercises ill run down and chat awhile with mrs lynde said anne i had intended to study some latin composition tonight but it can wait  i suppose gilbert blythe is going to college in the fall said marilla jerkily how would you like to go too anne  anne looked up in astonishment  i would like it of course marilla but it isnt possible  i guess it can be made possible ive always felt that you should go ive never felt easy to think you were giving it all up on my account  but marilla ive never been sorry for a moment that i stayed home ive been so happy    oh these past two years have just been delightful  oh yes i know youve been contented enough but that isnt the question exactly you ought to go on with your education youve saved enough to put you through one year at redmond and the money the stock brought in will do for another year    and theres scholarships and things you might win  yes but i cant go marilla your eyes are better of course but i cant leave you alone with the twins they need so much looking after  i wont be alone with them thats what i meant to discuss with you i had a long talk with rachel tonight anne shes feeling dreadful bad over a good many things shes not left very well off it seems they mortgaged the farm eight years ago to give the youngest boy a start when he went west and theyve never been able to pay much more than the interest since and then of course thomas illness has cost a good deal one way or another the farm will have to be sold and rachel thinks therell be hardly anything left after the bills are settled she says shell have to go and live with eliza and its breaking her heart to think of leaving avonlea a woman of her age doesnt make new friends and interests easy and anne as she talked about it the thought came to me that i would ask her to come and live with me but i thought i ought to talk it over with you first before i said anything to her if i had rachel living with me you could go to college how do you feel about it  i feel    as if    somebody    had handed me    the moon    and i didnt know    exactly    what to do    with it said anne dazedly but as for asking mrs lynde to come here that is for you to decide marilla do you think    are you sure    you would like it mrs lynde is a good woman and a kind neighbor but    but     but shes got her faults you mean to say well she has of course but i think id rather put up with far worse faults than see rachel go away from avonlea id miss her terrible shes the only close friend ive got here and id be lost without her weve been neighbors for fortyfive years and weve never had a quarrel    though we came rather near it that time you flew at mrs rachel for calling you homely and redhaired do you remember anne  i should think i do said anne ruefully people dont forget things like that how i hated poor mrs rachel at that moment  and then that apology you made her well you were a handful in all conscience anne i did feel so puzzled and bewildered how to manage you matthew understood you better  matthew understood everything said anne softly as she always spoke of him  well i think it could be managed so that rachel and i wouldnt clash at all it always seemed to me that the reason two women cant get along in one house is that they try to share the same kitchen and get in each others way now if rachel came here she could have the north gable for her bedroom and the spare room for a kitchen as well as not for we dont really need a spare room at all she could put her stove there and what furniture she wanted to keep and be real comfortable and independent shell have enough to live on of courseher childrenll see to thatso all id be giving her would be house room yes anne far as im concerned id like it  then ask her said anne promptly id be very sorry myself to see mrs rachel go away  and if she comes continued marilla you can go to college as well as not shell be company for me and shell do for the twins what i cant do so theres no reason in the world why you shouldnt go  anne had a long meditation at her window that night joy and regret struggled together in her heart she had come at last    suddenly and unexpectedly    to the bend in the road and college was around it with a hundred rainbow hopes and visions but anne realized as well that when she rounded that curve she must leave many sweet things behind   all the little simple duties and interests which had grown so dear to her in the last two years and which she had glorified into beauty and delight by the enthusiasm she had put into them she must give up her school     and she loved every one of her pupils even the stupid and naughty ones the mere thought of paul irving made her wonder if redmond were such a name to conjure with after all  ive put out a lot of little roots these two years anne told the moon and when im pulled up theyre going to hurt a great deal but its best to go i think and as marilla says theres no good reason why i shouldnt i must get out all my ambitions and dust them  anne sent in her resignation the next day and mrs rachel after a heart to heart talk with marilla gratefully accepted the offer of a home at green gables she elected to remain in her own house for the summer however the farm was not to be sold until the fall and there were many arrangements to be made  i certainly never thought of living as far off the road as green gables sighed mrs rachel to herself but really green gables doesnt seem as out of the world as it used to do    anne has lots of company and the twins make it real lively and anyhow id rather live at the bottom of a well than leave avonlea  these two decisions being noised abroad speedily ousted the arrival of mrs harrison in popular gossip sage heads were shaken over marilla cuthberts rash step in asking mrs rachel to live with her people opined that they wouldnt get on together they were both too fond of their own way and many doleful predictions were made none of which disturbed the parties in question at all they had come to a clear and distinct understanding of the respective duties and rights of their new arrangements and meant to abide by them  i wont meddle with you nor you with me mrs rachel had said decidedly and as for the twins ill be glad to do all i can for them but i wont undertake to answer davys questions thats what im not an encyclopedia neither am i a philadelphia lawyer youll miss anne for that  sometimes annes answers were about as queer as davys questions said marilla drily the twins will miss her and no mistake but her future cant be sacrificed to davys thirst for information when he asks questions i cant answer ill just tell him children should be seen and not heard that was how i was brought up and i dont know but what it was just as good a way as all these newfangled notions for training children  well annes methods seem to have worked fairly well with davy said mrs lynde smilingly he is a reformed character thats what  he isnt a bad little soul conceded marilla i never expected to get as fond of those children as i have davy gets round you somehow    and dora is a lovely child although she is    kind of    well kind of     monotonous exactly supplied mrs rachel like a book where every page is the same thats what dora will make a good reliable woman but shell never set the pond on fire well that sort of folks are comfortable to have round even if theyre not as interesting as the other kind  gilbert blythe was probably the only person to whom the news of annes resignation brought unmixed pleasure her pupils looked upon it as a sheer catastrophe annetta bell had hysterics when she went home anthony pye fought two pitched and unprovoked battles with other boys by way of relieving his feelings barbara shaw cried all night paul irving defiantly told his grandmother that she neednt expect him to eat any porridge for a week  i cant do it grandma he said i dont really know if i can eat anything i feel as if there was a dreadful lump in my throat id have cried coming home from school if jake donnell hadnt been watching me i believe i will cry after i go to bed it wouldnt show on my eyes tomorrow would it and it would be such a relief but anyway i cant eat porridge im going to need all my strength of mind to bear up against this grandma and i wont have any left to grapple with porridge oh grandma i dont know what ill do when my beautiful teacher goes away milty boulter says he bets jane andrews will get the school i suppose miss andrews is very nice but i know she wont understand things like miss shirley  diana also took a very pessimistic view of affairs  it will be horribly lonesome here next winter she mourned one twilight when the moonlight was raining airy silver through the cherry boughs and filling the east gable with a soft dreamlike radiance in which the two girls sat and talked anne on her low rocker by the window diana sitting turkfashion on the bed you and gilbert will be gone     and the allans too they are going to call mr allan to charlottetown and of course hell accept its too mean well be vacant all winter i suppose and have to listen to a long string of candidates    and half of them wont be any good  i hope they wont call mr baxter from east grafton here anyhow said anne decidedly he wants the call but he does preach such gloomy sermons mr bell says hes a minister of the old school but mrs lynde says theres nothing whatever the matter with him but indigestion his wife isnt a very good cook it seems and mrs lynde says that when a man has to eat sour bread two weeks out of three his theology is bound to get a kink in it somewhere mrs allan feels very badly about going away she says everybody has been so kind to her since she came here as a bride that she feels as if she were leaving lifelong friends and then theres the babys grave you know she says she doesnt see how she can go away and leave that    it was such a little mite of a thing and only three months old and she says she is afraid it will miss its mother although she knows better and wouldnt say so to mr allan for anything she says she has slipped through the birch grove back of the manse nearly every night to the graveyard and sung a little lullaby to it she told me all about it last evening when i was up putting some of those early wild roses on matthews grave i promised her that as long as i was in avonlea i would put flowers on the babys grave and when i was away i felt sure that     that i would do it supplied diana heartily of course i will and ill put them on matthews grave too for your sake anne  oh thank you i meant to ask you to if you would and on little hester grays too please dont forget hers do you know ive thought and dreamed so much about little hester gray that she has become strangely real to me i think of her back there in her little garden in that cool still green corner and i have a fancy that if i could steal back there some spring evening just at the magic time twixt light and dark and tiptoe so softly up the beech hill that my footsteps could not frighten her i would find the garden just as it used to be all sweet with june lilies and early roses with the tiny house beyond it all hung with vines and little hester gray would be there with her soft eyes and the wind ruffling her dark hair wandering about putting her fingertips under the chins of the lilies and whispering secrets with the roses and i would go forward oh so softly and hold out my hands and say to her little hester gray wont you let me be your playmate for i love the roses too and we would sit down on the old bench and talk a little and dream a little or just be beautifully silent together and then the moon would rise and i would look around me     and there would be no hester gray and no little vinehung house and no roses    only an old waste garden starred with june lilies amid the grasses and the wind sighing oh so sorrowfully in the cherry trees and i would not know whether it had been real or if i had just imagined it all diana crawled up and got her back against the headboard of the bed when your companion of twilight hour said such spooky things it was just as well not to be able to fancy there was anything behind you  im afraid the improvement society will go down when you and gilbert are both gone she remarked dolefully  not a bit of fear of it said anne briskly coming back from dreamland to the affairs of practical life it is too firmly established for that especially since the older people are becoming so enthusiastic about it look what they are doing this summer for their lawns and lanes besides ill be watching for hints at redmond and ill write a paper for it next winter and send it over dont take such a gloomy view of things diana and dont grudge me my little hour of gladness and jubilation now later on when i have to go away ill feel anything but glad  its all right for you to be glad    youre going to college and youll have a jolly time and make heaps of lovely new friends  i hope i shall make new friends said anne thoughtfully the possibilities of making new friends help to make life very fascinating but no matter how many friends i make theyll never be as dear to me as the old ones    especially a certain girl with black eyes and dimples can you guess who she is diana  but therell be so many clever girls at redmond sighed diana and im only a stupid little country girl who says i seen sometimes   though i really know better when i stop to think well of course these past two years have really been too pleasant to last i know somebody who is glad you are going to redmond anyhow anne im going to ask you a question    a serious question dont be vexed and do answer seriously do you care anything for gilbert  ever so much as a friend and not a bit in the way you mean said anne calmly and decidedly she also thought she was speaking sincerely  diana sighed she wished somehow that anne had answered differently  dont you mean ever to be married anne  perhaps    some day    when i meet the right one said anne smiling dreamily up at the moonlight  but how can you be sure when you do meet the right one persisted diana  oh i should know him    something would tell me you know what my ideal is diana  but peoples ideals change sometimes  mine wont and i couldnt care for any man who didnt fulfill it  what if you never meet him  then i shall die an old maid was the cheerful response i daresay it isnt the hardest death by any means  oh i suppose the dying would be easy enough its the living an old maid i shouldnt like said diana with no intention of being humorous although i wouldnt mind being an old maid very much if i could be one like miss lavendar but i never could be when im fortyfive ill be horribly fat and while there might be some romance about a thin old maid there couldnt possibly be any about a fat one oh mind you nelson atkins proposed to ruby gillis three weeks ago ruby told me all about it she says she never had any intention of taking him because any one who married him will have to go in with the old folks but ruby says that he made such a perfectly beautiful and romantic proposal that it simply swept her off her feet but she didnt want to do anything rash so she asked for a week to consider and two days later she was at a meeting of the sewing circle at his mothers and there was a book called the complete guide to etiquette lying on the parlor table ruby said she simply couldnt describe her feelings when in a section of it headed the deportment of courtship and marriage she found the very proposal nelson had made word for word she went home and wrote him a perfectly scathing refusal and she says his father and mother have taken turns watching him ever since for fear hell drown himself in the river but ruby says they neednt be afraid for in the deportment of courtship and marriage it told how a rejected lover should behave and theres nothing about drowning in that and she says wilbur blair is literally pining away for her but shes perfectly helpless in the matter  anne made an impatient movement  i hate to say it    it seems so disloyal    but well i dont like ruby gillis now i liked her when we went to school and queens together    though not so well as you and jane of course but this last year at carmody she seems so different    so    so     i know nodded diana its the gillis coming out in her     she cant help it mrs lynde says that if ever a gillis girl thought about anything but the boys she never showed it in her walk and conversation she talks about nothing but boys and what compliments they pay her and how crazy they all are about her at carmody and the strange thing is they are too    diana admitted this somewhat resentfully last night when i saw her in mr blairs store she whispered to me that shed just made a new mash i wouldnt ask her who it was because i knew she was dying to be asked well its what ruby always wanted i suppose you remember even when she was little she always said she meant to have dozens of beaus when she grew up and have the very gayest time she could before she settled down shes so different from jane isnt she jane is such a nice sensible ladylike girl  dear old jane is a jewel agreed anne but she added leaning forward to bestow a tender pat on the plump dimpled little hand hanging over her pillow theres nobody like my own diana after all do you remember that evening we first met diana and swore eternal friendship in your garden weve kept that oath i think    weve never had a quarrel nor even a coolness i shall never forget the thrill that went over me the day you told me you loved me i had had such a lonely starved heart all through my childhood im just beginning to realize how starved and lonely it really was nobody cared anything for me or wanted to be bothered with me i should have been miserable if it hadnt been for that strange little dreamlife of mine wherein i imagined all the friends and love i craved but when i came to green gables everything was changed and then i met you you dont know what your friendship meant to me i want to thank you here and now dear for the warm and true affection youve always given me  and always always will sobbed diana i shall never love anybody    any girl    half as well as i love you and if i ever do marry and have a little girl of my own im going to name her anne     xxvii  an afternoon at the stone house   where are you going all dressed up anne davy wanted to know you look bully in that dress  anne had come down to dinner in a new dress of pale green muslin    the first color she had worn since matthews death it became her perfectly bringing out all the delicate flowerlike tints of her face and the gloss and burnish of her hair  davy how many times have i told you that you mustnt use that word she rebuked im going to echo lodge  take me with you entreated davy  i would if i were driving but im going to walk and its too far for your eightyearold legs besides paul is going with me and i fear you dont enjoy yourself in his company  oh i like paul lots bettern i did said davy beginning to make fearful inroads into his pudding since ive got pretty good myself i dont mind his being gooder so much if i can keep on ill catch up with him some day both in legs and goodness sides pauls real nice to us second primer boys in school he wont let the other big boys meddle with us and he shows us lots of games  how came paul to fall into the brook at noon hour yesterday asked anne i met him on the playground such a dripping figure that i sent him promptly home for clothes without waiting to find out what had happened  well it was partly a zacksident explained davy he stuck his head in on purpose but the rest of him fell in zacksidentally we was all down at the brook and prillie rogerson got mad at paul about something    shes awful mean and horrid anyway if she is pretty    and said that his grandmother put his hair up in curl rags every night paul wouldnt have minded what she said i guess but gracie andrews laughed and paul got awful red cause gracies his girl you know hes clean gone on her    brings her flowers and carries her books as far as the shore road he got as red as a beet and said his grandmother didnt do any such thing and his hair was born curly and then he laid down on the bank and stuck his head right into the spring to show them oh it wasnt the spring we drink out of    seeing a horrified look on marillas face    it was the little one lower down but the banks awful slippy and paul went right in i tell you he made a bully splash oh anne anne i didnt mean to say that    it just slipped out before i thought he made a splendid splash but he looked so funny when he crawled out all wet and muddy the girls laughed moren ever but gracie didnt laugh she looked sorry gracies a nice girl but shes got a snub nose when i get big enough to have a girl i wont have one with a snub nose    ill pick one with a pretty nose like yours anne  a boy who makes such a mess of syrup all over his face when he is eating his pudding will never get a girl to look at him said marilla severely  but ill wash my face before i go courting protested davy trying to improve matters by rubbing the back of his hand over the smears and ill wash behind my ears too without being told i remembered to this morning marilla i dont forget half as often as i did but    and davy sighed    theres so many corners about a fellow that its awful hard to remember them all well if i cant go to miss lavendars ill go over and see mrs harrison mrs harrisons an awful nice woman i tell you she keeps a jar of cookies in her pantry apurpose for little boys and she always gives me the scrapings out of a pan shes mixed up a plum cake in a good many plums stick to the sides you see mr harrison was always a nice man but hes twice as nice since he got married over again i guess getting married makes folks nicer why dont you get married marilla i want to know  marillas state of single blessedness had never been a sore point with her so she answered amiably with an exchange of significant looks with anne that she supposed it was because nobody would have her  but maybe you never asked anybody to have you protested davy  oh davy said dora primly shocked into speaking without being spoken to its the men that have to do the asking  i dont know why they have to do it always grumbled davy seems to me everythings put on the men in this world can i have some more pudding marilla  youve had as much as was good for you said marilla but she gave him a moderate second helping  i wish people could live on pudding why cant they marilla i want to know  because theyd soon get tired of it  id like to try that for myself said skeptical davy but i guess its better to have pudding only on fish and company days than none at all they never have any at milty boulters milty says when company comes his mother gives them cheese and cuts it herself    one little bit apiece and one over for manners  if milty boulter talks like that about his mother at least you neednt repeat it said marilla severely  bless my soul    davy had picked this expression up from mr harrison and used it with great gusto    milty meant it as a compelment hes awful proud of his mother cause folks say she could scratch a living on a rock  i    i suppose them pesky hens are in my pansy bed again said marilla rising and going out hurriedly  the slandered hens were nowhere near the pansy bed and marilla did not even glance at it instead she sat down on the cellar hatch and laughed until she was ashamed of herself  when anne and paul reached the stone house that afternoon they found miss lavendar and charlotta the fourth in the garden weeding raking clipping and trimming as if for dear life miss lavendar herself all gay and sweet in the frills and laces she loved dropped her shears and ran joyously to meet her guests while charlotta the fourth grinned cheerfully  welcome anne i thought youd come today you belong to the afternoon so it brought you things that belong together are sure to come together what a lot of trouble that would save some people if they only knew it but they dont    and so they waste beautiful energy moving heaven and earth to bring things together that dont belong and you paul    why youve grown youre half a head taller than when you were here before  yes ive begun to grow like pigweed in the night as mrs lynde says said paul in frank delight over the fact grandma says its the porridge taking effect at last perhaps it is goodness knows    paul sighed deeply    ive eaten enough to make anyone grow i do hope now that ive begun ill keep on till im as tall as father he is six feet you know miss lavendar  yes miss lavendar did know the flush on her pretty cheeks deepened a little she took pauls hand on one side and annes on the other and walked to the house in silence  is it a good day for the echoes miss lavendar queried paul anxiously the day of his first visit had been too windy for echoes and paul had been much disappointed  yes just the best kind of a day answered miss lavendar rousing herself from her reverie but first we are all going to have something to eat i know you two folks didnt walk all the way back here through those beechwoods without getting hungry and charlotta the fourth and i can eat any hour of the day    we have such obliging appetites so well just make a raid on the pantry fortunately its lovely and full i had a presentiment that i was going to have company today and charlotta the fourth and i prepared  i think you are one of the people who always have nice things in their pantry declared paul grandmas like that too but she doesnt approve of snacks between meals i wonder he added meditatively if i ought to eat them away from home when i know she doesnt approve  oh i dont think she would disapprove after you have had a long walk that makes a difference said miss lavendar exchanging amused glances with anne over pauls brown curls i suppose that snacks are extremely unwholesome that is why we have them so often at echo lodge we   charlotta the fourth and i    live in defiance of every known law of diet we eat all sorts of indigestible things whenever we happen to think of it by day or night and we flourish like green bay trees we are always intending to reform when we read any article in a paper warning us against something we like we cut it out and pin it up on the kitchen wall so that well remember it but we never can somehow    until after weve gone and eaten that very thing nothing has ever killed us yet but charlotta the fourth has been known to have bad dreams after we had eaten doughnuts and mince pie and fruit cake before we went to bed  grandma lets me have a glass of milk and a slice of bread and butter before i go to bed and on sunday nights she puts jam on the bread said paul so im always glad when its sunday night     for more reasons than one sunday is a very long day on the shore road grandma says its all too short for her and that father never found sundays tiresome when he was a little boy it wouldnt seem so long if i could talk to my rock people but i never do that because grandma doesnt approve of it on sundays i think a good deal but im afraid my thoughts are worldly grandma says we should never think anything but religious thoughts on sundays but teacher here said once that every really beautiful thought was religious no matter what it was about or what day we thought it on but i feel sure grandma thinks that sermons and sunday school lessons are the only things you can think truly religious thoughts about and when it comes to a difference of opinion between grandma and teacher i dont know what to do in my heart    paul laid his hand on his breast and raised very serious blue eyes to miss lavendars immediately sympathetic face    i agree with teacher but then you see grandma has brought father up her way and made a brilliant success of him and teacher has never brought anybody up yet though shes helping with davy and dora but you cant tell how theyll turn out till they are grown up so sometimes i feel as if it might be safer to go by grandmas opinions  i think it would agreed anne solemnly anyway i daresay that if your grandma and i both got down to what we really do mean under our different ways of expressing it wed find out we both meant much the same thing youd better go by her way of expressing it since its been the result of experience well have to wait until we see how the twins do turn out before we can be sure that my way is equally good after lunch they went back to the garden where paul made the acquaintance of the echoes to his wonder and delight while anne and miss lavendar sat on the stone bench under the poplar and talked  so you are going away in the fall said miss lavendar wistfully i ought to be glad for your sake anne    but im horribly selfishly sorry i shall miss you so much oh sometimes i think it is of no use to make friends they only go out of your life after awhile and leave a hurt that is worse than the emptiness before they came  that sounds like something miss eliza andrews might say but never miss lavendar said anne nothing is worse than emptiness    and im not going out of your life there are such things as letters and vacations dearest im afraid youre looking a little pale and tired  oh    hoo    hoo    hoo went paul on the dyke where he had been making noises diligently    not all of them melodious in the making but all coming back transmuted into the very gold and silver of sound by the fairy alchemists over the river miss lavendar made an impatient movement with her pretty hands  im just tired of everything    even of the echoes there is nothing in my life but echoes    echoes of lost hopes and dreams and joys theyre beautiful and mocking oh anne its horrid of me to talk like this when i have company its just that im getting old and it doesnt agree with me i know ill be fearfully cranky by the time im sixty but perhaps all i need is a course of blue pills at this moment charlotta the fourth who had disappeared after lunch returned and announced that the northeast corner of mr john kimballs pasture was red with early strawberries and wouldnt miss shirley like to go and pick some  early strawberries for tea exclaimed miss lavendar oh im not so old as i thought    and i dont need a single blue pill girls when you come back with your strawberries well have tea out here under the silver poplar ill have it all ready for you with homegrown cream  anne and charlotta the fourth accordingly betook themselves back to mr kimballs pasture a green remote place where the air was as soft as velvet and fragrant as a bed of violets and golden as amber  oh isnt it sweet and fresh back here breathed anne i just feel as if i were drinking in the sunshine  yes maam so do i thats just exactly how i feel too maam agreed charlotta the fourth who would have said precisely the same thing if anne had remarked that she felt like a pelican of the wilderness always after anne had visited echo lodge charlotta the fourth mounted to her little room over the kitchen and tried before her looking glass to speak and look and move like anne charlotta could never flatter herself that she quite succeeded but practice makes perfect as charlotta had learned at school and she fondly hoped that in time she might catch the trick of that dainty uplift of chin that quick starry outflashing of eyes that fashion of walking as if you were a bough swaying in the wind it seemed so easy when you watched anne charlotta the fourth admired anne wholeheartedly it was not that she thought her so very handsome diana barrys beauty of crimson cheek and black curls was much more to charlotta the fourths taste than annes moonshine charm of luminous gray eyes and the pale everchanging roses of her cheeks  but id rather look like you than be pretty she told anne sincerely  anne laughed sipped the honey from the tribute and cast away the sting she was used to taking her compliments mixed public opinion never agreed on annes looks people who had heard her called handsome met her and were disappointed people who had heard her called plain saw her and wondered where other peoples eyes were anne herself would never believe that she had any claim to beauty when she looked in the glass all she saw was a little pale face with seven freckles on the nose thereof her mirror never revealed to her the elusive evervarying play of feeling that came and went over her features like a rosy illuminating flame or the charm of dream and laughter alternating in her big eyes  while anne was not beautiful in any strictly defined sense of the word she possessed a certain evasive charm and distinction of appearance that left beholders with a pleasurable sense of satisfaction in that softly rounded girlhood of hers with all its strongly felt potentialities those who knew anne best felt without realizing that they felt it that her greatest attraction was the aura of possibility surrounding her   the power of future development that was in her she seemed to walk in an atmosphere of things about to happen  as they picked charlotta the fourth confided to anne her fears regarding miss lavendar the warmhearted little handmaiden was honestly worried over her adored mistress condition  miss lavendar isnt well miss shirley maam im sure she isnt though she never complains she hasnt seemed like herself this long while maam    not since that day you and paul were here together before i feel sure she caught cold that night maam after you and him had gone she went out and walked in the garden for long after dark with nothing but a little shawl on her there was a lot of snow on the walks and i feel sure she got a chill maam ever since then ive noticed her acting tired and lonesome like she dont seem to take an interest in anything maam she never pretends companys coming nor fixes up for it nor nothing maam its only when you come she seems to chirk up a bit and the worst sign of all miss shirley maam    charlotta the fourth lowered her voice as if she were about to tell some exceedingly weird and awful symptom indeed    is that she never gets cross now when i breaks things why miss shirley maam yesterday i bruk her green and yaller bowl thats always stood on the bookcase her grandmother brought it out from england and miss lavendar was awful choice of it i was dusting it just as careful miss shirley maam and it slipped out so fashion afore i could grab holt of it and bruk into about forty millyun pieces i tell you i was sorry and scared i thought miss lavendar would scold me awful maam and id ruther she had than take it the way she did she just come in and hardly looked at it and said its no matter charlotta take up the pieces and throw them away just like that miss shirley maam    take up the pieces and throw them away as if it wasnt her grandmothers bowl from england oh she isnt well and i feel awful bad about it shes got nobody to look after her but me  charlotta the fourths eyes brimmed up with tears anne patted the little brown paw holding the cracked pink cup sympathetically  i think miss lavendar needs a change charlotta she stays here alone too much cant we induce her to go away for a little trip  charlotta shook her head with its rampant bows disconsolately  i dont think so miss shirley maam miss lavendar hates visiting shes only got three relations she ever visits and she says she just goes to see them as a family duty last time when she come home she said she wasnt going to visit for family duty no more ive come home in love with loneliness charlotta she says to me and i never want to stray from my own vine and fig tree again my relations try so hard to make an old lady of me and it has a bad effect on me just like that miss shirley maam it has a very bad effect on me so i dont think it would do any good to coax her to go visiting  we must see what can be done said anne decidedly as she put the last possible berry in her pink cup just as soon as i have my vacation ill come through and spend a whole week with you well have a picnic every day and pretend all sorts of interesting things and see if we cant cheer miss lavendar up  that will be the very thing miss shirley maam exclaimed charlotta the fourth in rapture she was glad for miss lavendars sake and for her own too with a whole week in which to study anne constantly she would surely be able to learn how to move and behave like her  when the girls got back to echo lodge they found that miss lavendar and paul had carried the little square table out of the kitchen to the garden and had everything ready for tea nothing ever tasted so delicious as those strawberries and cream eaten under a great blue sky all curdled over with fluffy little white clouds and in the long shadows of the wood with its lispings and its murmurings after tea anne helped charlotta wash the dishes in the kitchen while miss lavendar sat on the stone bench with paul and heard all about his rock people she was a good listener this sweet miss lavendar but just at the last it struck paul that she had suddenly lost interest in the twin sailors  miss lavendar why do you look at me like that he asked gravely  how do i look paul  just as if you were looking through me at somebody i put you in mind of said paul who had such occasional flashes of uncanny insight that it wasnt quite safe to have secrets when he was about  you do put me in mind of somebody i knew long ago said miss lavendar dreamily  when you were young  yes when i was young do i seem very old to you paul  do you know i cant make up my mind about that said paul confidentially your hair looks old    i never knew a young person with white hair but your eyes are as young as my beautiful teachers when you laugh i tell you what miss lavendar     pauls voice and face were as solemn as a judges    i think you would make a splendid mother you have just the right look in your eyes     the look my little mother always had i think its a pity you havent any boys of your own  i have a little dream boy paul  oh have you really how old is he  about your age i think he ought to be older because i dreamed him long before you were born but ill never let him get any older than eleven or twelve because if i did some day he might grow up altogether and then id lose him  i know nodded paul thats the beauty of dreampeople    they stay any age you want them you and my beautiful teacher and me myself are the only folks in the world that i know of that have dreampeople isnt it funny and nice we should all know each other but i guess that kind of people always find each other out grandma never has dreampeople and mary joe thinks im wrong in the upper story because i have them but i think its splendid to have them you know miss lavendar tell me all about your little dreamboy  he has blue eyes and curly hair he steals in and wakens me with a kiss every morning then all day he plays here in the garden     and i play with him such games as we have we run races and talk with the echoes and i tell him stories and when twilight comes     i know interrupted paul eagerly he comes and sits beside you    so    because of course at twelve hed be too big to climb into your lap     and lays his head on your shoulder    so    and you put your arms about him and hold him tight tight and rest your cheek on his head     yes thats the very way oh you do know miss lavendar  anne found the two of them there when she came out of the stone house and something in miss lavendars face made her hate to disturb them  im afraid we must go paul if we want to get home before dark miss lavendar im going to invite myself to echo lodge for a whole week pretty soon  if you come for a week ill keep you for two threatened miss lavendar     xxviii  the prince comes back to the enchanted palace   the last day of school came and went a triumphant semiannual examination was held and annes pupils acquitted themselves splendidly at the close they gave her an address and a writing desk all the girls and ladies present cried and some of the boys had it cast up to them later on that they cried too although they always denied it  mrs harmon andrews mrs peter sloane and mrs william bell walked home together and talked things over  i do think it is such a pity anne is leaving when the children seem so much attached to her sighed mrs peter sloane who had a habit of sighing over everything and even finished off her jokes that way to be sure she added hastily we all know well have a good teacher next year too  jane will do her duty ive no doubt said mrs andrews rather stiffly i dont suppose shell tell the children quite so many fairy tales or spend so much time roaming about the woods with them but she has her name on the inspectors roll of honor and the newbridge people are in a terrible state over her leaving  im real glad anne is going to college said mrs bell she has always wanted it and it will be a splendid thing for her  well i dont know mrs andrews was determined not to agree fully with anybody that day i dont see that anne needs any more education shell probably be marrying gilbert blythe if his infatuation for her lasts till he gets through college and what good will latin and greek do her then if they taught you at college how to manage a man there might be some sense in her going  mrs harmon andrews so avonlea gossip whispered had never learned how to manage her man and as a result the andrews household was not exactly a model of domestic happiness  i see that the charlottetown call to mr allan is up before the presbytery said mrs bell that means well be losing him soon i suppose  theyre not going before september said mrs sloane it will be a great loss to the community    though i always did think that mrs allan dressed rather too gay for a ministers wife but we are none of us perfect did you notice how neat and snug mr harrison looked today i never saw such a changed man he goes to church every sunday and has subscribed to the salary  hasnt that paul irving grown to be a big boy said mrs andrews he was such a mite for his age when he came here i declare i hardly knew him today hes getting to look a lot like his father  hes a smart boy said mrs bell  hes smart enough but    mrs andrews lowered her voice    i believe he tells queer stories gracie came home from school one day last week with the greatest rigmarole he had told her about people who lived down at the shore    stories there couldnt be a word of truth in you know i told gracie not to believe them and she said paul didnt intend her to but if he didnt what did he tell them to her for  anne says paul is a genius said mrs sloane  he may be you never know what to expect of them americans said mrs andrews mrs andrews only acquaintance with the word genius was derived from the colloquial fashion of calling any eccentric individual a queer genius she probably thought with mary joe that it meant a person with something wrong in his upper story  back in the schoolroom anne was sitting alone at her desk as she had sat on the first day of school two years before her face leaning on her hand her dewy eyes looking wistfully out of the window to the lake of shining waters her heart was so wrung over the parting with her pupils that for a moment college had lost all its charm she still felt the clasp of annetta bells arms about her neck and heard the childish wail ill never love any teacher as much as you miss shirley never never  for two years she had worked earnestly and faithfully making many mistakes and learning from them she had had her reward she had taught her scholars something but she felt that they had taught her much more    lessons of tenderness selfcontrol innocent wisdom lore of childish hearts perhaps she had not succeeded in inspiring any wonderful ambitions in her pupils but she had taught them more by her own sweet personality than by all her careful precepts that it was good and necessary in the years that were before them to live their lives finely and graciously holding fast to truth and courtesy and kindness keeping aloof from all that savored of falsehood and meanness and vulgarity they were perhaps all unconscious of having learned such lessons but they would remember and practice them long after they had forgotten the capital of afghanistan and the dates of the wars of the roses  another chapter in my life is closed said anne aloud as she locked her desk she really felt very sad over it but the romance in the idea of that closed chapter did comfort her a little  anne spent a fortnight at echo lodge early in her vacation and everybody concerned had a good time  she took miss lavendar on a shopping expedition to town and persuaded her to buy a new organdy dress then came the excitement of cutting and making it together while the happy charlotta the fourth basted and swept up clippings miss lavendar had complained that she could not feel much interest in anything but the sparkle came back to her eyes over her pretty dress  what a foolish frivolous person i must be she sighed im wholesomely ashamed to think that a new dress     even it is a forgetmenot organdy    should exhilarate me so when a good conscience and an extra contribution to foreign missions couldnt do it  midway in her visit anne went home to green gables for a day to mend the twins stockings and settle up davys accumulated store of questions in the evening she went down to the shore road to see paul irving as she passed by the low square window of the irving sitting room she caught a glimpse of paul on somebodys lap but the next moment he came flying through the hall  oh miss shirley he cried excitedly you cant think what has happened something so splendid father is here     just think of that father is here come right in father this is my beautiful teacher you know father  stephen irving came forward to meet anne with a smile he was a tall handsome man of middle age with irongray hair deepset dark blue eyes and a strong sad face splendidly modeled about chin and brow just the face for a hero of romance anne thought with a thrill of intense satisfaction it was so disappointing to meet someone who ought to be a hero and find him bald or stooped or otherwise lacking in manly beauty anne would have thought it dreadful if the object of miss lavendars romance had not looked the part  so this is my little sons beautiful teacher of whom i have heard so much said mr irving with a hearty handshake pauls letters have been so full of you miss shirley that i feel as if i were pretty well acquainted with you already i want to thank you for what you have done for paul i think that your influence has been just what he needed mother is one of the best and dearest of women but her robust matteroffact scotch common sense could not always understand a temperament like my laddies what was lacking in her you have supplied between you i think pauls training in these two past years has been as nearly ideal as a motherless boys could be  everybody likes to be appreciated under mr irvings praise annes face burst flower like into rosy bloom and the busy weary man of the world looking at her thought he had never seen a fairer sweeter slip of girlhood than this little down east schoolteacher with her red hair and wonderful eyes  paul sat between them blissfully happy  i never dreamed father was coming he said radiantly even grandma didnt know it it was a great surprise as a general thing    paul shook his brown curls gravely    i dont like to be surprised you lose all the fun of expecting things when youre surprised but in a case like this it is all right father came last night after i had gone to bed and after grandma and mary joe had stopped being surprised he and grandma came upstairs to look at me not meaning to wake me up till morning but i woke right up and saw father i tell you i just sprang at him  with a hug like a bears said mr irving putting his arms around pauls shoulder smilingly i hardly knew my boy he had grown so big and brown and sturdy  i dont know which was the most pleased to see father grandma or i continued paul grandmas been in kitchen all day making the things father likes to eat she wouldnt trust them to mary joe she says thats her way of showing gladness i like best just to sit and talk to father but im going to leave you for a little while now if youll excuse me i must get the cows for mary joe that is one of my daily duties  when paul had scampered away to do his daily duty mr irving talked to anne of various matters but anne felt that he was thinking of something else underneath all the time presently it came to the surface  in pauls last letter he spoke of going with you to visit an old    friend of mine    miss lewis at the stone house in grafton do you know her well  yes indeed she is a very dear friend of mine was annes demure reply which gave no hint of the sudden thrill that tingled over her from head to foot at mr irvings question anne felt instinctively that romance was peeping at her around a corner  mr irving rose and went to the window looking out on a great golden billowing sea where a wild wind was harping for a few moments there was silence in the little darkwalled room then he turned and looked down into annes sympathetic face with a smile halfwhimsical halftender  i wonder how much you know he said  i know all about it replied anne promptly you see she explained hastily miss lavendar and i are very intimate she wouldnt tell things of such a sacred nature to everybody we are kindred spirits  yes i believe you are well i am going to ask a favor of you i would like to go and see miss lavendar if she will let me will you ask her if i may come  would she not oh indeed she would yes this was romance the very the real thing with all the charm of rhyme and story and dream it was a little belated perhaps like a rose blooming in october which should have bloomed in june but none the less a rose all sweetness and fragrance with the gleam of gold in its heart never did annes feet bear her on a more willing errand than on that walk through the beechwoods to grafton the next morning she found miss lavendar in the garden anne was fearfully excited her hands grew cold and her voice trembled  miss lavendar i have something to tell you    something very important can you guess what it is  anne never supposed that miss lavendar could guess but miss lavendars face grew very pale and miss lavendar said in a quiet still voice from which all the color and sparkle that miss lavendars voice usually suggested had faded  stephen irving is home  how did you know who told you cried anne disappointedly vexed that her great revelation had been anticipated  nobody i knew that must be it just from the way you spoke  he wants to come and see you said anne may i send him word that he may  yes of course fluttered miss lavendar there is no reason why he shouldnt he is only coming as any old friend might  anne had her own opinion about that as she hastened into the house to write a note at miss lavendars desk  oh its delightful to be living in a storybook she thought gaily it will come out all right of course    it must    and paul will have a mother after his own heart and everybody will be happy but mr irving will take miss lavendar away    and dear knows what will happen to the little stone house    and so there are two sides to it as there seems to be to everything in this world the important note was written and anne herself carried it to the grafton post office where she waylaid the mail carrier and asked him to leave it at the avonlea office  its so very important anne assured him anxiously the mail carrier was a rather grumpy old personage who did not at all look the part of a messenger of cupid and anne was none too certain that his memory was to be trusted but he said he would do his best to remember and she had to be contented with that  charlotta the fourth felt that some mystery pervaded the stone house that afternoon    a mystery from which she was excluded miss lavendar roamed about the garden in a distracted fashion anne too seemed possessed by a demon of unrest and walked to and fro and went up and down charlotta the fourth endured it till patience ceased to be a virtue then she confronted anne on the occasion of that romantic young persons third aimless peregrination through the kitchen  please miss shirley maam said charlotta the fourth with an indignant toss of her very blue bows its plain to be seen you and miss lavendar have got a secret and i think begging your pardon if im too forward miss shirley maam that its real mean not to tell me when weve all been such chums  oh charlotta dear id have told you all about it if it were my secret    but its miss lavendars you see however ill tell you this much    and if nothing comes of it you must never breathe a word about it to a living soul you see prince charming is coming tonight he came long ago but in a foolish moment went away and wandered afar and forgot the secret of the magic pathway to the enchanted castle where the princess was weeping her faithful heart out for him but at last he remembered it again and the princess is waiting still   because nobody but her own dear prince could carry her off  oh miss shirley maam what is that in prose gasped the mystified charlotta  anne laughed  in prose an old friend of miss lavendars is coming to see her tonight  do you mean an old beau of hers demanded the literal charlotta  that is probably what i do mean    in prose answered anne gravely it is pauls father    stephen irving and goodness knows what will come of it but let us hope for the best charlotta  i hope that hell marry miss lavendar was charlottas unequivocal response some womens intended from the start to be old maids and im afraid im one of them miss shirley maam because ive awful little patience with the men but miss lavendar never was and ive been awful worried thinking what on earth shed do when i got so big id have to go to boston there aint any more girls in our family and dear knows what shed do if she got some stranger that might laugh at her pretendings and leave things lying round out of their place and not be willing to be called charlotta the fifth she might get someone who wouldnt be as unlucky as me in breaking dishes but shed never get anyone whod love her better  and the faithful little handmaiden dashed to the oven door with a sniff  they went through the form of having tea as usual that night at echo lodge but nobody really ate anything after tea miss lavendar went to her room and put on her new forgetmenot organdy while anne did her hair for her both were dreadfully excited but miss lavendar pretended to be very calm and indifferent  i must really mend that rent in the curtain tomorrow she said anxiously inspecting it as if it were the only thing of any importance just then those curtains have not worn as well as they should considering the price i paid dear me charlotta has forgotten to dust the stair railing again i really must speak to her about it  anne was sitting on the porch steps when stephen irving came down the lane and across the garden  this is the one place where time stands still he said looking around him with delighted eyes there is nothing changed about this house or garden since i was here twentyfive years ago it makes me feel young again  you know time always does stand still in an enchanted palace said anne seriously it is only when the prince comes that things begin to happen  mr irving smiled a little sadly into her uplifted face all astar with its youth and promise  sometimes the prince comes too late he said he did not ask anne to translate her remark into prose like all kindred spirits he understood  oh no not if he is the real prince coming to the true princess said anne shaking her red head decidedly as she opened the parlor door when he had gone in she shut it tightly behind him and turned to confront charlotta the fourth who was in the hall all nods and becks and wreathed smiles  oh miss shirley maam she breathed i peeked from the kitchen window    and hes awful handsome    and just the right age for miss lavendar and oh miss shirley maam do you think it would be much harm to listen at the door  it would be dreadful charlotta said anne firmly so just you come away with me out of the reach of temptation  i cant do anything and its awful to hang round just waiting sighed charlotta what if he dont propose after all miss shirley maam you can never be sure of them men my older sister charlotta the first thought she was engaged to one once but it turned out he had a different opinion and she says shell never trust one of them again and i heard of another case where a man thought he wanted one girl awful bad when it was really her sister he wanted all the time when a man dont know his own mind miss shirley maam hows a poor woman going to be sure of it  well go to the kitchen and clean the silver spoons said anne thats a task which wont require much thinking fortunately     for i couldnt think tonight and it will pass the time  it passed an hour then just as anne laid down the last shining spoon they heard the front door shut both sought comfort fearfully in each others eyes  oh miss shirley maam gasped charlotta if hes going away this early theres nothing into it and never will be they flew to the window mr irving had no intention of going away he and miss lavendar were strolling slowly down the middle path to the stone bench  oh miss shirley maam hes got his arm around her waist whispered charlotta the fourth delightedly he must have proposed to her or shed never allow it  anne caught charlotta the fourth by her own plump waist and danced her around the kitchen until they were both out of breath  oh charlotta she cried gaily im neither a prophetess nor the daughter of a prophetess but im going to make a prediction therell be a wedding in this old stone house before the maple leaves are red do you want that translated into prose charlotta  no i can understand that said charlotta a wedding aint poetry why miss shirley maam youre crying what for  oh because its all so beautiful    and story bookish    and romantic    and sad said anne winking the tears out of her eyes its all perfectly lovely    but theres a little sadness mixed up in it too somehow  oh of course theres a resk in marrying anybody conceded charlotta the fourth but when alls said and done miss shirley maam theres many a worse thing than a husband     xxix  poetry and prose   for the next month anne lived in what for avonlea might be called a whirl of excitement the preparation of her own modest outfit for redmond was of secondary importance miss lavendar was getting ready to be married and the stone house was the scene of endless consultations and plannings and discussions with charlotta the fourth hovering on the outskirts of things in agitated delight and wonder then the dressmaker came and there was the rapture and wretchedness of choosing fashions and being fitted anne and diana spent half their time at echo lodge and there were nights when anne could not sleep for wondering whether she had done right in advising miss lavendar to select brown rather than navy blue for her traveling dress and to have her gray silk made princess  everybody concerned in miss lavendars story was very happy paul irving rushed to green gables to talk the news over with anne as soon as his father had told him  i knew i could trust father to pick me out a nice little second mother he said proudly its a fine thing to have a father you can depend on teacher i just love miss lavendar grandma is pleased too she says shes real glad father didnt pick out an american for his second wife because although it turned out all right the first time such a thing wouldnt be likely to happen twice mrs lynde says she thoroughly approves of the match and thinks its likely miss lavendar will give up her queer notions and be like other people now that shes going to be married but i hope she wont give her queer notions up teacher because i like them and i dont want her to be like other people there are too many other people around as it is you know teacher  charlotta the fourth was another radiant person  oh miss shirley maam it has all turned out so beautiful when mr irving and miss lavendar come back from their tower im to go up to boston and live with them    and me only fifteen and the other girls never went till they were sixteen aint mr irving splendid he just worships the ground she treads on and it makes me feel so queer sometimes to see the look in his eyes when hes watching her it beggars description miss shirley maam im awful thankful theyre so fond of each other its the best way when alls said and done though some folks can get along without it ive got an aunt who has been married three times and says she married the first time for love and the last two times for strictly business and was happy with all three except at the times of the funerals but i think she took a resk miss shirley maam  oh its all so romantic breathed anne to marilla that night if i hadnt taken the wrong path that day we went to mr kimballs id never have known miss lavendar and if i hadnt met her id never have taken paul there    and hed never have written to his father about visiting miss lavendar just as mr irving was starting for san francisco mr irving says whenever he got that letter he made up his mind to send his partner to san francisco and come here instead he hadnt heard anything of miss lavendar for fifteen years somebody had told him then that she was to be married and he thought she was and never asked anybody anything about her and now everything has come right and i had a hand in bringing it about perhaps as mrs lynde says everything is foreordained and it was bound to happen anyway but even so its nice to think one was an instrument used by predestination yes indeed its very romantic  i cant see that its so terribly romantic at all said marilla rather crisply marilla thought anne was too worked up about it and had plenty to do with getting ready for college without traipsing to echo lodge two days out of three helping miss lavendar in the first place two young fools quarrel and turn sulky then steve irving goes to the states and after a spell gets married up there and is perfectly happy from all accounts then his wife dies and after a decent interval he thinks hell come home and see if his first fancyll have him meanwhile shes been living single probably because nobody nice enough came along to want her and they meet and agree to be married after all now where is the romance in all that  oh there isnt any when you put it that way gasped anne rather as if somebody had thrown cold water over her i suppose thats how it looks in prose but its very different if you look at it through poetry    and i think its nicer    anne recovered herself and her eyes shone and her cheeks flushed    to look at it through poetry  marilla glanced at the radiant young face and refrained from further sarcastic comments perhaps some realization came to her that after all it was better to have like anne the vision and the faculty divine    that gift which the world cannot bestow or take away of looking at life through some transfiguring    or revealing    medium whereby everything seemed apparelled in celestial light wearing a glory and a freshness not visible to those who like herself and charlotta the fourth looked at things only through prose  whens the wedding to be she asked after a pause  the last wednesday in august they are to be married in the garden under the honeysuckle trellis    the very spot where mr irving proposed to her twentyfive years ago marilla that is romantic even in prose theres to be nobody there except mrs irving and paul and gilbert and diana and i and miss lavendars cousins and they will leave on the six oclock train for a trip to the pacific coast when they come back in the fall paul and charlotta the fourth are to go up to boston to live with them but echo lodge is to be left just as it is   only of course theyll sell the hens and cow and board up the windows    and every summer theyre coming down to live in it im so glad it would have hurt me dreadfully next winter at redmond to think of that dear stone house all stripped and deserted with empty rooms    or far worse still with other people living in it but i can think of it now just as ive always seen it waiting happily for the summer to bring life and laughter back to it again  there was more romance in the world than that which had fallen to the share of the middleaged lovers of the stone house anne stumbled suddenly on it one evening when she went over to orchard slope by the wood cut and came out into the barry garden diana barry and fred wright were standing together under the big willow diana was leaning against the gray trunk her lashes cast down on very crimson cheeks one hand was held by fred who stood with his face bent toward her stammering something in low earnest tones there were no other people in the world except their two selves at that magic moment so neither of them saw anne who after one dazed glance of comprehension turned and sped noiselessly back through the spruce wood never stopping till she gained her own gable room where she sat breathlessly down by her window and tried to collect her scattered wits  diana and fred are in love with each other she gasped oh it does seem so    so    so hopelessly grown up  anne of late had not been without her suspicions that diana was proving false to the melancholy byronic hero of her early dreams but as things seen are mightier than things heard or suspected the realization that it was actually so came to her with almost the shock of perfect surprise this was succeeded by a queer little lonely feeling    as if somehow diana had gone forward into a new world shutting a gate behind her leaving anne on the outside  things are changing so fast it almost frightens me anne thought a little sadly and im afraid that this cant help making some difference between diana and me im sure i cant tell her all my secrets after this    she might tell fred and what can she see in fred hes very nice and jolly    but hes just fred wright  it is always a very puzzling question    what can somebody see in somebody else but how fortunate after all that it is so for if everybody saw alike    well in that case as the old indian said everybody would want my squaw it was plain that diana did see something in fred wright however annes eyes might be holden diana came to green gables the next evening a pensive shy young lady and told anne the whole story in the dusky seclusion of the east gable both girls cried and kissed and laughed  im so happy said diana but it does seem ridiculous to think of me being engaged  what is it really like to be engaged asked anne curiously  well that all depends on who youre engaged to answered diana with that maddening air of superior wisdom always assumed by those who are engaged over those who are not its perfectly lovely to be engaged to fred    but i think it would be simply horrid to be engaged to anyone else  theres not much comfort for the rest of us in that seeing that there is only one fred laughed anne  oh anne you dont understand said diana in vexation i didnt mean that    its so hard to explain never mind youll understand sometime when your own turn comes  bless you dearest of dianas i understand now what is an imagination for if not to enable you to peep at life through other peoples eyes  you must be my bridesmaid you know anne promise me that    wherever you may be when im married  ill come from the ends of the earth if necessary promised anne solemnly  of course it wont be for ever so long yet said diana blushing three years at the very least    for im only eighteen and mother says no daughter of hers shall be married before shes twentyone besides freds father is going to buy the abraham fletcher farm for him and he says hes got to have it two thirds paid for before hell give it to him in his own name but three years isnt any too much time to get ready for housekeeping for i havent a speck of fancy work made yet but im going to begin crocheting doilies tomorrow myra gillis had thirtyseven doilies when she was married and im determined i shall have as many as she had  i suppose it would be perfectly impossible to keep house with only thirtysix doilies conceded anne with a solemn face but dancing eyes  diana looked hurt  i didnt think youd make fun of me anne she said reproachfully  dearest i wasnt making fun of you cried anne repentantly i was only teasing you a bit i think youll make the sweetest little housekeeper in the world and i think its perfectly lovely of you to be planning already for your home odreams  anne had no sooner uttered the phrase home odreams than it captivated her fancy and she immediately began the erection of one of her own it was of course tenanted by an ideal master dark proud and melancholy but oddly enough gilbert blythe persisted in hanging about too helping her arrange pictures lay out gardens and accomplish sundry other tasks which a proud and melancholy hero evidently considered beneath his dignity anne tried to banish gilberts image from her castle in spain but somehow he went on being there so anne being in a hurry gave up the attempt and pursued her aerial architecture with such success that her home odreams was built and furnished before diana spoke again  i suppose anne you must think its funny i should like fred so well when hes so different from the kind of man ive always said i would marry    the tall slender kind but somehow i wouldnt want fred to be tall and slender    because dont you see he wouldnt be fred then of course added diana rather dolefully we will be a dreadfully pudgy couple but after all thats better than one of us being short and fat and the other tall and lean like morgan sloane and his wife mrs lynde says it always makes her think of the long and short of it when she sees them together  well said anne to herself that night as she brushed her hair before her gilt framed mirror i am glad diana is so happy and satisfied but when my turn comes    if it ever does    i do hope therell be something a little more thrilling about it but then diana thought so too once ive heard her say time and again shed never get engaged any poky commonplace way    hed have to do something splendid to win her but she has changed perhaps ill change too but i wont    and im determined i wont oh i think these engagements are dreadfully unsettling things when they happen to your intimate friends     xxx  a wedding at the stone house  the last week in august came miss lavendar was to be married in it two weeks later anne and gilbert would leave for redmond college in a weeks time mrs rachel lynde would move to green gables and set up her lares and penates in the erstwhile spare room which was already prepared for her coming she had sold all her superfluous household plenishings by auction and was at present reveling in the congenial occupation of helping the allans pack up mr allan was to preach his farewell sermon the next sunday the old order was changing rapidly to give place to the new as anne felt with a little sadness threading all her excitement and happiness  changes aint totally pleasant but theyre excellent things said mr harrison philosophically two years is about long enough for things to stay exactly the same if they stayed put any longer they might grow mossy  mr harrison was smoking on his veranda his wife had selfsacrificingly told that he might smoke in the house if he took care to sit by an open window mr harrison rewarded this concession by going outdoors altogether to smoke in fine weather and so mutual goodwill reigned  anne had come over to ask mrs harrison for some of her yellow dahlias she and diana were going through to echo lodge that evening to help miss lavendar and charlotta the fourth with their final preparations for the morrows bridal miss lavendar herself never had dahlias she did not like them and they would not have suited the fine retirement of her oldfashioned garden but flowers of any kind were rather scarce in avonlea and the neighboring districts that summer thanks to uncle abes storm and anne and diana thought that a certain old creamcolored stone jug usually kept sacred to doughnuts brimmed over with yellow dahlias would be just the thing to set in a dim angle of the stone house stairs against the dark background of red hall paper  i spose youll be starting off for college in a fortnights time continued mr harrison well were going to miss you an awful lot emily and me to be sure mrs lyndell be over there in your place there aint nobody but a substitute can be found for them  the irony of mr harrisons tone is quite untransferable to paper in spite of his wifes intimacy with mrs lynde the best that could be said of the relationship between her and mr harrison even under the new regime was that they preserved an armed neutrality  yes im going said anne im very glad with my head    and very sorry with my heart  i spose youll be scooping up all the honors that are lying round loose at redmond  i may try for one or two of them confessed anne but i dont care so much for things like that as i did two years ago what i want to get out of my college course is some knowledge of the best way of living life and doing the most and best with it i want to learn to understand and help other people and myself  mr harrison nodded  thats the idea exactly thats what college ought to be for instead of for turning out a lot of bas so chock full of booklearning and vanity that there aint room for anything else youre all right college wont be able to do you much harm i reckon  diana and anne drove over to echo lodge after tea taking with them all the flowery spoil that several predatory expeditions in their own and their neighbors gardens had yielded they found the stone house agog with excitement charlotta the fourth was flying around with such vim and briskness that her blue bows seemed really to possess the power of being everywhere at once like the helmet of navarre charlottas blue bows waved ever in the thickest of the fray  praise be to goodness youve come she said devoutly for theres heaps of things to do    and the frosting on that cake wont harden    and theres all the silver to be rubbed up yet     and the horsehair trunk to be packed    and the roosters for the chicken salad are running out there beyant the henhouse yet crowing miss shirley maam and miss lavendar aint to be trusted to do a thing i was thankful when mr irving came a few minutes ago and took her off for a walk in the woods courtings all right in its place miss shirley maam but if you try to mix it up with cooking and scouring everythings spoiled thats my opinion miss shirley maam  anne and diana worked so heartily that by ten oclock even charlotta the fourth was satisfied she braided her hair in innumerable plaits and took her weary little bones off to bed  but im sure i shant sleep a blessed wink miss shirley maam for fear that somethingll go wrong at the last minute    the cream wont whip    or mr irvingll have a stroke and not be able to come  he isnt in the habit of having strokes is he asked diana the dimpled corners of her mouth twitching to diana charlotta the fourth was if not exactly a thing of beauty certainly a joy forever  theyre not things that go by habit said charlotta the fourth with dignity they just happen    and there you are anybody can have a stroke you dont have to learn how mr irving looks a lot like an uncle of mine that had one once just as he was sitting down to dinner one day but maybe everythingll go all right in this world youve just got to hope for the best and prepare for the worst and take whatever god sends  the only thing im worried about is that it wont be fine tomorrow said diana uncle abe predicted rain for the middle of the week and ever since the big storm i cant help believing theres a good deal in what uncle abe says  anne who knew better than diana just how much uncle abe had to do with the storm was not much disturbed by this she slept the sleep of the just and weary and was roused at an unearthly hour by charlotta the fourth  oh miss shirley maam its awful to call you so early came wailing through the keyhole but theres so much to do yet    and oh miss shirley maam im skeered its going to rain and i wish youd get up and tell me you think it aint anne flew to the window hoping against hope that charlotta the fourth was saying this merely by way of rousing her effectually but alas the morning did look unpropitious below the window miss lavendars garden which should have been a glory of pale virgin sunshine lay dim and windless and the sky over the firs was dark with moody clouds  isnt it too mean said diana  we must hope for the best said anne determinedly if it only doesnt actually rain a cool pearly gray day like this would really be nicer than hot sunshine  but it will rain mourned charlotta creeping into the room a figure of fun with her many braids wound about her head the ends tied up with white thread sticking out in all directions itll hold off till the last minute and then pour cats and dogs and all the folks will get sopping    and track mud all over the house    and they wont be able to be married under the honeysuckle    and its awful unlucky for no sun to shine on a bride say what you will miss shirley maam i knew things were going too well to last  charlotta the fourth seemed certainly to have borrowed a leaf out of miss eliza andrews book  it did not rain though it kept on looking as if it meant to by noon the rooms were decorated the table beautifully laid and upstairs was waiting a bride adorned for her husband  you do look sweet said anne rapturously  lovely echoed diana  everythings ready miss shirley maam and nothing dreadful has happened yet was charlottas cheerful statement as she betook herself to her little back room to dress out came all the braids the resultant rampant crinkliness was plaited into two tails and tied not with two bows alone but with four of brandnew ribbon brightly blue the two upper bows rather gave the impression of overgrown wings sprouting from charlottas neck somewhat after the fashion of raphaels cherubs but charlotta the fourth thought them very beautiful and after she had rustled into a white dress so stiffly starched that it could stand alone she surveyed herself in her glass with great satisfaction    a satisfaction which lasted until she went out in the hall and caught a glimpse through the spare room door of a tall girl in some softly clinging gown pinning white starlike flowers on the smooth ripples of her ruddy hair  oh ill never be able to look like miss shirley thought poor charlotta despairingly you just have to be born so i guess     dont seems if any amount of practice could give you that air  by one oclock the guests had come including mr and mrs allan for mr allan was to perform the ceremony in the absence of the grafton minister on his vacation there was no formality about the marriage miss lavendar came down the stairs to meet her bridegroom at the foot and as he took her hand she lifted her big brown eyes to his with a look that made charlotta the fourth who intercepted it feel queerer than ever they went out to the honeysuckle arbor where mr allan was awaiting them the guests grouped themselves as they pleased anne and diana stood by the old stone bench with charlotta the fourth between them desperately clutching their hands in her cold tremulous little paws  mr allan opened his blue book and the ceremony proceeded just as miss lavendar and stephen irving were pronounced man and wife a very beautiful and symbolic thing happened the sun suddenly burst through the gray and poured a flood of radiance on the happy bride instantly the garden was alive with dancing shadows and flickering lights  what a lovely omen thought anne as she ran to kiss the bride then the three girls left the rest of the guests laughing around the bridal pair while they flew into the house to see that all was in readiness for the feast  thanks be to goodness its over miss shirley maam breathed charlotta the fourth and theyre married safe and sound no matter what happens now the bags of rice are in the pantry maam and the old shoes are behind the door and the cream for whipping is on the sullar steps  at half past two mr and mrs irving left and everybody went to bright river to see them off on the afternoon train as miss lavendar    i beg her pardon mrs irving    stepped from the door of her old home gilbert and the girls threw the rice and charlotta the fourth hurled an old shoe with such excellent aim that she struck mr allan squarely on the head but it was reserved for paul to give the prettiest sendoff he popped out of the porch ringing furiously a huge old brass dinner bell which had adorned the dining room mantel pauls only motive was to make a joyful noise but as the clangor died away from point and curve and hill across the river came the chime of fairy wedding bells ringing clearly sweetly faintly and more faint as if miss lavendars beloved echoes were bidding her greeting and farewell and so amid this benediction of sweet sounds miss lavendar drove away from the old life of dreams and makebelieves to a fuller life of realities in the busy world beyond  two hours later anne and charlotta the fourth came down the lane again gilbert had gone to west grafton on an errand and diana had to keep an engagement at home anne and charlotta had come back to put things in order and lock up the little stone house the garden was a pool of late golden sunshine with butterflies hovering and bees booming but the little house had already that indefinable air of desolation which always follows a festivity  oh dear me dont it look lonesome sniffed charlotta the fourth who had been crying all the way home from the station a wedding aint much cheerfuller than a funeral after all when its all over miss shirley maam  a busy evening followed the decorations had to be removed the dishes washed the uneaten delicacies packed into a basket for the delectation of charlotta the fourths young brothers at home anne would not rest until everything was in applepie order after charlotta had gone home with her plunder anne went over the still rooms feeling like one who trod alone some banquet hall deserted and closed the blinds then she locked the door and sat down under the silver poplar to wait for gilbert feeling very tired but still unweariedly thinking long long thoughts  what are you thinking of anne asked gilbert coming down the walk he had left his horse and buggy out at the road  of miss lavendar and mr irving answered anne dreamily isnt it beautiful to think how everything has turned out    how they have come together again after all the years of separation and misunderstanding  yes its beautiful said gilbert looking steadily down into annes uplifted face but wouldnt it have been more beautiful still anne if there had been no separation or misunderstanding     if they had come hand in hand all the way through life with no memories behind them but those which belonged to each other  for a moment annes heart fluttered queerly and for the first time her eyes faltered under gilberts gaze and a rosy flush stained the paleness of her face it was as if a veil that had hung before her inner consciousness had been lifted giving to her view a revelation of unsuspected feelings and realities perhaps after all romance did not come into ones life with pomp and blare like a gay knight riding down perhaps it crept to ones side like an old friend through quiet ways perhaps it revealed itself in seeming prose until some sudden shaft of illumination flung athwart its pages betrayed the rhythm and the music perhaps     perhaps    love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful friendship as a goldenhearted rose slipping from its green sheath  then the veil dropped again but the anne who walked up the dark lane was not quite the same anne who had driven gaily down it the evening before the page of girlhood had been turned as by an unseen finger and the page of womanhood was before her with all its charm and mystery its pain and gladness  gilbert wisely said nothing more but in his silence he read the history of the next four years in the light of annes remembered blush four years of earnest happy work    and then the guerdon of a useful knowledge gained and a sweet heart won  behind them in the garden the little stone house brooded among the shadows it was lonely but not forsaken it had not yet done with dreams and laughter and the joy of life there were to be future summers for the little stone house meanwhile it could wait and over the river in purple durance the echoes bided their time
